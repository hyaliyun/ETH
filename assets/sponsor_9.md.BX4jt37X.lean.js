The squadron was formed in September 1943 and was disbanded in July 1946 after seeing action in the South West Pacific Theatre of the war. History No. 80 Squadron was formed at Townsville, Queensland, on 10 September 1943 and was equipped with P-40 Kittyhawk fighter aircraft, under the command of the then temporary Squadron Leader Glen Cooper. It moved to Aitkenvale on 9 October and commenced flight training.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 76 On 13 November it became part of RAAF's main mobile unit, No. 10 Operational Group, upon its formation. This group's main role was to support the rapid advance of Allied units along the north coast of New Guinea.Odgers (1968), pp. 182‚Äì183 Once its training was completed the squadron moved again to Nadzab in New Guinea on 24 February 1944. \\"Coopers Flying Circus\\": Squadron Leader Cooper (middle) with members of No. 80 Squadron in New Guinea, July 1944 The squadron flew its first combat sorties two days after arriving in New Guinea. Its initial operations included patrols around Nadzab, escorting Allied bombers and ground attack missions against Japanese forces in and around Alexishafen and Madang. The squadron moved to Cape Gloucester, New Britain on 21 March to escort convoys and conduct armed reconnaissance patrols. It moved again on 29 April to Tadji on the New Guinea mainland where it flew patrols to protect the Allied landing at Hollandia. The squadron moved to Hollandia after it was secured, arriving there on 15 May. No. 80 Squadron continued to support Allied amphibious operations between May and July 1944. In May it covered the invasions Wakde and Biak from its base at Hollandia. This included attacking targets near the beachhead at Wakde while US troops landed.Eather (1995), p. 94 The squadron moved twice in July, arriving at Biak on 1 July and Noemfoor on 22 July.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 76‚Äì77 From its base at Noemfoor, No. 80 Squadron conducted ground attack operations over western New Guinea and the eastern islands of the Netherlands East Indies. These operations included attacks on Japanese watercraft and sawmills around Kokas Island and sweeps over the Maluku Islands in October.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 77 No. 10 Group, of which No. 80 Squadron was still part, was redesignated the First Tactical Air Force on 25 October 1944.Odgers (1968), pp. 298‚Äì299 On 15 January 1945, four of No. 80 Squadron's pilots were ferrying Kittyhawks from Noemfoor to Morotai when they missed their destination and had to land on the Japanese-held Talaud Islands, where they were captured and executed.Odgers (1999) p. 217 The unit completed its move to Morotai on 21 January, where it continued to operate over the Maluku Islands. The shortage of worthwhile targets in this area caused morale to decline in No. 80 Squadron and other RAAF units in the area from the end of 1944. No. 80 Squadron was taken off operational status on 11 April 1945 to prepare for the Borneo Campaign. Later that month its commander, Squadron Leader John Waddy, participated in the so-called \\"Morotai Mutiny\\" as a protest against what he and seven other senior pilots saw as the misuse of the First Tactical Air Force in unimportant operations.Odgers (1968), p. 444 While No. 80 Squadron's ground crew landed at Tarakan in early May, delays with repairing the island's airfield meant that the squadron's aircraft were unable to move forward until 22 July. The limited flying opportunities for the squadron's pilots in this period further reduced their morale. Once established at Tarakan, No. 80 Squadron flew close air support operations during the Battle of Balikpapan, but found few worthwhile targets.Odgers (1968), p. 488 Following the Japanese surrender No. 80 Squadron flew reconnaissance patrols over Japanese-occupied areas. The amount of flying was limited from September, however. In late 1945 the squadron's personnel embarked aboard the British aircraft carrier which carried them to Sydney via Manus Island. Glory arrived at Sydney on 12 December 1945 and the members of the squadron from New South Wales proceeded to Deniliquin and the remainder were sent on leave. No. 80 Squadron's strength was rapidly decreased, and it comprised only six men by 31 December. The last personnel left the unit on 9 May 1946 and it was disbanded on 11 July that year.

History  The original library of the Mellon Institute on the building's first floor Interior of Allen Hall Detail of main entrance door The building that would become known as Allen Hall was erected as the original home for the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research. The institute was founded for industrial and chemical research by brothers, and University of Pittsburgh alumni, Richard B. Mellon and Andrew W. Mellon. The institute originally grew out of university's Department of Industrial Research and served as a graduate school managed by the University of Pittsburgh until it was incorporated as an independent non- profit research institute in 1927. The six story building designed by J. H. Giesey in the Greek Revival style of the university's other buildings that at the time were being constructed in accordance with Henry Hornbostel's acropolis master plan for the university campus.

The institute soon outgrew this facility and engaged in the construction of a new facility on the corner of Bellefield and Fifth Avenue across from the grounds of the university's Cathedral of Learning. After completion of the new facility in 1937, the old Mellon Institute building was handed over to the university on May 9, 1939. It was remodeled and equipped to provide laboratories and additional classrooms for the School of Medicine, doubling that school's facilities that were then located in Pennsylvania Hall. The School of Medicine's library, administrative offices, several faculty offices, histology and embryology labs, as well as its departments of physiologic chemistry, physiology and pharmacy all moved into the building, freeing Pennsylvania Hall of all but the medical school's first year courses in anatomy and pathology. The School of Medicine began moving into its present facility, Scaife Hall, in the fall of 1955. Today Allen Hall is home to offices, classrooms, and labs of the Department of Physics and Astronomy.Alberts, Robert C.; Pitt: the story of the University of Pittsburgh; pg.132, 1986, University of Pittsburgh Press, , accessdate=2008-08-24 The building was renamed Allen Hall in honor of a former University of Pittsburgh Physics professor, Alexander J. Allen, who arrived at Pitt in the 1930s and led a project for the construction of a cyclotron for producing radioactive isotopes for medical applications and atomic research. This facility, called the Sarah Mellon Scaife Radiation Laboratory, was completed in 1946.History of the Nuclear Physics Laboratory, Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Pittsburgh, accessdate=2008-08-27 During World War II, Allen also participated in the development of radar systems.  Structure  Allen Hall comprises six stories (a ground floor and 1st‚Äì5th floors) using granite for the lower two stories and buff brick for the next three stories; the 5th floor is windowless and concealed by the roof. Due to the building's age and landmark status, and despite internal renovations, all floors, with the exception of the 1st (following the most recent renovation) and 3rd (due to the flying tunnel connection to NPL), have only one bathroom; the bathrooms alternate male-female, with the fifth floor's being coed. This is due to a space-saving decision by the original designers that women's bathrooms were unnecessary in a science building. The building is linked on the first three floors to neighboring Old Engineering Hall, and on the 1st and 3rd to the Van de Graaff Building housing the Nuclear Physics Laboratory located at the rear. Close-up of the plaque as of November 2015. The facade at the entrance of this building has a plaque to honor Madame Curie, commemorating the 100th anniversary in 1967 of her birth, the conferring of an honorary degree in 1921, her visit to the plants of the Standard Chemical Company, its role as a major radium producer and in the making of the gram of radium presented to Marie Curie by President Warren G. Harding, and the role of Glenn Donald Kammer, a University of Pittsburgh graduate who supervised its production. The plaque was unveiled on September 20, 1969, by the Archbishop of Krak√≥w, Poland, Cardinal Wojty≈Ça, who in 1978 became Pope John Paul II.

To allow for major internal reconstruction, Allen hall was temporarily vacated for the 2012‚Äì2013 academic year, with residents relocated to Thaw, Old Engineering, and Thackeray Halls. The renovations were completed on schedule and Allen was reoccupied at the beginning of the 2013‚Äì2014 academic year. The most unusual result of the renovations was the installation of a double rail over the original railing in the main staircase, due to it being below regulation height.

It runs from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta to refineries in Illinois and Texas, and also to oil tank farms and an oil pipeline distribution center in Cushing, Oklahoma. The pipeline became well known when a planned fourth phase, Keystone XL, attracted opposition from environmentalists, becoming a symbol of the battle over climate change and fossil fuels. In 2015 Keystone XL was temporarily delayed by then-President Barack Obama. On January 24, 2017, President Donald Trump took action intended to permit the pipeline's completion. In 2013, the first two phases had the capacity to deliver up to of oil into the Midwest refineries. Phase III has capacity to deliver up to to the Texas refineries. By comparison, production of petroleum in the United States averaged in first-half 2015, with gross exports of through July 2015. The proposed Keystone XL (sometimes abbreviated KXL, with XL standing for \\"export limited\\") Pipeline (Phase IV) would connect the Phase I-pipeline terminals in Hardisty, Alberta, and Steele City, Nebraska, by a shorter route and a larger-diameter pipe. It would run through Baker, Montana, where American-produced light crude oil from the Williston Basin (Bakken formation) of Montana and North Dakota would be added to the Keystone's throughput of synthetic crude oil (syncrude) and diluted bitumen (dilbit) from the oil sands of Canada.

ES1). Phase III was opened on January 22, 2014, completing the pipeline path from Hardisty, Alberta to Nederland, Texas. The Keystone XL Pipeline Project (Phase IV) revised proposal in 2012 consists of a new pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, through Montana and South Dakota to Steele City, Nebraska, to \\"transport of up to of crude oil from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta, Canada, and from the Williston Basin (Bakken) region in Montana and North Dakota, primarily to refineries in the Gulf Coast area.\\" The Keystone XL pipeline segments were intended to allow American crude oil to enter the XL pipelines at Baker, Montana, on their way to the storage and distribution facilities at Cushing, Oklahoma. Cushing is a major crude oil marketing/refining and pipeline hub. Operating since 2010, the original Keystone Pipeline System is a pipeline delivering Canadian crude oil to U.S. Midwest markets and Cushing, Oklahoma. In Canada, the first phase of Keystone involved the conversion of approximately of existing natural gas pipeline in Saskatchewan and Manitoba to crude oil pipeline service. It also included approximately of new diameter pipeline, 16 pump stations and the Keystone Hardisty Terminal. The U.S. portion of the Keystone Pipeline included of new, diameter pipeline in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois. The pipeline has a minimum ground cover of . It also involved construction of 23 pump stations and delivery facilities at Wood River and Patoka, Illinois. In 2011, the second phase of Keystone included a extension from Steele City, Nebraska, to Cushing, Oklahoma, and 11 new pump stations to increase the capacity of the pipeline from . Additional phases (III, completed in 2014, and IV, rejected in 2015) have been in construction or discussion since 2011. If completed, the Keystone XL would have added increasing the total capacity up to . The original Keystone Pipeline cost US$5.2 billion with the Keystone XL expansion slated to cost approximately US$7 billion. The Keystone XL had been expected to be completed by 2012‚Äì2013, however construction was ultimately overtaken by events. From January 2018 through December 31, 2019, Keystone XL development costs were $1.5 billion. Background The project was first proposed in 2005 by the Calgary, Alberta- based TransCanada Corporation, and was approved by Canada's National Energy Board in 2007.  Timeline  * February 9, 2005 TransCanada Corporation proposed the project. * October 2007 The Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada asked the Canadian federal government to block regulatory approvals for the pipeline, with union president Dave Coles stating \\"the Keystone pipeline will exclusively serve US markets, create a permanent employment for very few Canadians, reduce our energy security, and hinder investment and job creation in the Canadian energy sector.\\" * September 21, 2007 The National Energy Board of Canada approved the construction of the Canadian section of the pipeline, including converting a portion of TransCanada's Canadian Mainline gas pipeline to crude oil pipeline, on September 21, 2007. * March 17, 2008 During the final year of the Presidency of George W. Bush, the United States Department of State issued a Presidential Permit authorizing the construction, maintenance and operation of facilities at the United States and Canada border. * January 22, 2008 ConocoPhillips acquired a 50% stake in the project. * June 17, 2008 TransCanada agreed that they would buy out ConocoPhillips' share in the project and revert to being the sole owner. It took TransCanada more than two years to acquire all the necessary state and federal permits for the pipeline. Construction took another two years. The pipeline, from Hardisty, Alberta, Canada, to Patoka, Illinois, United States, became operational in June 2010. * June 2008 The Keystone XL extension was proposed in June 2008, * September 2008 TransCanada (now TC Energy) filed an application with the National Energy Board of Canada (NEB). * June 17, 2009 TransCanada began the process of becoming the sole owner of the pipeline. * September 2009 The NEB‚Äîreplaced in 2019 by the Canadian Energy Regulator (CER)‚Äîstarted hearings. * February 2010 South Dakota Public Utilities Commission granted a permit to proceed. and in March 2010, the National Energy Board approved the project. * June 2010 Keystone Pipeline (Phase I) was completed and was delivering oil from Hardisty, Alberta, over to the junction at Steele City, Nebraska, and on to Wood River Refinery in Roxana, Illinois, and Patoka Oil Terminal Hub north of Patoka, Illinois. * July 21, 2010 The Environmental Protection Agency criticized the State Department's draft environmental impact study for neglecting concerns about oil spill response plans, safety issues and greenhouse gas. * February 2011 The Keystone-Cushing extension (Phase II) was completed running from Steele City to a tank farm in Cushing, Oklahoma. * August 26, 2011 The final environmental impact report was released on stating that the pipeline would pose \\"no significant impacts\\" to most resources if environmental protection measures are followed, but it would present \\"significant adverse effects to certain cultural resources\\". * June 3, 2011 Public Hazardous Materials and Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued TransCanada a Corrective Action Order (CAO), for Keystone's May 2011 leaks. Primary source On April 2, 2016, PHMSA issued a CAO to TransCanada for a 16,800 gallon leak in Hutchinson County, South Dakota, Primary sourceand again on April 9. Primary source The pipeline restarted at a reduced operating pressure on April 10 after the U.S. regulator approved the companies corrective actions and plan.De Souza, Mike. (April 10, 2016). \\"TransCanada restarts Keystone pipeline after repairing leak\\". National Observer website Retrieved November 18, 2017. A 9,700 barrel (407,400 gallons) leak occurred in Marshall County, South Dakota in November 2017. This leak occurred early in the morning on November 16, 2017 near Amherst, South Dakota and was contained shortly after detection 35 miles south of the Ludden pump station. * September 2011 Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute released the results of the GLI Keystone XL Report, which evaluated the pipeline's impact on employment, the environment, energy independence, the economy, and other critical areas. * November 10, 2011 The Department of State postponed a final decision while investigating \\"potential alternative routes around the Sandhills in Nebraska\\" in response to concerns that the project was not in the United States' national interest. In its response, TransCanada pointed out fourteen different routes for Keystone XL were being studied, eight that impacted Nebraska. They included one potential alternative route in Nebraska that would have avoided the entire Sandhills region and Ogallala Aquifer and six alternatives that would have reduced pipeline mileage crossing the Sandhills or the aquifer. * March 2012 Obama endorsed the building of the southern segment (Gulf Coast Extension or Phase III) that begins in Cushing, Oklahoma. The President said in Cushing, Oklahoma, on March 22, \\"Today, I'm directing my administration to cut through the red tape, break through the bureaucratic hurdles, and make this project a priority, to go ahead and get it done.\\" * January 22, 2014 The Gulf Coast Extension (Phase III) was completed running from Cushing to refineries at Port Arthur, Texas. * January 2014 The US Department of State's (DoS) January 2014 \\"Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement\\" (SEIS) said that, \\"[B]ecause of broader market dynamics and options for crude oil transport in the North American logistics system, the upstream and downstream activities are unlikely to be substantially different whether or not the proposed Project is constructed.\\" * January 9, 2015 The Nebraska Supreme Court cleared the way for construction, after Republican Governor Dave Heineman had approved of it in 2013. * January 29, 2015 A senate bill passed (62‚Äì36), which approved the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, The House voted to approve it (270‚Äì152) on February 11, 2015. * February 24, 2015 President Obama vetoed the bill, saying that the decision of approval should rest with the Executive Branch. The Senate was unable to override the veto by a two-thirds majority, with a 62‚Äì37 vote.Keystone veto override fails. March 4, 2015. * September 29, 2015 TransCanada dropped their lawsuit against Nebraska landowners who had refused permission allowing for pipeline easements on their properties, in order to exercise eminent domain over such use. * November 3, 2015 Secretary of State John Kerry issued a determination that the project was not in the public interest. Kerry found that there was a \\"perception\\" among foreigners that the project would increase greenhouse-gas emissions, and that, whether or not this perception was accurate, the decision would therefore \\"undercut the credibility and influence of the United States\\" in climate-change-related negotiations. On November 6, 2015, the Obama government rejected the pipeline. * November 6, 2015 The Obama administration rejected the project of Keystone XL, \\"over environmental concerns\\". Financial commitment towards completion of the pipeline was weakened by a number of technological factors as well. Innovations in fracking had increased domestic production of oil and, according to the EIA, reduced annual demand of oil from foreign countries to an all-time low since 1985. Shifts to gasoline fuel for cargo vehicles, new technologies promoting fuel efficiency, and export restrictions that forced the price of oil to decrease also played a part. * Mid-2016 A lateral pipeline to refineries at Houston, Texas and a terminal was completed, and was online in 2017. * November 23, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump's aides considered ways of rescinding President Obama's orders to reject the pipeline. * January 24, 2017 In his first week in office, President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum to revive both Keystone XL pipelines,. which \\"would transport more than 800,000 barrels per day of heavy crude\\" from Alberta to the Gulf Coast. * March 9, 2017 Both the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau and then- Premier of Alberta, Rachel Notley, attended North America's largest energy conference‚ÄîCERAWeek in Houston, Texas. An Angus Reed Institute poll published that week, showed that 48 per cent of Canadians supported the revival of the Keystone XL pipeline project. The pollsters said that the support for the Keystone pipeline project by provincial NDP government and the federal Liberal government under Trudeau, had a positive impact on Canadians' attitudes of the project. Prime Minister Trudeau has been in office since 2015, and Notley served as Premier from 2015 until 2019. * March 24, 2017 President Trump signed a presidential permit to allow TransCanada to build the Keystone XL pipeline. The State Department issued a new Record of Decision on the same factual record as before but now finding that granting the permit to be in the national interest. * November 2017 The Nebraska Public Service Commission approved (3‚Äì2) the construction of the pipeline, albeit through an alternative route which is longer, but deemed to have the least environmental impact compared to two other routes that were considered. This proved to be a major setback for TransCanada since they would have \\"years of new review and legal challenges\\". TransCanada asked Nebraska to reconsider this decision and worked with Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) to determine the structural cause of a leak in South Dakota on November 21, 2017. * November 2018 A U.S. District Judge Brian Morris of the United States District Court for the District of Montana enjoined construction of the pipeline and vacated the new permit because the policy reversal violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Endangered Species Act. * February 2019 District Judge Morris denied a request by Calgary-based TransCanada Corporation to begin constructing worker camps for pipeline although the company could begin construction of pipe storage and container yards as long as they were outside the proposed pipeline's right-of- way. * March 2019 President Trump revoked the prior permit and himself directly issued a new permit for the pipeline. * May 2019 TransCanada Corporation changed its name to TC Energy Corporation, as its business extends into the United States, Mexico, as well as Canada where it has pipelines, power generation and energy storage operations. * June 2019 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the Justice Department's motion to lift the injunction blocking construction and found that the new permit mooted the prior Montana lawsuit. * August 2019, The Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed the Nebraska Public Service Commission's approval of TransCanada's pipeline application. * October 2019 The State Department solicited comments on its new draft supplemental environmental impact statement. * March 2020 The Premier of Alberta, Jason Kenney, who campaigned on promoting the province's oil and gas industry, and has aggressively promoted the industry by repealing the carbon tax and establishing an energy war room (Canadian Energy Centre), since the April 2019 Alberta general election, announced that the UCP government was taking an \\"equity stake\\" and providing a \\"loan guarantee\\", which amounts to a \\"total financial commitment of just over $7 billion\\" to the Keystone XL project. * March 31, 2020 CEO Russ Girling announced that TC Energy \\"will proceed with construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline\\" and thanked President Donald Trump, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, and other government officials for \\"support and advocacy\\" for Keystone XL. Girling said that this construction, which will take place during the COVID-19 pandemic, will follow government and health authorities guidance, to ensure the protection of workers, their families, and surrounding communities from the virus. * April 15, 2020 District Judge Brian Morris has issued a suspension for the pipeline's construction after the plaintiffs, the Northern Plains Resource Council, alleged the project was improperly reauthorised back in 2017Northern Plains Resource Council v. US Army Corps of Engineers, No. 19-cv-44 (D. Mont., Apr 15, 2020). In the summary judgment, the judge agreed that the Endangered Species Act was violated, thereby voiding the permit. * May 28, 2020 The United States Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit has denied a motion to stay the District Judge's rulingNorthern Plains Res. Council v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, Nos. 20-35412, 20-35414, and 20-35415 (9th. Cir., May 28, 2020). This prompted Solicitor General, Noel J. Francisco, to file an application for stay to the Supreme Court. The application was granted consideration. * July 6, 2020 In the US Army Corps of Engineers v. Northern Plains Resource Council case, the Supreme Court of the US ordered all Keystone XL work be halted. The order, however, does not affect any other present or future pipeline construction in the United States, and will be in force until the circuit court, and then the Supreme Court deliver their final rulingshttps://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/070620zr_2d83.pdf. In response, TC Energy stated that the US part of the project will be reassessed (but not abandoned); the Canadian part will proceed as before. TC Energy Logo of TransCanada before rebranding as TC Energy in 2019 According to their 2019 Annual Report, TC Energy owns 15,931 km of pipelines in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The company, which changed its name from TransCanada Corporation to TC Energy Corporation on May 3, 2020, to \\"better reflect the scope of our operations as a leading North American energy infrastructure company\\", is the sole owner of the Keystone Pipeline System. The pipeline system was originally developed as a partnership between TransCanada and ConocoPhillips, but TransCanada acquired ConocoPhillips' interest in August 2009. By 2019, TC Energy was delivering over 2 billion barrels through their 4,900-kilometer (3,000-mile) long liquids pipeline system which connects oil producers with refineries and markets. The Keystone Pipeline System, \\"delivers approximately 20 per cent of western Canadian exports to the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast.\\" Russ Girling, who has been with TransCanada since 1994, has served as President and Chief Executive Officer and since July 1, 2010. Siim A. Vanaselja is Chair of the Board. Revenue from TC Energy's 4,900-kilometer (3,000-mile) long liquids pipeline system was US $2,879 million in 2019, up from US $2,584 million in 2018. As of December 2019, their EBITDA in their liquids pipeline system alone was US $2,192 million up from to US $1,849 million in 2018. The estimated cost of Keystone XL3 was US $8 billion by December 2019, with a carrying value on December 31, 2019 of US $1.1 billion; for Heartland and TC Terminals, it was US $0.9 billion with a carrying value of US 0.1 billion; for Grand Rapids Phase II4, it was US $0.7 billion; and for Keystone Hardisty Terminal, it was US $0.3 billion with a carrying value of US 0.1 billion. As of 2008, certain parties who agreed to make volume commitments to the Keystone expansion had the option to acquire up to a combined 15% equity ownership, which included Valero Energy Corporation and Hogshead Spouter Co Eminent domain When Nebraska landowners who had refused TransCanada the permission it needed for pipeline easements on their properties, TransCanada attempted to exercise eminent domain over such use. Landowners in the path of the pipeline have complained about threats by TransCanada to confiscate private land and lawsuits to allow the \\"pipeline on their property even though the controversial project has yet to receive federal approval\\". As of October 17, 2011, TransCanada had \\"34 eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas\\" and \\"22 in South Dakota\\". Some of those landowners gave testimony for a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in May 2011. In his book The Pipeline and the Paradigm, Samuel Avery quotes landowner David Daniel in Texas, who claims that TransCanada illegally seized his land via eminent domain by claiming to be a public utility rather than a private firm. On October 4, 2012, 78-year-old Texas landowner Eleanor Fairchild were arrested for criminal trespassing and other charges after they were accused of standing in front of pipeline construction equipment on Fairchild's farm in Winnsboro, a town about east of Dallas. Fairchild has owned the land since 1983 and refused to sign any agreements with TransCanada. Her land was seized by eminent domain. By September 29, 2015, TransCanada (now TC Energy) had dropped the lawsuit and acceded to the authority of elected, five-member Nebraska Public Service Commission, which has the state constitutional authority to approve gas and oil pipelines. Route Phase 1 (complete) Keystone pipeline (phase 1) near Swanton, Nebraska (2009) This pipeline runs from Hardisty, Alberta, to the junction at Steele City, Nebraska, and on to the Wood River Refinery in Roxana, Illinois, and Patoka Oil Terminal Hub (tank farm) north of Patoka, Illinois. The Canadian section involves approximately of pipeline converted from the Canadian Mainline natural gas pipeline and of new pipeline, pump stations and terminal facilities at Hardisty, Alberta. The United States section is long. It runs through Nemaha, Brown and Doniphan counties in Kansas and Buchanan, Clinton, Caldwell, Montgomery, Lincoln and St. Charles counties in Missouri, before entering Madison County, Illinois. Phase 1 went online in June 2010. Phase 2 (complete) The Keystone-Cushing pipeline phase connected the Keystone pipeline (phase 1) in Steele City, Nebraska, south through Kansas to the oil hub and tank farm in Cushing, Oklahoma, a distance of . It was constructed in 2010 and went online in February 2011. Truck hauling pipe to build Keystone-Cushing pipeline (phase 2) southeast of Peabody, Kansas (2010) Phase 3a (complete) The Cushing MarketLink pipeline phase started at Cushing, Oklahoma, where American-produced oil is added to the pipeline, then runs south to a delivery point near terminals in Nederland, Texas, to serve refineries in the Port Arthur, Texas, area. Keystone started pumping oil through this section in January 2014. Oil producers in the U.S. pushed for this phase so the glut of oil can be distributed out of the large oil tank farms and distribution center in Cushing. Phase 3b (complete) The Houston Lateral pipeline phase is a pipeline to transport crude oil from the pipeline in Liberty County, Texas, to refineries and terminal in the Houston area. This phase was constructed 2013 to 2016 and went online in 2017.  Phase 4  The proposed Keystone XL pipeline starts from the same area in Alberta, Canada, as the Phase 1 pipeline. The Canadian section would consist of of new pipeline. It would enter the United States at Morgan, Montana, and travel through Baker, Montana, where American-produced oil would be added to the pipeline; then it would travel through South Dakota and Nebraska, where it would join the existing Keystone pipelines at Steele City, Nebraska. This phase has generated the greatest controversy because of its routing over the Sandhills in Nebraska. On January 18, 2018, TransCanada announced they had secured commitments to ship 500,000 barrels per day for 20 years. Political issues Map showing how the United States House of Representatives voted on the Keystone Pipeline, November 14, 2014: \\"No\\" votes are colored in red; \\"Yes\\" votes in green. According to a February 10, 2011 Reuters article, Koch Industries‚Äìthen owned by Charles G. Koch and David H. Koch, commonly referred to as the Koch brothers‚Äîwere in a position to increase their profits substantially if the Keystone XL Pipeline were approved. By 2011, Koch Industries refined 25 percent of all crude oil imported into the United States. In response to the article, Congressmen Henry Waxman and Bobby Rush submitted a letter to the Energy and Commerce Committee urging them to request documents from Koch Industries relating to the pipeline. The pipeline was a prominent issue in the 2014 United States mid-term elections, and after Republicans gained control of the Senate that the year, the project was revived. The following year, President Obama said in his speech announcing the rejection of the pipeline on November 6, 2015, that Keystone XL had taken on symbolic importance, \\"for years, the Keystone pipeline has occupied what I, frankly, consider an overinflated role in our political discourse. It became a symbol too often used as a campaign cudgel by both parties rather than a serious policy matter.\\" He went on to state that \\"approving this project would have undercut [the United States'] global leadership\\" on climate change. In January 2012, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) requested a new report on the environmental review process. In September 2015, Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton publicly expressed her opposition to the Keystone XL, citing concerns about climate change. After Donald Trump's victory in that election, he released a presidential memorandum on January 24, 2017 announcing revival of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. The order would expedite the environmental review, which Trump described as an \\"incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process.\\" Protests and opposition Demonstration against the Keystone XL extension at White House, August 2011 People's Climate March 2017 The environmentalist Bill McKibben (350.org) arrested in front of the White House at a protest against Keystone XL project. Bill McKibben, environmental and global warming activist and founder of 350.org, the group that organized the 2009 international protests‚Äîdescribed by CNN as \\"the most widespread day of political action in the planet's history\\"‚Äîled the opposition to the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. In the year before the 2012 United States presidential election, McKibben and other activists mounted pressure on then-President Obama, who was running for re-election. Obama had included a call to \\"be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil\\" in his 2008 United States presidential election. A broad coalition of protesters, including Phil Radford, Daryl Hannah, Dave Heineman, Ben Nelson, Mike Johanns and Susie Tompkins Buell challenged him to keep that promise. By August 11, there were over 1000 nonviolent arrests at the White House. On November 6, 2011, several thousand formed a human chain around the White House to convince Obama to block the Keystone XL project. Organizer Bill McKibben said, \\"this has become not only the biggest environmental flash point in many, many years, but maybe the issue in recent times in the Obama administration when he's been most directly confronted by people in the street. In this case, people willing, hopeful, almost dying for him to be the Barack Obama of 2008.\\" In August 2012, the Tar Sands Blockade launched an indefinite tree sit in East Texas. On October 31, 2012, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein was arrested in Texas for criminal trespass after trying to deliver food and supplies to the Keystone XL protesters. An estimated crowd of 35,000‚Äì50,000 gathers near the Washington Monument in February 2013 to protest the Keystone XL pipeline and support action on climate change On February 17, 2013, approximately 35,000 to 50,000 protesters attended a rally in Washington, D.C. organized by The Sierra Club, 350.org, and The Hip Hop Caucus, in what Bill McKibben described as \\"the biggest climate rally by far, by far, by far, in U.S. history\\". The event featured Lennox Yearwood; Chief Jacqueline Thomas, immediate past chief of the Saik'uz First Nation; Van Jones; Crystal Lameman, of Beaver Lake Cree Nation; Michael Brune, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and others as invited speakers. Simultaneous 'solidarity' protests were also organized in several other cities across the United States, Europe, and Canada. Protesters called on President Obama to reject the planned pipeline extension when deciding the fate of the pipeline after Secretary of State John Kerry completes a review of the project. On March 2, 2014, approximately 1000‚Äì1200 protesters marched from Georgetown University to the White House to stage a protest against the Keystone Pipeline. 398 arrests were made of people tying themselves to the White House fence with zip-ties and lying on a black tarp in front of the fence. The tarp represented an oil spill, and many protesters dressed in white jumpsuits covered in black ink, symbolizing oil-covered HazMat suits, laid down upon the tarp. Environmental concerns Environmental concerns include the potential for air pollution, and for leaks and spills, that could pollute critical water supplies and cause harm to migratory birds and other wildlife. One of the major concerns was the way in which the original route crossed the Sandhills, the large wetland ecosystem in Nebraska, and the Ogallala Aquifer, one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world. The Sandhills region and Ogallala Aquifer A map showing aquifer thickness of the Ogallala Aquifer with the proposed Keystone XL pipeline route laid over. Since 2010, there were concerns that a pipeline spill threaten the Ogallala Aquifer, one of the world's largest fresh water reserves. The Ogallala Aquifer spans eight states, provides drinking water for two million people, and supports $20 billion in agriculture. Critics say that a major leak could ruin drinking water and devastate the mid-western U.S. economy. On November 10, 2011, the Department of State postponed a final decision while investigating \\"potential alternative routes around the Sandhills in Nebraska\\" in response to concerns that the project was not in the United States' national interest. In its November 11 response, TransCanada pointed out fourteen different routes for Keystone XL were being studied, eight that impacted Nebraska. They included one potential alternative route in Nebraska that would have avoided the entire Sandhills region and Ogallala Aquifer and six alternatives that would have reduced pipeline mileage crossing the Sandhills or the aquifer. The Keystone XL proposal faced criticism from environmentalists and a minority of the members of the United States Congress. On November 22, 2011, the Nebraska unicameral legislature passed unanimously two bills with the governor's signature that enacted a compromise agreed upon with the pipeline builder to move the route, and approved up to US$2 million in state funding for an environmental study. On November 30, 2011, a group of Republican senators introduced legislation aimed at forcing the Obama administration to make a decision within 60 days. In December 2011, Congress passed a bill giving the Obama Administration a 60-day deadline to make a decision on the application to build the Keystone XL Pipeline. In 2011, after opposition for laying the pipeline in this area, TransCanada agreed to change the route and skip the Sandhills, even though pipeline industry spokesmen had maintained that existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years in southeast Wyoming, eastern Colorado and New Mexico, western Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.Larry Lakely, Map of Pipelines and the Ogallala Aquifer, 2012, January 20, 2012. * Andrew Black and David Holt, Guest View: We need crude oil pipelines Lincoln Journal Star, July 12, 2011 * Allegro Energy Group, How Pipelines Make the Oil Market Work ‚Äì Their Networks, Operation and Regulation , December 2001, Association of Oil Pipe Lines and American Petroleum Institute, pp. 8‚Äì9. * Pipeline 101, Refined products pipelines, accessed October 8, 2013. * Oil Sands fact Check, Myth vs. Fact: KXL will Threaten the Ogallala Aquifer May 20, 2012.

In January 2012, President Obama rejected the application amid protests about the pipeline's impact on Nebraska's environmentally sensitive Sandhills region. The deadline for the decision had \\"prevented a full assessment of the pipeline's impact\\". On September 5, 2012, TransCanada submitted an environmental report on the new route in Nebraska, which the company says is \\"based on extensive feedback from Nebraskans, and reflects our shared desire to minimize the disturbance of land and sensitive resources in the state\\". The March 2013 U.S. Department of State Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) stated that the original proposals, would not cause \\"significant impacts to most resources along the proposed Project route.\\" This included the shortening of the pipeline to ; its avoidance of \\"crossing the NDEQ-identified Sandhills Region\\" and \\"reduction of the length of pipeline crossing the Northern High Plains Aquifer system, which includes the Ogallala formation\\". In response to a Freedom of Information Act request for route information, the Department of State revealed on June 24, 2013, that \\"Neither Cardno ENTRIX nor TransCanada ever submitted GIS information to the Department of State, nor was either corporation required to do so.\\" In response to the Department of State's report, which recommended neither acceptance nor rejection, an editor of The New York Times recommended that Obama should reject the project, which \\"even by the State Department's most cautious calculations ‚Äî can only add to the [climate change] problem.\\"The Alberta government placed a $30,000 ad entitled \\"Keystone XL: The Choice of Reason\\" in The New York Times to counter the editorial (CBC March 17, 2013). On March 21, Mother Jones revealed that key personnel employed by Environment Resources Management (ERM), the consulting firm responsible for generating most of the SEIS, had previously performed contract work for TransCanada corporation. In addition, When the State Department released the original proposal ERM had submitted to secure the SEIS contract, portions of the work histories of key personnel were redacted. In April 2013, the EPA challenged the U.S. State Department report's conclusion that the pipeline would not result in greater oil sand production, noting that \\"while informative, [it] is not based on an updated energy-economic modeling effort\\". Overall, the EPA rated the SEIS with their category \\"EO-2\\" (EO for \\"environmental objections\\" and 2 for \\"insufficient information\\").Cynthia Jones (U.S. EPA), letter to U.S. Dept. of State concerning Keystone XL pipeline, April 22, 2013. In May 2013 Republicans in the House of Representatives defended the Northern Route Approval Act, which would allow for congressional approval of the pipeline, on the grounds that the pipeline created jobs and energy independence. If enacted the Northern Route Approval Act would waive the requirement for permits for a foreign company and bypass the need for President Obama's approval, and the debate in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate, concerned about serious environmental risks, that could result in the rejection of the pipeline. In April 2013, TransCanada Corporation changed the original proposed route of Keystone XL to minimize \\"disturbance of land, water resources and special areas\\"; the new route was approved by Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman in January 2013. On April 18, 2014, the Obama administration announced that the review of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline has been extended indefinitely, pending the result of a legal challenge to a Nebraska pipeline siting law that could change the route. On January 9, 2015, the Nebraska Supreme Court cleared the way for construction, and on the same day the House voted in favor of the pipeline. On January 29, 2015, the Keystone XL Pipeline was passed by the Senate 62‚Äì36.Senate Passes Keystone XL Measure, , accessed Jan. 2015 On February 11, 2015, the Keystone XL Pipeline was passed by the House of Representatives with the proposed Senate Amendments 270‚Äì152. The Keystone XL Pipeline bill was not officially sent to President Obama, starting the official ten-day count towards the bill becoming law without presidential signature, until February 24, 2015. Republicans delayed delivering the bill over the Presidents Day holiday weekend to ensure Congress would be in session if the president were to veto the bill. On February 24, 2015, the bill was vetoed and returned for congressional action. On March 4, 2015, the Senate held a vote and failed to override President Obama's veto of the bill; the vote was 62 to 37, less than the two-thirds majority required to override a presidential veto. The review by the State Department is ongoing. On June 15, 2015 the House Oversight Committee threatened to subpoena the State Department for the latter's withholding of records relevant to the process since March 2015 and calling the process \\"unnecessarily secretive\\". Despite some records being posted by consulted agencies such as the EPA, the State Department has not responded to the request. On November 2, 2015, TransCanada asked the Obama administration to suspend its permit application for the Keystone XL. Potential for oil spills University of Nebraska professor John Stansbury conducted an independent analysis which provides more detail on the potential risks for the Ogallala Aquifer. Stansbury concludes that safety assessments provided by TransCanada are misleading: \\"We can expect no fewer than 2 major spills per state during the 50-year projected lifetime of the pipeline. These spills could release as much as 180 thousand barrels of oil each.\\" Other items of note in Stansbury's analysis: * \\"While TransCanada estimates that the Keystone XL will have 11 significant spills (more than 50 barrels of crude oil) over 50 years, a more realistic assessment is 91 significant spills over the pipeline's operational lifetime. TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year. (The existing Keystone I pipeline has had one major spill and 11 smaller spills in its first year of operation.)\\" * \\"Analysis of the time needed to shut down the pipeline shows that response to a leak at a river crossing could conservatively take more than ten times longer than the 11 minutes and 30 seconds that TransCanada assumes. (After the June 2010 spill of more than of crude oil into a tributary of the Kalamazoo River, an Enbridge tar sands pipeline ‚Äì a pipe compared to the Keystone XL ‚Äì was not completely shut down for 12 hours.)\\" * \\"Realistic calculations yield worst-case spill estimates of more than in the Nebraska Sandhills above the Ogallala Aquifer, more than of crude oil at the Yellowstone River crossings, more than at the Platte River crossing and more than at the Missouri River crossing.\\" * \\"Contaminants from a release at the Missouri or Yellowstone River crossing would enter Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota where they would adversely affect drinking water intakes, aquatic wildlife, and recreation. Contaminants from a spill at the Platte River crossing would travel downstream unabated into the Missouri River for several hundred miles affecting drinking water intakes for hundreds of thousands of people (e.g., Lincoln, Nebraska; Omaha, Nebraska; Nebraska City, Nebraska; St. Joseph, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri) as well as aquatic habitats and recreational activities. In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river.\\" * \\"The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska. The Sandhills are ancient sand dunes that have been stabilized by grasses. Because of their very permeable geology, nearly 100 percent of the annual rainfall infiltrates to a very shallow aquifer, often less than 20 feet below the surface. This aquifer is the well-known Ogallala Aquifer that is one of the most productive and important aquifers in the world.\\" Portions of the pipeline will also cross an active seismic zone that had a 4.3 magnitude earthquake as recently as 2002. Opponents claim that TransCanada applied to the U.S. government to use thinner steel and pump at higher pressures than normal. TransCanada CEO Russ Girling has described the Keystone Pipeline as \\"routine\\", noting that TransCanada has been building similar pipelines in North America for half a century and that there are of similar oil pipelines in the United States today. He also stated that the Keystone Pipeline will include 57 improvements above standard requirements demanded by U.S. regulators so far, making it \\"the safest pipeline ever built\\". Rep. Ed Whitfield, a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce concurred, saying \\"this is the most technologically advanced and safest pipeline ever proposed.\\"\\"Keystone XL the 'safest pipeline ever'\\", Sun News Network, December 2, 2011. However, while TransCanada had asserted that a set of 57 conditions will ensure Keystone XL's safe operation, Anthony Swift of the Natural Resources Defense Council asserted that all but a few of these conditions simply restate current minimum standards. TransCanada claims that they will take 100% responsibility for any potential environmental problems. According to their website, \\"It's our responsibility ‚Äì as a good company and under law. If anything happens on the Keystone XL Pipeline, rapid response is key. That's why our Emergency Response plans are approved by state and federal agencies, and why we practice them regularly. We conduct regular emergency exercises, and aerial surveys every two weeks. We're ready to respond with a highly-trained response team standing by.\\" Alberta oil sands The Athabasca oil sands in Alberta, Canada, are a very large source of bitumen, which can be upgraded to synthetic crude oil. Different environmental groups, citizens, and politicians have raised concerns about the potential negative impacts of the Keystone XL project. Demonstration of citizens against tar sands and the Keystone Pipeline. The main issues are the risk of oil spills along the pipeline, which would traverse highly sensitive terrain, and 17% higher greenhouse gas emissions from the extraction of oil sands compared to extraction of conventional oil. Leaks and spills In 2016, about 400 barrels were released from the original Keystone pipe network via leaks, which federal investigators said resulted from a \\"weld anomaly.\\" On November 17, 2017, the pipeline leaked around 407,000 gallons onto farmland near Amherst, South Dakota. The oil leak is the largest seen from the Keystone pipeline in the state. The leak lasted for several minutes, with no initial reports of damage to water sources or wildlife. Although the spill did not happen on Sioux property, it was in close enough proximity to potentially contaminate the aquifer used for water. The pipeline was immediately shut down,\\"Keystone pipeline leak in South Dakota about double previous estimate: paper\\", Reuters, April 7, 2018 and TransCanada began using the pipe again 12 days after the leak.\\"Keystone Pipeline spill in South Dakota twice as big as first thought\\", Associated Press, April 7, 2018 For much of late 2017, the Keystone pipeline operated at reduced pressure during remediation efforts. The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said that the failure \\"may have been caused by mechanical damage to the pipeline and coating associated with a weight installed on the pipeline in 2008.\\" Later, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that a metal tracked vehicle had run over the area, damaging the pipeline.\\"November spill from Keystone pipeline larger than first estimated\\", Daniel J. Graeber, UPI, April 9, 2018 In April 2018, a federal investigation found that 408,000 gallons of crude had spilled at the site, almost twice what TransCanada had reported. That number made it the seventh-largest onshore oil spill since 2002.\\"The Keystone Pipeline oil spill was nearly twice as big as TransCanada said\\", Vice News, Sarah Sax, April 10, 2018 In April 2018, Reuters reviewed documents that showed that Keystone had \\"leaked substantially more oil, and more often, in the United States than the company indicated to regulators in risk assessments before operations began in 2010.\\" On October 31, 2019, a rupture occurred near Edinburg, North Dakota, spilling an estimated 9,120 barrels (383,000 gallons / 1.4 million liters) where the 45,000 gal that were not recovered from the 0.5 acre containment have spread contaminating 5 acres. This occurred while the South Dakota Water Management Board was in the middle of hearings on whether or not to allow TC Energy to use millions of gallons of water to build camps to house temporary construction workers for Keystone XL construction. Water supplies Pipeline construction will affect water supplies upstream of several Native American tribes' reservations, even though the pipeline does not lead through any tribal land. TC Energy is applying for permits to tap the Cheyenne River, White River (South Dakota), and Bad River (South Dakota). Increased carbon emissions Environmental organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) also oppose the project due to its transportation of oil from oil sands. In its March 2010 report, the NRDC stated that \\"the Keystone XL Pipeline undermines the U.S. commitment to a clean energy economy\\", instead \\"delivering dirty fuel at high costs\\". On June 23, 2010, 50 Democrats in Congress in their letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that \\"building this pipeline has the potential to undermine America's clean energy future and international leadership on climate change\\", referencing the higher input quantity of fossil fuels necessary to take the tar and turn it into a usable fuel product in comparison to other conventionally derived fossil fuels. The House Energy and Commerce Committee's chairman at the time, Representative Henry Waxman, had also urged the State Department to block Keystone XL for greenhouse gas emission reasons. In December 2010, the No Tar Sands Oil campaign, sponsored by action groups including Corporate Ethics International, NRDC, Sierra Club, 350.org, National Wildlife Federation, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, and Rainforest Action Network, was launched. In September 2011, Joe Oliver, Canada's Minister of Natural Resources, sharply criticized opponents of oil sands development in a speech to the Canadian Club of Toronto, arguing that oil sands account for about 0.1% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, coal power plants powered in the U.S. generate almost 40 times more greenhouse-gas emissions than Canada's oil sands and California bitumen is more GHG-intensive than the oil sands. As of 2013 however, producing and processing tar sands oil results in roughly 14 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than the average oil used in the U.S. The State Department's 2012 Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (Final SEIS) estimated that producing and transporting oil to the pipeline's capacity would increase greenhouse-gas emissions compared to alternative sources of oil, if the denial of the pipeline project meant that the oil would stay in the ground. \\"However, ... such a change is not likely to occur. [A]pproval or denial of any one crude oil transport project, including the proposed Project, is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands, or the continued demand for heavy crude oil.\\" To the extent that the oil would be extracted in any case, the relevant comparison would be to alternative means of transporting it; the Final SEIS considered three alternative scenarios and found that \\"total GHG emissions associated with construction and operation (direct and indirect) combined would be higher for each of the three scenarios than for the entire route encompassing the proposed Project.\\" The Final SEIS made no estimate of the net effect of the project on greenhouse-gas emissions, considering both the amount of oil that would likely replace other sources (increasing emissions) and the amount of oil for which the pipeline would merely replace alternate means of transportation (decreasing emissions). In a February 2015, the US EPA responded to the U.S. Department of State's Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (Final SEIS)] for the Keystone XL Pipeline Project, that the pipeline will significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions because it will lead to the expansion of Alberta's carbon intensive oilsands. and that over the proposed 50-year timeline of the pipeline, this could mean releasing as much as \\"1.37 billion more tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere\\". EPA concluded that due to the current relatively cheap cost of oil, companies might be less likely to set up their own developments in the oil sands. It would be too expensive for the companies to ship by rail. However, \\"the presence of the pipeline, which offers an inexpensive way to move the oil to market, could increase the likelihood that companies would extract from the oil sands even when prices are low\\". The EPA suggested that the State Department should \\"revisit\\" its prior conclusions in light of the drop in oil prices. TransCanada Corporation responded with a letter by President and CEO Russel K. Girling stating that TransCanada \\"rejects the EPA inference that at lower oil prices the [Keystone XL Pipeline] Project will increase the rate of oil sands production growth and accompanying greenhouse gas emissions\\".http://keystone-xl.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/02/response-to-epa-letter.pdf Girling maintained that the EPA's conclusions \\"are not supported by the facts outlined in the Final SEIS or actual observations of the marketplace\\". Conflicts of interest In October 2011, The New York Times questioned the impartiality of the environmental analysis of the pipeline done by Cardno Entrix, an environmental contractor based in Houston. The study found that the pipeline would have limited adverse environmental impacts, but was authored by a firm that had \\"previously worked on projects with TransCanada and describes the pipeline company as a 'major client' in its marketing materials\\". However, the Department of State's Office of the Inspector General conducted an investigation of the potential conflict of interest, and its February 2012 report of that investigation states there was no conflict of interest either in the selection of the contractor or in the preparation of the environmental impact statement.United States Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors Office of Inspector General Office of Audits. February 2012. Special Review of the Keystone XL Pipeline Permit Process. Report Number AUD/SI-12-28. According to The New York Times, legal experts questioned whether the U.S. government was \\"flouting the intent\\" of the Federal National Environmental Policy Act, which \\"[was] meant to ensure an impartial environmental analysis of major projects\\". The report prompted 14 senators and congressmen to ask the State Department inspector general on October 26, 2011 \\"to investigate whether conflicts of interest tainted the process\\" for reviewing environmental impact.Tar Sands Pipeline Probe Urged Sen. Bernie Sanders October 26, 2011 In August 2014, a study was published that concluded the pipeline could produce up to 4 times more global warming pollution than the State Department's study indicated. The report blamed the discrepancy on a failure to take account of the increase in consumption due to the drop in the price of oil that would be spurred by the pipeline. On May 4, 2012, the U.S. Department of State selected Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to author a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, after the Environmental Protection Agency had found previous versions of the study, by contractor Cardno Entrix, to be extremely inadequate. Project opponents panned the study on its release, calling it a \\"deeply flawed analysis\\". An investigation by the magazine Mother Jones revealed that the State Department had redacted the biographies of the study's authors to hide their previous contract work for TransCanada and other oil companies with an economic interest in the project. Based on an analysis of public documents on the State Department website, one critic asserted that \\"Environmental Resources Management was paid an undisclosed amount under contract to TransCanada to write the statement\\". Diplomatic issues Commentator Bill Mann has linked the Keystone postponement to the Michigan Senate's rejection of Canadian funding for the proposed Gordie Howe International Bridge and to other recent instances of \\"U.S. government actions (and inactions) that show little concern about Canadian concerns\\". Mann drew attention to a Maclean's article sub- titled \\"we used to be friends\\"Mann, Bill, \\"Americans should be thankful for Canada\\", MarketWatch, November 24, 2011. Retrieved November 24, 2011. about U.S./Canada relations after President Obama had \\"insulted Canada (yet again)\\" over the pipeline.Savage, Luiza Ch., \\"The U.S. and Canada: we used to be friends\\" , Maclean's, November 21, 2011 8:00 am. Retrieved November 24, 2011. Canadian Ambassador Doer observes that Obama's \\"choice is to have it come down by a pipeline that he approves, or without his approval, it comes down on trains\\". There are 2.6 million miles of pipeline in the United States (enough to wrap around the earth 100 times) safely transporting between 11 billion and 13 billion barrels of energy, chemical, and water resources each day. According to U.S. Department of Transportation statistics, pipelines are 451 times safer than rail on a per-mile basis. During the 2014 Pacific Northwest Economic Region Summit in Whistler, B.C., Canada's US Ambassador Gary Doer stated that there is no proof, be it environmental, economic, safety or scientific, that construction work on Keystone XL should not go ahead. Doer said that all the evidence supports a favorable decision by the US government for the controversial pipeline. In contrast, the President of the Rosebud Sioux Nation, Cyril Scott, has stated that the November 14, 2014, vote in favor of the Keystone XL pipeline in the U.S. House of Representatives is an \\"act of war\\", declaring: > We are outrage at the lack of intergovernmental cooperation. We are a > sovereign nation, and we are not being treated as such. We will close our > reservation borders to Keystone XL. Authorizing Keystone XL is an act of war > against our people. Geopolitical issues A map of world oil reserves according to OPEC, 2013. Proponents for the Keystone XL pipeline argue that it would allow the U.S. to increase its energy security and reduce its dependence on foreign oil. TransCanada CEO Russ Girling has argued that \\"the U.S. needs 10 million barrels a day of imported oil\\" and the debate over the proposed pipeline \\"is not a debate of oil versus alternative energy. This is a debate about whether you want to get your oil from Canada or Venezuela or Nigeria.\\" However, an independent study conducted by the Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute refers to some studies (e.g. a 2011 study by Danielle Droitsch of Pembina Institute) according to which \\"a good portion of the oil that will gush down the KXL will probably end up being finally consumed beyond the territorial United States\\". It also states that the project will increase the heavy crude oil price in the Midwestern United States by diverting oil sands oil from the Midwest refineries to the Gulf Coast and export markets. The US Gulf Coast has a large concentration of refineries designed to process very heavy crude oil. At present, the refineries are dependent on heavy crude from Venezuela, including crude from Venezuela's own massive Orinoco oil sands. The United States is the number one buyer of crude oil exported from Venezuela.US Energy Information Administration, Venezuela, June 20, 2014. The large trade relationship between the US and Venezuela has persisted despite political tensions between the two countries. However, the volume of oil imported into the US from Venezuela dropped in half from 2007 to 2014, as overall Venezuelan exports have dropped, and also as Venezuela seeks to become less dependent on US purchases of its crude oil. The Keystone pipeline is seen as a way to replace imports of heavy oil-sand crude from Venezuela with more reliable Canadian heavy oil.Jorge R. Pinon, The possible loss of Venezuelan heavy crude oil imports underscores the strategic importance of the Keystone XL pipeline, Energy Issue Brief, Jackson School of Geosciences, Univ. of Texas, Aug. 2014. TransCanada's Girling has also argued that if Canadian oil doesn't reach the Gulf through an environmentally friendly buried pipeline, that the alternative is oil that will be brought in by tanker, a mode of transportation that produces higher greenhouse-gas emissions and that puts the environment at greater risk. Diane Francis has argued that much of the opposition to the oil sands actually comes from foreign countries such as Nigeria, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia, all of whom supply oil to the United States and who could be affected if the price of oil drops due to the new availability of oil from the pipeline. She cited as an example an effort by Saudi Arabia to stop television commercials critical of the Saudi government. TransCanada had said that development of oil sands will expand regardless of whether the crude oil is exported to the United States or alternatively to Asian markets through Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines or Kinder Morgan's Trans-Mountain line. Indigenous issues Many Native Americans and Indigenous Canadians are opposed to the Keystone XL project for various reasons, including possible damage to sacred sites, pollution, and water contamination, which could lead to health risks among their communities. On September 19, 2011, a number of leaders from Native American bands in the United States and First Nations bands from Canada were arrested for protesting the Keystone XL outside the White House. According to Debra White Plume, a Lakota activist, indigenous peoples \\"have thousands of ancient and historical cultural resources that would be destroyed across [their] treaty lands\\". TransCanada's Pipeline Permit Application to the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission states project impacts that include potential physical disturbance, demolition or removal of \\"prehistoric or historic archaeological sites, districts, buildings, structures, objects, and locations with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups\\". Indigenous communities are also concerned with health risks posed by the extension of the Keystone pipeline. Locally caught fish and untreated surface water would be at risk for contamination through oil sands extraction, and are central to the diets of many indigenous peoples. Earl Hatley, an environmental activist who has worked with Native American tribes has expressed concern about the environmental and public health impact on Native Americans. TransCanada has developed an Aboriginal Relations policy in order to confront some of these conflicts. In 2004, TransCanada made a major donation to the University of Toronto \\"to promote education and research in the health of the Aboriginal population\\". Another proposed solution is TransCanada's Aboriginal Human Resource Strategy, which was developed to facilitate aboriginal employment and to provide \\"opportunities for Aboriginal businesses to participate in both the construction of new facilities and the ongoing maintenance of existing facilities\\". Economic issues In 2011, Russ Girling, president and CEO of TransCanada, touted the positive impact of the project by \\"putting 20,000 US workers to work and spending $7 billion stimulating the US economy\\". These numbers come from a 2010 report written by The Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm based in Texas that was hired by TransCanada to evaluate Keystone XL. The Perryman Group numbers have been disputed by an independent study conducted by the Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute, which found that while the Keystone XL would result in 2,500 to 4,650 temporary construction jobs, the impact will be reduced by higher oil prices in the Midwest, which will likely reduce national employment. However, the State Department estimated that the pipeline would create about 5,000 to 6,000 temporary jobs in the US during the two-year construction period, would increase gasoline availability to the Northeast and expand the Gulf refining industry. T. In January 2012, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford appealed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to review TransCanada's claims that the Keystone Pipeline would create 20,000 jobs. Stating that the company had \\"consistently used public statements and information it knows are false in a concerted effort to secure permitting approval\\" of the pipeline, Radford argued that TransCanada had \\"misled investors, U.S. and Canadian officials, the media, and the public at large in order to bolster its balance sheets and share price\\". In July 2013, President Obama stated \\"The most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline, which might take a year or two, and then after that we're talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 jobs in an economy of 150 million working people.\\" The estimate of 2,000 during construction came under heavy attack, while the long-term, permanent job estimates did not receive as much criticism. According to the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS), the pipeline will only create 35 permanent jobs. The Associated Press noted that it was unclear where the president's figure of 2,000 jobs came from. The U.S. State Department's Preliminary Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, issued in March 2013, estimated 3,900 direct jobs and 42,000 direct and indirect jobs during construction.Associated Press, AP: Obama Understates Keystone XL Pipeline Jobs By Thousands, August 1, 2013 In 2010 Glen Perry, a petroleum engineer for Adira Energy, warned that including the Alberta Clipper pipeline owned by TransCanada's competitor Enbridge, there is an extensive overcapacity of oil pipelines from Canada. After completion of the Keystone XL line, oil pipelines to the U.S. may run nearly half-empty. The expected lack of volume combined with extensive construction cost overruns has prompted several petroleum refining companies to sue TransCanada. Suncor Energy hoped to recoup significant construction-related tolls, though the U.S. Energy Regulatory Commission did not rule in their favor. According to The Globe and Mail, > The refiners argue that construction overruns have raised the cost of > shipping on the Canadian portion of Keystone by 145 per cent while the U.S. > portion has run 92 per cent over budget. They accuse TransCanada of > misleading them when they signed shipping contracts in the summer of 2007. > TransCanada nearly doubled its construction estimates in October 2007, from > $2.8-billion (U.S.) to $5.2-billion. Due to a 2011 exemption the state of Kansas gave TransCanada, the local authorities would lose $50 million public revenue from property taxes for a decade. In 2013, United States Democrats were concerned that Keystone XL would not provide petroleum products for domestic use, but simply facilitate getting Alberta oil sands products to American coastal ports on the Gulf of Mexico for export to China and other countries. In January 2015, Senate Republicans blocked a vote on an amendment proposed by Senator Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., which would have banned exports from the Keystone XL pipeline and required that the pipeline be built with steel from the United States. In 2013, frustrated by delays in getting approval for Keystone XL (via the Gulf of Mexico), the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines (via Kitimat, BC) and the expansion of the existing TransMountain line to Vancouver, Alberta has intensified exploration of two northern projects \\"to help the province get its oil to tidewater, making it available for export to overseas markets\\". By May 2012, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper had spent $9 million and $16.5 million by May 2013 to promote Keystone XL. Until Canadian crude oil accesses international prices like LLS or Maya crude oil by \\"getting to tidewater\\" (south to the U.S. Gulf ports via Keystone XL for example, west to the BC Pacific coast via the proposed Northern Gateway line to ports at Kitimat, BC or north via the northern hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk, near the Beaufort Sea), the Alberta government is losing from $4 ‚Äì 30 billion in tax and royalty revenues as the primary product of the oil sands, Western Canadian Select (WCS), the bitumen crude oil basket, is discounted so heavily against West Texas Intermediate (WTI) while Maya crude oil, a similar product close to tidewater, is reaching peak prices. In April 2013, Calgary-based Canada West Foundation warned, that Alberta is \\"running up against a [pipeline capacity] wall around 2016, when we will have barrels of oil we can't move\\". Pipeline opponents warn of disruption of farms and ranches during construction,http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/globallaborinstitute/research/upload/GLI_Impact- of-Tar-Sands-Pipeline-Spills.pdf and point to damage to water mains and sewage lines sustained during construction of an Enbridge crude oil pipeline in Michigan. A report by the Cornell University Global Labor Institute noted of the 2010 Enbridge Tar Oil Spill along the Kalamazoo River in Michigan: \\"The experience of Kalamazoo residents and businesses provides an insight into some of the ways a community can be affected by a tar sands pipeline spill. Pipeline spills are not just an environmental concern. Pipeline spills can also result in significant economic and employment costs, although the systematic tracking of the social, health, and economic impacts of pipeline spills is not required by law. Leaks and spills from Keystone XL and other tar sands and conventional crude pipelines could put existing jobs at risk..\\" Safety issue A USA Today editorial pointed out that the 2013 Lac-M√©gantic derailment in Quebec, in which crude oil carried by rail cars exploded and killed 47 people, highlights the safety of pipelines compared to truck or rail transport. The oil in the Lac-M√©gantic rail cars came from the Bakken Formation in North Dakota, an area that would be served by the Keystone expansion.Editorial, Canada train disaster bolsters pipeline case: Our view, USA Today, July 11, 2013. Increased oil production in North Dakota has exceeded pipeline capacity since 2010, leading to increasing volumes of crude oil being shipped by truck or rail to refineries.U.S. EIA, Williston Basin crude oil production and takeaway capacity are increasing Canadian journalist Diana Furchtgott-Roth commented: \\"If this oil shipment had been carried through pipelines, instead of rail, families in Lac-M√©gantic would not be grieving for lost loved ones today, and oil would not be polluting Lac M√©gantic and the Chaudi√®re River.\\"Diana Furchtgott-Roth, Quebec tragedy reminds us pipelines are safest way to transport oil, The Globe and Mail, July 8, 2013. A Wall Street Journal article in March 2014 points out that the main reason oil producers from the North Dakota Bakken Shale region are using rail and trucks to transport oil is economics not pipeline capacity. The Bakken oil is of a higher quality than the Canadian sand oil and can be sold to east coast refinery at a premium that they would not get sending it to Gulf refineries. The article goes on to state that there is little support remaining among these producers for the Keystone XL. On November 6, 2015, President Obama rejected Keystone XL citing the urgency of climate change as a key reason behind his decision. \\"IndraStra Global : Analysis, On The Dot\\" Public opinion polls United States Public opinion polls taken by independent national polling organizations toward the beginning of the dispute showed majority support for the proposed pipeline in the US. A September 2013 poll by the Pew Center found 65% favored the project and 30% opposed. The same poll found the pipeline favored by majorities of men (69%), women (61%), Democrats (51%), Republicans (82%), independents (64%), as well as by those in every division of age, education, economic status, and geographic region. The only group identified by the Pew poll with less than majority support for the pipeline was among those Democrats who identified themselves as liberal (41% in favor versus 54% opposed).Pew Center, Continued Support for Keystone XL Pipeline, September 26, 2013. In contrast, Pew's February 2017 poll showed that support for the pipeline had fallen to only 42%, with 48% of polled respondents opposing the pipeline, a 17 percentage point drop in support since 2014, with the majority of the shift due to a sharp decline in support among Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents. At the time of the poll, only 17% of Democrats favored the pipeline. Support among Republicans had also fallen (to 76%) but not as steeply as among Democrats.Pew Center, February 21, 2017. The overall results of polls on the Keystone XL pipeline taken by independent national polling organizations from 2012 to 2014 were as follows: * Gallup (March 2012): 57% government should approve, 29% government should not approve * Pew Center (September 2013): 65% favor, 30% oppose * Rasmussen (January 2014): 57% favor, 28% oppose (of likely voters)Rasmussen Reports, 56% See Keystone XL Pipeline As Good for the Economy, January 6, 2014. * USA Today (January 2014): 56% favor, 41% opposeUSA Today, Slight majority backs Keystone pipeline, January 28, 2014. * Washington Post-ABC News (April 2014): 65% government should approve, 22% government should not approveWashington Post- ABC Poll, Public approves of Keystone pipeline project, April 17, 2014.* CBS News ‚Äì Roper (May 2014): 56% favor, 28% opposeCBS News, CBS News poll database, May 2014. Canada An Angus Reid Institute poll, published on March 9, 2017, showed that 48 per cent of respondents across Canada supported the Keystone XL revival, while 33 per cent opposed it, and 20 per cent were uncertain. In Alberta, support increased to 77 per cent, while it dropped 36 per cent in the province of Quebec. Alternative projects On November 16, 2011, Enbridge announced it was buying ConocoPhillips's 50% interest in the Seaway pipeline that flowed from the Gulf of Mexico to the Cushing hub. In cooperation with Enterprise Products Partners LP it is reversing the Seaway pipeline so that an oversupply of oil at Cushing can reach the Gulf. This project replaced the earlier proposed alternative Wrangler pipeline project from Cushing to the Gulf Coast. It began reversed operations on May 17, 2012. However, according to industries, the Seaway line alone is not enough for oil transportation to the Gulf Coast. On January 19, 2012, TransCanada announced it may shorten the initial path to remove the need for federal approval. TransCanada said that work on that section of the pipeline could start in June 2012 and be on-line by the middle to late 2013. In April 2013, it was learned that the government of Alberta was investigating, as an alternative to the pipeline south through the United States, a shorter all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast, from where the oil would be taken by tanker ships through the Arctic Ocean to markets in Asia and EuropeJill Burke, Alaska watches Canadians consider shipping tar sands oil across Arctic Ocean, Alaska Dispatch, April 30, 2013 and in August, TransCanada announced a new proposal to create a longer all-Canada pipeline, called Energy East, that would extend as far east as the port city of Saint John, New Brunswick, at the same time providing feedstock to refineries in Montreal, Quebec City, and Saint John.TransCanada, Energy East News Release , August 1, 2013 The Enbridge \\"Alberta Clipper\\" expansion of the existing cross-border Line 67 pipeline has been continuing since late 2013. When completed it will add 350,000 bpd new capacity to the existing pipeline for cumulative total of 800,000 bpd. In late 2014 Enbridge announced it is awaiting final approval from the US State Department and expects to proceed with the last phase in mid-2015. Lawsuits In September 2009, independent refiner CVR sued TransCanada for Keystone Pipeline tolls seeking $250 million damage compensation or release from transportation agreements. CVR alleged that the final tolls for the Canadian segment of the pipeline were 146% higher than initially presented, while the tolls for the U.S. segment were 92% higher. In April 2010, three smaller refineries sued TransCanada to break Keystone transportation contracts, saying the new pipeline has been beset with cost overruns. In October 2009, a suit was filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council that challenged the pipeline on the grounds that its permit was based on a deficient environmental impact statement. The suit was thrown out by a federal judge on procedural grounds, ruling that the NRDC lacked the authority to bring it. In June 2012, Sierra Club, Inc., Clean Energy Future Oklahoma, and the East Texas Sub Regional Planning Commission filed a joint complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma seeking injunctive relief and petitioning for a review of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' action in issuing Nationwide Permit 12 permits for the Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf Coast portion of the pipeline. The suit alleges that, contrary to the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 701 et. seq., the Corps' issuance of the permits was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion. In early January 2016, TransCanada announced it would initiate an ISDS claim under NAFTA against the United States, seeking $15 billion in damages and calling the denial of a permit for Keystone XL \\"arbitrary and unjustified.\\"TransCanada to launch NAFTA claim over Keystone rejection, The Globe and Mail, January 6, 2016 See also * List of oil pipelines * List of oil refineries * List of articles about Canadian oil sands * List of pipeline accidents in the United States in the 21st century Notes References Further reading    External links *2012 Presidential Permit application documents from the United States Department of State *2017 Presidential Permit application documents from the United States Department of State *Keystone Pipeline Project, TC Energy * Interactive maps of Keystone XL route from Canadian border to Texas Gulf Coast, Keystone Mapping Project Category:Canada‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Crude oil pipelines in the United States Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2010 Category:Energy infrastructure under construction Category:Oil pipelines in Canada Category:Proposed pipelines in Canada Category:TC Energy Category:Pipelines in Alberta Category:Pipelines in Saskatchewan Category:Oil pipelines in North Dakota Category:Pipelines in South Dakota Category:Pipelines in Nebraska Category:Pipelines in Kansas Category:Oil pipelines in Missouri Category:Oil pipelines in Illinois Category:Oil pipelines in Oklahoma Category:Oil pipelines in Texas ","title":"Keystone Pipeline"},{"id":"11675184","text":"J√∫lius Korostelev (19 June 1923 ‚Äì 18 October 2006) was a Czechoslovak football player and manager born in Turƒçiansky Sv√§t√Ω Martin (in modern-day Slovakia) who played as a midfielder.

Retail design is primarily a specialized practice of architecture and interior design, however it also incorporates elements of industrial design, graphic design, ergonomics, and advertising.\\"Retail design\\" by Otto Riewoldt, te Neues, 2000 \\"Becoming an Architect: A Guide to Careers in Design\\" by Lee W. Waldrep, John Wiley and Sons, 2009\\"Retail design firms\\", Opportunities in commercial art and graphic design careers, Volume 2003 by Barbara Gordon, McGraw-Hill Professional, 2004, Pg. 88 Retail design is a very specialized discipline due to the heavy demands placed on retail space. Because the primary purpose of retail space is to stock and sell product to consumers, the spaces must be designed in a way that promotes an enjoyable and hassle-free shopping experience for the consumer. For example, research shows that male and female shoppers who were accidentally touched from behind by other shoppers left a store earlier than people who had not been touched and evaluated brands more negatively.Martin, Brett A. S. (2012), \\"A Stranger‚Äôs Touch: Effects of Accidental Interpersonal Touch on Consumer Evaluations and Shopping Time\\", Journal of Consumer Research, 39 (June), 174-184. The space must be specially-tailored to the kind of product being sold in that space; for example, a bookstore requires many large shelving units to accommodate small products that can be arranged categorically while a clothing store requires more open space to fully display product.\\"Luxury retail design and atmosphere\\", Luxury fashion branding: trends, tactics, techniques by Uch√© Okonkwo, Palgrave Macmillan, 2007, Pg. 78\\"Building type basics for retail and mixed-use facilities\\" by Stephen A.

The storefront must act as a billboard for the store, often employing large display windows that allow shoppers to see into the space and the product inside. In the case of a retail chain, the individual spaces must be unified in their design.\\"Boutiques and other retail spaces: the architecture of seduction\\" by Leontine de Wit, Taylor & Francis US, 2007 History Retail design first began to grow in the middle of the 19th century, with stores such as Bon Marche and Printemps in Paris, \\"followed by Marshall Fields in Chicago, Selfridges in London and Macy's in New York.\\" These early retail design stores were swiftly continued with an innovation called the chain store. The first known chain department stores were established in Belgium in 1868,LouisDewis.com Le Pantheon de L'Industrie, Paris, 1891, Page 20 when Isidore, Benjamin and Modeste Dewachter incorporated Dewachter fr√®res (Dewachter Brothers) selling ready-to-wear clothing for men and children and specialty clothing such as riding apparel and beachwear.Annexes to the Belgian Monitor of 1875. Acts, Extracts of Acts, Minutes and Documents relating to Corporations, Book #3, Page 67 The firm opened with four locationsThe French Wikipedia site reports that Dewachter fr√®res opened in La Louvi√®re in 1865, but provides no reference. and, by 1904, Maison Dewachter (House of Dewachter) had stores in 20 cities and towns in Belgium and France, with multiple stores in some cities.Maison Dewachter Li√®ge 1891 letterheadMaison Dewachter Bordeaux 1904 letterhead listing 20 cities and towns and three stores in Bordeaux itself Isidore's eldest son, Louis Dewachter, managed the chain at its peak and also became an internationally known landscape artist, painting under the pseudonym Louis Dewis. The first retail chain store in the United States was opened in the early 20th century by Frank Winfield Woolworth, which quickly became a franchise across the US. Other chain stores began growing in places like the UK a decade or so later, with stores like Boots. After World War II, a new type of retail design building known as the shopping centre came into being. This type of building took two different paths in comparison between the US and Europe. Shopping centres began being built out of town within the United States to benefit the suburban family, while Europe began putting shopping centres in the middle of town. The first shopping centre in the Netherlands was built in the 1950s, as retail design ideas began spreading east.\\"Retail Design\\", Design: the key concepts by Catherine McDermott, Psychology Press, 2007, Pg. 195 The next evolution of retail design was the creation of the boutique in the 1960s, which emphasized retail design run by individuals. Some of the earliest examples of boutiques are the Biba boutique created by Barbara Hulanicki and the Habitat line of stores made by Terence Conran. The rise of the boutique was followed, in the next two decades, with an overall increase in consumer spending across the developed world. This rise made retail design shift to compensate for increased customers and alternative focuses. Many retail design stores redesigned themselves over the period to keep up with changing consumer tastes. These changes resulted on one side with the creation of multiple \\"expensive, one-off designer shops\\" catering to specific fashion designers and retailers. The rise of the internet and internet retailing in the latter part of the 20th century and into the 21st century saw another change in retail design to compensate. Many different sectors not related to the internet reached out to retail design and its practices to lure online shoppers back to physical shops, where retail design can be properly utilized. Usage Role A retail designer must create a thematic experience for the consumer, by using spatial cues to entertain as well as entice the consumer to purchase goods and interact with the space.*Lopez, M. J., 2003. \\"Retail Store Planning And Design Manual\\". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.1Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. \\"Designing to Sell\\". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.9 The success of their designs are not measured by design critics but rather the records of the store which compare amount of foot traffic against the overall productivity. Retail designers have an acute awareness that the store and their designs are the background to the merchandise and are only there to represent and create the best possible environment in which to reflect the merchandise to the target consumer group.*Lopez, M. J., 2003. \\"Retail Store Planning And Design Manual\\". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.4 Design elements Since the evolution of retail design and its impact on productivity have become clear, a series of standardisations in the techniques and design qualities has been determined. These standardisations range from alterations to the perspective of the structure of the space, entrances, circulation systems, atmospheric qualities (light and sound) and materiality. By exploring these standardisations in retail design the consumer will be given a thematic experience that entices them to purchase the merchandise. It is also important to acknowledge that a retail space must combine both permanent and non permanent features, that allow it to change as the needs of the consumer and merchandise change (e.g. per season).Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. \\"Designing to Sell\\". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.23Curtis, E. and Watson, H., 2007. \\"Fashion Retail\\". 2nd ed. West Sussex, England: John Wiley and Sons Ltd. p.12 The structure of retail space creates the constraints of the overall design; often the spaces already exist, and have had many prior uses. It is at this stage that logistics must be determined, structural features like columns, stairways, ceiling height, windows and emergency exists all must be factored into the final design. In retail one hundred percent of the space must be utilised and have a purpose.Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. \\"Designing to Sell\\". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.15-17 The floor plan creates the circulation which then directly controls the direction of the traffic flow based on the studied psychology of consumer movement pattern within a retail space. Circulation is important because it ensures that the consumer moves through the store from front to back, guiding them to important displays and in the end to the cashier.Israel, L.J., 1994. \\"Store Planning/ Design\\". United States of America: John Wiley & sons, INC. There are six basic store layouts and circulation plans that all provide a different experience: # Straight plan: this plan divides transitional areas from one part of the store to the other by using walls to display merchandise. It also leads the consumer to the back of the store. This design can be used for a variety of stores ranging from pharmacies to apparel.Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. \\"Designing to Sell\\". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.6 # Pathway plan: is most suitable for large stores that are single level. In this plan there is a path that is unobstructed by shop fixtures, this smoothly guides the consumer through to the back of the store. This is well suited for apparel department stores, as the clothes will be easily accessible. # Diagonal plan: uses perimeter design which cause angular traffic flow. The cashier is in a central location and easily accessible. This plan is most suited for self-service retail. # Curved plan: aims to create an intimate environment that is inviting. In this plan there is an emphasis on the structure of the space including the walls, corners and ceiling this is achieved by making the structure curved and is enhance by circular floor fixtures. Although this is a more expensive layout it is more suited to smaller spaces like salons and boutiques.Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. \\"Designing to Sell\\". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.7 # Varied plan: in this plan attention is drawn to special focus areas, as well as having storage areas that line the wall. This is best suited for footwear and jewellery retail stores. # Geometric plan: uses the racks and the retail floor fixtures to create a geometric floor plan and circulation movement. By lowering parts of the ceiling certain areas can create defined retail spaces. This is well suited for appeal stores. Once the overall structure and circulation of the space has been determined, the atmosphere and thematics of the space must be created through lighting, sound, materials and visual branding. These design elements will cohesively have the greatest impact on the consumer and thus the level of productivity that could be achieved. Lighting can have a dramatic impact on the space. It needs to be functional but also complement the merchandise as well as emphasize key points throughout the store. The lighting should be layered and of a variety of intensities and fixtures. Firstly, examine the natural light and what impact it has in the space. Natural light adds interest and clarity to the space; also consumers also prefer to examine the quality of merchandise in natural light.Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. \\"Designing to Sell\\". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.65-80 If no natural light exists, a sky light can be used to introduce it to the retail space. The lighting of the ceiling and roof is the next thing to consider. This lighting should wash the structural features while creating vectors that direct the consumer to key merchandise selling areas. The next layer should emphasize the selling areas. These lights should be direct but not too bright and harsh. Poor lighting can cause eye strain and an uncomfortable experience for the consumer. To minimize the possibility of eye strain, the ratio of luminance should decrease between merchandise selling areas. The next layer will complement and bring focus onto the merchandise; this lighting should be flattering for the merchandise and consumer. The final layer is to install functional lighting such as clear exit signs.*Lopez, M. J., 2003. \\"Retail Store Planning And Design Manual\\". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.147-167Israel, L.J., 1994. \\"Store Planning/ Design\\". United States of America: John Wiley & sons, INC.p.183-191 Ambiance can then be developed within the atmosphere through sound and audio, the music played within the store should reflect what your target market would be drawn to, this would also be developed through the merchandise that is being marketed. In a lingerie store the music should be soft, feminine and romanticized; where in a technology department the music would be more upbeat and more masculine.Curtis, E. and Watson, H., 2007. \\"Fashion Retail\\". 2nd ed. West Sussex, England: John Wiley and Sons Ltd.p.213 Materiality is another key selling tool, the choices made must not only be aesthetically pleasing and persuasive but also functional with a minimal need for maintenance.*Lopez, M. J., 2003. \\"Retail Store Planning And Design Manual\\". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.563-566 Retail spaces are high traffic area and are thus exposed to a lot of wear this means that possible finishes of the materials should be durable. The warmth of a material will make the space more inviting, a floor that is firm and somewhat buoyant will be more comfortable for that consumer to walk on and thus this will allow them to take longer when exploring the store.Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. \\"Designing to Sell\\". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p51-64Israel, L.J., 1994. \\"Store Planning/ Design\\". United States of America: John Wiley & sons, INC.p.160-172 By switching materials throughout the store zones/ areas can be defined, for example by making the path one material and contrast it against another for the selling areas this help to guide the consumer through the store. Colour is also important to consider it must not over power or clash against the merchandise but rather create a complementary background for the merchandise. As merchandise will change seasonally the interior colours should not be trend based but rather have timeless appeal like neutral based colours. Visual branding of the store will ensure a memorable experience for the consumer to take with them once they leave the store ensuring that they will want to return. The key factor is consistency exterior branding and signage should continue into the interior, they should attract, stimulate and dramatise the store. To ensure consistency the font should be consistent with the font size altering.Israel, L.J., 1994. \\"Store Planning/ Design\\". United States of America: John Wiley & sons, INC.p.192 The interior branding should allow the consumer to easily self direct themselves through the store, proper placement of sales signs that will draw consumer in and show exactly where the cashier is located. The branding should reflect what the merchandise is and what the target market would be drawn to.Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. \\"Designing to Sell\\". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.81-94*Lopez, M. J., 2003. \\"Retail Store Planning And Design Manual\\". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.258 Perspective The final element of a well-executed retail space is the staging of the consumer's perspective. It is the role of retail design to have total control of the view that the consumer will have of the retail space. From the exterior of a retail store the consumer should have a clear unobstructed view into the interior.*Lopez, M. J., 2003. \\"Retail Store Planning And Design Manual\\". 2nd ed.

Emil Rieve (June 8, 1892 ‚Äì January 24, 1975)Saxon, \\"Emil Rieve, Unionist, Dies,\\" New York Times, January 26, 1975. was an American labor leader. He was president of the Textile Workers Union of America (TWUA) from 1939 to 1956, a vice president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) from 1939 to 1955, and a vice president of the AFL-CIO from 1955 to 1960. Emil Rieve was born in Poland and moved to Pennsylvania as a child. He left school early and first became a union member at age fifteen, quickly rising within the union hierarchy. He organized his first strike in 1930 in Reading, Pennsylvania. His aggressive drives to unionize the region's textile workers and achieve union recognition led to the Reading Formula of 1933 in negotiating with the National Labor Board, a precedent which resolved large numbers of other labor disputes. Rieve was a major figure in the unsuccessful textile workers strike of 1934. When the Congress of Industrial Organizations formed the following year, Rieve received international recognition for his efforts to avoid a rift with the American Federation of Labor. In 1937 Rieve pioneered a successful sit-down strike of 50,000 textile workers that resulted in wage increases. He became acting chairman of the Textile Workers Organizing Committee in 1938 and organized the Textile Workers Union of America in 1939. The union was quite strong under Rieve's stewardship and he played a role in the merger of the AFL with the CIO in 1952. Early life Rieve was born in ≈ªyrard√≥w County in Congress Poland in 1892 to Fred and Pauline (n√©e Lange) Rieve. The family was Lutheran, and Fred Rieve was a machinist who tended textile machines.Fink, Biographical Dictionary of American Labor, 1984. Rieve attended a local elementary school. But the family emigrated to the United States in 1904, interrupting Rieve's education. The Rieves settled in central Pennsylvania, and Emil found work in a hosiery mill. He married Laura Wosnack in July 1916. They had a son, Harold. Early union career In 1907, at the age of 15, Rieve joined the American Federation of Hosiery Workers (AFHW), a semi- autonomous division of the United Textile Workers of America (UTW), an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor.Galenson, 1960. The division was also variously called the American Federation of Full-Fashioned Hosiery Workers and the Full-Fashioned Hosiery Workers Union. His rise in the union was meteoric: At the age of 22, he was elected a vice president of the AFHW, became the division's president in 1929 at the age of 35, and joined the national UTW executive board in 1934. Organizing and the Reading Formula Rieve was committed to organizing new members in the hosiery industry. In November 1930, Rieve authorized a strike among hosiery workers in the mills around Reading, Pennsylvania.\\"Hosiery Strike Voted,\\" New York Times, November 17, 1930. The strike collapsed after heavy employer opposition. Rieve then tried a new tactic: The union agreed to a 30 percent wage cut in the expectation that non-union mills would lower their wages below the new union level. This would trigger a massive strike, enabling the AFHW to move in and organize the workers. Roughly 3,000 workers, or about a third of the total number in the industry, struck. Rieve purposefully withheld strike aid to the workers in an attempt to increase the radicalism of the workers and raise the demand for a union.\\"Hosiery Wage Cut Voted in Union War,\\" New York Times, September 7, 1931; \\"3,000 Workers Quit on Hosiery Pay Cut,\\" New York Times, September 22, 1931; \\"Union Withholds Hosiery Strike Aid,\\" New York Times, September 24, 1931. But employers were content to idle plants in the depths of the Great Depression, and the strike lingered for nearly a year. Admitting defeat, Rieve signed a new contract in September 1932.\\"Hosiery Workers Return,\\" New York Times, September 3, 1932. Just three months later, Rieve led his division in approving yet another large organizing drive. Again aimed at workers in the Reading area, Rieve declared war \\"against industrial slavery [and] starvation wages\\".\\"Demands Reforms in Textile Mills,\\" New York Times, December 17, 1932. The organizing drive began in the summer of 1933. The employers refused to recognize the union, and 10,000 workers went on strike. On August 10, 1933, the National Labor Board mediated a settlement which established the \\"Reading formula.\\" The \\"Reading formula\\" was a major step forward in the conceptualization of American labor law, for it established the principle of secret-ballot elections as a means of determining union support among workers at a plant.\\"Mediation Board Ends Hosiery Fight,\\" New York Times, August 11, 1933; Morris, The Blue Eagle at Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2004; Schlesinger, The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal: 1933-1935, 1958. 1934 national textile strike By 1934, despite Rieve's organizing drive and conditions favorable to union organizing created by the depression, the UTW still had only 80,000 paying members (making it one of the smaller unions in the AFL).Galenson, The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement, 1960. The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933 had authorized the establishment of \\"industry codes\\" to regulate wages, hours and working conditions in every industry in the United States. But employers not only heavily influenced the writing of the code, they also dominated the board adjudicating alleged violations of the code. The code led to few improvements in the textile industry. For example, when workers won shorter hours, employers made an end- run around the restriction by speeding up work.Irons, Testing the New Deal: The General Textile Strike of 1934 in the American South, 2000; Salmond, The General Textile Strike of 1934: From Maine to Alabama, 2002.Bernstein, The Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933-1941, 1970 (originally published 1969). Newly elected to the UTW executive board, Rieve was one of several national union leaders who pressed for the union to threaten a nationwide strike in order to win improvements in the NIRA code. The strike was a mere threat, as UTW had no resources to undertake a nationwide strike. Nevertheless, the National Recovery Administration agreed to provide UTW leaders with a voice on the code adjudicatory board. UTW agreed to cancel the strike. Local UTW leaders, however, refused to call off the strike. Locals in northern Alabama struck on July 18, and the strike swept through the Deep South. UTW was forced to call a special convention on August 13 to address the crisis. The UTW drew up a list of demands, which mill owners ignored. Nevertheless, the strike enjoyed initial success. In many counties, 80 percent of workers walked out. Nationwide, almost 400,000 textile workers left their jobs, an astonishing number in the middle of the depression. Mill owners and state and local government officials worked together to put down the strike. State and local officials hired hundreds of \\"special deputies\\" to guard plants, prevent strikers from closing plants, protect replacement workers from harassment and intimidation, and (in some cases) to beat strikers and break up picket lines. The governors of Connecticut, Maine, North Carolina, Rhode Island and South Carolina ordered out the National Guard. The governors of Georgia and Rhode Island also declared martial law. In Georgia, the governor ordered the arrest of all picketers and held hundreds in a former World War I prisoner of war camp. Violence also broke out. Three picketers and mill guard were shot to death in Georgia. Six picketers were killed and more than 20 wounded in South Carolina. A picketer was murdered in Rhode Island when National Guardsmen fired into a crowd attempting to storm a rayon knitting mill. After a mere 22 days, the strike was over. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had established a mediation board in the first week of the strike. The board recommended further study, that workers return to work, and that employers rehire workers without discriminating against strikers. With the UTW able to provide staff, financial resources and strike benefits in only a few places and for a small number of workers, the strike collapsed. Employees attempted to return to work, but mill owners refused to rehire the strikers. Although the 1934 textile strike was a major defeat for Rieve and the UTW, the union did sign up thousands of new members and declared victory nonetheless. Other activities Rieve was also active in politics. In 1932, he led a successful push to get the UTW to call for the establishment of a new political party beholden solely to the labor movement. A socialist, Rieve resigned his membership in the Socialist Party of America and supported the new American Labor Party.\\"Labor Party Plan Launched By Union,\\" New York Times, September 17, 1932. Rieve also was a committed industrial unionist. The UTW itself was an amalgamated union, a form of industrial union. Rieve's experiences in attempting to organize new members had convinced him that industrial unionism was the key to building the labor movement. In 1934, Rieve convinced UTW delegates to approve a resolution supporting industrial unionism. This philosophical commitment would prove to be pivotal in Rieve's life. Textile Workers Organizing Committee In 1935, the American labor movement split over the question of craft versus industrial unionism. The Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) formed on November 9, 1935, and UTW president Thomas McMahon was one of the Committee's charter members.Phelan, William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader, 1989.Zieger, The CIO 1935-1955, 1995. Rieve and McMahon refused to surrender their principles. The two leaders secured passage in December 1935 of a UTW executive council resolution supporting the CIO. In July 1936, Rieve and McMahon gained additional support when the UTW convention approved the formation of the CIO and the UTW's membership in the organization. The AFL executive council \\"tried\\" the members of the CIO from July 8 to July 15, 1936, and expelled the UTW and the other CIO member unions on September 5. Rieve, however, continued to hold out an olive branch to the AFL. In September 1936, he won AFHW support for a resolution asking the AFL to reconsider the expulsion of the CIO unions.Stark, \\"Truce Demanded in Labor's Strife,\\" New York Times, September 12, 1936. Rieve was unable to organize many new members. Despite meetings with John Brophy, the CIO's organizing director, the CIO did not consider any major organizing effort in textiles. The UTW's finances were in such poor shape that the union actually cut the number of staff organizers by 20 percent. And despite conditions conducive to organizing, the union established only nine new locals between September 1936 and February 1937. Nevertheless, Rieve became known internationally for his efforts, and was appointed to the national committee of the International Labour Organization. Collective bargaining For most of the next three years, Rieve attempted to fend off a series of attacks on the division's collective bargaining agreements. About a third of the UTW's membership came from the hosiery division in early 1937, and Rieve was in many ways the UTW's true leader. In the spring of 1937, Rieve led 15,000 Pennsylvania hosiery workers out on strike for a new contract. Pioneering use of the sit-down strike, the strikers successfully closed the mills. The strike's success spread until more than 50,000 union workers were on strike. Rieve eventually signed an agreement giving workers wage increases of 8 to 10 percent.\\"15,000 Ready to Open Hosiery Strike Today,\\" New York Times, March 1, 1937; \\"Sues to Evict Strikers,\\" New York Times, April 11, 1937; \\"Hosiery Workers to Get Rise,\\" New York Times, July 15, 1937; \\"Annual Pay Rise of $5,000,000 Is Granted to 30,000 Full-Fashioned Hosiery Workers,\\" New York Times, July 16, 1937. In early 1938, however, Rieve was forced to act against his own union members. The recession of 1937 had led to a significant worsening of economic conditions. Union members in Philadelphia demanded a pay increase. Rieve argued that the union had only managed to stop a wage giveback; there was no possibility of securing a wage increase. Nevertheless, workers at more than 50 hosiery plants in the Philadelphia area struck on March 1, 1938. Rieve declared the strike to be \\"illegal\\" and actively supported employer and government efforts to end the job action. When the new union contract was signed in mid-July, Rieve and the AFHW had successfully resisted employer demands to cut wages but were forced to agree to a contract clause barring strikes and lockouts for the term of the three-year agreement.\\"Union Board Bars Hosiery Wage Cut,\\" New York Times, January 10, 1938; \\"Hosiery Mills Idle in 'Illegal Strike',\\" New York Times, March 1, 1938; \\"Sign Hosiery Pact Outlawing Strikes,\\" New York Times, July 16, 1938. Rieve rose to national prominence through his astute leadership of the AFHW. After passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act in June 1938, Rieve was appointed to a federal committee to determine minimum wages in the textile industry.\\"Board Appointed on Textile Wages,\\" New York Times, September 14, 1938; \\"Picks Hosiery Wage Body,\\" New York Times, February 3, 1939. Formation and leadership of TWOC In February 1937, McMahon resigned the presidency of UTW to take a state government job in Rhode Island. He was succeeded by Francis J. Gorman. Meanwhile, the CIO had achieved sudden and large organizing victories in steel, automobile manufacturing and the rubber industry. The organizing victory in steel had come after the CIO had co-opted the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (the AA), using the long-established but moribund union as a means of legitimizing the CIO's efforts in organizing the steel industry. CIO leaders had forced the AA to become part of a new, centrally-run, and efficient organizing project, the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC). CIO leaders had little confidence in Gorman or the UTW. Gorman had overseen the ill-fated 1934 textile strike. The UTW staff was considered incompetent, and politically behold to McMahon's relatively conservative policies. Rieve coveted the presidency of UTW, and worked to undercut Gorman at every turn‚Äîeven when that meant disagreeing with actions he himself would otherwise support. Worst of all, UTW was practically bankrupt. Only the hosiery and dyers divisions were self-supporting, and Gorman was actually seeking a $5,000 loan from the CIO to keep the national union afloat. From a strategic perspective, UTW was ill-equipped to organize in textiles. Although there were more than 1 million workers in the industry, \\"textiles\\" was actually more than 10 distinct industries. Each had its own markets, technology, and labor force. Workers rarely moved between segments of the industry, for their skills were not normally transferable. More than 6,000 textile firms existed, almost none of them strategic. The geographic spread of the industry encompassed 29 states, with nearly 75 percent of all textile employment in the virulently anti-union Deep South. But Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and a CIO vice president, was adamant that the CIO undertake a comprehensive organizing drive in textiles. Now, two years after the victories in steel and automobiles, Hillman pressured CIO leaders to force the UTW into an agreement similar to that which had created SWOC. On May 9, 1937, the Textile Workers Organizing Committee (TWOC) was formed. Hillman was named the chairman, and Thomas Kennedy of the United Mine Workers its secretary-treasurer. The committee's other five members included Gorman and Rieve. TWOC organized impressive numbers of workers in its first six months. By September 1937, TWOC had organized 215,000 workers, most of them in the Northeast. But the recession of 1937 led to layoffs and sharp drops in TWOC membership. Additionally, Hillman fell critically ill in October 1937. He did not return to the committee's leadership until April 1938, and Rieve (not Thomas) was named the committee's acting chairman. Meanwhile, TWOC opened its organizing drive in the Deep South, but its efforts against the \\"fortress of southern cotton\\" proved fruitless. By the spring of 1939, after 18 months of work, TWOC could count only 27,000 Southern members‚Äîless than 7 percent of the region's textile workers.Daniel, Culture of Misfortune: An Interpretive History of Textile Unionism in the United States, 2001. Formation of TWUA Rieve's tenure as acting chairman saw the beginning of events which would seriously affect the union in the 1950s. The first was Rieve's ejection of the New Bedford Textile Council. The council, a federation of seven textile unions in New Bedford, Massachusetts, had been confronted by an employer demand in January 1938 to cut wages by 12.5 percent. Rather than stay silent and acquiesce in the wage cut, the council formally approved the wage reduction. The action not only angered other New England locals, but undercut TWOC organizing efforts in the region. Determined to uphold the authority of TWOC and concerned that the council's action might spark a revolt by other New England local unions, Rieve revoked the charters of the seven locals. In late 1938, TWOC also saw a revolt from within. Hillman distrusted Gorman, and clearly favored Rieve as the leader of the union which would emerge once TWOC's organizing drives concluded. Gorman and other disgruntled UTW leaders filed suit against TWOC, claiming that UTW funds had been illegally appropriated by TWOC. A Rhode Island superior court ruled on November 30, 1938, that the TWOC-UTW agreement of March 9 was invalid. Gorman then denounced TWOC and Hillman, and sought to re-affiliate UTW with the AFL. On December 28, 1938, Gorman led a convention of 21 delegates in voting for affiliation with the AFL. The AFL executive council approve the affiliation on February 3, 1939.Gorman was denied the presidency of the reaffiliated union, because AFL president William Green told him he must be penalized for agreeing to lead the union out of the AFL in the first place. Hillman and the TWOC leadership branded Gorman a traitor and replaced him with George Baldanzi, president of the UTW's dyers division. Realizing that the March 9 agreement might not survive court scrutiny, Hillman, Rieve and Baldanzi called a convention of UTW and TWOC locals for May 15, 1939. The convention voted to merge the two organizations into a new union, the Textile Workers Union of America (TWUA). Rieve was elected president, and Baldanzi vice president. Both elections were unanimous.\\"T.W.O.C. Will Meet Today for Merger,\\" New York Times, May 15, 1939; \\"C.I.O. Merger Forms Big Textile Union,\\" New York Times, May 16, 1939. TWUA presidency Emil Rieve's tenure as president of the TWUA saw the union's prestige and importance soar during World War II and falter in the 1950s. The union's decline in the 1960s finally led Rieve to retire. Rieve was elected a vice president of the CIO in 1939 after his election as TWUA president. In 1940, Rieve established a Southern organizing committee and pushed the union deeper into politics. With himself as the head of the organizing project, the union organized Marshall Field's, Lane Cotton and the Erwin Cotton Mills‚Äîthe latter the first of the \\"big four\\" North Carolina cotton mills to be organized. Rieve also kept the union politically active, making the TWUA one of the first labor organizations to endorse Franklin D. Roosevelt for president for reelection in 1940. But in May 1941, the New Bedford Textile Council affiliated with the AFL's UTW, providing the rump union with a significant boost. Soon the UTW had defeated the TWUA in elections in Massachusetts and Tennessee, and was beginning to challenge the TWUA in the Northeast. In March 1941, President Roosevelt created the National Defense Mediation Board, and appointed Rieve as an alternative labor representative. The board had been created to help resolve collective bargaining disputes in defense production, transportation and raw materials industries. The United Mine Workers were fighting for the closed shop when the board's public and employer representatives voted that the issue should be submitted to binding arbitration. Angry that the board would not order the mine owners to submit to the closed shop, Rieve and the other CIO members of the board resigned.Dubofsky and Van Tine, John L. Lewis: A Biography, 1992; \\"All C.I.O. Men Quit Mediation Board,\\" New York Times, November 14, 1941; \\"President Rejects C.I.O. Resignations,\\" New York Times, November 28, 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, however, the president established the War Labor Board on January 12, 1942, to arbitrate labor disputes and wage settlements. Rieve was appointed as an alternate to the board and served throughout the war. But Rieve and other labor representatives left the body in early 1945 after the public and employer members of the board refused to approve sizeable post-war wage increases for union members.\\"President Names War Labor Body,\\" New York Times, December 14, 1941; \\"CIO May Quit WLB, New Reports Say,\\" New York Times, February 22, 1945. Rieve released the TWUA from its wartime no-strike pledge shortly thereafter.\\"No-Strike Pledge Voided for 100,000.\\" New York Times. February 21, 1945. Although Rieve had purged his union of communists in the mid-1930s, he found himself accused of communist dictatorship in 1944. American Labor Party (ALP) leader Sidney Hillman felt that the 1944 presidential election would be a close one in New York state. Hillman proposed that communists be permitted to play a role in the party, hoping to tip the state toward Roosevelt. ALP leader David Dubinsky felt the communists should be expelled from the ALP. Rieve supported Hillman. Rieve was labeled a communist, and Samuel Baron (the general manager of the TWUA) resigned in protest from the union. Nevertheless, Hillman's proposal won the approval of ALP delegates, and Roosevelt easily carried New York in the general election.\\"ALP Heads Reject Hillman Proposal,\\" New York Times, January 21, 1944; \\"Role of Dictator Held Hillman Aim,\\" New York Times, February 7, 1944. In 1945, Rieve was a member of a CIO delegation to the Soviet Union. He was an ardent anti-communist, however, and strongly criticized the Soviet Union afterward. Two years later, Rieve became one of the first CIO leaders to sign the non-communist oath required by the Taft-Hartley Act.Raskin, \\"Russia Criticized by Office of CIO,\\" New York Times, April 25, 1946; \\"Textile Union to File Non-Communist Oath,\\" New York Times, October 7, 1947. Secession movement In 1948, Rieve expelled his old division, the American Federation of Hosiery Workers, from the TWUA. The division, which had 20,000 members, was a major backer of TWUA executive vice-president George Baldanzi. Baldanzi was strongly critical of Rieve's leadership of the union, and argued that Rieve was not doing enough to organize new members or win contract improvements. When the Hosiery Workers withheld dues in protest of the Rieve administration's policies, Rieve pulled the division's charter.\\"CIO Textile Workers Oust Hosiery Rebels,\\" New York Times, April 23, 1948. The tension between Rieve and Baldanzi worsened over the next two years. In May 1950, Rieve attempted to unseat Baldanzi as executive vice-president. Baldanzi, however, beat back the attempt and retained his seat.Levey, \\"Textile Union Rift has C.I.O. Worried,\\" New York Times, April 8, 1950; \\"C.I.O. Textile Union Split Over High Post,\\" New York Times, April 30, 1950; Fenton, \\"Textile Union Re-elects Baldanzi Oven Opposition of Other Officers,\\" New York Times, May 5, 1950. Rieve then tried to amend the TWUA constitution to remove the executive vice-president from the line of succession if the president should fall ill or die. This attempt, too, was defeated.\\"Textile Union Test Is Won By Baldanzi,\\" New York Times, May 6, 1950. Rieve fired Samuel Baron, a Baldanzi supporter and the regional director of the TWUA in Canada, in March 1951. Baron retained his elected position as a TWUA vice president, however. For the next four months, the TWUA was roiled by the firing, with the Baldanzi faction attempting to overturn Baron's dismissal and drive Rieve from office. In early June, the TWUA executive council upheld Rieve's action, albeit by a slim majority.Levey, \\"Factions Embroil C.I.O.

Six weeks later, the Baldanzi faction announced a \\"democracy movement\\" within the TWUA and submitted a full slate of candidates to challenge Rieve for leadership of the union.\\"Anti-Rieve Faction Confers Here Today,\\" Associated Press, July 21, 1951; \\"350 Rieve Foes Plan for T.W.U. Changes,\\" Associated Press, July 22, 1951; \\"Democracy Is Union Issue,\\" Associated Press, July 23, 1951. In August 1951, the AFHWA re-affiliated with the American Federation of Labor.\\"Hosiery Union in A.F.L.,\\" New York Times, August 10, 1951. On April 30, 1952, TWUA delegates re-elected Rieve as president of the union. The vote was 1,223 to 720, although most observers claimed this was a startlingly close election given Rieve's near-total control over the union. The convention was a contentious one. Delegates engaged in heated debate, with many exchanges devolving into shouting matches. Rieve was forced to alter a number of his policy decisions in order to win delegate support. On the last day of the convention, Rieve fulfilled one such pledge by announcing that he was resigning from the Wage Stabilization Board in the midst of a major dispute over steelworker wages in order to devote more time to union business and less to government and other duties.\\"Textile Workers in Stormy Session,\\" New York Times, May 1, 1952; \\"Rieve Holds Rule of Textile Union,\\" Associated Press, May 2, 1952; \\"C.I.O. Textile Head Quits Wage Board,\\" New York Times, May 3, 1952. Baldanzi, no longer an office-holder in the TWUA, announced he had been hired as an organizer with the American Federation of Labor and would be working with the TWUA's arch-rival, the United Textile Workers. He called for disaffected TWUA locals to follow him into the AFL. A number of local TWUA union presidents and leaders followed him into the UTW as organizers.\\"Defeated in C.I.O., Switches to A.F.L.,\\" Associated Press, May 16, 1952. Over the next several months, nearly 40 TWUA locals representing 20,000 members‚Äîabout 2 percent of the union's membership‚Äîattempted to disaffiliate from the national union and join the AFL. The secession movement was a national one, involving locals in Canada, Maine, the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic states. Rieve accused Baldanzi and the dissident locals of dual unionism. Rieve induced CIO president Philip Murray to threaten wholesale raiding of AFL unions if the UTW accepted the breakaway locals into that union. Rieve suspended local officials, trusteed local unions, impounded local union funds and padlocked local union offices, and sent national staff into wavering locals to shore up support for the TWUA. By August, more than 50,000 TWUA members had left the union for the UTW. But Rieve's actions blunted the secession movement. High- level talks between AFL and CIO leaders eventually put a stop to the raids.\\"C.I.O. Acts to Bar Defections to A.F.L.,\\" Associated Press, May 17, 1952; \\"Six Textile Locals Quit C.I.O. for A.F.L.,\\" Associated Press, May 18, 1952; \\"C.I.O.

The crisis severely weakened Rieve's political position within the union, and led to collective bargaining difficulties. Membership losses were particularly high in the South and Canada. Although most of Rieve's political opponents had left the TWUA for the UTW, the secession movement led many of the remaining members to question Rieve's leadership of the union. The union's finances were significant affected by the disaffiliations, forcing members to raise dues to cover a budget shortfall. Rieve claimed that only 12,500 members had disaffiliated, but admitted that the union's membership had fallen by 400,000 as it defended itself from raids rather than organized new members.Stetson, \\"Rieve Lists Woes of Textile Union,\\" New York Times, May 4, 1952. The secession movement in the TWUA in 1952 aided in the merger between the AFL and CIO in 1955. Both Philip Murray and William Green had died in November 1952. The sudden outbreak of raiding deeply alarmed their successors, Walter Reuther and George Meany. The dissension within the TWUA led to a series of \\"no-raid\\" pacts between the AFL and CIO, agreements which helped pave the way for eventual merger of the two labor federations. Rieve played an important role in the AFL-CIO merger talks, pushing for merger as a solution to raiding and serving on various merger committees.Goldberg, AFL-CIO: Labor United, 1956; Stetson, \\"C.I.O. Union Backs Textile Raid Pact,\\" New York Times, May 8, 1954. Other activities After the merger of the AFL and CIO, Rieve was elected a vice president of the merged labor federation. As Rieve's position within the TWUA deteriorated, however, he became nationally-known for a pushing a variety of causes. He stridently attacked the Taft-Hartley Act, and declared that the law had permitted Southern textile executives to engage in a \\"widespread conspiracy\\" to destroy the union's Southern locals.\\"War on Union Laid to Textile Group,\\" United Press International, April 27, 1952; \\"Taft Law Changes Urged,\\" United Press International, April 17, 1953; Loftus, \\"Union Scores Bias Despite South's Plea,\\" New York Times, May 19, 1956. He was a vocal and extremely critical opponent of President Dwight Eisenhower, and acted as the AFL-CIO's point man against the president while Meany and other leaders muted their criticism. Despite public disavowals of his extreme attacks on the administration, AFL-CIO leaders privately supported his actions and in 1955 he was named to an AFL-CIO committee on economic policy.Stetson, \\"President Scored by Textile Union,\\" New York Times, May 3, 1954; \\"Democrats Told Not to Ape G.O.P.,\\" New York Times, May 15, 1956; \\"A.F.L.-C.I.O Unit Named,\\" New York Times, December 30, 1955. Rieve continued to play a role in international affairs as well. When Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev visited the U.S. for 13 days in September 1959, Rieve was a member of an AFL-CIO delegation which met with Khrushchev for three and a half hours in a closed-door session. He excoriated Soviet labor union officials for being puppets of the Communist regime and attacked Khrushchev as a dictator and war-monger.Raskin, \\"Premier and Labor Men Find Views Poles Apart,\\" New York Times, September 21, 1959. Retirement and death Faced with rapidly declining membership, the 63-year- old Rieve retired as TWUA president at the union's ninth biennial convention in 1956. However, he continued to serve on the union's executive board as chairman until 1960. He was named \\"president emeritus\\" and given a lifetime annuity of $15,000 a year.\\"Textile Workers Head to Quit Post in May,\\" New York Times, March 13, 1956; \\"Textile Union Elects,\\" New York Times, May 18, 1956; \\"Union Gives Rieve $15,000 Annually,\\" New York Times, June 3, 1960. Rieve was forced to retire from the TWUA executive board in 1964. During a speech at the union's biennial convention, Rieve blasted the union's leadership for allowing the membership to fall to a mere 127,000 and for failing to organize non-union plants. Rieve retired as a vice president of the AFL-CIO after losing his TWUA office. Although Rieve had pushed for his successor, William Pollock, to be elected to the AFL-CIO executive council, Reuther supported Ralph Helstein, the president of the United Packinghouse, Food and Allied Workers.Jones, \\"A.F.L.-C.I.O. Selects Meany's Council Choices,\\" New York Times, December 15, 1965. After his forced retirement, Rieve retired to Florida, where he lived quietly. Emil Rieve died of heart failure at his home in Lauderhill, Florida, on January 24, 1975. Notes References *\\"A.F.L.

Written by series creator Hart Hanson and directed by Tony Wharmby, the episode was first aired on August 30, 2006 on the FOX Network. The plot features the investigation of FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (played by David Boreanaz) and Dr. Temperance Brennan (played by Emily Deschanel) into the deaths of a U.S. senator and an ex-basketball player. The episode also introduces a new main character, Dr. Camille Saroyan (played by Tamara Taylor), who is Brennan's new superior. Summary As Special Agent Booth drives Dr. Brennan to the crime scene, they discuss Brennan's vacation and her decision to keep looking for her father, despite his warning (in \\"The Woman in Limbo\\"). They arrive at the crime scene, where a train has derailed after crashing into a parked car on the tracks. A prominent senator was killed and an ex-basketball player appears to have been at the wheel of the car. Booth introduces Brennan to her new boss, Dr. Camille Saroyan, who has been hired by Dr. Goodman to be the Head of Forensic Division at the Jeffersonian Institute. Brennan's colleagues, Dr. Jack Hodgins and Angela Montenegro, think that she deserves the position as the Head of Forensic Division. Angela notes that Booth and Cam act like they were previously involved. Preliminary examination of the evidence identifies the driver as Warren Lynch, a CEO and ex-basketball player. Soon, it is revealed that Lynch was a heroin addict, and that he had died several hours before his car was placed in front of the train. However, after Zack's cranial reconstruction, Angela does a facial reconstruction that proves the driver not to be Warren Lynch. Booth and Brennan find Lynch comatose in a hospital. As they investigate further, it becomes clear that he and his shady private investigator, Rick Turco, were involved in the plot from the start, to win hundreds of millions of dollars from betting that the shares of his company would plummet. Meanwhile, the man who murdered Brennan's mother is killed in prison by a maniac who murdered his entire family. When Brennan finds out her father ordered the hit on his wife's murderer, Brennan begins to question whether he is a good man, and whether she should continue looking for him. When Brennan finally gives in to Booth's idea of talking to her mother and laying flowers at her grave, she finds that her father had visited the grave, and still cares deeply for his wife. Music The episode featured the following music:Bones music season 2 * The Greatest - Cat Power * Be Here Now - Ray LaMontagne Conception The original idea for the premiere episode of Season 2 was of \\"an assassin targeting FBI agents\\". When the writers presented the idea to the studio, the executives suggested that they could create a more dramatic scenario and the idea of a train wreck was born. Hart Hanson, the writer of the episode, expanded the plot to include his ideas of \\"high-powered CEO‚Äôs manipulating the stock market to earn millions\\", which were brought about from his experience in working on the Canadian television show, Traders.

She was ordained as deacon and probationary member of the North Texas Conference in 1983 and as elder and full member of the North Texas Conference in 1988. She received national recognition for her preaching, especially to youth. She was a keynote speaker at Youth2007, the international youth conference of the UMC. She was also recognized regionally as the first female minister in North Texas to demonstrate high membership and worship attendance growth while serving as senior pastor of a large church. She had a notable career record of growth in membership, worship attendance, and people joining by profession of faith. Baskin-Ball died on December 2, 2008, after two years' illness with cancer.http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/120208dnmetballobit.2395a9e7.html Death notice Kathleen Baskin-Ball preaching at Suncreek United Methodist Church (Allen, Texas) in 2007 Churches served *Suncreek United Methodist Church, Senior Pastor, 2001-2008 (Allen, Texas) *Greenland Hills United Methodist Church, Senior Pastor, 1994-2001 (East Dallas, Texas) *Nueva Esperanza United Methodist Church, Pastor, 1989-1994 (West Dallas, Texas) *First United Methodist Church of Denton, Associate Pastor, 1984-1989 (Denton, Texas) *First United Methodist Church of Wichita Falls, Intern Pastor, 1983-1984 (Wichita Falls, Texas) *Holy Covenant United Methodist Church, Associate Pastor, Director of Youth Ministries, 1980-1983 (Carrollton, Texas) Education Baskin-Ball earned a B.A. degree in psychology from North Texas State University in 1981 and an M.Div. degree from Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University in 1986. Ordained ministry milestones In 1981, Baskin-Ball was the first woman in the North Texas Conference of the UMC to enter seminary immediately after completing her undergraduate education. (Between 1965 and 1982, all the women ordained by the North Texas Conference were entering ministry as a second career.) In 2002, Baskin-Ball had a Profession of Faith/Worship Attendance Index value of 17.73. (Worship attendance: 440, Profession of Faith: 78) This index denotes how many persons joined by profession of faith for every 100 persons in worship each week. This is the highest value ever recorded for a female minister serving a large United Methodist church. In 2003, Baskin-Ball was the first North Texas Conference female minister serving a local church appointment to be elected as a Delegate to General Conference. (This election was for the 2004 General Conference.) In 2004, Baskin-Ball was the first female minister in North Texas to serve as the senior pastor of a church with average annual attendance of 500 or more. This occurred at Suncreek United Methodist Church in Allen. Through 2007, Baskin-Ball had a total cumulative average annual worship attendance gain of 548 persons for her three appointments as Sr. Pastor (Nueva Esparanza ‚Äì 81, Greenland Hills UMC ‚Äì 168 and Suncreek UMC ‚Äì 299). This appears to be the highest gain for any female minister in the history of the United Methodist Church and the first to break the 500 person per week gain mark. (Gains in worship attendance are calculated by taking the final or most recent full year that a pastor served a church and subtracting the church's worship attendance for the year prior to their appointment.) In 2007, Baskin- Ball was the first female minister in the 140-year history of the North Texas Conference of the United Methodist Church to be elected to lead the conference's clergy delegation to the General and Jurisdictional Conferences. By mid-2008, membership at the three churches Baskin-Ball has served as senior pastor had grown by a total of more than 1500 people during her tenure. Every church at least approximately doubled in size. Membership at Suncreek UMC had tripled at the end of her sixth year of service at the church. She has done this despite being appointed as Senior Pastor to relatively small churches (0, 301, and 469 members). The membership gain of 1134 persons at Suncreek through November 2008 represents the highest gain ever achieved by a female minister at one church in the United Methodist Church. (She was the first female UMC minister to reach the 1000 member growth mark at one church.) Preaching Baskin-Ball preached at the Children's Ministries Forum '08, the United Methodist Church's three-day national children's ministries conference. Baskin-Ball was a keynote speaker at Youth2007, the \\"Youth Gathering of The United Methodist Church\\", a four-day international youth conference. In 2005, Baskin-Ball preached at SpiLiRa, a Spiritual Life Rally for youth that was sponsored by the South Central Jurisdiction of the UMC (8 state region). Baskin-Ball has preached at several large conference youth events, including events in the Texas and Central Texas Conferences. She was the featured preacher at the 21st Annual Youth Rally in the Peninsula-Delaware Conference in early 2008 that included about 5,000 youth and adults. Baskin-Ball has preached at a number of gatherings for youth workers including Perkins School of Youth Ministry. Baskin-Ball was the preacher/speaker for the 2008 Hopkins Lectures at First UMC Denton, TX. She was a Rejebian Lecturer at Highland Park UMC (Dallas, TX). In 2007, Baskin-Ball received the Award of Excellence in Word and Worship. It was presented by Lovers Lane United Methodist Church. (See links to video of sermons in External Links listing below.) Honors Baskin-Ball was elected as Chair of the Ministry and Higher Education Legislation Committee for the 2008 General Conference of the United Methodist Church. Baskin-Ball was named Best Pastor in Collin County in the 2006 Reader's Choice Awards sponsored by Star Community Newspapers. Other activities In mid-1989, Baskin-Ball was appointed to start a new Hispanic church in West Dallas. The location was a very impoverished neighborhood that the Dallas Morning News called one of the poorest in the nation with \\"adjusted per capita income\\" less than \\"poverty-stricken Mexico.\\" She knew little Spanish so she took an intensive 5-week Spanish course in Cuernavaca, Mexico. She lived in the community and went door to door to start the church. A vibrant multi-ethnic congregation was formed with predominately Hispanic and African American members. Rev.

It was developed by BELMA (BZE BELMA S.A.) with its partner Military Institute of Engineer Technology. The MPB consists of a metal cylinder filled with explosives, mounted horizontally in an adjustable frame. The mine is intended to be hidden from direct view of the intended target, off to the side of a probable vehicle route, usually a road, to attack the weaker armour on the sides and rear of a vehicle. The mine can be triggered by either a contact fuze (MPB-ZK variant) or an influence fuze (MPB-ZN variant) based on infra-red and acoustic sensors, and is also fitted with an anti-handling device. When used with the passive infrared fuze, an acoustic sensor detects approaching vehicles and activates the infra-red sensor, which triggers the mine at an optimal moment as the target passes. The mine can be programmed to self- destruct after either 1, 10 or 30 days have passed. The mine uses the Misznay‚ÄìSchardin effect to project an explosively formed projectile to an effective range of roughly 50 meters, where it can penetrate up to 100 millimeters of rolled homogeneous armour (RHA) plate. The energy carried by the projectile is large enough that it can often significantly damage a vehicle that it hits.

She then lived and taught at Yuendumu, Amoonguna, Alice Springs, Darwin, Jabiru and was Principal of all three NT Area Schools (at Jabiru in Kakadu, Alyangula on Groote Eylandt and Batchelor). These moves were important for the direction of her work. Her first book, In My Husband's Country, was a clear and deft response to country in a way that is peculiarly Territorian, as is her involvement in cross-art performances of poetry, dance ritual, and textiles. In 1992 she won the Northern Territory Red Earth Literary Award.

Medical attention should be sought immediately if an allergic reaction is suspected. An allergic reaction will not occur on the first exposure to a substance. The first exposure allows the body to create antibodies and memory lymphocyte cells for the antigen. However, drugs often contain many different substances, including dyes, which could cause allergic reactions. This can cause an allergic reaction on the first administration of a drug. For example, a person who developed an allergy to a red dye will be allergic to any new drug which contains that red dye. A drug allergy is different from an intolerance. A drug intolerance, which is often a milder, non-immune-mediated reaction, does not depend on prior exposure. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of drug hypersensitivity reactions can be similar to non-allergic adverse effects. Common symptoms include: * Hives * Itching * Rash * Fever * Facial swelling * Shortness of breath due to the short-term constriction of lung airways or longer-term damage to lung tissue * Anaphylaxis, a life-threatening drug reaction (produces most of these symptoms as well as low blood pressure) * Cardiac symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest palpitations, light headedness, and syncope due to a rare drug-induced reaction, eosinophilic myocarditis Causes Some classes of medications have a higher rate of drug reactions than others. These include antiepileptics, antibiotics, antiretrovirals, NSAIDs, and general and local anesthetics. Risk factors Risk factors for drug allergies can be attributed to the drug itself or the characteristics of the patient. Drug-specific risk factors include the dose, route of administration, duration of treatment, repetitive exposure to the drug, and concurrent illnesses. Host risk factors include age, sex, atopy, specific genetic polymorphisms, and inherent predisposition to react to multiple unrelated drugs (multiple drug allergy syndrome). A drug allergy is more likely to develop with large doses and extended exposure. People with immunological diseases, such as HIV and cystic fibrosis, or infection with EBV, CMV, or HHV6, are more susceptible to drug hypersensitivity reactions. These conditions lower the threshold for T-cell stimulation. Mechanisms There are two broad mechanisms for a drug allergy to occur: IgE or non-IgE mediated. In IgE-mediated reactions, also known as immunoglobulin E mediated reactions, drug allergens bind to IgE antibodies, which are attached to mast cells and basophils, resulting in IgE cross-linking, cell activation and release of preformed and newly formed mediators. Most drugs do not cause reactions in themselves, but by the formation of haptens.  Types  Drug allergies or hypersensitivities can be broadly divided into two types: immediate reactions and delayed reactions. Immediate reactions take place within an hour of administration and are IgE mediated, while delayed reactions take place hours to weeks after administration and are T-cell mediated. The first category is mostly mediated through specific IgE, whereas the latter is specifically T-cell mediated.

The party is opposed to French centralizing Jacobin attitudes and favours decentralization, fiscal and political autonomy for Alsace, and bilingualism in the region (Alsatian and French). It is often compared to the stronger Lega Nord in Italy. In the 2004 French regional elections, the party won 9.42% of the vote but failed to win seats. It had 9 seats in the Alsace regional council from 1998 to 2004 due to an electoral system more favourable to smaller parties than the current system, adopted in 2003.

Around 13,100 American paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions made night parachute drops early on D-Day, June 6, followed by 3,937 glider troops flown in by day. Includes pathfinders. All statistics, except where otherwise noted, are derived from this source, which referenced Warren. As the opening maneuver of Operation Neptune (the assault operation for Overlord) the two American airborne divisions were delivered to the continent in two parachute and six glider missions. The divisions were part of the U.S. VII Corps and provided it with support in its mission of capturing Cherbourg as soon as possible to provide the Allies with a port of supply. The specific missions of the two airborne divisions were to block approaches into the vicinity of the amphibious landing at Utah Beach, to capture causeway exits off the beaches, and to establish crossings over the Douve River at Carentan to assist the U.S. V Corps in merging the two U.S. beachheads. The assault did not succeed in blocking the approaches to Utah for three days. Numerous factors played a part, most of which dealt with excessive scattering of the drops. Despite this, German forces were unable to exploit the chaos. Many German units made a tenacious defense of their strong-points, but all were systematically defeated within the week. Background [Except where footnoted, information in this article is from the USAF official history: Warren, Airborne Operations in World War II, European Theater] Plans and revisions Plans for the invasion of Normandy went through several preliminary phases throughout 1943, during which the Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) allocated 13¬Ω U.S. troop carrier groups to an undefined airborne assault. The actual size, objectives, and details of the plan were not drawn up until after General Dwight D. Eisenhower became Supreme Allied Commander in January 1944. In mid-February Eisenhower received word from Headquarters U.S. Army Air Forces that the TO&E; of the C-47 Skytrain groups would be increased from 52 to 64 aircraft (plus nine spares) by April 1 to meet his requirements. At the same time the commander of the U.S. First Army, Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, won approval of a plan to land two airborne divisions on the Cotentin Peninsula, one to seize the beach causeways and block the eastern half at Carentan from German reinforcements, the other to block the western corridor at La Haye-du-Puits in a second lift. The exposed and perilous nature of the La Haye de Puits mission was assigned to the veteran 82nd Airborne Division (\\"The All-Americans\\"), commanded by Major General Matthew Ridgway, while the causeway mission was given to the untested 101st Airborne Division (\\"The Screaming Eagles\\"), which received a new commander in March, Brigadier General Maxwell D. Taylor, formerly the commander of the 82nd Airborne Division Artillery who had also been temporary assistant division commander (ADC) of the 82nd Airborne Division, replacing Major General William C. Lee, who suffered a heart attack and returned to the United States. Bradley insisted that 75 percent of the airborne assault be delivered by gliders for concentration of forces. Because it would be unsupported by naval and corps artillery, Ridgway, commanding the 82nd Airborne Division, also wanted a glider assault to deliver his organic artillery. The use of gliders was planned until April 18, when tests under realistic conditions resulted in excessive accidents and destruction of many gliders. On April 28 the plan was changed; the entire assault force would be inserted by parachute drop at night in one lift, with gliders providing reinforcement during the day. The Germans, who had neglected to fortify Normandy, began constructing defenses and obstacles against airborne assault in the Cotentin, including specifically the planned drop zones of the 82nd Airborne Division. At first no change in plans were made, but when significant German forces were moved into the Cotentin in mid-May, the drop zones of the 82nd Airborne Division were relocated, even though detailed plans had already been formulated and training had proceeded based on them. Just ten days before D-Day, a compromise was reached. Because of the heavier German presence, Bradley, the First Army commander, wanted the 82nd Airborne Division landed close to the 101st Airborne Division for mutual support if needed. Major General J. Lawton Collins, commanding the VII Corps, however, wanted the drops made west of the Merderet to seize a bridgehead. On May 27 the drop zones were relocated east of Le Haye-du-Puits along both sides of the Merderet. The 101st Airborne Division's 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR), which had originally been given the task of capturing Sainte-M√®re-√âglise, was shifted to protect the Carentan flank, and the capture of Sainte-M√®re-√âglise was assigned to the veteran 505th PIR of the 82nd Airborne Division. For the troop carriers, experiences in the Allied invasion of Sicily the previous year had dictated a route that avoided Allied naval forces and German anti-aircraft defenses along the eastern shore of the Cotentin. On April 12 a route was approved that would depart England at Portland Bill, fly at low altitude southwest over water, then turn 90 degrees to the southeast and come in \\"by the back door\\" over the western coast. At the initial point the 82nd Airborne Division would continue straight to La Haye-du-Puits, and the 101st Airborne Division would make a small left turn and fly to Utah Beach. The plan called for a right turn after drops and a return on the reciprocal route. However the change in drop zones on May 27 and the increased size of German defenses made the risk to the planes from ground fire much greater, and the routes were modified so that the 101st Airborne Division would fly a more southerly ingress route along the Douve River (which would also provide a better visual landmark at night for the inexperienced troop carrier pilots). Over the reluctance of the naval commanders, exit routes from the drop zones were changed to fly over Utah Beach, then northward in a wide \\"safety corridor\\", then northwest above Cherbourg. As late as May 31 routes for the glider missions were changed to avoid overflying the peninsula in daylight. Preparations IX Troop Carrier Command (TCC) was formed in October 1943 to carry out the airborne assault mission in the invasion. Brigadier General Paul T. Williams, who had commanded the troop carrier operations in Sicily and Italy, took command in February 1944. The TCC command and staff officers were an excellent mix of combat veterans from those earlier assaults, and a few key officers were held over for continuity. The 14 groups assigned to IX TCC were a mixture of experience. Four had seen significant combat in the Twelfth Air Force. Four had no combat experience but had trained together for more than a year in the United States. Four others had been in existence less than nine months and arrived in the United Kingdom one month after training began. One had experience only as a transport (cargo carrying) group and the last had been recently formed. Joint training with airborne troops and an emphasis on night formation flying began at the start of March. The veteran 52nd Troop Carrier Wing (TCW), wedded to the 82nd Airborne, progressed rapidly and by the end of April had completed several successful night drops. The 53rd TCW, working with the 101st, also progressed well (although one practice mission on April 4 in poor visibility resulted in a badly scattered drop) but two of its groups concentrated on glider missions. By the end of April joint training with both airborne divisions ceased when Taylor and Ridgway deemed that their units had jumped enough. The 50th TCW did not begin training until April 3 and progressed more slowly, then was hampered when the troops ceased jumping. A divisional night jump exercise for the 101st Airborne scheduled for May 7, Exercise Eagle, was postponed to May 11-May 12 and became a dress rehearsal for both divisions. The 52nd TCW, carrying only two token paratroopers on each C-47, performed satisfactorily although the two lead planes of the 316th Troop Carrier Group (TCG) collided in mid-air, killing 14 including the group commander, Col. Burton R. Fleet. The 53rd TCW was judged \\"uniformly successful\\" in its drops. The lesser-trained 50th TCW, however, got lost in haze when its pathfinders failed to turn on their navigation beacons. It continued training till the end of the month with simulated drops in which pathfinders guided them to drop zones. The 315th and 442d Groups, which had never dropped troops until May and were judged the command's \\"weak sisters\\", continued to train almost nightly, dropping paratroopers who had not completed their quota of jumps. Three proficiency tests at the end of the month, making simulated drops, were rated as fully qualified. The inspectors, however, made their judgments without factoring that most of the successful missions had been flown in clear weather. By the end of May 1944, the IX Troop Carrier Command had available 1,207 Douglas C-47 Skytrain troop carrier airplanes and was one-third overstrength, creating a strong reserve. Three quarters of the planes were less than one year old on D-Day, and all were in excellent condition. Engine problems during training had resulted in a high number of aborted sorties, but all had been replaced to eliminate the problem. All mat√©riel requested by commanders in IX TCC, including armor plating, had been received with the exception of self-sealing fuel tanks, which Chief of the Army Air Forces General Henry H. Arnold had personally rejected because of limited supplies. Crew availability exceeded numbers of aircraft, but 40 per cent were recent-arriving crews or individual replacements who had not been present for much of the night formation training. As a result, 20 per cent of the 924 crews committed to the parachute mission on D-Day had minimum night training and fully three-fourths of all crews had never been under fire. Over 2,100 CG-4 Waco gliders had been sent to the United Kingdom, and after attrition during training operations, 1,118 were available for operations, along with 301 Airspeed Horsa gliders received from the British. Trained crews sufficient to pilot 951 gliders were available, and at least five of the troop carrier groups intensively trained for glider missions. C-47 of the 438th TCG marked with invasion stripes. Because of the requirement for absolute radio silence and a study that warned that the thousands of Allied aircraft flying on D-Day would break down the existing system, plans were formulated to mark aircraft including gliders with black-and-white stripes to facilitate aircraft recognition. Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, commander of the Allied Expeditionary Air Force, approved the use of the recognition markings on May 17. For the troop carrier aircraft this was in the form of three white and two black stripes, each two feet (60 cm) wide, around the fuselage behind the exit doors and from front to back on the outer wings. A test exercise was flown by selected aircraft over the invasion fleet on June 1, but to maintain security, orders to paint stripes were not issued until June 3.

The 300 men of the pathfinder companies were organized into teams of 14-18 paratroops each, whose main responsibility would be to deploy the ground beacon of the Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar system, and set out holophane marking lights. The Rebecca, an airborne sender- receiver, indicated on its scope the direction and approximate range of the Eureka, a responsor beacon. The paratroops trained at the school for two months with the troop carrier crews, but although every C-47 in IX TCC had a Rebecca interrogator installed, to keep from jamming the system with hundreds of signals, only flight leads were authorized to use it in the vicinity of the drop zones. Despite many early failures in its employment, the Eureka-Rebecca system had been used with high accuracy in Italy in a night drop of the 82nd Airborne Division to reinforce the U.S. Fifth Army during the Salerno landings, codenamed Operation Avalanche, in September 1943. However, a shortcoming of the system was that within of the ground emitter, the signals merged into a single blip in which both range and bearing were lost. The system was designed to steer large formations of aircraft to within a few miles of a drop zone, at which point the holophane marking lights or other visual markers would guide completion of the drop. Each drop zone (DZ) had a serial of three C-47 aircraft assigned to locate the DZ and drop pathfinder teams, who would mark it. The serials in each wave were to arrive at six- minute intervals. The pathfinder serials were organized in two waves, with those of the 101st Airborne Division arriving a half-hour before the first scheduled assault drop. These would be the first American and possibly the first Allied troops to land in the invasion. The three pathfinder serials of the 82nd Airborne Division were to begin their drops as the final wave of 101st Airborne Division paratroopers landed, thirty minutes ahead of the first 82nd Airborne Division drops. D-Day results General Dwight D. Eisenhower speaking with First lieutenant Wallace C. Strobel and men of Company E, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment on June 5, 1944 at USAAF Greenham Common. The placard around Strobel's neck indicates he is the jumpmaster for chalk 23 of the 438th TCG. Strobel's battalion was the first to drop into Normandy. Efforts of the early wave of pathfinder teams to mark the drop zones were partially ineffective. The first serial, assigned to DZ A, missed its zone and set up a mile away near St. Germain-de-Varreville. The team was unable to get either its amber halophane lights or its Eureka beacon working until the drop was well in progress. Although the second pathfinder serial had a plane ditch in the sea en route, the remainder dropped two teams near DZ C, but most of their marker lights were lost in the ditched airplane. They managed to set up a Eureka beacon just before the assault force arrived but were forced to use a hand held signal light which was not seen by some pilots. The planes assigned to DZ D along the Douve River failed to see their final turning point and flew well past the zone. Returning from an unfamiliar direction, they dropped 10 minutes late and off target. The drop zone was chosen after the 501st PIR's change of mission on May 27 and was in an area identified by the Germans as a likely landing area. Consequently so many Germans were nearby that the pathfinders could not set out their lights and were forced to rely solely on Eureka, which was a poor guide at short range. The pathfinders of the 82nd Airborne Division had similar results. The first serial, bound for DZ O near Sainte-M√®re-√âglise, flew too far north but corrected its error and dropped near its DZ. It made the most effective use of the Eureka beacons and holophane marking lights of any pathfinder team. The planes bound for DZ N south of Sainte-M√®re-√âglise flew their mission accurately and visually identified the zone but still dropped the teams a mile southeast. They landed among troop areas of the German 91st Division and were unable to reach the DZ. The teams assigned to mark DZ T northwest of Sainte- M√®re-√âglise were the only ones dropped with accuracy, and while they deployed both Eureka and BUPS, they were unable to show lights because of the close proximity of German troops. Altogether, four of the six drops zones could not display marking lights. The pathfinder teams assigned to Drop Zones C (101st) and N (82nd) each carried two BUPS beacons. The units for DZ N were intended to guide in the parachute resupply drop scheduled for late on D-Day, but the pair of DZ C were to provide a central orientation point for all the SCR-717 radars to get bearings. However the units were damaged in the drop and provided no assistance. Combat jumps Mission profile Planned airborne drop zones on the Cotentin Peninsula, D-Day, 6 June 1944 Band of Brothers fame) into Normandy. Group commander's aircraft, chalk #1 of serial 11, assigned to Drop Zone C The assault lift (one air transport operation) was divided into two missions, \\"Albany\\" and \\"Boston\\", each with three regiment-sized landings on a drop zone. The drop zones of the 101st were northeast of Carentan and lettered A, C, and D from north to south (Drop Zone B had been that of the 501st PIR before the changes of May 27). Those of the 82nd were west (T and O, from west to east) and southwest (Drop Zone N) of Sainte-M√®re-Eglise. Each parachute infantry regiment (PIR), a unit of approximately 1800 men organized into three battalions, was transported by three or four serials, formations containing 36, 45, or 54 C-47s, and separated from each other by specific time intervals. The planes, sequentially designated within a serial by chalk numbers (literally numbers chalked on the airplanes to aid paratroopers in boarding the correct airplane), were organized into flights of nine aircraft, in a formation pattern called \\"vee of vee's\\" (vee-shaped elements of three planes arranged in a larger vee of three elements), with the flights flying one behind the other. The serials were scheduled over the drop zones at six-minute intervals. The paratroopers were divided into sticks, a plane load of troops numbering 15-18 men. To achieve surprise, the parachute drops were routed to approach Normandy at low altitude from the west. The serials took off beginning at 22:30 on June 5, assembled into formations at wing and command assembly points, and flew south to the departure point, code-named \\"Flatbush\\". There they descended and flew southwest over the English Channel at MSL to remain below German radar coverage. Each flight within a serial was behind the flight ahead. The flights encountered winds that pushed them five minutes ahead of schedule, but the effect was uniform over the entire invasion force and had negligible effect on the timetables. Once over water, all lights except formation lights were turned off, and these were reduced to their lowest practical intensity. Twenty-four minutes out over the channel, the troop carrier stream reached a stationary marker boat code-named \\"Hoboken\\" and carrying a Eureka beacon, where they made a sharp left turn to the southeast and flew between the Channel Islands of Guernsey and Alderney. Weather over the channel was clear; all serials flew their routes precisely and in tight formation as they approached their initial points on the Cotentin coast, where they turned for their respective drop zones. The initial point for the 101st at Portbail, code-named \\"Muleshoe\\", was approximately south of that of the 82d, \\"Peoria\\", near Flamanville. Scattered drops Despite precise execution over the channel, numerous factors encountered over the Cotentin Peninsula disrupted the accuracy of the drops, many encountered in rapid succession or simultaneously. These included: *C-47 configuration, including severe overloading, use of drag-inducing parapacks, and shifting centers of gravity, *a lack of navigators on 60 percent of aircraft, forcing navigation by pilots when formations broke up, *radio silence that prevented warnings when adverse weather was encountered, *a solid cloud bank at penetration altitude (), obscuring the entire western half of the wide peninsula, thinning to broken clouds over the eastern half, *an opaque ground fog over many drop zones, *German antiaircraft fire (\\"flak\\"), *limitations of the Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar system used to guide serials to their drop zones, *emergency usage of Rebecca by numerous lost aircraft, jamming the system, *unmarked or poorly marked drop zones, *drop runs by some C-47s that were above or below the designated drop altitude, or in excess of the drop speed, and *second or third passes over an area searching for drop zones. Flak from German anti-aircraft guns resulted in planes either going under or over their prescribed altitudes. Some of the men who jumped from planes at lower altitudes were injured when they hit the ground because of their chutes not having enough time to slow their descent, while others who jumped from higher altitudes reported a terrifying descent of several minutes watching tracer fire streaking up towards them. Of the 20 serials making up the two missions, nine plunged into the cloud bank and were badly dispersed. Of the six serials which achieved concentrated drops, none flew through the clouds. However the primary factor limiting success of the paratroop units, because it magnified all the errors resulting from the above factors, was the decision to make a massive parachute drop at night, a concept that was not again used in three subsequent large-scale airborne operations. This was further illustrated when the same troop carrier groups flew a second lift later that day with precision and success under heavy fire.Wolfe, Green Light!, 122. First wave: Mission Albany 101st Airborne drop pattern, D-Day, 6 June 1944 Paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division \\"Screaming Eagles\\" jumped first on June 6, between 00:48 and 01:40 British Double Summer Time. 6,928 troops were carried aboard 432 C-47s of mission \\"Albany\\" organized into 10 serials. The first flights, inbound to DZ A, were not surprised by the bad weather, but navigating errors and a lack of Eureka signal caused the 2nd Battalion 502nd PIR to come down on the wrong drop zone. Most of the remainder of the 502nd jumped in a disorganized pattern around the impromptu drop zone set up by the pathfinders near the beach. Two battalion commanders took charge of small groups and accomplished all of their D-Day missions. The division's parachute artillery experienced one of the worst drops of the operation, losing all but one howitzer and most of its troops as casualties. The three serials carrying the 506th PIR were badly dispersed by the clouds, then subjected to intense antiaircraft fire. Even so, 2/3 of the 1st Battalion was dropped accurately on DZ C. The 2nd Battalion, much of which had dropped too far west, fought its way to the Haudienville causeway by mid-afternoon but found that the 4th Division had already seized the exit. The 3rd Battalion of the 501st PIR, also assigned to DZ C, was more scattered, but took over the mission of securing the exits. A small unit reached the Pouppeville exit at 0600 and fought a six- hour battle to secure it, shortly before 4th Division troops arrived to link up. The 501st PIR's serial also encountered severe flak but still made an accurate jump on Drop Zone D. Part of the DZ was covered by pre-registered German fire that inflicted heavy casualties before many troops could get out of their chutes. Among the killed were two of the three battalion commanders and one of their executive officers. A group of 150 troops captured the main objective, the la Barquette lock, by 04:00. A staff officer put together a platoon and achieved another objective by seizing two foot bridges near la Porte at 04:30. The 2nd Battalion landed almost intact on DZ D but in a day- long battle failed to take Saint-C√¥me-du-Mont and destroy the highway bridges over the Douve. The glider battalions of the 101st's 327th Glider Infantry Regiment were delivered by sea and landed across Utah Beach with the 4th Infantry Division. On D-Day its third battalion, the 1st Battalion 401st GIR, landed just after noon and bivouacked near the beach. By the evening of June 7 the other two battalions were assembled near Sainte Marie du Mont. Second wave: Mission Boston 82nd Airborne drop pattern, D-Day, 6 June 1944 The 82nd Airborne's drop, mission \\"Boston\\", began at 01:51. It was also a lift of 10 serials organized in three waves, totaling 6,420 paratroopers carried by 369 C-47s. The C-47s carrying the 505th did not experience the difficulties that had plagued the 101st's drops. Pathfinders on DZ O turned on their Eureka beacons as the first 82nd serial crossed the initial point and lighted holophane markers on all three battalion assembly areas. As a result the 505th enjoyed the most accurate of the D-Day drops, half the regiment dropping on or within a mile of its DZ, and 75 per cent within . The other regiments were more significantly dispersed. The 508th experienced the worst drop of any of the PIRs, with only 25 per cent jumping within a mile of the DZ. Half the regiment dropped east of the Merderet, where it was useless to its original mission.Warren, Airborne Operations, 54. The 507th PIR's pathfinders landed on DZ T, but because of Germans nearby, marker lights could not be turned on. Approximately half landed nearby in grassy swampland along the river. Estimates of drowning casualties vary from \\"a few\\"Warren, Airborne Operations, 55. to \\"scores\\"Wolfe, Green Light!, 119. (against an overall D-Day loss in the division of 156 killed in action), but much equipment was lost and the troops had difficulty assembling. Timely assembly enabled the 505th to accomplish two of its missions on schedule. With the help of a Frenchman who led them into the town, the 3rd Battalion captured Sainte-M√®re-√âglise by 0430 against \\"negligible opposition\\" from German artillerymen.Warren, Airborne Operations, 50-51. The 2nd Battalion established a blocking position on the northern approaches to Sainte-M√®re-√âglise with a single platoon while the rest reinforced the 3rd Battalion when it was counterattacked at mid-morning. The 1st Battalion did not achieve its objectives of capturing bridges over the Merderet at la Fi√®re and Chef-du-Pont, despite the assistance of several hundred troops from the 507th and 508th PIRs. None of the 82nd's objectives of clearing areas west of the Merderet and destroying bridges over the Douve were achieved on D-Day. However one makeshift battalion of the 508th PIR seized a small hill near the Merderet and disrupted German counterattacks on Chef-du- Pont for three days, effectively accomplishing its mission. Two company-sized pockets of the 507th held out behind the German center of resistance at Amfreville until relieved by the seizure of the causeway on June 9. D-Day glider landings Pre-dawn assaults Two pre-dawn glider landings, missions \\"Chicago\\" (101st) and \\"Detroit\\" (82nd), each by 52 CG-4 Waco gliders, landed anti-tank guns and support troops for each division. The missions took off while the parachute landings were in progress and followed them by two hours, landing at about 0400, 2 hours before dawn. Chicago was an unqualified success, with 92 per cent landing within of target. Detroit was disrupted by the same cloud bank that had bedevilled the paratroops and only 62 per cent landed within . Even so, both missions provided heavy weapons that were immediately placed into service. Only eight passengers were killed in the two missions, but one of those was the assistant division commander of the 101st Airborne, Brigadier General Don Pratt. Five gliders in the 82nd's serial, cut loose in the cloud bank, remained missing after a month. Evening reinforcement missions On the evening of D-Day two additional glider operations, mission \\"Keokuk\\" and mission \\"Elmira\\", brought in additional support on 208 gliders. Operating on British Double Summer Time, both arrived and landed before dark. Both missions were heavily escorted by P-38, P-47, and P-51 fighters. Keokuck was a reinforcement mission for the 101st Airborne consisting of a single serial of 32 tugs and gliders that took off beginning at 18:30. It arrived at 20:53, seven minutes early, coming in over Utah Beach to limit exposure to ground fire, into a landing zone clearly marked with yellow panels and green smoke. German forces around Turqueville and Saint C√¥me-du-Mont, on either side of Landing Zone E, held their fire until the gliders were coming down, and while they inflicted some casualties, were too distant to cause much harm. Although only five landed on the LZ itself and most were released early, the Horsa gliders landed without serious damage. Two landed within German lines. The mission is significant as the first Allied daylight glider operation, but was not significant to the success of the 101st Airborne.Warren, Airborne Operations, 66. Elmira was essential to the 82nd Airborne, however, delivering two battalions of glider artillery and 24 howitzers to support the 507th and 508th PIRs west of the Merderet. It consisted of four serials, the first pair to arrive ten minutes after Keokuck, the second pair two hours later at sunset. The first gliders, unaware that the LZ had been moved to Drop Zone O, came under heavy ground fire from German troops who occupied part of Landing Zone W. The C-47s released their gliders for the original LZ, where most delivered their loads intact despite heavy damage. The second wave of mission Elmira arrived at 22:55, and because no other pathfinder aids were operating, they headed for the Eureka beacon on LZ O. That wave too came under severe ground fire as it passed directly over German positions. One serial released early and came down near the German lines, but the second came down on Landing Zone O. Nearly all of both battalions joined the 82nd Airborne by morning, and 15 guns were in operation on June 8.Warren, Airborne Operations, 68-69. Follow-up landing and supply operations 325th Glider Infantry Regiment Two additional glider missions (\\"Galveston\\" and \\"Hackensack\\") were made just after daybreak on June 7, delivering the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment to the 82nd Airborne. The hazards and results of mission Elmira resulted in a route change over the Douve River valley that avoided the heavy ground fire of the evening before, and changed the landing zone to LZ E, that of the 101st Airborne Division. The first mission, Galveston, consisted of two serials carrying the 325th's 1st Battalion and the remainder of the artillery. Consisting of 100 glider-tug combinations, it carried nearly a thousand men, 20 guns, and 40 vehicles and released at 06:55. Small arms fire harried the first serial but did not seriously endanger it. Low releases resulted in a number of accidents and 100 injuries in the 325th (17 fatal). The second serial hit LZ W with accuracy and few injuries. Mission Hackensack, bringing in the remainder of the 325th, released at 08:51. The first serial, carrying all of the 2nd Battalion and most of the 2nd Battalion 401st GIR (the 325th's \\"third battalion\\"), landed by squadrons in four different fields on each side of LZ W, one of which came down through intense fire. 15 troops were killed and 60 wounded, either by ground fire or by accidents caused by ground fire. The last glider serial of 50 Wacos, hauling service troops, 81 mm mortars, and one company of the 401st, made a perfect group release and landed at LZ W with high accuracy and virtually no casualties. By 10:15, all three battalions had assembled and reported in. With 90 per cent of its men present, the 325th GIR became the division reserve at Chef-du-Pont. Airborne resupply Two supply parachute drops, mission \\"Freeport\\" for the 82nd and mission \\"Memphis\\" intended for the 101st, were dropped on June 7. All of these operations came in over Utah Beach but were nonetheless disrupted by small arms fire when they overflew German positions, and virtually none of the 101st's supplies reached the division. Fourteen of the 270 C-47s on the supply drops were lost compared to only seven of the 511 glider tugs shot down. In the week following, six resupply missions were flown on call by the 441st and 436th Troop carrier Groups, with 10 C-47's making parachute drop and 24 towing gliders. This brought the final total of IX Troop Carrier Command sorties during Operation Neptune to 2,166, with 533 of those being glider sorties. Ground combat involving U.S. airborne forces This section summarizes all ground combat in Normandy by the U.S. airborne divisions. The U.S. Army does not designate the point in time in which the airborne assault ended and the divisions that fought it conducted a conventional infantry campaign. After 24 hours, only 2,500 of the 6,000 men in 101st were under the control of division headquarters. The 82nd had consolidated its forces on Sainte-M√®re-√âglise, but significant pockets of troops were isolated west of the Merderet, some of which had to hold out for several days. The dispersal of the American airborne troops, and the nature of the hedgerow terrain, had the effect of confusing the Germans and fragmenting their response. In addition, the Germans' defensive flooding, in the early stages, also helped to protect the Americans' southern flank. The 4th Infantry Division had landed and moved off Utah Beach, with the 8th Infantry surrounding a German battalion on the high ground south of Sainte-M√®re-√âglise, and the 12th and 22nd Infantry moving into line northeast of the town. The biggest anxiety for the airborne commanders was in linking up with the widely scattered forces west of the Merderet. Many continued to roam and fight behind enemy lines for up to 5 days. The Air Force Historical Study on the operation notes that several hundred paratroopers scattered without organization far from the drop zones were \\"quickly mopped up\\", despite their valor and inherent toughness, by small German units that possessed unit cohesion. Most consolidated into small groups, however, rallied by NCOs and officers up to and including battalion commanders, and many were hodgepodges of troopers from different units. Particularly in the areas of the 507th and 508th PIRs, these isolated groupings, while fighting for their own survival, played an important role in the overall clearance of organized German resistance. On June 6, the German 6th Parachute Regiment (FJR6), commanded by Oberst Friedrich August von der Heydte,Ambrose, D-Day, pg. 116 (FJR6) advanced two battalions, I./FJR6 to Sainte-Marie-du-Mont and II./FJR6 to Sainte-M√®re-√âglise, but faced with the overwhelming numbers of the two U.S. divisions, withdrew. I./FJR6 attempted to force its way through U.S. forces half its size along the Douve River but was cut off and captured almost to the man. Nearby, the 506th PIR conducted a reconnaissance-in-force with two understrength battalions to capture Saint- C√¥me-du-Mont but although supported by several tanks, was stopped near Angoville-au-Plain. In the 82nd Airborne's area, a battalion of the 1058th Grenadier Regiment supported by tanks and other armored vehicles counterattacked Sainte-M√®re-√âglise the same morning but were stopped by a reinforced company of M4 Sherman tanks from the 4th Division. The German armor retreated and the infantry was routed with heavy casualties by a coordinated attack of the 2nd Battalion 505th and the 2nd Battalion 8th Infantry. Battle of Carentan, June 8‚Äì12, 1944 101st units maneuvered on June 8 to envelop Saint-C√¥me-du-Mont, pushing back FJR6, and consolidated its lines on June 9. VII Corps gave the division the task of taking Carentan. The 502nd experienced heavy combat on the causeway on June 10. The next day it attacked the town, supported by the 327th GIR attacking from the east. The 506th PIR passed through the exhausted 502nd and attacked into Carentan on June 12, defeating the rear guard left by the German withdrawal. On June 13, German reinforcements arrived, in the form of assault guns, tanks, and infantry of SS-Panzergrenadier-Regiment 37 (SS-PGR 37), 17. SS-Panzergrenadier Division. SS-PGR 37 and III./FJR6 attacked the 101st positions southwest of Carentan. The Germans pushed back the left of the U.S. line in a morning-long battle until Combat Command A of the 2nd Armored Division was sent forward to repel the attack. The 101st was then assigned to the newly arrived U.S. VIII Corps on June 15 in a defensive role before returning to England for rehabilitation. The 82nd airborne still had not gained control of the bridge across the Merderet by June 9. Its 325th GIR, supported by several tanks, forced a crossing under fire to link up with pockets of the 507th PIR, then extended its line west of the Merderet to Chef-du-Pont. The 505th PIR captured Montebourg Station northwest of Sainte-Mere-√àglise on June 10, supporting an attack by the 4th Division. The 508th PIR attacked across the Douve River at Beuzeville-la-Bastille on June 12 and captured Baupte the next day. On June 14 units of the 101st Airborne linked up with the 508th PIR at Baupte. The 325th and 505th passed through the 90th Division, which had taken Pont l'Abb√© (originally an 82nd objective), and drove west on the left flank of VII Corps to capture Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte on June 16. On June 19 the division was assigned to VIII Corps, and the 507th established a bridgehead over the Douve south of Pont l'Abb√©. The 82nd Airborne continued its march towards La Haye- du-Puits, and made its final attack against Hill 122 (Mont Castre) on July 3 in a driving rainstorm. It was \\"pinched out\\" of line by the advance of the 90th Infantry Division the next day and went into reserve to prepare to return to England. Aircraft losses and casualties Forty-two C-47s were destroyed in two days of operations, although in many cases the crews survived and were returned to Allied control. Twenty-one of the losses were on D-Day during the parachute assault, another seven while towing gliders, and the remaining fourteen during parachute resupply missions. Of the 517 gliders, 222 were Horsa gliders, most of which were destroyed in landing accidents or by German fire after landing. Although a majority of the 295 Waco gliders were repairable for use in future operations, the combat situation in the beachhead did not permit the introduction of troop carrier service units, and 97 per cent of all gliders used in the operation were abandoned in the field.Warren, Airborne Operations, 53. D-Day casualties for the airborne divisions were calculated in August 1944 as 1,240 for the 101st Airborne Division and 1,259 for the 82nd Airborne. Of those, the 101st suffered 182 killed, 557 wounded, and 501 missing. For the 82nd, the total was 156 killed, 347 wounded, and 756 missing., Note 34 for 101st, note 55 for 82nd. Casualties through June 30 were reported by VII Corps as 4,670 for the 101st (546 killed, 2217 wounded, and 1,907 missing), and 4,480 for the 82nd (457 killed, 1440 wounded, and 2583 missing).. German casualtiescompiled at German Order of Battle Normandy amounted to approximately 21,300 for the campaign. Fallschirmj√§ger-Regiment 6. reported approximately 3,000 through the end of July. Divisional totals, which include combat against all VII Corps units, not just airborne, and their reporting dates were: *91. Luftlande-Infanterie-Division: 2,212 (June 12), 5,000 (July 23) *243. Infanterie-Division: 8,189 (July 11) *709. Infanterie- Division: 4,000 (June 16) *17 SS-Panzergrenadier Division: 1,096 (June 30) Troop carrier controversy In his 1962 book, Night Drop: The American Airborne Invasion of Normandy, Army historian S.L.A. Marshall concluded that the mixed performance overall of the airborne troops in Normandy resulted from poor performance by the troop carrier pilots. In coming to that conclusion he did not interview any aircrew nor qualify his opinion to that extent, nor did he acknowledge that British airborne operations on the same night succeeded despite also being widely scattered. Marshall‚Äôs original data came from after- action interviews with paratroopers after their return to England in July 1944, which was also the basis of all U.S. Army histories on the campaign written after the war, and which he later incorporated in his own commercial book. General Omar Bradley.Page? blamed \\"pilot inexperience and anxiety\\" as well as weather for the failures of the paratroopers. Memoirs by former 101st troopers, notably Donald Burgett (Currahee) and Laurence Critchell (Four Stars of Hell) harshly denigrated the pilots based on their own experiences, implying cowardice and incompetence (although Burgett also praised the Air Corps as \\"the best in the world\\"). Later John Keegan (Six Armies in Normandy) and Clay Blair (Ridgway‚Äôs Paratroopers: The American Airborne in World War II) escalated the tone of the criticism, stating that troop carrier pilots were the least qualified in the Army Air Forces, disgruntled, and castoffs.Wolfe, Green Light!, 334. Blair also imputed that glider pilots were cowards in general. Others critical included Max Hastings (Overlord: D-Day and the Battle for Normandy) and James Huston (Out of the Blue: U.S. Army Airborne Operations in World War II). As late as 2003 a prominent history (Airborne: A Combat History of American Airborne Forces by retired Lieutenant General E.M. Flanagan) repeated these and other assertions, all of it laying failures in Normandy at the feet of the pilots. This criticism primarily derived from anecdotal testimony in the battle-inexperienced 101st Airborne. Criticism from veterans of the 82nd Airborne was not only rare, its commanders Ridgway and Gavin both officially commended the troop carrier groups, as did Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort and even one prominent 101st veteran, Captain Frank Lillyman, commander of its pathfinders. Gavin‚Äôs commendation said in part: The troop carrier pilots in their remembrances and histories admitted to many errors in the execution of the drops but denied the aspersions on their character, citing the many factors since enumerated and faulty planning assumptions. Some, such as Martin Wolfe, an enlisted radio operator with the 436th TCG, pointed out that some late drops were caused by the paratroopers, who were struggling to get their equipment out the door until their aircraft had flown by the drop zone by several miles.Wolfe, Green Light, 118, quoting from Four Stars of Hell. Others mistook drops made ahead of theirs for their own drop zones and insisted on going early.Warren, Airborne Operations, 41. The TCC personnel also pointed out that anxiety at being new to combat was not confined to USAAF crews. Warren reported that official histories showed 9 paratroopers had refused to jump and at least 35 other uninjured paratroopers were returned to England aboard C-47s.Warren, Airborne Operations, 41, 43, 45. General Gavin reported that many paratroopers were in a daze after the drop, huddling in ditches and hedgerows until prodded into action by veterans.Wolfe, Green Light!, 117. Wolfe noted that although his group had botched the delivery of some units in the night drop, it flew a second, daylight mission on D-Day and performed flawlessly although under heavy ground fire from alerted Germans. Despite this, controversy did not flare until the assertions reached the general public as a commercial best-seller in Stephen Ambrose's Band of Brothers, particularly in sincere accusations by icons such as Richard Winters. In 1995, following publication of D-Day June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II, troop carrier historians, including veterans Lew Johnston (314th TCG), Michael Ingrisano Jr. (316th TCG), and former U.S. Marine Corps airlift planner Randolph Hils, attempted to open a dialog with Ambrose to correct errors they cited in D-Day, which they then found had been repeated from the more popular and well-known Band of Brothers. Their frustration with his failure to follow through on what they stated were promises to correct the record, particularly to the accusations of general cowardice and incompetence among the pilots, led them to detailed public rejoinders when the errors continued to be widely asserted, including in a History Channel broadcast April 8, 2001. This is a 12-part work by Lew Johnston, a TC pilot with the 314th TCG. As recently as 2004, in MHQ: The Quarterly of Military History, the misrepresentations regarding lack of night training, pilot cowardice, and TC pilots being the dregs of the Air Corps were again repeated, with Ambrose being cited as its source.

It was dedicated to Sir Henry Wood and is perhaps the most performed and most immediately approachable of Bax's symphonies. It was the first symphony Bax completed at the Station Hotel, Morar, in the West Highlands of Scotland. The first recording was by the Hall√© Orchestra under John Barbirolli in 1944. It is scored for 3 flutes (1 doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 4 clarinets, 1 bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 1 double bassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, tenor drum, snare drum, tambourine, cymbals, gong, xylophone, glockenspiel, celesta, anvil, 2 harps and strings. Unlike his first two symphonies the third is \\"gentle rather than somber in character, dominated by the spirit of Northern legends which, Bax acknowledges, influenced him subconsciously\\". It is in three movements: #Lento moderato ‚Äì Allegro moderato ‚Äì Lento moderato ‚Äì Allegro moderato #Lento #Moderato ‚Äì Piu mosso ‚Äì Tempo I ‚Äì Epilogue The opening movement begins with a soft bassoon solo which introduces the main melodic theme. The clarinet then joins the bassoon, followed by other instruments of the woodwind section in a relatively short lento moderato opening section. An accelerando then introduces the allegro moderato section which is based upon the opening melody from the bassoon. There is a long slow section in the middle of the movement before the allegro moderato material eventually returns at the conclusion. Unusually, Bax calls for a single anvil strike at the climax of this movement (his original intention had been more conventional, with a cymbal clash).http://arnoldbax.com/bax-symphony-no-3-and- the-happy-forest-on-naxos-reviewed/ The dreamy and calm second movement begins with a solo horn introducing the main motive. Throughout the movement there are many other brass solos (particularly trumpet), and the form of the movement is relatively simple. It closes peacefully and beautifully. The finale opens with a gong and repeated notes from the strings and woodwinds, which is then transformed into the main theme. The mood is inescapably optimistic, as though to exorcise the dark and wild moods of the first and second symphonies. It ends in a famous, peaceful and beautiful epilogue which makes a suitable close to the journey of the first three symphonies‚Äîwhich are in many ways linked, and are a cycle of their own. In addition to the Barbirolli recording, the symphony has been recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra under Sir Edward Downes (RCA), the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Bryden Thomson (Chandos), the BBC Philharmonic with Vernon Handley (Chandos) and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra conducted by David Lloyd- Jones (Naxos). The original Barbirolli recording has been reissued several times by EMI Classics, and latterly by Dutton Vocalion. For the second movement of his Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra, Ralph Vaughan Williams quoted the theme from the Epilogue of the third movement of Bax's symphony.

His mother was Philomena and father was George Walls, a pilot, who had seen service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) in the First World War. He received his initial education at Plumtree School in Southern Rhodesia. Early military career In the closing months of the Second World War, he left Southern Rhodesia for England, where he received his initial military education at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned on 16 March 1946 into the Black Watch regiment of the British Army. Return to Africa Resigning his commission in the British Army, apparently dissatisfied with a proposal to transfer him to another regiment from the Black Watch, he returned home and re-enlisted with the Rhodesian Army, first as a non-commissioned officer in the Southern Rhodesian Staff Corps, and then as an officer in the Northern Rhodesia Regiment.Obituary for Lt. Gen. Peter Walls, 'Daily Telegraph' 27 July 2010. Malayan Emergency In 1951, Walls was promoted to the rank of Captain at the age of 24 years, and was appointed second-in-command of a reconnaissance unit that Rhodesia despatched to fight in the Malayan Emergency. On arrival in Malaya this unit was renamed \\"C\\" Squadron, Special Air Service, and Walls, proving his fighting and leadership qualities in the Malayan jungle, was promoted to the rank of Major, and appointed as the unit's Commanding Officer. On the conclusion of the victorious campaign after 2 years, Walls was appointed an M.B.E. (Military) in 1953.Obituary for Lt. Gen. Peter Walls, 'The Guardian' newspaper (England), 28 July 2010. Southern Rhodesia Returning home to Southern Rhodesia, Walls continued as a career soldier, holding a succession of General Staff posts in the Rhodesian Army, and attending the British Army's Staff College in England for training as a future senior officer. In November 1964, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and appointed to be the Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion of the Rhodesian Light Infantry. With the advent of global decolonisation, Southern Rhodesia came under increasing political pressure from the Colonial Office and the United Nations to introduce universal suffrage and majority rule. In response, Ian Smith, then Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, and his Cabinet issued a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) from the United Kingdom in November 1965, claiming that Southern Rhodesia was now independent as a dominion within the Commonwealth called Rhodesia. During this period, Brigadier Sam Putterill, Walls' commanding officer, reproached him for permitting his men to wear paper party hats at a regimental Christmas dinner printed with the words, \\"RLI for UDI.\\" Rhodesia declared itself a republic in 1970. General Staff Officer After UDI, in the new Rhodesia, Walls was promoted to Brigadier, and appointed to the command of the Rhodesian Army's 2nd Brigade. In the late 1960s he was appointed to the post of the Rhodesian Army's Chief of Staff, with the rank of Major-General. In 1972 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General and appointed to the post of the Commander- in-Chief of the Rhodesian Army.Obituary for Lt. Gen. Peter Walls, 'The Guardian', 28 July 2010. In 1977 he was appointed as the head of Rhodesian Joint Operations Command, becoming de facto with this office the Head of the Rhodesian Armed Forces.Wood, J. R. T. 'So Far and No Further!' Rhodesia's Bid for Independence During the Retreat from Empire 1959, 2005, p. 244 Rhodesian Bush War As international pressure upon the Rhodesian government to admit more indigenous Africans into the country's governance increased during the late 1960s, exerted by crippling economic sanctions, guerrilla activity intensified among the Shona and the Ndebele with support from the Chinese and Soviet governments, as a part of their Cold War strategy against Western presence in Africa. This support brought in modern weapons and training for the tribal forces, and the guerrilla activity escalated through the 1970s into full-scale guerrilla warfare (known as the Rhodesian Bush War) in the Rhodesian countryside between the guerillas and the Rhodesian authorities ‚Äî with Walls as the leader of the armed forces directing operations in the increasingly besieged nation. Many of these operations involved incursion raids into the neighbouring territories of Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Angola and Botswana, which were covertly harbouring the guerrillas of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). In 1973, after a study as to the nature of the opponents that Rhodesia was facing, Walls summoned Ronald Reid-Daly and asked him to assemble a new army unit in response to the strategic nature of the escalating guerilla tactics of Rhodesia's adversaries. The new unit needed to combine cross-border insurgency warfare to take the fight to the enemies' bases of operation in territory under hostile governmental control (which collectively virtually encircled Rhodesia), with domestic policing counter- insurgency operations of a more traditional colonial nature, both disciplines being drawn heavily from the experiences that both Walls and Reid-Daly had learned when they had fought alongside one another in the Malayan Emergency twenty years earlier. The new unit was the Selous Scouts.'Lt. Gen. Peter Walls obituary, 'Daily Telegraph', 27 July 2010. In 1976 Walls oversaw the introduction of indigenous Africans into the Rhodesian Army as commissioned officers for the first time.AFP Report, 'First black officers graduate into Rhodesian Army', 11 June 1977 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SqmYYNH6rA In 1977, Walls was appointed as Rhodesia's Commander of Combined Operations, commanding the nation's military and police forces, providing him with almost 50,000 men under his orders in increasingly severe fighting. On 3 April 1977, in a sign that time was running out for Rhodesia amid economic sanctions, Walls announced that the government would launch a campaign to win the \\"hearts and minds\\" of Rhodesia's indigenous African populations to undermine support for the guerrilla campaigns.Rhodesia Psychological Operations 1965-1980 Psychological Operations In May 1977, General Walls received intelligence reports of a ZANLA force massing in the town of Mapai, in the neighbouring country of Mozambique, and he launched an attack across the border to remove the threat. At this time Walls briefed the press that the Rhodesian forces were changing tactics from \\"contain and hold\\" to \\"search and destroy\\", and adopting a military policy of \\"hot pursuit when necessary.\\" On 30 May 1977, a force of around five hundred Rhodesian troops crossed the border into Mozambique (which had only gained independence from Portugal in 1975), engaging the enemy with support from the Rhodesian Air Force (RhAF), and paratroopers conveyed in Second World War-era C-47 Dakotas. At the end of the operation, General Walls announced that it had killed 32 guerrillas for the loss of one Rhodesian pilot in action. Mozambique's government disputed the number of casualties, stating it had shot down four Rhodesian aircraft and taken several Rhodesian prisoners of war, which the Rhodesian government denied.Kalley, Jacqueline Audrey. Southern African Political History: A chronological of key political events from independence to mid-1997, 1999. Page 224.Smith Takes a Dangerous New Gamble TIME magazine and CNNGetting ready for war TIME magazine and CNN Walls announced a day later that the Rhodesian Army would occupy the captured area of Mozambique until it had removed nationalist guerrillas from it. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, condemned the incident on 1 June, and political pressure, led by the United States, prompted the Rhodesian government to order its forces out of Mozambique. In November 1977 Walls commanded another raid into Mozambique entitled Operation Dingo, inflicting heavy losses on ZANLA guerrillas quartered there. In a candid admission to the press, Walls gave an insight to the nature of the conflict that Rhodesia found itself in when he stated in an interview in September 1978 that: \\"There is no single day of the year when we are not operating beyond our borders.\\"Preston, Matthew. Ending Civil War: Rhodesia and Lebanon in Perspective, 2004. Page 65. In 1977, rumours began circulating in the Rhodesian press that Walls had become deeply pessimistic about the future of Rhodesia, and that he had been quietly preparing to abandon the country and personally relocate his family into South Africa, and had covertly purchased property there for this purpose. Seeking to scotch these allegations, with the attenuation they would have to the military morale of the troops still fighting under his command, he publicly issued a denial they had any basis in truth.AFP Report, 'General Peter Walls presents troops with trophy Gweru', 26 August 1979 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2qGmbZpwAA On 4 November 1978 Walls announced to the press that 2,000 nationalist guerrillas had been persuaded to lay down their arms (this figure has been placed by subsequent historical research at closer to no more than 50). On 12 February 1979, in an attempt to assassinate Walls, ZIPRA shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827 with a Soviet-made SAM-7 missile. Flight 827 was a regularly scheduled flight from Kariba to Salisbury. The aircraft was a Vickers Viscount known as The Umniati, and the second civilian Viscount they had shot down. All 55 passengers and 4 crew on board were killed. But Walls and his wife had missed the flight and were aboard a second Viscount which took off 15 minutes later, and which landed unharmed at Salisbury. The Zimbabwe African People's Union leader Joshua Nkomo appeared on British domestic television laughing about this incident, declaring that Walls was responsible for the passengers' deaths because he was the \\"biggest military target\\", and this justified the action.Again, death on \\"Flight SAM-7\\" TIME magazine and CNN The Rhodesian government responded to the attack by air- strikes on ZIPRA bases within the borders of Angola and Zambia.Sibanda, Eliakim M. The Zimbabwe African People's Union, 1961-87: A Political History of Insurgency in Southern Rhodesia, 2004. Page 196. With the nation increasingly pressured by sanctions, the Rhodesian government offered an amnesty to the nationalist guerrillas operating in the field in March 1979, printing and distributing 1.5 million leaflets entitled: \\"TO ALL ZIPRA FORCES\\". The leaflets were printed with the signatures of Prime Minister Ian Smith, the ZANU founder Ndabaningi Sithole, United African National Council leader Abel Muzorewa, Chief Jeremiah Chirau, and Walls. Any who abandoned the Bush War were offered suffrage, food and medical treatment. Following this in April 1979 Walls issued an order to the Selous Scouts Regiment to train, organise, and support militants who had defected to the Rhodesian government's authority as part of Operation Favour. However this hearts and minds approach had only limited success, and the Bush War continued unabated. Following the Internal Settlement, Zimbabwe Rhodesia's government concluded a ceasefire with the Patriotic Front ahead of negotiations in London. Zimbabwe In late 1979, at a peace conference held in at Lancaster House in London, the UK, the Government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia, and the Patriotic Front guerrilla leaders, concluded the Lancaster House Agreement, leading to elections in March 1980 with universal suffrage extended to all the country's citizens. The election was won by ZANU-PF and its leader Robert Mugabe, who became Prime Minister of the newly declared nation of Zimbabwe on its formal independence in April 1980. Amid the international community's welcome of these developments, Lieutenant-General Walls publicly announced to the press his support for the new government and national dispensation of the Zimbabwean state.\\"We will make it work!\\", interview with Lt. Gen. Peter Walls, 'Time' Magazine, 24 March 1980. This caused some surprise in military, political and diplomatic circles involved, and acrimony between himself and Rhodesia's last Prime Minister, Ian Smith (who had known Walls' father when they had served together in the Royal Air Force),Lt.Gen Peter Walls obituary, 'Daily Telegraph' 27 July 2010. who privately accused him of betrayalObituary Lt. Gen. Peter Walls, 'Daily Telegraph', 27 July 2010. during the negotiations in London for the Lancaster House Agreement.'Bitter Harvest, The Great Betrayal', by Ian Smith (Pub. Blake Publishing, 2008). In consequence of his newly found conciliatory demeanour, Walls was maintained as the Commanding Officer of the new Zimbabwe national army by the new Government to oversee the integration of the black nationalist guerrilla units into its regular armed forces. Whilst the Western press and governments praised Mugabe's early announcements of his aim of reconciliation with the white community, tensions swiftly developed on the ground. On 17 March 1980, only a few days after the election of the new government, a rumour of a coup attempt led Mugabe to confront Walls with the question: \\"Why are your men trying to kill me?\\" Walls replied: \\"If they were my men you would be dead.\\"Raymond, Walter John. Dictionary of Politics: Selected American and Foreign Political and Legal Terms, 1992. Page 557. Whites continued to leave the country for South Africa, and relations between the two men continued to deteriorate. In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in August 1980, Walls stated that he had requested British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher annul the March 1980 election results prior to the official announcement of the result. His request was based on the grounds that Robert Mugabe's forces had used intimidation of voters at the hustings and polling stations to win. Walls stated that there had also been multiple breaches of military aspects of the Lancaster House Agreement's terms.Interview with Peter Walls, 'End of Empire' Part 14 Granada Television documentary (1985). He noted that the British Government had not even replied to his request. On 12 August 1980, the British Government issued a statement in response to the interview stating that Antony Duff, at that time the Deputy Governor of Salisbury, had replied to Walls in March 1980, notifying him that it would not interfere with the election. Walls also later revealed that he had raised the same concerns during the election and transfer of power in March 1980 with the British Government's Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials who were overseeing the election, led by Lord Soames as the last Governor of Southern Rhodesia (who were more concerned that the Rhodesian military were about to stage a coup d'√©tat to prevent the handover of power to the native African electorate), but had been told that they were not willing to annul the election process as Mugabe had, in their assessment, the overwhelming support of the native African population anyway, and the US government would be against it.Interview with Peter Walls, 'End of Empire', Episode #14 television documentary, Granada Television (1985). In response to the release of the interview with the BBC, the Zimbabwean Minister of Information, Nathan Shamuyarira, issued a statement that the new Government: \\"Would not be held ransom by racial misfits\\", and suggested that \\"all those Europeans who do not accept the new order should pack their bags.\\" He also stated that the Zimbabwean government was now considering legal or administrative action against Lt. Gen. Walls for his comments in the BBC interview. On returning from a meeting in the US with President Jimmy Carter, Prime Minister Mugabe, on hearing of the interview, said: \\"We are certainly not going to have disloyal characters in our society.\\" Walls returned to Zimbabwe after the interview, telling Peter Hawthorne of Time magazine: \\"To stay away at this time would have appeared like an admission of guilt.\\" Subsequently, the government removed him from his military post at the head of its armed forces and passed an order essentially precluding his presence within Zimbabwe's territory. Walls left the country at the end of 1980 to live in exile in South Africa.Zanu-PF's Walls 'manhunt' backfires DispatchA soldier faces his critics TIME magazine and CNN Military awards Whilst a temporary major in the Southern Rhodesia Far East Volunteer Unit (Staff Corps) he was awarded the M.B.E. in recognition of his service in Malaya. Walls was the only recipient of the Grand Officer (Military Division) of the Rhodesian Legion of Merit. He was entitled to the post-nominal letters G.L.M. Final years Walls settled with his wife at Plettenberg Bay in the Western Cape of South Africa, where he spent the remainder of his life in obscurity away from the public eye. At the turn of the century, as Zimbabwe became an economically chaotic state, the Government began to seize the properties and farmsteads of the remaining white farming population in an atmosphere of escalating menace and violence. Paranoia also increased in the Government about perceived potential threats from the previous era to its rule becoming a focus for popular discontent; this was publicly displayed by articles appearing in state controlled press outlets 'The Herald' (Zimbabwe) 20 December 2000. circulating rumours that Walls had covertly been crossing the border into Zimbabwe from South Africa to support the Movement for Democratic Change. Obert Mpofu, ZANU-PF Party Deputy Secretary for Security stated publicly that Walls had been seen in the vicinity of the Victoria Falls. Walls subsequently denied these reports in response to press enquiries, with: \\"It's utter bloody rubbish, I haven't been out of the Western Cape this year, except to go to Johannesburg once. I haven't been in Zimbabwe since I left in 1980. I have no connection with any group whatsoever in Zimbabwe.\\" The Daily News later reported the Zimbabwe Government had confused Walls with Peter Wells, an English agronomist who had visited Harare to assist African farmers with water management. During the night of 23 February 2001 a gang of black Zimbabweans attacked Walls' son, George, in Harare. Identifying themselves as Bush War veterans, they waylaid his car, demanded to know his father's whereabouts, and then proceeded to assault him, cutting his face and stabbing him in the thigh.Ex-Rhodesian army chief's son attacked The Daily Telegraph Death General Walls died in his 83rd year on 20 July 2010 at George Airport (formerly P.W.

While Bob Chamberlain was working as a tractor mechanic in Victoria he designed a tractor and built a prototype tractor around what he believed farmers wanted. It became the basis of the 40K model tractor. The Western Australian Government having heard of Bob Chamberlain's plan to build tractors persuaded the Chamberlains to use an ex-munitions factory (); in Welshpool, Western Australia. Thus the first Tractors rolled off the production line in 1949. The first Chamberlain tractor produced was the model 40k which had twin- cylinder, horizontally opposed engines. They weighed about four tonnes and were considered to be ideal for the needs of Australian farmers.A history of Australian Tractors In 1953 Chamberlain started to produce diesel powered tractors such as the GM diesel powered 60DA and later the 70DA, as well as the 55DA, which was powered by an Australian built diesel engine. A few years later the production of kerosene powered tractors was stopped. In 1955 Chamberlain developed the Perkins diesel powered Champion models and as a publicity stunt in the same year Chamberlains entered the new diesel powered tractor in the around Australia Redex Trial as a rescue/recovery vehicle. It became known as \\"Tail End Charlie\\" The tractor in question was fitted with modified cab, bench seat and high speed gears (allowing it to reach speeds of up to 110 km/hourQuick GR 2006 Australian tractors Indigenous tractors and self-propelled machines in rural Australia, Rosenberg Publishing, Australia. ). Initial attempts to enter the event were met with disbelief, and it was only officially recognised as a recovery vehicle for one leg of the trial. Tail-End Charlie is reputed to have completed one stage of the trial while towing as many as six other entrants that broke down on the way. In a subsequent trial, the powers that be relented, and the Chamberlain machine completed the whole course. In subsequent years, Chamberlain produced a range of iconic larger tractors suited to broadland farming in Australia.http://www.tractordata.com/farm-tractors/tractor- brands/chamberlain/chamberlain-tractors.html These tractors are now popular for heritage tractor pulling contests, and feature their own national championships. An expansion and refit of the Welshpool Plant was undertaken in 1978. The Welshpool manufacturing site was redeveloped and a new office complex built in 1982, however by 1986 due to significant decline in demand, the manufacture of the famous Chamberlain tractors ceased. John Deere Merger In 1970, the John Deere Company of America purchased a controlling interest in Chamberlain. During the 1980s, Chamberlain became a fully owned subsidiary of John Deere, thus trading as Chamberlain John Deere.

Playing career Born in Westhoughton, near Bolton, he initially played as an amateur with Wigan Borough, Bolton Wanderers and Horwich RMI while working in the coal mines before signing for Burnley as a professional in 1925 - it was reported that he came up from the pit and signed professional forms on an overturned tub at the pit head. At Turf Moor he established himself as one of the best wingers in the country and won representative honours with the Football League team. He also made three appearances for England. He scored 44 times in 176 games for Burnley before becoming Blackburn Rovers' record ¬£6,500 signing in December 1929. A maker of goals as well as a scorer, Bruton proved to be remarkably consistent during his playing career with Rovers. In the 1930‚Äì31 season, Bruton was Rovers' top- scorer with 19 league goals, closely followed by his unrelated namesake Les Bruton on 18.Blackburn Rovers goalscorers: 1930‚Äì31 He scored 115 times in 344 appearances for Blackburn before moving on to Preston North End in 1939, although he was prevented from making any first team appearances for Preston as a result of the outbreak of World War II. He was awarded a benefit match in 1935 when Blackburn Rovers beat Celtic 1‚Äì0 on Monday, 22 April at Ewood Park. Management career After the war he returned to Ewood Park as assistant trainer and assistant secretary. During manager Will Scott's absence through illness, Bruton took over the running of the club and on Scott's return was appointed assistant manager. He was the natural successor when Rovers' lack of consistency led to Scott finally vacating the manager's chair in December 1947. On taking control Bruton's immediate aim was to avoid the team's relegation from Division 1, but nine defeats in the last ten games sealed the club's fate. In an attempt to regain First Division status, Bruton signed Dennis Westcott, a proven goal-scorer from Wolves, and also unearthed an exciting prospect at left-back in the shape of Bill Eckersley. However, success proved just as elusive and after the club finished in fourteenth place in the Second Division, Bruton was summoned to a board meeting and dismissed in May 1949. In 1950 he was appointed manager at Bournemouth, who played in the Third Division South.

He was the first athlete from his country to win a gold medal at what is now known as the Commonwealth Games, when he won the 100 yards final in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on 31 July 1954.  Early life  Michael Agostini was born on 23 January 1935 at Port- of-Spain, Trinidad. His family had interests in sports: his father played football, his mother played hockey, and all his siblings participated in football and athletics events at St. Mary's College, where they studied.  Athletics career  Agostini participated in athletics, football, and boxing in his school days. In 1952, at Kingston, he defeated Jamaican sprinter Herb McKenley, who had won one gold and two silver medals at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. On a scholarship, Agostini enrolled at Villanova University, where he received training from Jumbo Elliott. On 23 January 1954, his 19th birthday, he set a world indoor record for over 100 yards at Washington, beating Olympic champion Lindy Remigino. The same year, he competed in the 1954 Commonwealth Games at Vancouver, Canada, and won gold in the 100 yards race (9.6). He defeated Canadian Don McFarlane (9.7) and Australian Hec Hogan (9.7), becoming the first athlete from Trinidad and Tobago to win gold at the Commonwealth Games. Hogan was then in the news for tying the world records of 100 yards (9.3) and 100 m (10.2) and was the most anticipated winner. Reports suggest that Hogan's performance was hampered after he was informed that Agostini had ironically stated in a pre-Games interview, \\"Who the heck is Hogan?\\" when questioned about him. In 1955 Agostini participated in the Pan American Games held in Mexico and won a silver and a bronze in the 100 m and 200 m races, respectively. He also won silver at the 1959 Chicago Pan American Games in the 100 m, a bronze in the 200 m, and another bronze in the 4 √ó 100 m relay. In the next Commonwealth Games at Cardiff in 1958, he stood third in the 100 yards run behind Keith Gardner of Jamaica and Tom Robinson of Bahamas. Agostini won another gold in the 1959 British West Indies Championships in the 100 m and a bronze in the 200 m. Agostini had also represented Trinidad and Tobago at the Men's 100 m and Men's 200 m at the 1956 Summer Olympics, ranking 6th and 4th, respectively. Post-retirement Agostini retired from active sports in the late 1950s. He graduated with a degree in economics from Fresno State University, California, in 1958. In the late 1950s Agostini moved to Australia and married Pamela, with whom he had two daughters and two sons. He received Australian citizenship in 1961. He coached various sprinters, including Ralph Doubell, Andrew Ratcliffe, Peter Vassella, and Jenny Lamy. He worked as a freelance journalist and as a teacher for a brief time, and also served as editor and publisher for Track and Field magazine in the mid-1960s. He edited numerous periodicals and authored nine books. In 2007, Mike Agostini was inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame. In his later years, he suffered from arthritis and pancreatic cancer. He died on 12 May 2016 of cancer in Sydney.

Black beech occurs on both the North and the South Island at low altitudes up to the mountains. The other variety of N. solandri is called Mountain beech or Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides, and grows at higher altitudes than black beech. In New Zealand the taxon is called Fuscospora solandri. Black beech is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 27 m tall. The leaves are oppositely arranged, ovoid, 10 mm long and 5 mm broad, with smooth margins. Black beech is known as black beech because it is prone to a sooty mold which covers the trunk and branches. This, in turn, is the result of a scale insect which sucks sap from the tree, and excretes honeydew, a sweet liquid, in small droplets (less than 1 mm diameter) on the end of stalks. This feeds the sooty mold, and also forms a valuable high-energy food source for various birds and insects including the kaka. The infestation is common and does not appear to harm the tree. Black beech and mountain beech have both been planted in Great Britain, and mountain beech has shown better cold tolerance than black beech in locations such as Scotland.  Hybrids  * Black beech is known to hybridise freely with mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides ) where the two species co-exist, and in some places the hybrids may form complex introgressive hybrid swarms. * Black beech hybridises with hard beech (Nothofagus truncata) to form the hybrid species Nothofagus √óapiculata. * Black beech hybridises with red beech (Nothofagus fusca) to form the hybrid species Nothofagus √ódubia.

If I had to spend the extra hours, learning my craft, that's what I was going to do. It took a while,\\" Bembery said. During those years, Bembery was named to the 1993 All Star Game and was a three-time member of the All- Arena First Team (1990‚Äì93). His vicious style of play became notorious around the AFL; however, the 6-foot-3-inch, 285-pound monster was known as a gentle giant off the field. \\"I wont lie about it, I grew into it,\\" Bembery said about his \\"switch.\\" \\"Like everybody in life, you have to know how to control yourself and conduct yourself both on and off the field. In order to play football, you have to have some nastiness. You have to know when to turn it on and off. What did that for me was wanting to be the best at my craft and not wanting to be defeated on the field. I still hadn't won a championship.\\" Tampa Bay Storm He joined the Tampa Bay Storm in 1994. That year, the Storm advanced to the third round of the Playoffs but his ArenaBowl hopes were shot with a loss to Orlando. The following season, legendary Head Coach and AFL Hall of Famer Tim Marcum joined the Storm. During those years, Bembery was a Second Team All-Arena member, twice, and named to the 10th Anniversary Team. Buffalo Destroyers He would play the 1999 season with the Storm before joining the Buffalo Destroyers in 2000. Return to the Tampa Bay Storm He re-joined the Storm for his final year in 2001. Known as one of the Storm's greatest pass rushers, a 6-time All-Arena selection, Sylvester won 2 ArenaBowl Championships' with the Storm. In 2001, he helped the Storm win 7 straight games ending with a 58‚Äì51 overtime win over the Carolina Cobras. This was the longest streak the Storm put together since Bemery helped them win 9 straight games in 1998, and the longest Tampa Bay winning streak since when he contributed to 8 game streak they tore through to begin the 1996 season. Career Highlights Bembery was named to the Arena Football League 10th Anniversary Team in 1996, and was the All-time AFL leader in sacks with 43 at the time of his retirement. In 2002 his jersey was retired by Tampa Bay at the St. Pete Times Forum. In 2006, Bembery ranked seventh among the 20 Greatest AFL Players and in 2009, he was inducted into the UCF Athletics Hall of Fame. On August 12, 2011, Bembery earned his most cherished accomplishment as he was named to the 2011 AFL Hall of Fame Class. After football Currently, Sylvester Bembery is the CEO of B.E.M Services, LLC an agency that provides care services to persons with developmental disabilities in the Tampa Bay Area of Florida. \\"Arena Football taught me to be the man I am today, a respectable man in the community. Today, I work with the handicap and disabled. I love my job. I hope I can retire doing my job. I'm a positive person in my community. I mentor children and I try to teach them positive things. I help coach Little League football. There are a lot of things I'm trying to do. That's because of Arena Football. I am very grateful for the game. If I had to do it all over again, I would,\\" Bembery said.

It featured a higher level of standard equipment than corresponding Falcon models of the same series. As well as offering a more luxurious interior trim with additional comfort and convenience features, for much of its first 25 years the Fairmont also offered a higher mechanical specification; a larger capacity engine and refinements such as disc brakes, power steering and automatic transmission that were extra cost options for the Falcon were fitted as standard equipment for the Fairmont. It was available as a four-door sedan throughout its life, as a five-door station wagon from its introduction through to 2008, and as a two-door hardtop from 1972 to 1978. History The Fairmont was added to Ford's Australian lineup in September 1965 as part of the Falcon XP range.Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, 1986, Page 158 It was offered in sedan and station wagon body-styles, replacing the short-lived XP series Falcon Futura sedan and Falcon Squire wagon models. A 200 cubic-inch (3.3-litre) six-cylinder engine, optional on the XP Falcon, was standard on the Fairmont. The Fairmont has been through many incarnations since then, each one aligned with the contemporary Falcon series but usually with a better grade of interior and different exterior lights, front grille and other features. In 1966 the new XR series Fairmont offered a V8 engine option. The XA series of 1972 marked the debut of a two-door hardtop body style. In 1976, the XC series saw further differentiation between Falcon and Fairmont styling with the latter equipped with large rectangular quartz halogen headlamps while the Falcon featured round headlamps. An additional top-of-the-line Fairmont GXL sedan was offered from 1976 in the XC series. There was no two-door hardtop in the XD series that was launched in 1978 and the GXL badge was replaced by the Fairmont Ghia. The Ghia was, unlike the base Fairmont, offered in the sedan body-style only. A Ghia wagon was offered from 1986 but discontinued in 1993 with the release of the ED Series and the Fairmont wagon was discontinued in 2002 when the AU series gave way to the BA. The Fairmont's model life ended with the arrival of the FG Series Falcon range in 2008, when the Fairmont and Fairmont Ghia models were replaced by the Ford G6, G6E and G6E Turbo models. According to the then Ford Australia head Tom Gorman, the model code FG was chosen as a 'nod to the Fairmont Ghia'. Between 1967 and 1978, Australian Ford Fairmont sedans and wagons were exported to the United Kingdom. Though large compared to models in Ford's European range, they had a reputation for reliability.

Two engines were available: a 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder and the 351 cubic-inch Cleveland V8. The Ranchero badge was used on the utility version. A switch from assembly to local production had been considered but was ruled out on cost grounds; the Fairmont was replaced by the locally built Granada. Some South African Fairmonts were made as GT models. These cars had the same specifications as the Australian Falcon GT, but with some cosmetic differences, the main ones being that the side stripes had the Supa-Roo replaced by a Supa-Rhino and the dashboard gauges were in metric format. These cars are nicknamed \\"White Rhino\\" in the South African classic car scene. See also * Ford Falcon * Ford Fairlane References  External links  * Ford Fairmont at www.redbook.com.au.

Salk Hall from the rear Jonas Salk Hall at the University of Pittsburgh is a Pennsylvania state and Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark. The Art Deco building is named after Jonas Salk, who conducted his research on the first polio vaccine in a basement laboratory while on the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh. Jonas Salk in 1955 holds bottles of a culture used to grow polio vaccines History The main structure of Salk Hall is the former city owned Pittsburgh Municipal Hospital for Contagious Diseases constructed in 1941 on land the university had given to the city. It was designed by Richard Irving and Theodore Eicholz. The hospital was built as a project by President Roosevelt's Public Works Administration. The 225-bed hospital was originally part of the Medical Center associated with the University and was intended to be used primarily to treat communicable diseases. However, when antibiotics virtually eliminated the need to quarantine patients, the building had become a financial burden on the city. Therefore, in September 1949, work began on remodeling the building, and it temporarily housed Pitt's School of Public Health. In October 1957, the Municipal Hospital was formally acquired from the city for $1.3 million ($ million today) and renamed Jonas Salk Hall. For a time, the upper floors of the building served as a residence for students. Pitt remodeled it to house the School of Dental Medicine and School of Pharmacy in 1961-1962. Annex The Salk Hall Annex, a major renovation and three-story addition designed by the architectural firm Deeter, Ritchey, and Sippel for the Dental School, was completed the Terrace Street side of the building in 1967 for a cost of over $5 million ($ million today). Today, it serves as a main entrance for Salk Hall and the dental clinics. A new $50.6 million ($ million today) addition and renovation to Salk Hall was announced in January 2010. It will include the construction of an research tower in the parking area behind the existing building by Ballinger Architects with associates DRS Architects. The new tower is planned to house laboratories and support spaces relocated from their current home in Salk Hall in order to free up space for additional classrooms and offices in the original structure. The target completion date is July, 2014. Dental Museum A dental museum is housed in the first floor reception area of Salk Hall.

Early life Born and raised in London, England, he trained there as an architect, travelled to the United States and Canada in 1882‚Äì83, and returned to England. On 14 March 1883, he married Ada Spencer at Kelvedon, Essex. He shared the liberal political views of Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts, and she was influential in him getting a town planning commission in Westcliffe, Southend-on-Sea. The Westward Ho Hotel design came out of this commission, and it was his last major work in England. In 1886, he departed with his wife and their first two sons for New Zealand. Career in New Zealand For the next 30 years, Natusch established himself between Wellington and Hawke's Bay particularly as a builder of fine houses in a variety of styles. These ranged from those that displayed an Italian influence, such as Bushy Park (1905) near Wanganui, through Tudor style like Maungaraupi (1906) in Marton. Other examples of his work that reflect his use of local materials are Erewhon (1898) near Taihape, Matapiro (1907) in Hawke's Bay, and Atawhai (1908) in Palmerston North. He also introduced innovations into commercial and industrial buildings as well as churches. Natusch later had his architectural practice in Napier, and one of his pupils was Louis Hay. Family and death Charles and Ada had ten children. He died on 16 July 1951 at Paraparaumu aged 91, survived by his wife and eight of their children. Three of their sons, Aleck, Rene and Stanley, became architects and quantity surveyors and carried on the family firm as Natusch & Sons. Rene's son, Guy Natusch, continued the family firm until his retirement around 1997. Noted works Some of Natusch's works are registered by Heritage New Zealand as indicated in the following list. Later designs were by C. Tilleard Natusch and Sons, and it is unclear whether Charles Natusch was involved. *1884 Westward Ho Hotel, Southend-on-Sea (demolished 1965) *1890 Gwavas, Hawkes Bay (Category I) *1892 Homebush, Masterton (Category II) *1898 Erewhon, Taihape *1900 Te Aute College Chapel *1901 Westella, Feilding *1903 Springvale, Tikokino (Category II) *1903 Silverford, Napier *1904 St John's Cathedral, Napier (destroyed in 1931) *1904 Rangiatea (Bulls)http://www.heritage.org.nz/the- list/details/1213 *1905 Bushy Park, Kai Iwi *1906 Wellington Stock Exchange *1906 St Andrews Presbyterian Church, Hastings (destroyed in 1931) *1906 Maungaraupi, Marton (Category I) *1906 Shalimar, Palmerston North *1907 Matapiro, Hawkes Bay (Category I) *1908 Atawhai, Palmerston North *1932 McGruer's Building, Napier (Category II) *1935 Kia Ora, Pahiatua (Category II) References Category:New Zealand architects Category:1859 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Quantity surveyors Category:New Zealand surveyors ","title":"Charles Natusch"},{"id":"11676998","text":"Modara Muthugalage Don Nimesh Randika Gayan Perera (born September 5, 1977 in Colombo) is a Sri Lankan first-class cricketer.

He began on the Fraser River at the age of 18 and would become one of the most famous and prosperous riverboat captains of the era. His father, William Irving was known as the \\"King of the River\\" and the neighborhood of Irvington in Portland, Oregon is named in honor of their family. Early years John was born in 1854 in the suburb of Irvington in Portland, Oregon, the second child and only son of William and Elizabeth Irving.Irvington Community Association The family moved to New Westminster, British Columbia in 1859 and John's father began work on the Fraser River. William Irving became a partner in the Victoria Steam Navigation Company and built two sternwheelers, the Governor Douglas and the Colonel Moody to serve between New Westminster and Victoria. However, he did not have a monopoly on the route and rate wars soon erupted between him and his main rival, Captain William Moore who was running his Henrietta on the same route. John Irving at 19 In 1862, news of the gold strikes in the Cariboo Gold Rush brought 4,000 miners to the area and William Irving sold his boats to John Wright and had another sternwheeler built, the Reliance and later the Onward which were kept busy shipping miners and supplies to Yale where they could travel on the nearly completed Cariboo Wagon Road to the goldfields at Barkerville. John Irving was only eighteen when his father died on August 28, 1872 at New Westminster. He inherited the Onward and the Reliance and soon proved that he was capable of following in his father's footsteps. Fraser and Stikine Rivers John Irving's Reliance at Yale (1880) In 1873, John Irving took command of the Onward and ordered a new sternwheeler, the Glenora which was launched in 1874 and taken up to the Stikine River to provide freight and passenger service for the miners during the Cassiar Gold Rush. Though the Stikine was William Moore's territory, he was busy prospecting so the Glenora's only competition was Captain Parson's Hope. The two sternwheelers both worked on the Stikine until that June when the owner's agreed to share in the profits of Parson's Hope and Irving brought the Glenora back to the Fraser River. In 1874, John Irving purchased the Royal City from Captain Parson, who would perish the following year with his wife and daughter during the sinking of the SS Pacific. In 1875, John had his first rate war with his father's old rival, William Moore. Moore ran the Gertrude against Irving's Royal City for a few weeks, creating a rate war that lowered fares to $1 between New Westminster and Yale. Seeing there was no profits to be made, Moore laid the Gertrude up at Victoria and John Irving was left to his river again. In 1876, John had another sternwheeler built, the Reliance, which he first intended to run on the Stikine, but after consultation with Moore, the two captains decided it was more profitable for them to stick to their respective rivers. In 1879, the Glenora sank and was badly damaged just below the Harrison River and John replaced her with a new vessel, the William Irving. John Irving's William Irving at Yale (1882) By 1881, only five sternwheelers were on the river, Irving's Reliance, Royal City and William Irving along with Moore's Cassiar and Western Slope and the two captains battled for the increased business caused by the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The old rivalry ran hot as Moore's and Irving's sternwheelers raced up and down the Fraser, competing for passengers. To compete with Moore's Western Slope, Irving built a new sternwheeler, the $80,000 Elizabeth J Irving which on its second trip to Yale, raced Moore's Western Slope and, midway through the race, caught on fire near Hope and was soon reduced to a charred wreck, resulting in the deaths of four First Nations crewmen, two horses and two cows. The loss would be a tremendous financial blow to John Irving who had just allowed the vessel's insurance to expire a week earlier. RP Rithet at Yale (1882) In 1882, Irving ordered another sternwheeler, the RP Rithet, the finest yet on the river. Simply gorgeous... the RP Rithet is truly a floating palace raved the New Westminster newspaper. Meanwhile, William Moore had fallen on hard times, losing not only his sternwheelers, but also his home and properties in Victoria. John Irving purchased the Moore's Western Slope at auction, and in a grand gesture that proved he was a man of great honor, hired William Moore's three sons to be her crew, Billie to be her captain, Henry her mate and John her purser, thus helping his rival's family remain solvent. In 1883 John, then 29, was made the general manager of the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company and the future looked bright, but the completion of the railway replaced Yale with Ashcroft as the gateway to the Cariboo and points further north and sternwheelers were demoted to working for local trade. After becoming general manager, John Irving arranged for the company to purchase the sidewheel steamboat Yosemite which had been lying idle in Oakland, California from 1879 to 1883.Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W.

The partners hired Alexander Watson to build a sternwheeler to work on the Fraser River, the Charlotte. She would be piloted by Frank Odin and later, Owen Forrester Browne. The Charlotte ran from Soda Creek to Quesnel and was the only sternwheeler on the upper Fraser until 1909. Purchase by Canadian Pacific Railway Advertisement from December 1899 in British Columbia Mining Record for Irving's Canadian Pacific Navigation Company In 1901, the CPR purchased the CPNC and told John Irving that he could ride free on their boats for the rest of his life. In his retirement years, he would take them up on the offer and travel on the CPR ships frequently. Political career From 1894 to 1901 John Irving was the Member of the Legislative Assembly for the Cassiar Electoral District.Elections BC - Electoral History of British Columbia 1871-1986 - TOC Later years Historian Norman R. Hacking came to known John Irving well in the captain's later years, and wrote of him: When Irving had sold the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company to the CPR, he had been presented with a lifetime pass to travel on the CPR's coastal steamships as a guest of the company. Irving, who apparently lacked a regular home ashore, came to use the pass constantly. So long as Irving's old friend James W. Troup was superintendent of CPR coastal operations, Irving was always welcome aboard the company's ships. When Captain Troup retired, his successor, believing that Irving was abusing the pass, warned his captains that while travel might be at the company's expense, Irving was to be required to pay for accommodations and meals on board. This directive was ignored by the CPR's captains, who continued to seat Irving at the captain's table and make sure a cabin was available for him.Hacking, Norman R., and Lamb, W.

It is a sub facility of MCAS Cherry Point in Havelock in Craven County and one of three USMC facilities in Carteret County. The others include Atlantic Airfield, a Cherry Point sub installation which is sparsely manned and Radio Island shipping terminal, between Morehead City and Beaufort, which falls under control of Camp Lejeune, though it is only manned during active military operations. Another USMC facility, Oak Grove Airfield, near Pollocksville in Jones County, in also controlled by Cherry Point and in rarely manned unless training is conducted there. By Boogie Field being available for performing many of these landings at night, pilots simulate landing on an aircraft carrier or an amphibious assault ship, which provides the force with the means to forward deploy its aviation assets in order to have a more readily accessible aviation punch for the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commander on the battlefield. History When the United States Navy purchased of land in 1942 for an auxiliary airfield, three runways were built for the use of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Cherry Point, North Carolina. Facilities were also constructed to support two squadrons with a combined total of 45 aircraft and accommodations for 1,050 personnel. World War II During World War II, Bogue was used almost exclusively by the United States Marine Corps for VMSB dive-bomber squadron training. Equipped with the SBD Dauntless, the first squadron, VMSB-331, moved to Bogue from MCAS New River in 1943 followed by Marine Aircraft Group 33 (MAG-33) later that year. Specialized training facilities were established in the surrounding area to support the training of the resident dive-bombing squadrons. Dive-bombing circle targets were constructed on nearby islands, and vertical targets were built for low-level bombing practice. A maneuvering target boat was also used on the Neuse River to practice attacks on shipping. MAG-33 transferred to MCAS Eagle Mountain Lake, Texas in 1944, and MAG-93 was commissioned at Oak Grove in the same year. By that point, Marine Corps dive-bombing squadrons were transitioning to the SB2C Helldiver. A J2F Duck amphibian was assigned to Bogue for the rescue of downed flyers, but proved unsuitable for open-sea landings. Post-war operation Bogue was decommissioned on 15 June 1947 and became an Outlying Field of Cherry Point. The Marines' first Short Airfield for Tactical Support (SATS) system was installed at Bogue in 1958. It was a deployable catapult & arresting system, intended to permit jet aircraft to operate from short expeditionary airfields. Vietnam Era A VMA-231 AV-8A taking off from Bogue, in 1978. The Marine Corps reopened Bogue (sometime between 1965 and 1976) as a satellite airfield for aircraft & helicopters from MCAS New River & MCAS Cherry Point due to the Vietnam War. As of 2003, Bogue is still actively used as a satellite airfield with one active runway, along with the painted outline of the deck of an LHA amphibious assault ship, used for carrier landing practice. MCALF Bogue Field is the primary location for AV-8B Harrier practice operations. It is also used by other locally based USMC aircraft. It supports about 3500 FCLPs (Field Carrier Landing Practice) per training year. Training squadron aircraft take priority over normal traffic while exercises take priority over all other users, including training. Bogue Field consists of a runway constructed of aluminum panels which can be disassembled and reconstructed anywhere in the world in a matter of days by a specialty construction battalion. The remains of two other runways still exist. The Airport Facility Directory includes the remark, \\"Runway 18 utilized for catapults only.\\" Although Bogue Field has no aircraft permanently assigned, it serves as a training facility primarily for AV-8 Harriers from Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. However, it is also used for practice approaches by KC-130 Hercules transports from MCAS Cherry Point, F/A-18 Hornet fighters from MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina and helicopters from MCAS New River, North Carolina. Bogue Field Committee MCAS Cherry Point has enjoyed a comfortable relationship with the nearby communities of Emerald Isle and Bogue, although area residents have formed a committee to evaluate the impact that MCALF Bogue has on their community. The obvious noise impact on the community is considered by some to be offensive to the citizens living too close to normal flight patterns. In January 2001, a group of residents from Emerald Isle, Swansboro, Cape Carteret, Bogue and Morehead City that have concerns about safety issues of the Harrier noise, quality of life, and accident potential zones, have formed the Bogue Field Committee in an effort to have the federal government properly fund the AV-8 Harrier program so that safety is no longer an issue for the pilots. Since most committee members feel that this is not likely, their goals are now to have the USMC to stop flying the plane over highly populated areas.

Dale Jarrett won this race for the second time after winning it in 1993 and for the first (and only) time in all of Daytona 500 history, Dale Earnhardt won the pole position, allowing many to believe that he would finally win the race. Ernie Irvan returned to race full-time alongside Earnhardt (both drivers won their respective Gatorade Twin 125-mile qualifying races). Background Daytona International Speedway, where the race was held. Daytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida, that is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway, and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track also features two other layouts that utilize portions of the primary high speed tri-oval, such as a sports car course and a motorcycle course. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation. The track was built by NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. to host racing that was being held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959. The Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar. It is also the series' first race of the year; this phenomenon is virtually unique in sports, which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start. Race summary Opening laps The lead changed four times between Ernie Irvan, Ken Schrader, Sterling Marlin, and Dale Earnhardt in the first five laps. Reigning Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon was eliminated on lap 8 after getting a light tap from Jeremy Mayfield. Busch Series Goody's 300 winner Steve Grissom, along with Rick Mast, Joe Nemechek (both Busch Series champions) and Rusty Wallace, were involved in a chain reaction incident after Gordon hit the wall. Mast's and Wallace's cars both were relatively undamaged, but Grissom and Nemechek lost several laps after repairs. On lap 29, Earnhardt's ignition failed, triggering a wreck for Ernie Irvan. Wally Dallenbach, Jr., who could not see Earnhardt, tagged Irvan and sent him into the wall. Due to a new rules package, the lead changed hands early and often. On lap 50, no one but Dale Earnhardt or Terry Labonte (the new leader), had spent more than 4 consecutive laps in the lead. Lap 54 saw 1990 race winner Derrike Cope hit the turn 4 wall, which ended his day. Mid-race developments On lap 77, 1994 and 1995 winner Sterling Marlin took the lead away from Terry Labonte and led three laps before having engine problems. Not much later, Labonte began to drop back with overheating issues after leading the most laps at 44. He managed a decent finish, but Marlin almost instantly retired from the lead. IndyCar veteran John Andretti, whose uncle Mario won the 1967 race, became the new leader. He and Earnhardt, along with Bill Elliott, Dale Jarrett (the eventual race winner), Ken Schrader and Michael Waltrip, were all prime contenders at halfway. On lap 131, after 72 laps of green flag racing, Andretti had a hard crash in turn 2. Waltrip clipped him as he tried to go past his spinning car, only to damage the right- front fender. The damage seemed to improve the car's aerodynamic qualities. Shortly after the restart, Mike Wallace suddenly snapped loose and collected Loy Allen, Jr., Brett Bodine and Bobby Labonte, whose car was relatively undamaged. Only Wallace; Allen, Jr.; and Bodine were all done for the day. Run to the finish Geoff Bodine and Lake Speed crashed at lap 159, collecting Bobby Hamilton, Chad Little, Robert Pressley, Jeff Purvis and Morgan Shepherd. This prompted the final pit stops. Dale Jarrett and his crew chief Todd Parrott decided on a four-tire change, while the RCR duo Earnhardt and Petree opted for two. Bud Moore, whose car and driver Wally Dallenbach, Jr. were not yet sponsored for the season, were going to gamble that their full tank of fuel from the previous caution would be enough to finish. Even so, Dallenbach kept the #15 in the lead pack in the waning laps. Earnhardt quickly dispatched new leader and last year's Rookie of the Year Ricky Craven. He lost the lead briefly to Schrader but at lap 177, Jarrett passed him with four fresh tires. Earnhardt could keep up with Jarrett, but he could not repass him.

GAB2 is a docking protein with a conserved, folded PH domain attached to the membrane and a large disordered region, which hosts interactions with signaling molecules. It is a member of the GAB/DOS family localized on the internal membrane of the cell. It mediates the interaction between receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and non-RTK receptors serving as the gateway into the cell for activation of SHP2, Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Grb2, ERK, and AKT and acting as one of the first steps in these signaling pathways. GAB2 has been shown to be important in physiological functions such as growth in bone marrow and cardiac function. GAB2 has also been associated with many diseases including leukemia and Alzheimer's disease. Discovery GAB proteins were one of the first docking proteins identified in the mammalian signal transduction pathway. GAB2 along with many other adaptor, scaffold, and docking proteins, was discovered in the mid-1990s during the isolation and cloning of protein tyrosine kinase substrates and association partners. GAB2 was initially discovered as a binding protein and substrate of protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2/PTPN11. Two other groups later cloned GAB2 by searching DNA database for protein with sequence homology to GAB1.  Structure  GAB2 is a large multi-site docking protein (LMD) of about 100kD that has a folded N-terminal domain attached to an extended, disordered C-terminal tail rich in short linear motifs. LMDs are docking proteins that function as platforms mediating interaction between different signaling pathways and assisting with signal integration. The N-terminal is characterized by a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain that is the most highly conserved region between all members of the GAB family of proteins. (GAB1, GAB2, GAB3 and GAB4) GAB2 is an Intrinsically disordered protein, meaning that beyond the folded N-terminal region, the C-terminal region extends out into the cytoplasm with little or no secondary structure. The disordered region of the protein however may not be as disordered as was initially expected, as sequencing has revealed significant similarity between the ‚Äúdisordered‚Äù regions of GAB orthologs in different species. The PH domain of GAB2 recognizes phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate(PIP3) in the membrane and is responsible for localizing the GAB protein on the intracellular surface of the membrane and in regions where the cell contacts another cell. Some evidence also suggests that the PH domain plays a role in some signal regulation as well. Adjacent to the PH domain is a central, proline-rich domain that contains many PXXP motifs for binding to the SH3 domains of signaling molecules such as Grb2 (from which the name ‚ÄúGrb2-associated binding‚Äù protein, GAB, comes). It is hypothesized that binding sites in this region may be used in indirect mechanisms pairing the GAB2 protein to receptor tyrosine kinases. It is on the C-terminal tail that the various conserved protein binding motifs and phosphorylation sites of GAB2 are found. GAB2 binds to the SH2 domains of such signaling molecules as SHP2 and PI3K. By binding to the p85 subunit of PI3K, and continuing this signaling pathway GAB provides positive feedback for the creation of PIP3, produced as a result of the PI3K pathway, which binds to GAB2 in the membrane and promotes activation of more PI3Ks. Discovery of multiple binding sites in GAB proteins has led to the N-terminal folding nucleation (NFN) hypothesis for the structure of the disordered region. This theory suggests that the disordered domain is looped back to connect to the N-terminal, structured region several times to make the protein more compact. This would assist in promoting interactions between molecules bound to GAB and resisting degradation.  Function  GAB2 mediates the interactions between receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) or non-RTK receptors, such as G protein coupled receptors, cytokine receptors, multichain immune recognition receptors and integrins, and the molecules of the intracellular signaling pathways. By providing a platform to host a wide array of interactions from extracellular inputs to intracellular pathways, GAB proteins can act as a gatekeeper to the cell, modulating and integrating signals as they pass them along, to control the functional state within the cell. Mutagenesis and Binding assays have helped to identify which molecules and what pathways are downstream of GAB2. The two main pathways of GAB proteins are SHP2 and PI3K. GAB protein binding to SHP2 molecules acts as an activator whose main effect is the activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway. There are also, however, other pathways that are activated by this interaction such as the pathways c-Kit-induced Rac activation and Œ≤1-integrin. PI3K activation by GAB2 promotes cell growth. The effects of all the pathways activated by GAB proteins are not known, but it is easy to see that amplification of signal can progress quickly and these proteins can have large effects on the state of the cell. While not lethal, GAB2 deficient knockout mice do exhibit phenotypic side-effects. These include weak allergic reactions, reduced mast cell growth in bone marrow and osteopetrosis. Knockout mice have also been used to show the importance of GAB2 in maintenance of cardiac function. A paracrine factor, NRG1 Œ≤, utilizes GAB2 to activate the ERK and AKT pathways in the heart to produce angiopoietin 1.  Interactions  The C-terminal tail of GAB2 acts as a site for multiple phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases. It acts as a docking station for the Src homology 2(SH2) domain that is contained in the adaptor protein families Crk, Grb2, and Nck. These adaptor proteins then couple to enzymes to amplify different cellular signals. GAB2 may also bind directly to SH2-containing enzymes, such as PI3K, to produce such signals. GAB2 has been shown to interact with: AKT1 Through the PI3K signaling pathway, PI3K activates the serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT), which in turn through phosphorylation inactivates GSK3. This in turn causes the phosphorylation of tau and amyloid production. CRKL CT10 regulator of kinase (Crk) is also known as the breast cancer anti-oestrogen resistance protein. It plays a role in both fibroblast formation and breast cancer. The YXXP binding motif is required for the association of CRKL and GAB2. This leads to the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase(JNK) as part of the JNK signaling pathway. Grb2 Upon stimulation by growth hormone, insulin, epidermal growth factor (EFG), etc., the GAB2 protein can be recruited from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane, where it forms a complex with Grb2 and SHC. The interaction between GAB2 and Grb2 requires a PX3RX2KP motif in order to produce a regulatory signal. The activated GAB2 can now recruit SH2 domain-containing molecules, such as SHP2 or PI3K to activate signaling pathways. PI3K The p85 subunit of PI3K (or PIK3) possessed the SH2 domain required to be activated by GAB2. The activation of the PI3K signaling pathway produces increased amyloid production and microglia-mediated inflammation. The immunoglobulin receptor FceRI requires GAB2 as a necessity for mast cells to activate PI3K receptor to create an allergic response. In a study of knockout mice lacking the GAB2 gene, subjects experienced impaired allergic reactions, including passive cutaneous and systemic anaphylaxis. PI3K is found to be mutated in most breast cancer subtypes. Sufficient GAB2 expression by these cancerous subtypes proves necessary in order to sustain a cancerous phenotype. PLCG2 The erythropoietin hormone (Epo) is responsible for the regulation and proliferation of erythrocytes. Epo is able to self phosphorylate, which causes recruitment of SH2 proteins. An activated complex of GAB2, SHC, and SHP2 is required for binding of Phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2) through its SH2 domain, which activates PIP3. PTPN11 Protein tyrosine phosphatase non- receptor 11 (PTPN11) interaction with GAB2 is part of the Ras pathway. Mutations found in PTPN11 cause disruption in the binding to GAB2, which in turn impairs correct cellular growth. Thirty-five percent of patients diagnosed with JMML show activating mutations in PTPN11. RICS GC-GAP is part of the Rho GTP-ase activating protein family (RICS). It contains a highly proline-rich motifs that allow favorable interactions with GAB2. GC-GAP is responsible for the proliferation of astroglioma cells. SHC1 The interaction between GAB2 and Grb2 at the cell membrane recruits another adaptor protein, the Src homology domain-containing transforming protein 1 (SHC1), before being able to recruit SH2 domain-containing molecules. Clinical Implications Alzheimer's Disease Ten SNPs of GAB2 have been associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Free full text Free PDF Genetic data in the public domain However, this association is found only in APOE Œµ4 carriers. In LOAD brains, GAB2 is overexpressed in neurons, tangle- bearing neurons, and dystrophic neuritis. GAB2 has been indicated in playing a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease via its interaction with tau and amyloid precursor proteins. GAB2 may prevent neuronal tangle formation characteristic of LOAD by reducing phosphorylation of tau protein via the activation of the PI3K signaling pathway, which activates Akt. Akt inactivates Gsk3, which is responsible for tau phosphorylation. Mutations in GAB2 could affect Gsk3-dependent phosphorylation of tau and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Interactions between GAB2-Grb2 and APP are enhanced in AD brains, suggesting an involvement of this coupling in the neuropathogenesis of AD. Cancer GAB2 has been linked to the oncogenesis of many cancers including colon, gastric, breast, and ovarian cancer. Studies suggest that GAB2 is used to amplify the signal of many RTKs implicated in breast cancer development and progression. GAB2 has been particularly characterized for its role in leukemia. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), GAB2 interacts with the Bcr-Abl complex and is instrumental in maintaining the oncogenic properties of the complex. The Grb2/GAB2 complex is recruited to phosphorylated Y177 of the Bcr-Abl complex leading to Bcr-Abl-mediated transformation and leukemogenesis. GAB2 also plays a role in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Studies have shown the protein's involvement in the disease via the Ras pathway. In addition, GAB2 appears to play an important role in PTPN11 mutations associated with JMML.

Recap * This was the last of the non- restrictor plate Daytona 500's until 2020. * Bill Elliott dominated much of the race, leading 104 of the 200 laps. During two different points in the race, he pulled away from the other leaders and was all by himself on the track, leading the first 35 laps, 29 in a row at another point, and the last three. * Benny Parsons finished three car lengths back of Elliott. During the late-race pit stops for fuel, he overshot his pit which cost him several seconds. Parsons was subbing for an ill Tim Richmond in the Hendrick Motorsports Folgers Chevrolet Monte Carlo, renumbered 35 from its usual #25. Parsons also won his Twin 125 mile qualifying race on the Thursday before the Daytona 500. https://www.racing-reference.info/race?id=1987-02&series;=Q * Geoff Bodine led the race with three laps to go after all the front runners had pitted for fuel. His crew chief Gary Nelson told CBS pit reporter Mike Joy that they were not going to pit and would either win or run out of fuel. Bodine won the 1986 Daytona 500 after Dale Earnhardt ran out of fuel with three laps to go. Bodine, though, was largely a non-factor in the rest of the race, only leading 10 laps which were all related to having better fuel mileage than the other competitors. * Davey Allison made his debut as a rookie in the Ranier Racing #28 T-Bird, and promptly qualified on the outside pole for the race, then finishing 6th in his Twin 125 qualifier. He showed good speed in the 500, running second to leader Elliott early on, before losing a wheel on a botched pit stop and losing several laps for repairs.

Davey Allison won the pole. In the first Gatorade 125 on Thursday, Richard Petty edged Hut Stricklin for second place, placing Petty third on the grid. A notable absentee was 1972 Daytona 500 winner A. J. Foyt. Foyt was badly injured in the Texaco-Havoline 200 IndyCar race at Road America in the fall of 1990. He suffered severe injuries to his feet and legs, and spent several months out of a racecar before returning to action at Indianapolis in May 1991. Foyt missed his first Daytona 500 since 1965. The race also marked Rod Osterlund‚Äôs final race as an owner. Pit rules This race began a series of changes to pit road procedure after the death of a Melling Racing rear tire changer in a pit road accident at Atlanta the previous November. *Changing tires under caution was banned, under any circumstances. Any tire changed under caution (even if it was flat) resulted in a one-lap penalty. *The signboard man was banned from standing in the pit lane. Instead, teams would utilize signboards on a long pole (i.e. the \\"lollipop\\") held by a crew member behind the wall. *Each car was given a sticker based on their starting position. The sticker was placed on the steering wheel for easy reference. The pit stall selection was staggered to prevent drivers in neighboring stalls from pitting at the same time: **Cars starting in odd-numbered positions were given a blue sticker with a white 1 on it; their pit stalls were selected from the odd-numbered stalls. **Cars starting in even-numbered positions were given orange stickers with a white 2 on it; their pit stalls were selected from the even-numbered stalls. *After a restart from a caution, the pits would be closed. On the second green lap, a blue flag was waved at the entrance of pit road, allowing only the cars with the blue stickers (odd) to pit for tires. On the next time around, an orange flag would be waved, allowing the cars with orange stickers (even) to pit for tires. *A new pit road speed limit was implemented at all times. During cautions, a second pace car was added, which would lead the cars entering the pits, and set the speed down the pit lane. *Penalties were severe: a 1-lap penalty for changing tires during a caution or pitting with the wrong group (blue/orange). A 15-second penalty for overshooting the pit stall, or for crew members jumping over the wall too soon. The new pit procedures changed the complexity of the race. Teams considered it too time-consuming to change four tires since it had to be done under green (at the time, a four-tire pit stop would take roughly 20‚Äì25 seconds). For an example of how the rules adversely affected the racing, Kyle Petty ran the entire 500 miles on the same left side tires. Bill Elliott suffered a flat tire early on, and was forced to limp around the track at a reduced pace for two laps before he was allowed to pit, effectively eliminating him from the competition. By April, the rules were changed. At Bristol, the blue/orange procedure was used only for cautions ‚Äì blue sticker cars pitting on the first lap under caution, orange sticker cars pitting on the second lap. On the restarts, blue sticker cars started on the inside and orange sticker cars on the outside. Lapped cars went to the rear. The blue/orange rule was eliminated during green flag stops. By the next week at North Wilkesboro, the blue/orange rule was scrapped. In its place, lead lap cars only were allowed to pit on the first caution, while lapped cars on the second lap. After a few weeks, the rules were relaxed further and eventually reverted nearly back to original regulations. The pit road speed limit and use of the \\"lollipop\\" style signboard were the only significant changes made permanent. No longer was a second pace car used to pace the speed in the pits. Drivers would be required to gauge their own speed (by checking their RPMs) and officials enforced the infractions with a system similar to VASCAR. The rule closing pit road when the caution comes out also remained in place, as well as only permitting lead lap cars to pit on the first caution lap (lapped cars on the second). Race The start Davey Allison led the first lap from Dale Earnhardt, who took the lead entering Turn 1. On the backstretch, Earnhardt obliterated a seagull. This adversely affected his car's water temperature, raising it at one point to . It forced Earnhardt's team to make emergency repairs under one of the many early cautions in the race. Early yellows Sprint car champion Sammy Swindell spun on the backstretch to bring out the first yellow flag. Five laps after the restart, Rick Wilson and Greg Sacks collided in Turn 1, ending Sacks' day. Just after the restart, Bill Elliott cut a tire, but had to wait for the proper lap for a pit stop. On lap 31, Jimmy Spencer's engine blew, filling the car with smoke. A fire also erupted just after Spencer climbed out to catch his breath. Meanwhile, turn 4 was coated with oil, gathering Jeff Purvis, Jimmy Means, Phil Barkdoll, and again Sammy Swindell. Barkdoll would soon spin again in Turn 4, blowing out his windshield in the spin and nearly flipping. The windshield slid across the track and into Ken Schrader's bumper and air dam, puncturing the radiator and causing a lengthy repair that eliminated the three-time Daytona 500 polesitter from contention. 1990 Winston Cup runner-up Mark Martin moved through the field quickly in the early going, but was also eliminated from contention as the center section of the car's rear gearing sheared completely off of the driveshaft, causing him to spend many laps behind the wall. Long green flag run On Lap 75, Geoff Bodine, Eddie Bierschwale and Phil Barkdoll ran three- wide coming out of turn 4. Bierschwale slid up the track and into Bodine's left-rear quarter panel, sending Bodine into a spin and into Jim Sauter, who was slowing to enter the pits. The caution flag came out and all four cars continued in the race. However, Bodine spent several laps in the pits because the rim of his left-rear wheel had been so badly warped in the collision that the crew could not remove the lug nuts to change the now flat left-rear tire. This incident effectively eliminated Bodine from contention and he later retired with an oil leak. This would be the last caution flag for over 100 laps, and the new pit rules confused the running order during the long green flag run. The lead changed hands many times, as Dale Earnhardt, Joe Ruttman, Davey Allison, Sterling Marlin, Rick Mast, Kyle Petty, Ernie Irvan, and Darrell Waltrip had all pitted on varying laps. Late-race drama With 16 laps to go, Richard Petty and off-road racer Robby Gordon tangled on the backstretch. Polesitter and leader Davey Allison pitted with the leaders, allowing Rusty Wallace to take the lead. He was quickly shuffled off of the lead on the restart, and was touched by Kyle Petty in Turn 4, which broke the car loose and sent him into a spin. Rick Mast narrowly avoided Wallace, but Darrell Waltrip, unsighted, collided with Wallace's left rear quarter panel, before Wallace slammed into the inside retaining wall, eliminating both cars. Seconds later, Derrike Cope lost control entering the tri-oval while trying to avoid Waltrip's damaged car. Cope spun across the infield and back across the track almost at the start/finish line and into the path of Hut Stricklin. With nowhere to go, Stricklin slammed nearly head-on into the rear of Cope's car, sending him bouncing off Harry Gant's car and down the straightaway with no brakes and virtually no steering. At the final restart on lap 193, the order was Earnhardt, Irvan, Petty, Ruttman, Marlin, Mast, and Allison, the only cars remaining on the lead lap. Leader Dale Earnhardt was passed by Ernie Irvan a lap after the green flag returned, and Davey Allison made up four positions in one lap to run third. Irvan began to pull away while Earnhardt spent several laps battling Davey Allison for 2nd. With 2 laps to go, Earnhardt got loose while running side by side under Allison exiting turn 2. The two cars tapped each other, pushing Allison into the outside wall briefly before the car spun into the infield towards Lake Lloyd, slamming into the earthen embankment as Allison had done early in the 1989 race. Earnhardt spun down the backstretch and into the path of Kyle Petty, who slammed into Earnhardt's right front fender, launching the car into the air briefly before it landed back on its wheels. Ernie Irvan coasted to the checkers to become the first Californian since Marvin Panch in 1961 to win the Daytona 500. Results {class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" style=\\"font-size:95%\\" |- ! Pos !

It was based in Baja California and also claimed (but never controlled) Sonora. Walker's exploits generated interest back in San Francisco, where bonds for the Republic of Sonora were sold, and its flag was even raised in places. His enterprise, however, suffered from a lack of supplies and discontent from within; resistance by the Mexican government quickly forced Walker to retreat. History In the summer of 1853, an American adventurer and filibuster named William Walker traveled to Guaymas seeking a grant from the government of Mexico to create a colony that would serve as a fortified frontier, protecting US soil from raids by Native Americans. Mexico refused, and Walker returned to San Francisco determined to obtain his colony anyway. He began recruiting American supporters of slavery and Manifest Destiny, mostly inhabitants of Kentucky and Tennessee. His proposed buffer colony turned into plans to establish the independent Republic of Sonora as a part of the American Union, like the Republic of Texas. He funded his project by \\"selling scripts which were redeemable in lands of Sonora.\\" On October 15, 1853, Walker set out with 45 men to invade and conquer the Mexican territories of Baja California and Sonora. He succeeded in capturing La Paz, the capital of sparsely populated Baja California, and declared the Republic of Baja California, with himself as president and his partner, Henry P. Watkins, as vice president. He then put the region under the laws of the American state of Louisiana, where slavery remained legal in 1854. He declared independence from Mexico on January 10, 1854. Fearful of attacks by Mexico, Walker moved his position twice over the next three months, first to Cabo San Lucas, and then further north to Ensenada to maintain a more secure position of operations. He never gained control of Sonora but three months later, he pronounced Baja California part of a larger Republic of Sonora.Filibustering: William Walker. CRWFlags.com. Accessed March 11, 2012. Walker's exploits generated large amounts of interest back in San Francisco, where bonds for the Republic of Sonora were sold and its flag was even raised in places. However, Walker was never able to take advantage of his project's popularity. A serious lack of supplies, discontent within his party and an unexpectedly strong resistance by the Mexican government quickly forced Walker to retreat.William Walker. Tennessee History for Kids. Accessed March 11, 2012. Back in California, Walker was put on trial for conducting an illegal war. The judge indicated that Walker was guilty of violating the peace treaty agreed upon by the United States and Mexico after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì48). However, it was the era of Manifest Destiny, and, consequently, his filibustering project was popular in the southern and western United States. Because of this, the jury took only eight minutes to acquit him.The Biography of William Walker. About.com. Accessed March 11, 2012.

Davey Allison of Robert Yates Racing won the race after leading 127 laps, including the final 30. Sterling Marlin won the pole, driving the No. 22 Ford for Junior Johnson & Associates. Richard Petty gave the command to start the engines from the cockpit of the famous #43 Pontiac for his team in his final appearance in the race as a driver. This would also be the final Daytona 500 start for 1972 winner A. J. Foyt, who would also start his final Indianapolis 500 later that year. Rick Wilson made his final start for the Stavola Brothers. This was Rahmoc Enterprises last race. It also marked the debut of Joe Gibbs Racing in the form of the green and black No. 18 Chevrolet, with Dale Jarrett as the driver. The start The initial part of the race was clean, though Geoff Bodine and Morgan Shepherd touched exiting Turn 4 with no further incident. Brett Bodine and Ricky Rudd fell out in the first half of the race with separate engine failures, as the Junior Johnson cars of Sterling Marlin and Bill Elliott established themselves as the cars to beat. Davey Allison's crew gambled with a two-tire change, but caught a lucky break when Geoff Bodine was penalized for speeding, and gained a drafting partner. The Big One Rain fell after 80 laps, and when the race restarted Ernie Irvan went for the lead on lap 92. He came up in front of Sterling Marlin, but had not cleared him, and also moved him up the track into his teammate Bill Elliott who was on the outside. The ensuing mayhem collected polesitter Sterling Marlin, Ernie Irvan, Bill Elliott, Mark Martin, Ken Schrader and Dale Earnhardt. Also, Bobby Hillin Jr., Dale Jarrett, Alan Kulwicki, Chad Little, Richard Petty, Hut Stricklin, Rusty Wallace, and Darrell Waltrip were involved. The wreck ended the race for Jarrett, Schrader, Marlin, Hillin, and Little, with their cars being terminally damaged. The finish On Lap 144 Rick Wilson was planning to pit the Stavola Brothers Ford, but Kerry Teague did not realize it and ran into him. This brought out the third yellow flag in the race. On Lap 166 Ernie Irvan's crippled car spun to bring out the fourth caution flag. Leaders Allison, Shepherd, and Michael Waltrip made their final stops. Waltrip fell back after the restart with an engine that was quitting. This left the two Ford Thunderbirds of Allison and Shepherd to race for the win, finishing in this order. This win made the Allisons the second father-son duo to win the Daytona 500, joining Lee and Richard Petty. Alan Kulwicki finished a quiet fourth which kicked off an unlikely championship run.

Dale Jarrett won the race. Summary Kyle Petty's No. 42 won the pole, putting a Petty on the Daytona 500 pole for the first time since 1966, and only the second time ever. Kyle was also the first North Carolina driver to win the 500 pole since Benny Parsons in 1982. His father Richard waved the green flag in the first Winston Cup race held since his retirement. The start The first lap was led by rookie Jeff Gordon, who was the youngest winner of a Gatorade 125-mile qualifier on Thursday. Shortly after this, CBS reporter Chris Economaki said that Rookie of the Year is an award he would be almost assured of. Engine failures for Dick Trickle and Jimmy Hensley (the latter would crash in Turn 1 in his substitution for the injured Jimmy Means) brought out the first two caution flags in the first 15 laps. Mid-race summary Over the next 110 laps, Dale Earnhardt, Ken Schrader, and Kyle Petty would lead the majority of the laps, with Jeff Gordon and Bobby Hillin Jr. leading a handful of laps as legitimate leaders. 1990 winner Derrike Cope and Harry Gant also led several of these laps, but they had pitted under the early yellows to stretch their fuel runs. Meanwhile, two-time winner Bill Elliott dropped out of the race on lap 99, the victim of overheating in his #11 Ford Thunderbird. Closing stages Dale Earnhardt was the leader on Lap 130 when Wally Dallenbach Jr. brushed the Turn 4 wall. Sterling Marlin and Michael Waltrip were lined up behind him, and when Marlin backed off, Waltrip tagged him and sent him into a spin. Marlin caught air as he spun by Joe Ruttman, who was coming to pit road to retire with engine failure. 5 laps after the restart, Rick Wilson and Bobby Hamilton collided on the backstretch. Approaching 50 laps to go, 1991 Daytona 500 winner Ernie Irvan was turned into the wall exiting Turn 2, eliminating a possible winner. The first major wreck happened when Dale Earnhardt touched 1992 Indianapolis 500 winner Al Unser Jr. (competing in his only Winston Cup Series race). His #46 Chevrolet crashed into the 90 of Bobby Hillin Jr., who spun into the path of polesitter Kyle Petty. Both had a heated verbal exchange, Hillin reportedly was telling Petty he had no brakes, but both were victims of circumstances. With 31 laps to go, Derrike Cope and Waltrip touched in Turn 2. Waltrip spun down into 1989 Winston Cup Champion Rusty Wallace and sent him into a horrific series of barrel rolls in the grass. A little more than minute later, Ken Squier reported that Wallace came on the radio to crew chief Buddy Parrott and said, \\"I'm okay.\\" The finish By this time, Hut Stricklin and Sterling Marlin presented themselves as contenders. Earnhardt led from the restart, only to be passed briefly by Dale Jarrett. The #3 was soon in the lead again, as he was pursued by the Chevrolets of Jarrett and Jeff Gordon, and the Fords of 1986 Daytona 500 winner Geoff Bodine, Hut Stricklin, Mark Martin, and Morgan Shepherd. The \\"Dale and Dale Show\\" commenced as Jarrett passed Earnhardt in the tri-oval as they took the white flag. As the leaders exited Turn 2, the CBS Sports producers told Ken Squier and Neil Bonnett through their headsets to let Ned Jarrett to \\"call his son Dale home\\". In response, Jarrett called the finish thus: > \\"Come on, Dale! Go, baby, go! All right, come on! I know he's got it to the > floorboard; he can't do anymore! Come on! Take 'er to the inside! Don't let > 'em get on the inside of you comin' around this turn! Here he comes, > Earnhardt; it's the \\"Dale and Dale Show\\" as we come off Turn 4! You know who > I'm pulling for, it's Dale Jarrett. Bring her to the inside, Dale! Don't let > him get down there! He's gonna make it! Dale Jarrett's gonna win the Daytona > 500!!!\\" The next weekend at Rockingham, Ned reportedly apologized to Earnhardt for his obvious show of bias, to which an understanding Earnhardt replied, \\"I'm a daddy too.\\" Results {class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" style=\\"font-size:95%\\" |- !

Loy Allen Jr., ARCA graduate and Winston Cup rookie, driving the No. 19 for TriStar Motorsports, won the pole. Speedweeks 1994 was marked by tragedy when two drivers, Neil Bonnett and Rodney Orr, were killed in separate practice accidents for this race. Sterling Marlin in the Morgan-McClure Motorsports No. 4 won the race, the first win of his NASCAR career. Tragedies During Speedweeks, on the first day of practice for the Daytona 500, legendary driver Neil Bonnett crashed in turn four. Bonnett died at Halifax Hospital from massive head injuries. Three days later, reigning Goody's Dash Series (NASCAR's four- cylinder class) champion, Rodney Orr, making his Cup debut, lost control and spun in turn two. His car flipped and hit the catch fence with the roof above the driver's seat. Orr was killed instantly. Following these tragedies, a worried Rusty Wallace gave a lecture, calling out the drivers for over- aggression on the track, during the pre-race Drivers Meeting. In his lecture, Wallace was extremely critical of the drivers taking bold risks such as gambling on their tires, making overly-aggressive moves early in the races, and not taking much time to fix any damages to their car on pit road. In conclusion, he told the drivers, \\"Use your damn heads!\\" He was given a round of applause from the drivers and teams after his lecture. In the middle of the Goodyear-Hoosier tire war, Hoosier released teams from their contracts three days following Orr's death. Hoosier received blame from some observers as the tires were the only linking factor between the two deaths. However, the criticism was purely speculative and NASCAR never blamed the tires for the deaths and never offered an official cause of the accident for either fatality. An investigation done by the Orlando Sentinel blamed Orr's crash on a broken right-rear shock absorber mounting bracket. That same part was reportedly broken on Bonnett's car. NASCAR refused to comment on the outside investigation. Summary Loy Allen, Jr. failed to lead a lap. Ernie Irvan and Dale Earnhardt swapped the lead several times in the first 60 laps (which turned out to be a preview of the Championship battle), with Jeff Gordon leading briefly. The Big One happened on lap 62 when Chuck Bown and Kyle Petty touched in Turn 4. Petty, Robert Pressley, John Andretti and Rusty Wallace were done for the day. Hut Stricklin, Harry Gant, Bobby Hillin Jr., and rookie Jeff Burton, among others, were also involved. The race restarted with Daytona 500 rookie Todd Bodine in the lead. He was soon passed by Earnhardt and was then tagged by Gordon whom Todd thought he was clear of. Jimmy Spencer, Ted Musgrave, Brett Bodine and Michael Waltrip were caught up in a chain reaction to Bodine's spin; Brett and Waltrip would continue. The finish The yellow flag was displayed with 60 laps to go when Morgan Shepherd spun, which made for interesting fuel mileage strategy. Earnhardt, Irvan, and Mark Martin came into the pits again for extra fuel. 1990 winner Derrike Cope led the field at the restart, only to be passed by Marlin and Irvan a couple of laps later. Irvan took the lead with 43 laps to go, but on Lap 180 he suddenly got loose in Turn 4. He recovered the car, but Marlin retook the lead as Irvan fell back to 7th. With 12 laps to go, Irvan was repassed by Martin, whom he had passed a few laps before, but with eight laps to go the Ford duo tag- teamed Jeff Gordon for 3rd and 4th. The two Fords swapped positions with five laps to go, and Irvan passed Terry Labonte (who was hung up behind Jimmy Hensley) in the tri-oval with three laps to go. But Sterling Marlin's Morgan- McClure Chevrolet was untouchable, and he finally won a Winston Cup race in his 279th start after eight second-place finishes. He broke Dave Marcis' previous record for most starts before his first Cup win (227th start, at Martinsville in 1975). Martin ran out of fuel with two to go, but he managed to take the white flag to complete 199 laps. Race results {class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" style=\\"font-size:95%\\" |- ! Pos ! Grid ! ! Driver !

Dale Jarrett won his first career Winston Cup pole. Sterling Marlin won the race for the second straight year, his second Daytona 500 win. Background Daytona International Speedway, the track where the race will be held. Daytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida that is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track also features two other layouts that utilize portions of the primary high speed tri-oval, such as a sports car course and a motorcycle course. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation. The track was built by NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. to host racing that was being held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004, and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010. The Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar. It is also the series' first race of the year; this phenomenon is virtually unique in sports, which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start. Since 1995, U.S. television ratings for the Daytona 500 have been the highest for any auto race of the year, surpassing the traditional leader, the Indianapolis 500 which in turn greatly surpasses the Daytona 500 in in-track attendance and international viewing. The 2006 Daytona 500 attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers. Race summary Opening laps Outside polesitter Dale Earnhardt led the opening lap for the first time in his Daytona 500 career. Lap 3 saw Sterling Marlin in the Morgan- McClure Motorsports No. 4 car take the lead. The first yellow flag came out on lap 10 when Joe Nemechek (in his first race for his own team) crashed and collected Brett Bodine. Two laps after the restart, IMSA and IndyCar veteran Davy Jones touched with fellow rookie Randy LaJoie exiting turn 4, clipping the wall and spinning the Jasper Motorsports No. 77 car into the pits. Before 30 laps were put on the board, sprint car king Steve Kinser crashed with Phil Parsons. Jeff Gordon took the lead from Marlin during the yellow flag pit stops. After the restart, Mark Martin and 1985 and 1987 winner Bill Elliott stopped for flat tires. On lap 43, John Andretti and 1990 winner Derrike Cope collided exiting turn 2. Both drivers continued with minimal damage, but as Cope came through the tri-oval to catch up to the field, both rear tires suddenly blew out, sending him into a harmless spin but rendering his car disabled as he could get no traction with both rear tires flat. On lap 58, Mike Wallace got loose in turn 2 and tagged Jeff Purvis, sending both cars into the wall and the 1994 and 1993 ARCA 200 winners respectively were finished for the day. Caution flag pit stops resulted in Dave Marcis staying out to lead one lap (a regular practice for Dave), and Mark Martin's Roush Racing crew placed his car in front. On lap 68, Gordon retook the lead. Mid-race events On lap 70, rain interrupted the race for 2 hours. Jeff Gordon led Marlin, Todd Bodine, Earnhardt and Ken Schrader when the red flag was withdrawn. On lap 97, Todd Bodine spun exiting turn 4 (whether or not contact with Robert Pressley caused it was unclear), and engine failure soon took him out after the restart. He joined Purvis, Mike Wallace, Kinser Parsons, and Nemechek as the 6 cars out of the race. During the pit stops, Gordon dropped from the lead to 20th after a very long pit stop. Earnhardt was the new leader, and at halfway he led Michael Waltrip, Morgan Shepherd, Marlin and Ken Schrader to the restart. With help from Marlin, the younger Waltrip took the lead from Earnhardt for 2 laps before the defending 500 winner retook the lead. Meanwhile, Gordon was reclaiming lost ground quickly and passed Michael Waltrip in turn 2 on lap 109 to re-enter the top 10. On lap 131, Dave Marcis hit the turn 3 wall and slowed to a stop in the middle of turns 3 and 4. After the restart, a small dispute developed in his pits centering on the status of his unused tires. The Penske team showed up to make an offer for the tires, but Marcis wanted the tires to go to Richard Childress Racing and Earnhardt, for whom Marcis and his team had done many miles of testing and from whom he had received an engine for the race. \\"I may not have been in the Daytona 500 if it wasn't for Richard Childress,\\" said Marcis of the former owner-driver. Going through all of this, Marlin retained the lead until, with 40 laps to go, rookie Randy LaJoie spun on the backstretch and lost his windshield. As the yellow flag was being waved, Bobby Hamilton made contact with Rusty Wallace, resulting in Wallace's fifth straight Daytona 500 crash (4 of which resulted in a DNF, with the 1992 running as the exception). Rick Mast led a lap during the caution. 1989 winner Darrell Waltrip had a transmission failure that would cost him 20 laps to repair. Meanwhile, Gordon suffered an aerodynamic setback that would cost him the race. The jack was let down too soon on the driver's side during the tire change, and the fender was bent by the left front tire. Earnhardt would lead the field to the restart, and afterward, Gordon would brush the wall in his now ill-handling car. He brought the Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 car in for a correctional pit stop and lost a lap. Finish With 20 laps to go, Marlin passed Earnhardt for the lead on the back straightaway. With 15 laps to go, Bobby Labonte (in his first race for Joe Gibbs Racing) crashed in turn 1, nearly collecting his older brother Terry. Earnhardt came in for 4 new tires, gambling that maneuverability would be more valuable than track position. Just before the restart, rookie Robert Pressley spun in the short chute before turn 1 after contact from Dick Trickle. When the green was waved Earnhardt quickly re-entered the top 10, and with 10 to go, he was side by side with Ricky Rudd for 9th. He passed Mark Martin for the second position with 4 laps to go, but Sterling Marlin's Chevrolet was not to be denied. This was Sterling Marlin's second Winston Cup win, both of which were in the Daytona 500. Marlin also joined Richard Petty (in the 1974 race) and Cale Yarborough (in 1984 race) as the only drivers who have won back-to-back Daytona 500's; this has not been done (until the 2020 race) when Denny Hamlin joined. Martin went to third while his teammate Ted Musgrave finished fourth and 1993 winner Dale Jarrett (who started on the Pole) finished 5th. This was Richard Petty's only Daytona 500 as a broadcaster, and the first Daytona 500 to be broadcast with a reduction in availability. As a result of the Fox affiliate switches of 1994, many markets where CBS lost major affiliates and were relegated to minor affiliates could not receive the race, including three markets where a NASCAR-sanctioned national series races were held -- Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Detroit.

Dale Jarrett won the pole and Jeff Gordon won the race, making this his third Daytona 500 win. Kurt Busch finished second and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. finished third. As the result of NASCAR's implementation of the green-white-checker finish rule the previous season, the race had three extra laps due to a caution with three laps to go, reaching a total distance of 203 laps and . Because of that, this was the first Daytona 500 to go longer than 500 miles. It was also the first Daytona 500 to end at sunset, around 6:18 pm EST. A crowd of 200,000 people were estimated to have attended this race. Qualifying and Gatorade Duels Three- time Daytona 500 champion Dale Jarrett won his third pole for this race with a speed of . 2001 and 2003 winner Michael Waltrip won the first Gatorade Duel and 2002 Cup Series champion Tony Stewart won the second. The main story focusing on the Gatorade Duels was an accident involving Jimmie Johnson and Kevin Harvick, which turned into a minor feud.2005 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series#Gatorade Duel Race summary The green flag waved with Dale Jarrett leading the field, but he lost the first lap to Jimmie Johnson and fell back through the field after a small bump from behind from defending Daytona 500 champion Dale Earnhardt, Jr.. Tony Stewart took the lead from Johnson on lap 4 and led 12 laps. The first caution came out on lap 15 halfway through the first fuel run when Bobby Labonte blew an engine. Scott Wimmer, who had only changed two tires, led when the race restarted. The second caution flew on lap 28 when Ricky Rudd spun out in the middle of the field, collecting five cars. On lap 36, Matt Kenseth, one of the pre-race favorites in trouble with a smoking exhaust, pitted under green. On lap 61, there came to the start of green-flag pit stops, with the Dodges coming in first, as they did not get as good fuel mileage as others. Earnhardt, Jr. was pushed by Jeff Burton coming into his pit stop, and had to back up to get out after his tires were changed, causing him to drop down through the field. There was a total of seven speeding violations on pit road during these pit stops, most notably Johnson. Once the green flag pit stops cycled through on lap 64, Jeff Gordon had the lead. Debris on the racetrack brought out the third caution on lap 86, with Gordon still out in front. Stewart led the race at the restart, and he was still leading at halfway and when the fourth caution came out on lap 105 for debris. On lap 137, there came another round of green-flag pit stops, with Stewart still taking the lead. The fifth caution came out on lap 144 and the sixth one came on lap 155. Waltrip brought out the seventh caution, allowing him to leave the race and led to another round of pit stops on lap 164. Jason Leffler and Kasey Kahne came together on pit road, dropping them both down the field. The wreck on pit road occurred when Kasey Kahne, who was 4th when the pit stops began, was exiting his pit stall, and Leffler was turning into his, unbeknownst to Kahne. Kahne would later rebound before becoming a victim of a couple of crashes not of his own making. With 32 laps to go, John Andretti, running three-wide and following a group of cars going four-wide, crashed and turned into Leffler, taking that driver out of the race. This would bring up the eight caution, with Stewart still out in front. Stewart became the first driver since Bobby Allison in 1981 and 1982 to lead the most laps in two consecutive Daytona 500's. The \\"Big One\\" occurred on lap 184. This began when Greg Biffle ran into Scott Riggs, collecting 11 cars in turn 3. Scott Wimmer's car took the worst of it, as his car went onto the apron, flipped over four times, spun on its nose, and crashed hard on its wheels. This crash brought out the ninth caution. Only some cars chose to pit, and Stewart and the others stayed out. Earnhardt, Jr., who had languished in midfield for the earlier part of the race, was now up to third place. Kasey Kahne was right in the middle of this crash in his #9 mango colored Dodge Charger, but managed to miss it. Kahne charged again back up through the field when the race went back green. When the race restarted on lap 187, Andretti drove straight into Mike Skinner, starting a chain reaction crash (another \\"Big One\\") involving at least eight cars, bringing out the immediate 10th caution. This crash was the result of someone (possibly Skinner) missing a gear at the restart. Kasey Kahne was also involved in this crash, because as he checked up Dale Jarrett in the 88 accidentally punted him into the infield grass. Kahne spent a lot of time on pit road, but he did not lose a lap, and apparently his car was, or should have been being checked for fender rubs, when the race restarted Kahne made his way from about the 20th position to about the 8th position, but there was clearly still a tire rub on his right front fender; because it was clearly smoking, and FOX commentator Darrel Waltrip even made mention of it, as he made his way back up through the field again. The race restarted with six laps to go. With five to go, Earnhardt, Jr. briefly took the lead, but Stewart retook it on the next lap. The two drivers raced side-by-side until Earnhardt, Jr. retook the lead. Gordon took the lead before the 11th caution came out with three laps to go. The caution came out when Kasey Kahne was on the outside moving forward from the 8th position trying keep his momentum up and move into the top 6 or so, as Kurt Busch made a pass on Tony Stewart, who was in the lead; but Jeff Gordon was also fighting on the outside with Stewart for the lead; Kahne slid up the race track hard probably due to a cut tire and as he did so, his teammate Jeremy Mayfield in the 19 car apparently got into the back of him as well and Kahne went into the wall. He could not get off the wall until about the middle of the backstretch, when NASCAR finally brought out the caution. Kahne would end up scored 22nd after being crashed while running 7th and possibly moving up into the top 5 to contend for the win. Oddly as the cars came around for the green flag Kahne's teammate Jeremy Mayfield came down to pit road from running 9th on the track, but apparently returned to the race and would end up finishing a position behind his teammate. The race length of 200 laps and was completed under yellow, so a green-white-checker finish would take place. The race restarted on lap 202 with two laps to go. Despite much activity behind him, Gordon was able to hold off Kurt Busch and Earnhardt, Jr. to win his third Daytona 500 victory. This was the third-slowest Daytona 500 to go the distance, with only both the 1960 and 2011 races were slower. Two other runnings of this race in the 2000s were also slower, but they both were rain-shortened. Results {class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" style=\\"font-size:95%\\" |- ! Pos ! Grid ! Car ! Driver !

In Oak Park alone, Roberts designed over 200 houses. Early life Eben Ezra Roberts was born in Boston and attended public school. His father trained him in both mechanical and freehand drawing as he grew up.Hackl. Marty. \\"Eben E. Roberts ,\\" Oak Park Tourist/Historical Society of Oak Park and River Forest, 2003. Retrieved 15 June 2007. His family moved to Meredith, New Hampshire where Roberts' education continued in public schools there. He went on to study architecture at Tilton Seminary, now known as Tilton School, in New Hampshire. Career In 1888 Roberts moved to Chicago where he worked as a site superintendent for S.S. Beman at Pullman, on the south side of the city. Roberts remained at that job until 1893. Roberts moved to the Chicago suburb of Oak Park in 1893 and established his own practice which eventually grew to become the largest architecture firm in the village of Oak Park, rivaling even architecture giant Frank Lloyd Wright's practice. In Oak Park he designed over 200 homes which span a multitude of architectural styles.Sacchi, Lonnie. \\"From castles to Canavares,\\" Riverside/Brookfield Landmark, 10 April 2007.

Roberts' practice in Oak Park grew quickly and he soon employed several draftsmen.Guarino, Jean L. \\"Park Grove Manor,\\" Village of Oak Park Landmark Nomination Form, 26 March 2004. Despite eventually working in Chicago, Roberts remained an Oak Park resident until he died in 1943. Roberts and his wife Rossie Roberts (n√©e Willey) lived in the Eben Ezra Roberts House on Superior Street in Oak Park for most of the time they were in the village. At that home, now a contributing property to the U.S. federally Registered Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District, Roberts and his wife raised their two children Margaret and Elmer C. Roberts. Roberts' Oak Park firm, established in 1893, maintained two offices: one was at Marion Street and North Blvd in the Dunlop Brothers Bank Building, the other was along Superior Street. After the office moved to 82 West Washington Street in Chicago in 1912 Roberts' son, Elmer, began to work in the practice as a draftsman until he left for architectural school in 1913. When the younger Roberts graduated he became a staff member and in 1924 he became a full partner. E.E. Roberts became ill in 1926 and went into retirement, though he worked as an adviser to the firm for some time after leaving.Heitzman, Frank. \\"Maze Branch Library,\\" Village of Oak Park Landmark Nomination Form, 22 July 2005. In 1930 the pair designed the Borden Dairy Building on Vincennes Road in Blue Island, Illinois in the Art Deco style. Works and style The E.J. Wiswall House, an E.E. Roberts building in DeKalb, Illinois. Roberts designed buildings in many styles but after he began accepting mostly commercial commissions he favored Prairie style and its emphasis on horizontal lines. It is his work in this early modern style and the architectural transformation that took place in the early 20th century for which he is remembered. Roberts 1890s designs were aimed at popular tastes at the time. He designed homes across the gamut of architectural styles, Queen Anne, Shingle style and Tudor Revival are but some of the examples of the styles his homes conformed to. In 1900 Roberts work underwent a distinct shift with the design of the A.J. Redmond House in Oak Park. His residential work began to adapt a more horizontal emphasis, featuring broad windows, hip roofs, wide eaves and large pier-supported porches dominating the front facade. Many of Roberts' early 20th century residential works are of this type, commonly following the stock American Foursquare plan with wood-trimmed stucco exteriors and full-width porches with massive corner piers. The homes varied in decorative details such as dormers and other exterior features. The horizontal emphasis, broad, overhanging eaves and hip roofs are all common elements of Prairie style, a school many houses of the foursquare tradition adhere to. Other examples of Roberts' Prairie style residential work is found in Oak Park houses such as the Henry P. Magill House, the Frank W. Hall House, Charles Schwerin House and the Louis Brink House.

The legend predicts that in the end times, a last emperor would appear on earth to reestablish the Roman Empire and assume his function as biblical katechon who stalls the coming of the Antichrist. The legend first appears in the 7th-century apocalyptic text known as the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius; that and the oracles of the Tiburtine Sibyl are its two most important sources. It developed over the centuries, becoming particularly prominent in the 15th century. The notion of Great Catholic Monarch is related to it, as is the notion of the Angelic Pope. Foundations The legend is based on the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius, which was, after the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation, \\"the most widespread apocalypse story in Europe\\". The work proposes a Last Emperor who will fight against religious enemies, most notably the then-recent spread of Islam during the Early Muslim conquests: he will \\"go forth against them [the enemies of the faith] from the Ethiopian sea and will send the sword and desolation into Ethribus their homeland, capturing their women and children living in the Land of Promise\\". After conquering his enemies he would travel to Jerusalem and relinquish his power on the Mount of Olives. The Last Emperor was further developed in the writings of Adso of Montier-en-Der, whose Libellus de Antichristo (ca. 954) was a popular biography of the Antichrist, whose coming was preceded by the rise of a Frankish ruler (the continuation of the Roman Empire); this Last Emperor would voluntarily give up his power and die, after which the Antichrist comes to power. Another important impetus came from the oracles of the Tiburtine Sibyl, first recorded in Latin around the year 1000; its legend proved particularly adaptable to rulers all over Europe, containing as it did a list of emperors and kings leading up to the Last Emperor which could be revised or added to as political and dynastic circumstances required. It still had great currency in the fifteenth century. Catholic tradition The concept of the Great King features prominently in mystical and folk traditions, as well as writings of people thought to have been granted gifts of prophecy or special visitations by messengers from heaven (such as angels, saints, or Christ). The Great Catholic Monarch was very popular in popular folklore until the 18th century Enlightenment. He reappeared in 19th century prophecy when French legitimists believed that the count of Chambord, Henry V of France would be the new king. Marie-Julie Jahenny (1850-1941), also known as the \\"Breton\\" stigmatist, prophesied that Henry V, the Count of Chambord, was the chosen King. Despite his death, one of her predictions dated 1890 declares he is yet \\"reserved for the great epochs\\", i.e. the end of time.'Marie-Julie Jahenny, The 'Breton Stigmatist': Her life and Prophecies, www.mysticsofthechurch.com/2015/07/marie-julie-jahenny-breton- stigmatist.html An 1871 book, Future Career of Napoleon, advocated Napoleon III's reign as Roman Emperor over a 'new ten-kingdomed Roman Empire'. The Catechism of the Catholic Church speaks only of Christ as the king who is to be manifested in \\"the last days\\".Catechism of the Catholic Church, 671-672 It speaks of this manifestation as associated by his recognition by \\"all Israel\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 674 and preceded by the Church's ultimate trial, \\"a religious deception offering men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of apostasy from the truth. The supreme religious deception is that of the Antichrist, a pseudo-messianism by which man glorifies himself in place of God and of his Messiah come in the flesh\\".Catechism of the Catholic Church, 675 It makes no mention of the coming of any Great Catholic Monarch, whether French or German or of any continent. The French writer and Traditionalist Catholic Yves Dupont has opined that the Great Monarch will have a restorationist character and that he will restore European Catholic royalty, destroy the power of heretics and atheists, and successfully convert many Muslims and Jews to the Faith.See Catholic Prophecy: The Coming Chastisement by Yves Dupont See also * Grand Monarch * King Arthur's messianic return * Parousia * Pope Peter II * Sacred king * Second Coming * Son of Perdition * Tiburtine Sibyl References Bibliography * S.N., Mirabilis Liber, 1522 * Baethgen, Friedrich, Der Engelpapst: Vortrag gehalten am 15.

Each rocket can carry six or eight mines and has a range of around six or seven kilometres. The rockets are launched from a BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launcher system that can hold up to 24 of the rockets. A time fuse on the rocket is set before launch, which activates at a predetermined distance after firing. Upon activation, the rocket head bursts, ejecting the mines, which descend with small green parachutes that slow their fall. The mine consists of a cylindrical body with three prong legs that form a spike, which pierces the ground and arms. If the mine strikes soft ground, the spike is driven into the ground and the mine is held upright. Three variants of the mine exist: one with a magnetic fuse which detonates upon magnetic influence, one with a self-extending tilt rod fuse, and another with a contact baffle. In addition, the magnetic fuse mine has an anti-handling device. The mine's penetrator warhead uses the Misznay-Schardin effect to penetrate up to 110 millimetres of rolled homogeneous armour. The mines also have a self-destruct facility which can be set to between 4 and 72 hours, and will disarm itself after 72 hours. Operational history On 7 May 2011, C.J. Chivers of the New York Times reported military forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi scattered Type 84 Model A mines with magnetic fuses across the port of the disputed Libyan city of Misrata to threaten the city's sole route for evacuation and supplies. Delivered by a \\"Chinese-made variant of a Grad rocket\\", the mines were deployed at around 2100 or 2200 at night on 5 May. An estimated of at least 20 mines or 31 mines were dispersed across the port. A rebel truck patrolling the port hit two of the mines, injuring both men inside, with one seriously wounded. The incident was later confirmed by Human Rights Watch. Also in Libya, Type 84 mines were also found in the coastal town of Dafniya by DanChurchAid (DCA) and in the city of Sirte by the Swiss Foundation for Mine Action (FSD). In November 2011, two DCA staff were injured while trying to defuse a mine in Dafniya and had to be hospitalised. In March 2012, a DCA international deminer was killed by another mine while clearing buildings of explosives in Dafniya. As of April 2014, the Syrian ‚ÄúDignity Brigade‚Äù was in possession of Type 84 mines and components in the Golan Heights of the Syrian governorate of Quneitra, according to a video posted by the group, which depicted the submunitions. As of December 2016, the Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries were reportedly in possession of Type 84 mines, when Libyan National Army forces found an unused example left behind in the Ganfouda district of Benghazi in Libya.

The first European in the area was the explorer Major Thomas Mitchell on his way to discovering what he termed \\"Australia Felix\\" in 1836-37. Not long after, a sheep station was established by William Campbell, which incorporated the current townsite. Gold was discovered by shepherds on Dr Barker's sheep run at nearby Barkers Creek in 1851, spawning a large gold rush. Over 30,000 diggers arrived at Chewton within three months, soon followed by prospectors from around the world, including many Chinese. The town was surveyed in 1854 with land lots being sold the following year (1855). Chewton Post Office opened on 8 September 1857. A Forrest Creek Post Office had opened in 1852, which was replaced by Castlemaine in 1854. The Red Hill Hotel, constructed in 1854 is still standing today. By the 1860s the alluvial gold had been exhausted and efforts turned to underground shafts in search of gold bearing quartz reefs. Underground mining saw the immigration of Welsh and Cornish miners and some mines were very successful. The Wattle Gully mine founded in 1876 is still operating today. As gold mining wound down, the population declined to 1,212 in 1891 and 454 in 1933. While close to Castlemaine the town still maintains a distinct identity, but is slowly becoming a suburb of greater Castlemaine. Several historical buildings and sites, including the Chewton Town Hall (constructed in 1858) and the Post office (constructed in 1879) are now owned by the Chewton Domain Society, a community group established to manage the properties. The society also produces a monthly community newsletter. For several years, Chewton was host to a folk music festival over the Australia Day long weekend. In 2007, the festival relocated to nearby Newstead. The former railway station at Chewton closed to all traffic on 16 June 1976.

He has broadcast on environmental issues since the 1980s and has won many awards in print, TV and radio. Aside from his speciality he has covered many major general news stories. He is a Visiting Fellow at Green Templeton College, Oxford, an Associate Press Fellow at Wolfson College, Cambridge and has received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Cranfield University. Early life and career Harrabin was born and raised in Coventry, England where his father ran a building firm with his wife and brother. He attended Stivichall Primary School and King Henry VIII School. He then studied English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he was president of the Junior Common Room. He started a college newspaper. He began his career on the Coventry Evening Telegraph. He developed a specialism reporting on the city's ethnic minority population, who were previously largely ignored in the media. He won a prize in the British Press Awards in 1980 for a series of features tracing the roots of Coventry Asians back to Pakistan and India. He joined the independent Thames TV News as a producer whilst also freelancing for several years as a Saturday sports sub-editor in Fleet Street on The News of the World and The Sunday Mirror. During a spell at BBC Radio London he revealed how the Metropolitan Police was training its riot control officers using Roman Army tactics. BBC career Harrabin joined BBC radio's The World at One, where he won a succession of Media Natura Environment Awards for reports on issues related to the environment and development. He also won the One World Media award after revealing how changes in trade rules would affect sugar workers in Guyana, and a Sony Silver Award for reports on development dilemmas in Africa. He was shortlisted for Sony Reporter of the Year. The Today Programme created a roving role for him, and he spent a decade there travelling widely, reporting and organising series on issues like globalisation, health and the role of women. He won an award for an investigation into flower-growing in Kenya which showed that multi-national companies tended to take better care of their workers than local firms. He won another award for a feature on child labour in Bangladesh which demonstrated that for many girls, work in a \\"sweatshop\\" was preferable to the other alternatives of prostitution or working as a domestic servant in the Persian Gulf. Environmental issues In 2004 the BBC created the role of Environment Analyst so Harrabin could work across all media. He did reports for Newsnight on uncertainty in climate forecasting and on geoengineering to combat climate change. He won the Media Natura Award for TV documentaries for Gas Muzzlers, a film on green energy investment in President Bush's America. In 2007 he shared the Media Natura TV News award for films on the Ten o'Clock News. One report from Bangladesh highlighted the need for climate adaptation ‚Äì a topic little discussed at the time. Another report revealed how China was building two power stations a week. A third demonstrated why the Chinese need to increase energy production to tackle poverty. It also traced a Chinese-made energy-saving product ‚Äì dryerballs ‚Äì and showed how some people in the West were blaming China for its emissions created during the manufacture of goods for export. Harrabin popularised discussion of these \\"embedded\\" emissions, and showed that there were problems in all methodologies comparing international greenhouse gas emissions. In September 2010 he presented Uncertain Climate, a highly praised two-part documentary on Radio 4, which examined media depictions of climate change. He also reported for TV from a Chinese cave on how scientists are using stalagmites to decipher past monsoon patterns. Later that year he completed a documentary outlining the difficulties faced by organisers and delegates at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Harrabin was founder presenter of BBC Radio 4's environment magazine \\"Costing the Earth\\" which was created to bring a lighter touch to environmental issues and to question environmental goals. In 2015 Harrabin's report on renewable energy sources in Malawi, including a cook stove that charges mobile phones reportedly pulled in 22 million hits. Risk reporting and analysis Harrabin's reporting is dominated by risk issues. He states that often major risk issues fail to fit news criteria of novelty, drama, conflict, personality and pictures. This leads the media, he believes, to have given the wrong level of prominence to a range of risks including MMR, dirty bombs, child abduction, transport safety, exotic diseases, UK National Health Service \\"crisis\\", the Brent Spar oil platform, nuclear power and genetic modification. He argues that the media should find new ways of exploring long-term risk issues like preventive health and security of water, food, energy and climate. Public health Risk During a sabbatical at Green Templeton College, Oxford, he led a King's Fund paper \\"Health in The News\\" which researched the number of people needing to fall victim to a health problem for it to merit an item on national news. It showed that public health issues were massively under-reported compared with their impact on people's lives. Colleagues subsequently credited him with devising \\"Harrabin's Law\\" on disproportionate media coverage. On returning to the BBC he led pan-BBC reporting on a public survey which suggested that people in the UK were much more ready to accept tougher measures on smoking, drinking and obesity than previously believed. Public health has since risen up the agenda in the UK for government and media. Transport Risk Harrabin's investigations into transport safety expenditure on Today provoked a shift in the UK national debate. He questioned media demands for increased rail safety investment because trains were already statistically much safer than roads, which were starved of funds. After his Panorama examined the UK's poor record in child road safety the then Prime Minister Tony Blair increased road safety targets for children. Risk advisory role Harrabin co-wrote the BBC's guidance on reporting on risk with the head of BBC Politics, Sue Inglish. It calls for news instincts to be tempered by statistical perspective. Whilst on sabbatical at Wolfson College, Cambridge Harrabin set up the Cambridge Media and Environment Programme (CMEP) with Dr Joe Smith, now of the Open University. They worked in partnership with other BBC staff organising seminars with a broad range of views to stimulate discussion of the BBC's coverage of global risk issues covering the environment, economics, and society. After one seminar, the BBC concluded that as all major governments had apparently accepted the risk of climate change, arguments about the science of climate change should play a smaller part in the media than previously, whilst still being aired from time to time. Family Harrabin currently lives in Hampstead, London with his wife, with whom he has three children. He has two younger brothers.

Description The taruca is a medium-sized deer with a heavy body. It measures from head to rump, with a tail, and stands tall at the shoulder. Adults weigh between . As with most deer, males are significantly larger than females. It has sandy brown hair over most of its body, with white patches on the underside of its head, neck, tail, and genital region, and on the inner surface of its fore-legs. While females often have a dark brown area on the forehead, facial markings are much clearer in the males. The exact patterns vary between different males, but in general there is a black behind the nose, and a black Y or V pattern over the forehead and snout. Male tarucas have antlers, typically measuring in length once fully grown. Unlike all other South American deer, except for the closely related huemul, the antlers consist of just two tines, branching close to the base, and with the posterior tine being the larger. Males also possess canine teeth in their upper jaw, which females usually, but not always, lack. Distribution and habitat Tarucas are found only in the Andes mountains, from central Peru, through Bolivia and extreme north-eastern Chile, and into northern Argentina. In Argentina, they are found between , but the elevation of their preferred habitat gradually rises as they approach the equator, until it reaches in Peru. Within this region, they are found in grasslands marked by occasional shrubs and rocky outcrops, typically close to water. There are no recognised subspecies. Diet and behaviour Despite living in grasslands, the taruca feeds mainly on the local bushes, shrubs, and herbs for much of the year, but supplements this diet with grasses during the rainy season. Plants commonly eaten include dwarf gentian, ragworts, lupins, senna, valerian, and clubmosses. Tarucas may also feed on agricultural crops, such as alfalfa, barley, and potato plants. Tarucas are gregarious, but do not live in stable herds, with individuals moving between groups of up to thirty members each over the course of a few days. Their populations are scattered, due to their need for relatively specialised habitats, with population densities as low as , even away from human habitation. Individual groups are typically led by the females. During the breeding season, males may compete with one another, displaying threatening behaviour by raising their forelegs one at a time and pointing their antlers towards one another. Reproduction The rut lasts from May to July, during which time the deer segregate into smaller groups with a single adult male. Males drop their antlers immediately after the breeding season finishes, in September, with the new pair beginning to grow in December, and losing the velvet by February. Pregnancy lasts for 240 days, so that the single fawn is born between January and March, coinciding with the rainy season. Twins have been observed in captivity, but are rare. The mother leaves the group in order to give birth, and keeps the fawn hidden behind rocky outcrops for the first month of life.

The mine has a circular ribbed plastic case that is tapered towards the bottom. It uses an electronic fuze with a combination magnetic and seismic fuze; it also has an anti-handling device. The mine is armed by inserting an arming pin, which completes an electronic circuit. The mine indicates that it is armed by lighting a small LED light which switches off after 10 minutes. When a vehicle approaches, vibrations travelling through the ground trigger the seismic sensor, which activates the magnetic sensor. When a vehicle passes over the mine, the warhead is triggered. First a clearing charge fire, removing up to 100 millimeters of earth from the top of the mine, then a copper-lined Misznay Schardin effect warhead is triggered. This projects a slug of copper at high velocity into the bottom of the target. The mine is believed to be in Finnish service.

Hunt Stockwell appeared on The A-Team in its final season (season five, 1986‚Äì1987). He represented the dramatic shift that the A-Team underwent in the final season, as their new primary antagonist and boss. Similar to how Jack Ging was brought in the fourth season of the show,Bring Back... The A-Team (2006), Justin Lee Collins Robert Vaughn was cast partially in the hope that he could mend fences between George Peppard, whom he had long been a friend of, and Mr. T.\\"General Hunt Stockwell\\", The A-Team 24-7.CO.UK. Accessdate 2011-10-15 Fictional character biography The character of Stockwell first appears in the opening episode of the show's fifth season, \\"The Dishpan Man\\". In the first three episodes of the season (a story arc commonly referred to as either \\"The Court Martial\\" or \\"The Revolution\\"), it is through Stockwell's manipulation that the A-Team comes to work for him, offering them a pardon after fulfilling an unspecified number of missions that they perform for him. Stockwell is never accepted onto the team in any traditional sense, although he is shown to be capable of working with them quite well at times too. Nonetheless, a few episodes have the members of the team either threatening to kill, leave or otherwise rebel against Stockwell: * Murdock threatens to kill Stockwell in the \\"Court Martial\\" arc if he doesn't help him. * In the episode \\"Alive at Five\\", Face considers leaving the team after having had enough of Stockwell's manipulations. * Murdock is also later faced with an almost apathetic Stockwell when Murdock asks Stockwell to look into Face's paternity.In the episode \\"Family Reunion\\", season 5 episode 8. * Both Face and Murdock have a confrontation with Stockwell when they believe Hannibal might have died on a solo mission.In the episode \\"Point of No Return\\", season 5 episode 9. * Hannibal himself also has trouble with Stockwell's pressuring and manipulation in a few episodes, most notably \\"The Crystal Skull\\" and \\"Without Reservations\\". Even then, Stockwell does show a certain appreciation for the team, but it is balanced by his attitude towards their expendability, often given them certain time-related ultimatums. He shows some emotion when it comes to Hannibal, whom he seems to respect (even likening him to himself\\"You make fewer mistakes than anyone I have ever come across with the exception of my self. Don't make one at this stage in the game.\\", \\"Firing Line\\", season 5 episode 3.), and when he is confronted by Murdock and Face in \\"Point of No Return\\". From time to time however, he makes sure to remind the team that the missions are to be done \\"My way.\\" Not much is revealed of Stockwell's own history, although several pieces are filled in, in the episode \\"The Say U.N.C.L.E. Affair\\" (a reference to Robert Vaughn's starring role on the show The Man from U.N.C.L.E.), wherein he is betrayed and held captive by his former partner Ivan Trigorin (played by David McCallum, also Vaughn's co-star on The Man from U.N.C.L.E.). In the episode \\"Point of No Return\\" it is revealed Stockwell spent a great deal of time in Hong Kong, where he built up an extensive intelligence network. He also refers to operating in Cuba where he was captured and tortured alongside Trigorin. Stockwell is most often assisted by Carla, who also takes over the operation when Stockwell is captured. Stockwell has access to a large number of agents all over the world and numerous intelligence resources. As Stockwell himself explains:In his first appearance, the episode \\"Dishpan Man\\" (season 5 episode 1). \\"I work inside the system. I keep my skirts clean, I am a dedicated American patriot.\\" He is seen mostly in his private jet or at the A-Team's safehouse in Langley, Virginia (set up by Stockwell). His existence is mostly secret, and his operation is shown to be purely dependent on him, set to \\"dissolve\\" if Stockwell doesn't call in to an undisclosed location at certain intervals.As explained by Carla in \\"The Say U.N.C.L.E. Affair\\", season 5 episode 6. Stockwell heads the EIA (Enhanced Intelligence Assets) which draws its personnel from the DIA, CIA and FBI. He is rumored to be a 3 star general who turned down retirement as a 4 star general for this hands-on assignment reporting directly to the US President.

He worked, fundamentally, on medical history and anthropology.  Biography  He was born in Urrea de Ga√©n (Teruel, Spain) in 1908. He obtained the degrees of Medicine and Chemical Siences in the Central University of Madrid, and PhD in Medicine with the dissertation: \\"El problema de las relaciones entre la medicina y la historia\\" (The problem of the relationships between medicine and history\\". In the context of the Spanish Civil postwar period, he became an important member of the intellectual circle of the Falange. In 1942 he obtained the first chair of History of Medicine in the country, at the Central University of Madrid. In 1951, during the period of Joaqu√≠n Ruiz-Jim√©nez as Ministry of education, he became rector of the institution, creating a circle of certain political openness. He was a member of the Royal Spanish Academy, the Royal National Academy of Medicine and of the Royal Academy of History. He obtained the Prince of Asturias award for Communication and Humanities in 1989 and was awarded with the Men√©ndez Pelayo International Prize in 1991.  Philosophical work  His work is very varied and extensive. Regarding his historical- medical work, his works on medicine in classical Greece, his history and theory of clinical history and his works on Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal stand out. In addition, he coordinated a monumental Historia Universal de la Medicina (1972-1975) (Universal History of Medicine), in which not only all the Spanish specialists participated, but also renowned foreign historians of medicine. He published several books on philosophical anthropology in which he analyzed the profound nature of the human being and the current history and theory of the problem of body and soul.  Disciples  He was able to attract a good number of physicians around him who began to professionalize the History of Medicine (and, later, of science) in Spain. They stand out, among them, Luis S. Granjel (1920-2014), professor at the University of Salamanca, Jos√© Mar√≠a L√≥pez Pi√±ero (1933-2010) in Valencia, Juan Antonio Paniagua Arellano (1920-2010) in Navarra and Agust√≠n Albarrac√≠n Teul√≥n (1922-2001) and Diego Gracia Guill√©n (born in 1941), at the Complutense University of Madrid.

The plot focuses on an axe-wielding murderer named Madman Marz who, after accidentally summoned by a group of campers during a campfire tale, begins to stalk and murder the young adults. Originally based on the upstate New York urban legend of the Cropsey maniac, the film was conceived by Giannone and producer Gary Sales, both first-time feature filmmakers who had met in college. Their initial premise and main antagonist was changed last- minute due to conflicts with The Burning (1981), which featured the Cropsey villain and was in production at the same time. Madman was released theatrically in January 1982 by Jensen Farley Pictures, and received largely unfavorable reviews from critics. Though not prosecuted for obscenity nor officially listed as a video nasty, the film was seized by police forces in Hampshire, England during the video nasty panic. In the years since its release, Madman has achieved a cult following. In 2017, it was named one of the greatest slasher films of all time by Complex magazine. Plot A group of senior counselors and campers, T.P., Betsy, Ellie, Dave, Stacy, Bill, and the middle-aged head counselor Max, are gathered around a campfire and tell the legend of Madman Marz, who murdered his wife and children with an axe. He was set to hang, before he mysteriously broke free, escaping into the woods. Max explains that anyone that says his name will awaken him and he will attack that person. Richie, a cocky teenager, awakens Marz by shouting his name and throws a rock into his old home. Annoyed, Max ends the campfire session sending everyone to their cabins while he goes into town to stock up on supplies. Richie stays behind, and he sees Marz hiding in a tree, and sneakily follows him back to his house. While everyone is inside their cabins, Marz kills Chef Dippy. After the kids have gone to sleep, the rest of the counselors go to the rec room to relax; T.P. and Betsy kiss in a hot tub, unaware that Marz is watching them from outside. Meanwhile, Dave finds out that Richie didn't follow them back, and informs the counselors about this. T.P. searches the woods for Richie, and is hung by Marz with a noose up on a tree. T.P. is killed when Marz pulls down his legs and the noose snaps his neck. Marz later returns to the camp and grabs the axe out of the log. While Richie tries looking for a way back to camp, Dave ventures out into the woods due to Betsy worrying about T.P.'s disappearance. Dave is decapitated by Marz. Stacy tells Betsy to watch the kids in the meantime, and gets Ellie and Bill back to the camp due to the disappearances. Stacey drives out into the woods and, panicking from discovering Dave's headless body, tries to escape in her car in which stalls. She opens the car's hood, and Marz stands on top of the car just before he jumps down onto the hood, decapitating Stacy. Later, Ellie finds Madman Marz and screams, prompting Marz to flee and bringing Stacy's body with him. Bill soon arrives and consoles her while they try to head back to the camp using Stacy's car. Marz appears, and drags Bill out of the car to snap his back. Ellie is then chased back to the camp by Marz, and murders her with his axe. Unable to find a way back, Richie goes back to Marz' house and is horrified when he discovers the corpses of Marz' victims stashed in the basement. Meanwhile, Betsy arms herself with a double-barrel shotgun upon seeing Marz running through camp, and quietly makes her way to the kitchen cabin. Marz then slams an wounded Ellie into a window, and Betsy accidentally shoots her. The gunshots awaken the children, and she tells them to pack up and get on the bus they took to camp to escape. Marz briefly tries to get into the bus with Betsy, but she wards him off. She tells the bus driver to drive them out of the camp, and she chases after Marz to his home. Inside, Betsy is disarmed and attacked by Marz, who drags her down to the basement and impales her on a coat rack. She pulls out a hunting knife and stabs Marz in the shoulder, causing him to knock over a candle which sets the house on fire, including the bodies of his victims. Marz escapes, however, and disappears off into the woods. Max drives to the camp, and almost hits a shaken Richie out on the road. He gets out to console him, and Richie tells him that Marz is real. Cast Production Development In 1979, filmmakers Joe Giannone and Gary Sales, both graduates of Richmond College, were inspired to make a horror film after the commercial successes of recent low-budget horror films. In developing a screenplay, Sales recalled the urban legend of the Cropsey maniac which he had heard as a child, and suggested it as a possible basis for the story. The two devised the working title Madman: The Legend Lives, with Giannone writing the screenplay, while Sales attempted to find an investor to help fund the production. After numerous failed attempts at attracting an investor, producer Sam Marion agreed to help fund the picture. By 1980, Giannone and Sales had secured enough financing to enter production; it was during this time that the filmmakers became aware of Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs The Burning (1981), also featuring the Cropsey maniac. Because the two films resembled each other too much‚Äîwhich would lead to a canceling effect for both projects‚ÄîGiannone decided to halt production and rewrite the script. The idea of Cropsey was changed to the fictionalized \\"Madman Marz,\\" a farmer who had massacred his family and lynched by an angry mob, whose presence is claimed to still haunt the woods near his home. With a Frank Sinatra tour entitled Frank Sinatra: The Legend Lives being produced around the same time, the filmmakers also decided to alter the film's name to simply Madman. Casting An advertisement in Backstage was placed to cast the film, and an open audition was held in which around 300 actors attended. Paul Ehlers, originally an artist designing promotional materials for the film, was offered the role of the villain, Madman Marz, by Giannone. Ehlers had trained in martial arts for many years and so had the requirements to play the killer. For the role of Max, the middle-aged head counsellor, Giannone and Sales had originally wanted to approach screen legend Vincent Price, but with the movie being non-union, they felt that the actor would decline the offer. Gaylen Ross, who had previously starred in the zombie epic Dawn of the Dead (1978), was cast as the lead heroine, Betsy, and credited under the name Alexis Dubin. The rest of the cast were made up mainly of first-time actors. Filming During the summer of 1980, the producers had begun location scouting, eventually settling on Fish Cove in Southampton, Long Island, which provided all of the required locations in the script. Principal photography commenced in November 1980 at Fish Cove Inn in Southampton, for what was to be all-night shoots. As the leaves were starting to turn brown and fall from the trees, the production were forced to find as many as possible and paint them green to give the impression that the movie was set in summer. Fish Cove not only provided a large house to film in but also twenty-five cabins that the cast and crew could stay in. As it was out of season, the filmmakers had to hire out the entire camp. For the room and board that the complex offered, the crew was charged only $25 per head, with the staff having to work nights to accommodate for their guests. The special effects in the film were created with practical methods, some of which were dubious and demanded the scenes being filmed quickly: The opening scene, which sees Max tells the story of Madman Marz around a campfire, actor Tony Fish was given only one night to memorize the song that he sings in an effort to creep out his fellow counsellors, as the prosthetics for Madman Marz were late arriving on set, and the director was forced to rethink his shooting schedule. Other practical effects included dummy heads made of condoms with fake blood, which, when hit with an axe, created the image of a skull being crushed. On December 8, 1980, towards the end of the shoot, filming was abandoned for one day when news came over the radio that singer John Lennon had been murdered in New York. This senseless act of violence, carried out by an obsessive fan, took the entire nation by surprise and so as a mark of respect, the filming was put on hold for the day. Soundtrack Original music for Madman was created by Stephen (Steve) Horelick with Gary Sales filling the role as musical director.steveHmusic Release Box office Madman remained in distribution limbo through 1981 until being acquired by Jensen Farley Pictures at the end of the year. In January 1982, the film screened in Wilmington, Delaware and Detroit, Michigan. It had its premiere in New York City the following year on January 7, 1983, and in Los Angeles on February 18, 1983. Over the course of the year, became a sleeper hit in the drive-in circuit, and ultimately grossed $1.35 million in the United States.  Critical response  Linda Gross, of the Los Angeles Times, deemed the screenplay \\"predictable\\" and the film \\"another truly terrible and ludicrous horror movie about a crazy ax murderer lurking around a camp for gifted children.\\" The Journal News referred to it as \\"the first moronic exploitation movie\\" of the year, deeming it \\"the sort of movie that parodies the frustrations of everyday lifethe car that won't start when you most need it, the flashlight that refuses to light, the noose that won't untie once it's around your neck.\\" The Baltimore Evening Suns Lou Cedrone criticized the film's unoriginality, writing: \\"The butchery is the usual. There are decapitations and open gashes... There isn't a trace of intelligence in it.\\" Bill O'Connor of The Akron Beacon Journal wrote that the film \\"takes the simple scenario of jump-at-you and plays with it again and again. There is no attempt to add mystery to the plot. We know whodunit.\\" Variety awarded the film a favorable review, deeming it \\"a well-made, low-budget horror film.\\" AllMovie called it an \\"unremarkable slasher film\\", writing \\"only genre completists with completely undiscriminating tastes are likely to be frightened or entertained\\". Scott Weinberg of FEARnet gave the film a negative review, saying that Madman was \\"better left in the annals of your vague memory.\\" TV Guide gave the film a negative review, complimenting the film's photography, but also stated that the film was \\"predictable\\" and \\"boring\\" calling it \\"[a] wholly derivative splatter movie\\". Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews gave the film a grade D, calling it \\"Frightfully inept\\", and criticized the film's acting, execution, pacing, weak story line, and music. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Madman holds a 40% approval rating based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 3.99/10. Home media Madman was released on DVD in 2002 by Anchor Bay Entertainment with a non-anamorphic transfer. The film was again released on DVD by Code Red on September 28, 2010. This edition, though anamorphic, and containing numerous bonus materials, boasted an inferior transfer that lacked blue hues present in the original negative. On May 12, 2015 the independent label Vinegar Syndrome issued the film on Blu-ray for the first time, featuring a new 4K restoration from the original negatives. Legacy  In 2017, Complex named Madman the 25th greatest slasher film of all time.

She became a professor in the Politics Department at Lancaster University not long after its inception, later moving to Keele University where she remained until her retirement in 2002. Canovan published several books but is perhaps best known for her work on Hannah Arendt, particularly after accessing Arendt's unpublished papers in the late 1980s. Her book Hannah Arendt: A Reinterpretation of Her Political Thought (1992) was described by Gordon Tolle in The Review of Politics as \\"an excellent and comprehensive explanation of how Arendt's political theory emerges out of her early struggle to understand the new phenomenon of totalitarianism\\".The Review of Politics, Vol. 56, No. 2 (Spring, 1994), pp. 378-380) Her later work on nationalism was also received with international acclaim.

He was educated at Mr Binns' Highfield Academy and Manchester Grammar School. On Joseph Stott's death in 1894 George Stott took over his father's practice, trading as Joseph Stott and Son. George Stott adopted the triple brick arch system of flooring. His mills are known for their proportions and the meticulous detail of their facades. Manor and Kent Mills in Chadderton are two good examples. Another two are the Pine Mill and the Elm Mill (Newby). Stott designed mills in Ramleh Egypt and Brazil. He was a donor to the British Conservative Party. He died in December 1936. Abraham Henthorn Stott Houldsworth Mill, Reddish, A H Stott, 1865 Abraham Henthorn Stott was born on 25 April 1822 in the parish of Crompton. He served a seven- year apprenticeship with Sir Charles Barry, the architect of the Houses of Parliament and Manchester Art Gallery. He returned to Oldham in 1847 and founded the architectural practice of A H Stott and Sons, and was known for his innovative structural engineering. His brother Joseph Stott started his career here before leaving to start his own practice. After his retirement, the practice was renamed Stott and Sons. Three of his 9 children worked in the practice. Philip Sydney Stott Dee Mill, Shaw,1907, P.S.Stott Philip Sydney Stott (Sydney Stott) was the third son of A H Stott. He is regarded as Oldham's greatest architect. He established his own practice, P.S.Stott, in 1883. He was known as Sydney Stott until 1920, but adopted the title Sir Philip Stott on being made a baronet. He benefitted from the innovations made by his father and Edward Potts, another Oldham architect. His first mill design was for Chadderton Mill in 1885. Sydney designed 22 mills in Oldham and 55 elsewhere in Lancashire. His last design was the Maple No 2 in 1915. The mills accounted for 44% of the increase in the spinning capacity of the county between 1887 and 1925, and for 40% of the new spindles laid down in Oldham between 1887 and 1914. His mills accounted for 9 million spindles. He relied on the triple brick arches supported on steel beams favoured by George Stott, rather than concrete. Stott was a Conservative and a freemason, he was president of the Oldham Lyceum and played rugby for Oldham Football Club. He held several directorships in the cotton-spinning industry. He moved to Stanton Court, Gloucestershire (near Broadway, Worcestershire), in 1913, where he became a Justice of the Peace and, in 1925, High Sheriff of Gloucester. He died in 1937. James Stott James was a younger brother of Abraham Henthorn Stott, the son of James Stott. He set up a heating, ventilation, and catering equipment business that trades as Stotts of Oldham.

He was the first Canadian to run the mile in less than 4 minutes (3:59.1) in San Diego, CA on June 11, 1966 and the first Canadian to the run the mile in less than 4 minutes in Canada (3:57.7) in Toronto on July 22, 1967. A resident of North York, Ontario he won the bronze medal in this event at the 1967 Pan American Games and the silver medal in this event at the 1968 World University Games He was two-time Canadian Universities Track and Field Athlete of Year (1965, 1967) and two-time inductee into the University of Toronto Sports Hall of Fame (individually 1998 and team 2003). He was a member of 9 Canadian National Track and Field Teams competing at World University Games, Budapest 1965 and Tokyo 1967, Commonwealth Games, Kingston, Jamaica, 1966, Pan American Games, Winnipeg, 1967, Commonwealth vs USA, Los Angeles, 1967, Pre-Olympic Games, Mexico City, 1967, Soviet Union Tour, 1968, European Tour, 1968, Olympic Games, Mexico City, 1968. David Bailey completed undergraduate studies in Pharmacy (1968) and graduate work in Pharmacology (M.Sc. 1970; Ph.D. 1973) at the University of Toronto. After post-doctoral training in Pharmacology at the University of Saskatchewan and work in drug development for the pharmaceutical industry, he returned to academia in 1986 at the University of Western Ontario, Canada. He is currently full Professor in the Departments of Physiology & Pharmacology and Medicine. His research focused on mechanistic and translational clinical pharmacological investigations related to drug interactions. Bailey's notable publication of grapefruit ‚Äì drug interactions (Lancet 1991; 337: 268-269) has been cited more than 300 times. Grapefruit decreased drug metabolism in humans, which likely represented the first clinical example of a food producing such an effect. Clinically, the concern is that a single judicious amount of grapefruit ingested even many hours beforehand would noticeably boost oral drug bioavailability and cause overdose toxicity. Research findings have demonstrated that grapefruit produced a clinically relevant interaction with more than 40 medications. Formal product information for a number of highly prescribed or essential medications now warn about the risk of a grapefruit - induced adverse drug interaction. A label stating, \\"Do NOT take with Grapefruit Juice\\" is often affixed to prescription vials. Bailey's research was prominently discussed in such prestigious journals as Nature Medicine (Aronson JK, Forbidden Fruit. Nat Med 2001; 7: 29-30) and the New England Journal of Medicine (Wilkinson GR, Drug metabolism and variability among patients in drug response. N Eng J Med 2005; 352: 2211-21). A review article of his on the topic of grapefruit ‚Äì drug interactions was republished in a special 2004 Anniversary Edition of the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, which reprinted only 14 publications that were considered of major importance over the past 30 years. A research study in the elderly received the William B Abrams Award from the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (1999). Dr. Bailey was the recipient of the Senior Investigator Award from the Canadian Society for Clinical Pharmacology (2005). Moreover, this research is now well known to the public through numerous articles in the lay press. Some were in the most influential and trusted publications including The New York Times (March 21, 2006), National Geographic (March 2007) and the Wall Street Journal (November 27, 2007). Thus, this research has received significant scientific, clinical and mainstream stature. In recent years, Bailey has slightly shifted the focus of his research to assessing the effect of fruit juices on other potentially important mechanisms of drug absorption. Current research found that grapefruit and other juices (orange and apple) inhibited a specific intestinal drug uptake transporter (organic anion transporting polypeptide 1A2; OATP1A2) to diminish oral drug absorption discernibly in humans. The initial publication in 2002, which has been cited more than 100 times, supported a new model of intestinal drug absorption and novel mechanism of food-drug interactions. Most recently, he showed that the major flavonoid in grapefruit, naringin, was an important clinically active inhibitor of intestinal OATP1A2. This appeared to be the first example of a single dietary constituent modulating drug transport in humans.

One must use the mount to adjust for the difference between the tripod mount and the focal point of the camera. This is accomplished by sliders on the mount. A panoramic tripod head is a piece of photographic equipment, mounted to a tripod, which allows photographers to shoot a sequence of images around the entrance pupil of a lens that can be used to produce a panorama. The primary function of the panoramic head is to precisely set the point of rotation about the entrance pupil for a given lens and focal length, eliminating parallax error. To take a panorama, the camera is rotated at fixed angular increments, taking an image at each point. These images can then be assembled (stitched) using stitching software, which allows the images to be aligned and combined into a single seamless panoramic image, either automatically (using image analysis) or manually (with user supplied control points). The final panoramic image can then be viewed or printed as a flat image or viewed interactively using specific playback software. Professional models include precision bearings, scales to allow the user to take photos at specific angles, detents to stop at common angles and integrated levels to aid in adjusting the tripod. Robotic panoramic heads are also available. The robotic head performs the rotation and image capture functions automatically under computer control. Robotic heads can also be used with time-lapse photography.

Sh≈çz≈ç Makino („Éû„Ç≠„ÉéÁúÅ‰∏â, Makino Sh≈çz≈ç, September 22, 1878, Kyoto ‚Äì July 25, 1929) was a Japanese film director, film producer and businessman who is regarded as a pioneering director of Japanese film. In addition, all four of his sons, including Masahiro Makino and Sadatsugu Matsuda, went into the film business as either directors or producers, and his grandchildren include the actors Masahiko Tsugawa and Hiroyuki Nagato. Actress Yoko Minamida is a granddaughter-in-law. Career Makino was born in Kyoto on September 22, 1878. His mother ran a theater, and his association with movies began when the motion picture producer Einosuke Yokota of Yokota Sh≈çkai asked for his help in filming period films. Shozo discovered actor Matsunosuke Onoe working in an itinerant kabuki troupe and enlisted him into becoming Japan's first film star. He directed over 60 Matsunosuke films a year in the early 1910s, most if not all short films. In addition to creating the unique genre of the Japanese period film, Makino also incorporated trick camera techniques and a myriad of other cinematic methods of expression into his films. In 1919, he founded the Mikado Company and began to produce educational films. He later founded an independent production company, Makino Film Productions, and from 1923, continued as a director and as producer. Makino Film Productions turned out many successful movies also made by several other directors and actors. In 1928, he directed the epic, Jitsuroku Chushingura (True Record of the Forty-Seven Ronin), which coincided with his 50th birthday. He died on July 25, 1929. Family He had a total of five children. Two of his sons, Sadatsugu Matsuda (1906‚Äì2003) and Masahiro Makino (1908‚Äì1993) were also film directors. Another, Mitsuo Makino, was a film producer, and another Shinz≈ç Makino, also worked as a director (his wife was the actress Chikako Miyagi). Masahiro married the actress Yukiko Todoroki and their son, Masayuki Makino, is the head of the Okinawa Actor's School. Sh≈çz≈ç's daughter, Tomoko Makino, married the actor Kunitar≈ç Sawamura, and is the mother to actors Masahiko Tsugawa and Hiroyuki Nagato, both of whom married famous actresses, Yukiji Asaoka and Y≈çko Minamida respectively.

In 1860, Dunbar Douglas, Lord Selkirk, acting on advice of his land agent, sold his holdings to the Island Colonial Government, then containing some 62,059 acres, for ¬£6,586 17s 8d Sterling, the per acre price stated as 2s 2p Sterling (this the lowest price paid for land lottery grant lands).Martin, Chester, Lord Selkirk's Work in Canada, Volume 7.

Her father, Sir Philip was born on 13 November 1806 in Oulton Park, Cheshire, England and her mother, Lady Anne (born Legh) was born on 28 December 1808 in East Hall, High Legh, also in Cheshire. Baptised in 1836, Cecily Louisa married Dunbar James Douglas on 29 June 1878 at Little Budworth, Chester, England. She was then 42 and her husband 69. After a short marriage of six years, the 6th Earl of Selkirk died on 11 April 1885 at age 75. The Countess of Selkirk remained a widow for 35 years, and died on 10 January 1920 at Balmaclellan, Scotland. The graves of Cecily Louisa and her husband Dunbar James sit at the top of a gentle slope, in The Galt-way (Gatta/Gata) Kirk Cemetery located southeast of Kirkcudbright, within its former churchyard, on the Farmstead of Banks, now held by Sir David Hope-Dunbar. The Countess lies close to the graves of Captain John Hope R.N., a Selkirk grandson, his wife, and her children, he a son of Lady Isabella-Helen Douglas and The Hon. Charles Hope.

It has several outdoor caf√©s, surrounded by a graceful arcade. In the middle of the square, facing the parvis and entrance to the cathedral, there is a small monument to former Prime Minister of Malta Enrico Mizzi, sculpted in 1964 by Vincent Apap (1909‚Äì2003). To the left and right of the cathedral entrance, are the Lion and Unicorn fountains, sculpted out of the native limestone by Maltese sculptor Mariano Gerada (1766‚Äì1823), which originally featured water transported to Valletta from the highlands around Mdina by means of the Wignacourt Aqueduct. Although this pjazza is today a favourite meeting place in the heart of Malta's baroque capital city, its origins are relatively recent. It did not form part of the original plans of the city, as drafted by the Knights' architect, Francesco Laparelli. Prior to the Second World War, two large apartment buildings with street-level store fronts stood on this location, divided by the narrow street then referred to as Strada San Zaccaria (now, Triq San ≈ªakkarija). However, these buildings suffered massive damage due to aerial bombardment during the War. During the reconstruction years following the War, the Government of Malta requisitioned the central portion of both these buildings, to create the square that exists today. St. John's Square is one of the few \\"green\\" areas in Valletta, as it has several large ficus trees that were planted along the facade of the cathedral in the 1920s. A decision to remove some or all of these trees due to the potential damage that their roots might cause to the cathedral's priceless marble floors, was met with considerable public outcry. These trees are considered an important bird area for the white wagtail, which migrates from European breeding grounds every year to spend the winter in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and northeastern Africa. This decision is being challenged by, among others, the Valletta Rehabilitation Project, whose executive co-ordinator has been quoted as saying, \\"St John's is mostly built on solid rock, so there are no vaults through which the roots could penetrate the church as has been suggested.\\" References External links * Category:Squares in Malta Category:National squares Category:Buildings and structures in Valletta Category:Geography of Valletta ","title":"St John's Square"},{"id":"11677821","text":"Utrechtse Sportvereniging Elinkwijk, known as USV Elinkwijk is a Dutch football club, based in Utrecht.

Educational institutions may not be legally required to obtain independent accreditation, depending on local laws. Academic degrees or other qualifications from such unaccredited institutions may or may not be accepted by civil service or other employers, depending on the local laws, the institution's reputation, and the industry standards. An institution may not obtain or maintain accreditation for one of several reasons. As accreditation processes often require several years' work, a new institution may not yet have completed the initial accreditation process. A long-established institution may have lost accreditation due to financial difficulties or other factors. Other institutions (for example, some longstanding Bible colleges and seminaries) choose not to participate in the accreditation process because they view it as a government infringement of their religious, academic, or political freedom. In some countries, unaccredited institutions are not allowed to exist legally. Therefore any such schools will fall under the label of fraudulent diploma or accreditation mills. Australia In Australia, it is a criminal offence to use the term \\"university\\" or to purport to offer university degrees (Bachelors, Masters, Doctors) without government authorization. For government universities and some private institutions, this authorization is generally given in the form of an Act of a State or Federal Parliament, specifically referring to that institution. (Each state will recognize the institutions authorized under the law of the other states.) Private institututions may apply to TEQSA (Tertiary Education Quality and Standard Agency http://www.teqsa.gov.au) for authorisation to offer recognised higher education diplomas and degrees. Separate to this, there is also authorization under the Higher Education Funding Act to receive federal government funds for students; this is a separate process from authorization to grant degrees, so some institutions are entitled to grant degrees but not to receive government funds to do so. There is also registration under CRICOS (the ESOS Act) - a student visa can only be issued to a student if they are studying at an institution with a valid CRICOS registration India According to the India Department of Education, regarding institutions without accreditation or an Act of Parliament, \\"It is emphasized that these fake institutions have no legal entity to call themselves as University/Vishwvidyalaya and to award ‚Äòdegrees‚Äô which are not treated as valid for academic/employment purposes.\\" Ireland Legitimate higher education qualifications in Ireland are placed on, or formally aligned with, the National Framework of Qualifications. This framework was established by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland in accordance with the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act (1999). It is illegal under the Universities Act (1997) for any body offering higher education services to use the term \\"university\\" without the permission of the Minister for Education and Science. It is likewise illegal under the Institutes of Technologies Acts (1992‚Äì2006) to use the term \\"institute of technology\\" or \\"regional technical college\\" without permission. The Netherlands Dutch academic titles are legally protected and can only be used by graduates from accredited Dutch institutions of higher education. Illegal use is considered a misdemeanor and subject to legal prosecution.

In 2004 authorities announced their intention to take action against unaccredited schools using the words \\"degree\\" and \\"university,\\" including the University of Newlands, an unaccredited distance-learning provider based in the Wellington suburb of Newlands. Other unaccredited New Zealand institutions reported to be using the word \\"university\\" included the New Zealand University of Golf in Auckland, the online Tawa-Linden and Tauranga Universities of the Third Age, and the Southern University of New Zealand. Newlands owner Rochelle M. Forrester said she would consider removing the word \\"university\\" from the name of her institution in order to comply with the law.David Cohen, New Zealand Vows a Crackdown on Diploma Mills in Wake of Unusual Defamation Lawsuit, The Chronicle of Higher Education, August 26, 2004 After the University of Newlands was listed as a \\"wannabe\\" or \\"degree mill\\" by The Australian newspaper, the institution was given permission by the New Zealand High Court to proceed to trial in its suit against the paper's publisher for defamation. The presiding judge noted that such degrees may be illegal and that purporting to offer such degrees could be deemed dishonest or unethical conduct. He also ruled that defamation occurs in the country where the material is downloaded from the Internet. In December 2005 the Court of Appeal said the defamation case could not go ahead. Newlands and Ms. Forrester had not shown it had a good arguable case that an act had been done in New Zealand for which damages could be claimed from a party outside New Zealand. Without their showing a good arguable case, New Zealand courts would not assume jurisdiction.

Switzerland In Switzerland no prior authorisation is required in order to offer higher education courses, organise examinations or issue private degrees. In certain cases, however, the federal or cantonal authorities, depending on their respective area of authority, will supervise private institutions and/or authorise them to offer courses and issue degrees. This supervision means that private institutions are required to accept a certain amount of public control. They must undergo quality inspections if they wish to issue protected titles that will be recognised as such. Non protected titles are nevertheless common. Private institutions that are not part of Switzerland's public higher education sector, are not compatible with it, or are not entirely supervised by public authorities offer a different, but not necessarily lower, level of quality. There are several prestigious private institutions that are entirely independent from Switzerland's public higher education sector. Not all private institutions are prestigious, however. Apart from particularly regulated cases, Swiss tradition has been to allow clients or the labour market itself to decide whether a private institution offers education quality rather than to leave this decision up to the State Validity of degrees issued by private institutions in Switzerland.http://www.sbfi.admin.ch/themen/hochschulen/01641/index.html?lang=de&download;=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDfYN_e2ym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A-- However, the institutional titles of university, university of applied science, university institute and university of applied science institute are protected by law and may only be used by publicly accredited institutions. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom only institutions with degree awarding powers awarded by royal charter or by or under an act of parliament can grant degrees, and courses leading to UK degrees can only be offered by these institutions or institutions validated by an institution with degree awarding powers (with the exception of a small number of \\"recognised awards\\" that are specifically designated by the Secretary of State). However, it is not an offence for overseas bodies to offer their own qualifications in Britain as long as it is made clear that these are not UK degrees. A list of \\"recognised bodies\\" that have degree awarding powers, \\"listed bodies\\" that offer courses leading to degrees from recognised bodies, and \\"recognised awards\\" is maintained by the British government. The government also maintains a list of educational institutions that are entitled to sponsor students for visas, although lack of inclusion on this list does not necessarily imply that an institution is 'bogus', merely that they are not licensed to sponsor students for visas. United States of America Unlike in some countries, the term \\"college\\" or \\"university\\" is not legally protected in the United States on a national level; however, such terms are restricted by some states. The federal government does not accredit any institutions or programs, either inside or outside of the United States. Instead, it maintains a list of valid, reliable, independent accrediting agencies, including private organizations and, for vocational schools, state accrediting agencies.Accreditation in the United States: Overview of Accreditation U.S. Department of Education.

IcedTea-Web is a free software implementation of Java Web Start and the Java web browser plugin. IcedTea-Sound is a collection of plugins for the Java sound subsystem, including the PulseAudio provider which used to be included with IcedTea. The Free Software Foundation recommends that all Java programmers use IcedTea as their development environment. Historically, the initial goal of the IcedTea project was to make the OpenJDK software, which Sun Microsystems released as free software in 2007, usable without requiring any proprietary software, and hence make it possible to add OpenJDK to Fedora and other Linux distributions that insist on free software. This goal was met, and a version of IcedTea based on OpenJDK was packaged with Fedora 8 in November 2007. April 2008 saw the first release of a new variant, IcedTea6, which is based on Sun's build drops of OpenJDK6, a fork of the OpenJDK with the goal of being compatible with the existing JDK6. This was released in Ubuntu and Fedora in May 2008. The IcedTea package in these distributions has been renamed to OpenJDK using the OpenJDK trademark notice. In June 2008, the Fedora build passed Sun's rigorous TCK testing on x86 and x86-64. IcedTea 2, the first version based on OpenJDK 7, was released in October 2011. IcedTea 3, the first version based on OpenJDK 8, was released in April 2016. Support for IcedTea 1 was dropped in January 2017. History This project was created following Sun's release under open source licenses of its HotSpot Virtual Machine and Java compiler in November 2006, and most of the source code of the class library in May 2007. However, parts of the class library, such as font rendering, colour management and sound support, were only provided as proprietary binary plugins. This was because the source code for these plugins was copyrighted to third parties, rather than Sun Microsystems.See also Java Class Library Licensing The released parts were published under the terms of the GNU General Public License, a free software license. Due to these missing components, it was not possible to build OpenJDK only with free software components. Sun aimed to negotiate with the license holders to allow this code to be released under a free software license, or failing that, to replace these proprietary elements with alternative implementations. With the plugins replaced, the class library would then be completely free. Sun has continued to use the proprietary code in their certified binary releases. Following the announcement, the IcedTea project was started and was formally announced on June 7, 2007, with a build repository provided by the GNU Classpath team. The team could not call their software product \\"OpenJDK\\" because this is a trademark which was owned by Sun Microsystems. They instead decided to use the temporary name \\"IcedTea\\". On November 5, 2007, Red Hat signed both the Sun Contributor Agreement and the OpenJDK Community Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) License. The press release suggested that this would benefit the IcedTea project. Simon Phipps suggested the possibility of IcedTea being hosted on openjdk.java.net, and Mark Reinhold noted that signing the copyright assignment could allow Red Hat to contribute parts of IcedTea to Sun for inclusion in the mainstream JDK. Since then, a number of patches from IcedTea have made their way into OpenJDK. On June 2008, it was announced that IcedTea6 (as the packaged version of OpenJDK on Fedora 9) has passed the (TCK) tests and can claim to be a fully compatible Java 6 implementation. The project continues to track OpenJDK 6, OpenJDK 7 and OpenJDK 8 development in separate repositories, and contribute patches back upstream where possible; the current state of each IcedTea patch is maintained on the IcedTea wiki. Aims The IcedTea project started with two aims: # to make it possible for the GNU Compiler for Java to compile the OpenJDK code. OpenJDK presented a bootstrapping question of itself being written in Java. Hence, developers needed an already-working Java compiler and runtime in order to build OpenJDK. Originally, only the existing proprietary Sun JDK met that requirement. Free distributions like Fedora can't depend on proprietary tools in order to build packages, so the IcedTea project had to make it possible to compile the code using free software. When this was done, the resulting IcedTea version of OpenJDK could be used to compile itself, thus escaping the need to use non- Free software for future compiling. # to provide free equivalents of the binary plugins that existed in OpenJDK because Sun was unable to release all the source code. As of March 2008, this is no longer necessary for IcedTea6, as the OpenJDK 6 build drops can be built with no binary plugins. With the release of b10, which replaces the proprietary sound support with that from the Gervill project, a full implementation of Java 1.6 can be built without binary plugins. The only remaining binary plug is for SNMP support, which is an optional provider for the JMX architecture and not part of the specification. As of b53 in April 2009, the same is true for OpenJDK 7. Outside the core of OpenJDK, binary plugins are still required for utilizing Java Web Start applets that run using the browser plugin (distinct from the core plugins discussed earlier); as of 2013, the only source code available that accomplishes this goal is the IcedTea-Web project. Other benefits IcedTea also provides a more familiar build system by providing a wrapper around the OpenJDK makefiles using the GNU Autotools. This removes the need to remember numerous environment variables for configuring the build. (The current IcedTea builds set roughly forty such variables for the underlying OpenJDK build.) It has also provided a place for early work on features which will eventually appear in the main OpenJDK builds such as Gervill and for work on ports to other platforms. IcedTea-Web IcedTea NPR plugin (based on IcedTea6) listed in Debian Iceweasel 6.0.2 (Knoppix 6.7.1) IcedTea-web provides a free-software Java Web browser plugin. It was the first to work in 64-bit browsers under 64-bit Linux, a feature Sun's proprietary JRE later addressed.Java SE 6 Update 12 Release Notes. Java.sun.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-18. This makes it suitable to enable support for Java applets in 64-bit Mozilla Firefox, among others. IcedTea-web also provides a free Java Web Start (Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP)) implementation. Sun had promised to release their plugin and Web Start implementation as part of OpenJDK. Despite pressure from the community, Sun Microsystems did not succeed in doing so before the company was acquired by Oracle. Development on the IcedTea-web plugin continues, with the latest version of the next-generation plugin supporting Google's Chromium in addition to Firefox. Since 2011, development takes place in the separate IcedTea-Web project. As of April 2013, Oracle has kept the codebase of the Java plugin fully proprietary, in contrast to the remainder of OpenJDK. As of December, 2017, IcedTea-Web 1.7.1 adds support for jdk9. As of October 2018, Oracle has announced that public Java Web Start support will end with Java SE 11. In March the icedtea-web source code was donated to the AdoptOpenJDK project. Based on this the sources and issue management of IcedTea-Web were migrated to GitHub. One goal of the migration is to provide an integration for the Java 8 releases of AdoptOpenJDK, and provide JDK vendor independent installers for IcedTea-Web. The integration project is a cooperation between the AdoptOpenJDK community, RedHat, and Karakun AG. The project for the installers is named OpenWebStart and first information can be found here. Progress and availability From June 2007, IcedTea was able to build itself and pass a significant portion of Mauve, the GNU Classpath test suite. In May 2008, support was added to IcedTea for running the Sun jtreg regression tests. Availability on several Windows editions still remains unstable and unofficial. IcedTea has become popular among package maintainers for the following Linux distributions. Currently (as of April 2012): *IcedTea is the default JVM in Ark Linux and Arch Linux. *It can be built and run under Debian. Packages entered unstable on 12 July 2008. *IcedTea[7] was available in Fedora 8 and IcedTea6 appeared in Fedora 9 through to 17 as java-1.6.0-openjdk. A java-1.7.0-openjdk package using the IcedTea 2.x OpenJDK forest, but not its build system, first appeared in Fedora 16. *Binary and source packages for IcedTea 3.x are available in Gentoo's official repository. A source package for IcedTea 2.x continues to be maintaining in the Java overlay repository. Installing a Java application by default pulls in IcedTea instead of oracle-jdk because it can be installed without extra work from the user, as users have to manually agree to Oracle's EULA to download the oracle-jdk. *IcedTea is available in Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon), from the \\"universe\\" repository, and IcedTea6 in 8.04 (Hardy Heron). Starting with Ubuntu 11.04 only IcedTea is available. Architecture OpenJDK contained approximately (on release in May 2007) 4% encumbered code, which was only packaged as binary plugins. These were required to build and use the JDK. OpenJDK 6 was released with only 1% encumbered code, and the encumbered sound support has also since been replaced. IcedTea6 is based on this release. IcedTea still provides its own web browser plugin and Web Start support, as Sun's implementation remains proprietary. IcedTea 1.x and 2.x can compile OpenJDK using GNU Classpath-based solutions such as GCJ and optionally bootstraps itself using the HotSpot Java Virtual Machine and the javac Java compiler it just built. For now, building IcedTea 3.x requires using IcedTea 2.x or 3.x, or an OpenJDK 7 or 8 build from another source. Platform support Cross-architecture ports of HotSpot (OpenJDK's Virtual Machine) are difficult, because the code contains much assembly language, in addition to the C++ core. The IcedTea project has developed a generic port of the HotSpot interpreter called zero-assembler Hotspot (or zero), with almost no assembly code. This port is intended to allow the interpreter part of HotSpot to be very easily adapted to any Linux processor architecture. The code of zero- assembler Hotspot was used for all the non-x86 ports of HotSpot (PPC, IA-64, S390 and ARM) from version 1.6 of IcedTea7. The IcedTea project has also developed a platform-independent just-in-time compiler called Shark for HotSpot, using LLVM, to complement Zero. This was included in upstream OpenJDK in August 2010. A JIT for ARM32 was first included in 1.6.0 and 2.1.1. A native port to AArch64 from Red Hat appeared in 2.4.6 and a native PPC64 port from SAP/IBM will be included in 2.5.0. The PPC/AIX port is included upstream in OpenJDK from version 8u20, and the AArch64 port will be included from version 9.

The line is double- track on the short section it shares with the Belfast-Larne railway line, but is composed primarily of single track from Monkstown to Derry with passing points at Templepatrick, Antrim, Magherabeg, Ballymena, Killagan, Ballymoney, Coleraine and Bellarena. Current service Weekday and Saturday services on the line run hourly from in Belfast to and vice versa (except weekdays last train from Derry will terminate ). Hourly shuttle services to and from connect with the line at . On Sundays services from Great Victoria Street to Derry operate every two hours from Derry to Belfast and vice versa. During those hours when trains do not depart from Derry, the shuttle service from Portrush to Coleraine continues on to Great Victoria Street. This means that only passengers departing from Derry, and have a two-hour wait between departing services. The first train Monday to Saturday begins at Coleraine and weekends begins from Coleraine. Previous operations Prior to 2001 and the reopening of the Bleach Green viaduct, services operated via Crumlin, Glenavy, Ballinderry and Lisburn. The reopening of the Bleach Green viaduct resulted in shorter journeys between Belfast and Derry. A skeleton service continued on the Lisburn‚ÄìAntrim line until 2003, when the line and its stations were closed. This section of railway is now used solely for driver training or other operational requirements e.g. special services to major events. Recent history and future In August 2011 it was planned to reduce services on the Coleraine to Londonderry section to five services, in each direction on weekdays, to facilitate safety improvement works during 2012. A refurbishment of the line was due to commence in April 2012, however the ¬£75 million that it was to cost, was unavailable. This resulted in opposition from supporters of the section who feared that the line would be permanently closed down. In October 2011, after years of uncertainty, Regional Development minister Danny Kennedy relocated funding from the A5 dualling project to the railway upgrade project, allowing for a 3-phase upgrade, which commenced in July 2012. Phase 1 saw the line close for nine months to completely relay two sections (Coleraine to Castlerock; and Eglinton to Derry) of the route, extending the life of the remaining section by converting the currently jointed track to continuous welded rail, elimination of wet spots, and essential bridge repairs. This was completed on 24 March 2013, and new timetable changes have resulted in a morning train reaching Derry before 9am for the first time since Northern Ireland Railways took control of the network in the 1960s. Phase 2 has seen the passing loop removed and the 'down' track lifted at Castlerock, replaced with a new loop further down the line at Bellarena halt. New signalling has been introduced, and the signal boxes at Castlerock and Waterside, Derry closed, with the line operating under absolute block. An hourly service between Belfast and Derry was introduced on 3 July 2017. Phase 3 will include rail renewal between Castlerock and Eglinton, the introduction of a line speed between Castlerock and Derry and other works, however funding for this part of the project is doubtful for the foreseeable future. Other future plans for the Derry line include the reinstatement of the double line from Antrim to Ballymena, and the doubling of the track from Monkstown to Templepatrick. The route terminus in Derry was relocated in October 2019 when the former B&NCR; Waterside station reopened, replacing the 1980 terminus. Railway engineering feature Coleraine has a bascule bridge for the railway over the navigable River Bann.http://www.movablebridges.org.uk/BridgePage.asp?BridgeNumber=1100 Just after Castlerock station there are two tunnels created during an event known as the Great Blast in October 1845. Castlerock tunnel is long and is the longest operational railway tunnel in Northern Ireland. After passing through a short opening trains pass through the shorter Downhill tunnel which is in length. Signalling Signalling on the line from Great Victoria Street to Slaught level crossing (just south of Ballymena station) is controlled by the Belfast Central control terminal. From Kellswater South, the signalling and level crossings are controlled by the Coleraine signal cabin. Following the signalling upgrade in 2016, the line north of is no longer controlled by electric token, instead being centralised in the Coleraine signal box. The signal boxes at Castlerock and Waterside, which previously controlled the token system, have now been closed. The whole of the Belfast to Derry line is now controlled by colour light signals, the last semaphore signals at Castlerock station being removed after the 2016 signalling upgrade. The signal box at Coleraine will be moved to Lanyon Place upon completion of the Belfast Hub project. Rolling stock Following the complete withdrawal of the NIR Class 80 and NIR Class 450 trains, the line is now served by a combination of NIR Class 3000 and NIR Class 4000 diesel multiple units.

Established in 1920, the school merged with Duval High School in January 2019 to allow for the newly-established Armidale Secondary College. The school had a non-selective enrolment policy and at the time of closure catered to approximately 715 students from Year 7 to Year 12. The school was operated by the New South Wales Department of Education, and prepared students for the Record of School Achievement (Year 10), and the NSW Higher School Certificate (Year 12). History Founded in 1920, Armidale High School was the first public secondary school to be established in Armidale, drawing students from Armidale and from around the New England region. Because of poor transport, many of these students boarded at two hostels maintained by the Church of England, St John's for boys and the Memorial Hostel for girls. The establishment of the Armidale Teachers' College (1928) and then the New England University College (1938), now the University of New England, drew teachers to Armidale for career reasons and helped create a vibrant sporting and academic culture. The school expanded quickly over the 1950s and 1960s as the expansion of the University brought new families to the city. This created pressures on facilities, leading to the establishment in 1974 of a new high school, Duval High School, on the northern outskirts of Armidale. Structural changes in Australian higher education resulting from the Dawkins Education Reforms from the late 1980s lead to significant job losses in Armidale, population decline and hence declines in student numbers at the two high schools. Faced with the need to renew buildings and facilities as well as the need to accommodate renewed student growth, the New South Wales Government decided to merge the two high schools. In 2018 it was announced that Armidale High would merge with Duval High to form the newly-established Armidale Secondary College that will cater for approximately 1,500 students from Year 7 to Year 12. The installation of a temporary additional school at Duval High School started, in readiness for students during the transition period from January 2019. Construction of Armidale Secondary College commenced on the Armidale High School site in 2019 and will continue in 2020. It is expected that Armidale Secondary College will commence in Term 1, 2021. While the merge caused some distress among alumni of both schools, the plans provide for preservation of key historical features of the Armidale High School and for preservation of the history of both schools.

In recent years, the Society has concentrated on the publication of name indexes to English probate records, and the texts of 17th-century Hearth Tax returns. Foundation and early history The Society was founded in 1889 to take over the Index Library, which had begun life the previous year as W. P. W. Phillimore's private scheme for the publication of indexes to British public records, now the brief of the List and Index Society. The Society was also always interested in record conservation, and to act as what would now be called a pressure group for archives and their users, pushing for the creation of county record offices and county record societies. The inception of an official series of Lists and Indexes in 1892 reduced the need for private publication of indexes to records in the Public Record Office. The Society consequently turned its attention to records held in other repositories. In 1898 the Society‚Äôs Scottish section became the totally independent Scottish Record Society. In 1933 the Society's Record Preservation Section was similarly taken over by the newly founded British Records Association (B.R.A.). Activities Since the 1930s, the British Record Society has been primarily a publishing society for English records, frequently in conjunction with county historical societies. By 2012, 126 volumes of the Index Library had been published over 123 years, besides two extra volumes and some microfiche. Over the past half century the Society has largely, but not exclusively, concentrated on the publication of name indexes to probate records, and the texts of Hearth Tax returns from the 1660s and 1670s. A longer history of the Society and its current activities will be found on its website. A complete list of its publications up to 1982 will be found in E. L. C. Mullins, Texts and Calendars, I and II, Royal Historical Society, 1958 and 1983. Details of those published after 1982 can be found on the Royal Historical Society's website.

It was founded in 1776 by the order of Catherine the Great. The palace has lent its name to the surrounding district and the nearby metro station.  History  left The estate is known from the late 16th century, when it belonged to Tsaritsa Irina, sister of Tsar Boris Godunov. At that time it was called Bogorodskoye. In the 17th century it belonged to the Streshnevs and then to the Galitzines. Smaller hall inside the grand palaceIn 1775, the estate was bought by empress Catherine the Great, who happened to be passing through the area and fell in love with the picturesque beauty of the land. It received its present name, which means ‚ÄúTsaritsa‚Äôs‚Äù. In 1776-85 architect Vasili Bazhenov built a palace for the Empress there. When the palace was almost complete, the Empress visited Tsaritsyno to inspect it. She declared the rooms to be too cramped and dark, and the palace unlivable. As a result, Catherine ordered the palace to be torn down. The remnants of the foundation of Bazhenov's original palace are still visible in the park. Palace front In 1786, Matvey Kazakov presented new architectural plans, which were approved by Catherine. Kazakov supervised the construction project until 1796 when the construction was interrupted by Catherine's death. Her successor, Emperor Paul I of Russia showed no interest in the palace and the massive structure remained unfinished and abandoned for more than 200 years, until it was completed and extensively reworked in 2005-07. Currently, in Tsaritsyno there are a history and architecture museum, a landscape park with an adjacent forest, an art museum, the Biryulyovo dendropark, and a cascade of the Tsaritsyno ponds. It is managed by the Tsaritsyno Museum Reserve, founded in 1984.  Park  193x193px The 18th-century architecture ensemble was built (though not finished) following the order of Catherine II in Neo-Gothic style, after projects of the Bazhenov and Kazakov, and it is the only 18th-century architectural ensemble of such dimensions in Russia. Map of park locations in Tsaritsino Around the palace, in the park there are a number of pavilions, pergolas, arbours, artificial grottos, decorative bridges (early 19th century, architect I. Yegotov), and a Russian Orthodox temple ‚ÄúSource of Life‚Äù, as well as a modern recreation center with an upscale restaurant. For a long time most buildings were ruined (and used for rock climbing). In 2005-2007 most buildings were extensively restored and completed: roofs, interiors and decorations have been added and their historical appearance has been altered. A number of buildings house the Russian museum of folk and applied art. The atrium of the ‚ÄúBread House‚Äù is used for concerts of Moscow musicians. The park grounds contain a group of burial mounds (Kurgans) that belong to the Early Slavs tribe Vyatichs dated to the 11th-13th century.

Ride experience The ride is an inverted roller coaster, whereby the trains travel underneath the rails. The ride travels through ravines and tunnels, similar to Nemesis at Alton Towers. The track was built from 70 individual parts with 0.15 mm of manufacturing tolerance which prevents noticeable transitions between sections. Construction began at four separate parts of the ride which were joined together to complete the circuit. The hollow rails were filled with sand to dampen the noise created by passing trains.

On 22 September 1950, the Battalion of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders moved up to attack Hill 282 near Songju. Starting before dawn on 23 September, B and C Companies after an hour's climb seized the crest of Hill 282 surprising there a North Korean force at breakfast. Across a saddle, and nearly a mile away to the southwest, higher Hill 388 dominated the one they had just occupied. C Company started toward it. North Korean troops occupying this hill already were moving to attack the one just taken by the British. The North Koreans supported their attack with artillery and mortar fire, which began falling on the British. The action continued throughout the morning with North Korean fire increasing in intensity. Shortly before noon, with American artillery fire inexplicably withdrawn and the five supporting U.S. tanks unable to bring the North Koreans under fire because of terrain obstacles, the Argylls called for an air strike on the North Korean- held Hill 388. Just after noon the Argylls heard the sound of approaching aircraft. Three United States Air Force F-51 Mustangs of the 18th Fighter Bomber Wing circled Hill 282 where the British displayed their white recognition panels. The North Koreans on Hill 388 also displayed white panels. To his dismay, Captain Radcliff of the tactical air control party had a defective radio which prevented him from establishing contact with the F-51s and it was later revealed that several British forward air controllers had yet to notify the pilots of proper air recognition panels. At 12:15, the Mustangs, confused by the panels and no radio contact with friendly ground forces, dropped napalm bombs onto the Argylls' position and also strafed it with 50 calibre machine-gun fire. The attack was over in two minutes and left the hilltop a sea of orange flame. Survivors plunged 50 ft down the slope to escape the burning napalm. Maj. Kenneth Muir, second in command of the Argylls, who had led an ammunition resupply and litter-bearing party to the crest before noon, watching the flames on the crest die down, noticed that a few wounded men still held a small area on top. Acting quickly, he assembled about thirty men and led them back up the hill before approaching North Koreans reached the top. There, two bursts of automatic fire mortally wounded him as he and Maj. A. I. Gordon-Ingram, B Company commander, fired a 2-inch mortar. According to his Victoria Cross citation, Muir's last words as he was carried from the hilltop were \\"The Gooks will never drive the Argylls off this hill\\".Lt Col G.I. Malcolm of Poltalloch, The Argylls in Korea; Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd, London 1952 Gordon-Ingram counted only ten men with him able to fight, and some of them were wounded. His three Bren guns were nearly out of ammunition. At 15:00 the survivors were down at the foot of the hill. The next day a count showed 2 officers and 11 men killed, 4 officers and 70 men wounded, and 2 men missing for a total of 89 casualties; of this number, the mistaken air attack caused approximately 60.South to the Naktong, North to the Yalu See also * List of post-1945 U.S. friendly-fire incidents with British victims References External links *Friendly Fire on Hill 282 *The Battle for Hill 282 Category:Conflicts in 1950 Category:1950 in Korea Category:Battles of the Korean War Category:Battles of the Korean War involving the United States Category:Friendly fire incidents Category:September 1950 events ","title":"Battle of Hill 282"},{"id":"11678257","title":"Khemraj Naiko"},{"id":"11678272","text":"Dovegate Prison is a Category B men's private prison, located near Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, England.

Located in the valley of the Maquoketa River, it is approximately three miles (5 km) south of Strawberry Point in Delaware County. It is named for a narrow and steep ridge of bedrock carved by a loop of the Maquoketa River originally known as the Devil's Backbone. The initial were donated by E.M. Carr of Lamont, Iowa. Backbone Lake Dam, a relatively low dam built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s, created Backbone Lake. The CCC constructed a majority of trails and buildings which make up the park. History The area of the Devil's Backbone was a favorite of natural scientists such as W.J. McGee, Thomas Macbride, and Samuel Calvin who visited it to study its ancient geologic formations. with Edward M. Carr bought in the 1890s to protect the Backbone Ridge from destruction. MacBride and members of the Iowa Park and Forestry Association thought of it as a prime location for a state park. The State Board of Conservation, organized in December 1918, recommended buying the land at its first meeting. It took a little over a year for the purchase to be finalized. On May 28, 1920 Backbone was dedicated as Iowa's first state park. Development of the park was deferred until 1925, although trees were planted and planning for a roadway was begun in prior years. Tensions developed between two groups in the 1920s and the 1930s over development. One group saw the state parks as places that protected the natural areas, and the second group had a multiple-use philosophy of conservation. The multiple-use concept won the debate. Two camps from the Civilian Conservation Corps, a public work relief program during the Great Depression, developed the park between 1933 and 1942. CCC Camp SP2 and Camp SP17 developed the overnight cabin and recreational area on the southern end of the park; a picnic, hiking, and camping area in the center; and Richmond Springs on the north end. Backbone became one of the largest and one of the most extensively developed parks in the state system. Historic district Three distinct areas of park were individually listed as historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990: Cabin-Bathing Area (Area A), Picnicking, Hiking & Camping Area (Area B), and Richmond Springs (Area C). They contain 70 contributing resources and are differentiated by function as described below. They were incorporated into a larger district the following year. At that time an additional 31 resources were added when the historic district expanded, of which 21 are considered contributing properties. The contributing resources include: the stone portals at the north entrance, two stone erosion control dams, an auditorium, two stone latrines, two sets of stone trail steps, a stone wall, two trout rearing ponds, the fish hatchery garage, two stone drinking fountains, a stone pumphouse, a stone lodge now used as a museum, a stone barn, and four commemorative markers. One of the markers commemorates the Daughters of the American Revolution of Iowa who planted 6,000 trees in the park. The other three mark three roads that were named for three individuals who were instrumental in establishing the park: State Senator Byron W. Newberry, State Treasurer E.H. Hoyt, and landowner E.M. Carr. Included within the boundaries of the larger historic district are , the geographical area of the park in 1942 when the CCC completed its development work. The park was part of a larger study of Iowa's state parks called the . Cabin-Bathing Area (Area A) Area A is located at the southern end of the park and around the Backbone Lake on the Makoqueta River. Its historic buildings and structures include 17 cabins, pump house, two sets of trail steps, soil erosion dams, six parking areas, paved road, the site of CCC Camp 1756, bathhouse, boathouse, a wall, the beach, two drinking fountains, pit latrine, a sundial and bench, dam, and the sand filter bed. with The lake was created by the dam and spillways that were constructed from August 1933 to October 1934. The bathhouse was built between September 1934 and April 1935, while the boathouse was built between January and May 1935. Both of these structures are located on the east side of the lake. They are composed of roughly coursed limestone, and the boathouse includes a round tower at its south end. The sundial and bench are located south of the bathhouse on the east shore of the lake. The semi-circular, courses ashlar bench surrounds a flagstone patio, in the middle of which is the sundial. They were completed sometime between November 1935 and March 1936. Eighteen single-family cabins were built north of the bathing area between 1937 and 1941. It is believed they were built from south to north. They are all single-story, rectangular, frame structures. One of the cabins is considered a noncontributing building. Picnicking, Hiking & Camping Area (Area B) Area B is located near the center of the park. Its historic buildings and structures include a picnic shelter/concession, two more picnic shelters, two pit latrines, the site of CCC Camp 781, the east entrance entryways and gate, four overlooks, two trailside benches, six parking lots, a vehicle bridge, trail steps, the Backbone Trail and steps, Watercrest Springs, a sign, a drinking fountain, and paved roads. with The CCC began constructing the picnic facilities beginning in December 1933 and continued until at least 1938. Work on the Backbone Trail, which follows the top of Backbone Ridge, began at the end of 1933 and continued until about December 1934. The concession was built between January and May 1937. One of the picnic shelters and the picnic shelter/concession are composed of uncoursed, rough-faced ashlar limestone, and oak timbers. The second picnic shelter is a rectangular roof that is supported by triple and single timber posts and timber framing. The Watercrest Springs is a landscaping device composed of two sections of random rubble, limestone retaining walls that are stepped up a hill creating a shallow pool at the head of the natural spring. The remains of CCC Camp 781 includes the concrete foundations from the frame buildings. Richmond Springs (Area C) Area C is located on the north end of the park. Its historic structures include Richmond Springs, steps, and a waterway. with The springs are a natural feature that were enclosed by the CCC from June 1934 to March 1935. The waterway was built from October 1935 to March 1936. It created a new channel from the area to prevent overflow into the springs. The work was done, in part, to protect the springs as a source of potable water. Land use Measuring , the region is heavily forested, mainly in species of oak and maple. The geology of the area is particularly noteworthy. As part of the Driftless Area, it was left unglaciated during the last Ice Age, with very ancient dolomite formations dating from the Silurian period. A large ridge of rock divides the park, resembling a spine, and lends its name to the park and adjacent forest. The area is characterized by active springs, caves, sinkholes and karsts. With cliffs measuring over 80 feet in places, climbing and rappelling are popular, but both require a permit. Twenty-one miles of multi- use trails support year-round recreational activities, including hiking as well as cross-country skiing and snowmobiling in winter. The lake is noted for its swimming, boating, and fishing. Backbone Creek is known to support both Rainbow and Brown trout, and is stocked by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources from local brood ponds. Campsites (49 electrical and 49 non- electrical) and cabins are available for rental (reservations recommended). Two shower buildings and a playground are also available. Local wildlife abound in the park and surrounding area, including fox, turkey, and deer. Backbone State Forest is immediately adjacent to the park. It consists of of pine forest. Horsebackriding and hunting are permitted in this reserve, but not in the park proper. The park's administrative headquarters are in Dundee. Iowa Civilian Conservation Corps Museum The Iowa Civilian Conservation Corps Museum provides exhibits about the activities of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in Iowa state parks. Backbone State Park was the site of two CCC camps, and many of the buildings and trails in the park were built by the CCC. The museum opened in Spring of 1991.

Course and features The river rises in the lower Inman Valley and flows generally north west through the Fleurieu Peninsula, through primarily agricultural surroundings and drains into the Gulf St Vincent. The Bungala flows past the town of Yankalilla, and empties into the Yankalilla Bay, part of the Gulf of St Vincent, near Normanville. The river descends over its course. The wetlands surrounding the river are classified as Brackish wetlands, with the estuary also having a brackish wetland system, and coastal dunes along the neighboring stretch of coast. The Yankalilla Bay Catchment Action Group and the Normanville Heritage Sand Dune Rehabilitation Group are environmental groups aiming to preserving and restoring the river's natural state, whilst maintaining its use by the surrounding community. The latter are concerned primarily with Yankalilla and further inland sections of the river, and the former are concerned with the estuary and coastal section of the river. Etymology The river's name is derived from an Aboriginal name adopted for a house built on section 1171 in the Hundred of Yankalilla by Eli Butterworth in the 1860s. He and his brother John owned and operated a steam powered flour mill on adjoining land.

At the 2016 Australian census the town recorded a population of 1,584.  Geography  Cambooya is in the Darling Downs region, west of the state capital, Brisbane. History Harrow homestead Land sale around Cambooya, circa 1910 European settlement of the area dates from 1840, when Arthur Hodgson chose of prime land, which he named Eton Vale. In 1843 the New South Wales Commissioner of Crown Lands, Christopher Rolleston, carried out a survey and reserved a site on Eton Vale for a township. He named it Cambooya, a rendering of the Aboriginal word 'yambuya', thought to refer to tubers growing in a water hole. Cambooya was, in its early years, the railway, postal, and general centre of two properties named after two public schools of England, Eton and Harrow. Hodgson had attended Eton, and Ramsay had attended Harrow. Hodgson resisted the formation of a township, and no development occurred until 1868, when a railway station was built at Cambooya as the railway line was extended from Toowoomba to Warwick. Cambooya Post Office opened on 12 March 1869. It was co-located with the railway station. In 1877, of land was resumed from the Eton Vale pastoral run to establish smaller farms. The land was offered for selection on 17 April 1877. The post office, railway station building and goods shed were destroyed in a fire in the early hours of the morning on 7 July 1908. A new post office was built in 1909 at an estimated cost of ¬£1050. The current post office is located at 53 Eton Street, Cambooya. The first public school in Cambooya opened in 1882, with 12 students from four local families. Due to growing attendance and an increased population caused by the railway, the school was moved and a building was erected in 1899 at the current school site; this building became a school residence in 1910 when a new state school was built. The nearby Nunkulla School was closed on 6 December 1959 and the building was transported to Cambooya to become an additional classroom. It was officially opened in December 1960. A new building was constructed in 1985 and officially opened on 3 August 1985 by Tony Elliott, Member for Cunningham. In 1985 the school was officially given six allotments of land, now called Johnson Oval. This oval is used today for cricket, soccer, and athletics. By 1990 there were 104 students and 25 pre-school students enrolled, plus a teaching staff of six teachers and three teacher-aides. Early in 2005 there was an officially opened covered area. Stuart Copeland, Member of Parliament (MP) congratulated the school community for constructing a useful covered area for eating lunches and undercover activities. The school celebrated its centenary in 1982 and 125 years of education at Cambooya State School in 2007. Eton Vale school was originally a private school on Eton Vale Station, three and a half miles from the Cambooya railway station. Most children who attended the school in 1890 were girls and infants, as they could not travel to Cambooya School with any regularity and the black soil was impassable in wet weather. Eton Vale became a half-time school with Preston in 1925; Preston School closed shortly after and Eton Vale school closed in 1929. In February 1923 a branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association was formed in Cambooya. More than 50 women attended the meeting. Ruth Fairfax (Queensland president and founder) referred to the \\"good work than the association could accomplish among country women, emphasis being laid \\"on what could be done in Cambooya and district. The newly formed branch agreed to devote its energies to assisting the Bush Nursing Association. Ruth Fairfax was elected president, and Miss Middleton secretary and treasurer.\\" There is no longer a branch in Cambooya, although there are a number of branches in the surrounding area, including Toowoomba and Middle Ridge. The Cambooya Catholic Church was officially opened on 9 November. 1914 by Archbishop James Duhig, before a crowd of about 600. At the centenary celebrations in 2014, descendants of the men who helped build the church were among the crowd for the celebration. In April 1914, the Anglican Church at Cambooya was destroyed by cyclonic winds. As reported in the Darling Downs Gazette, \\"the church was built by the residents some years ago, and was one of the centres of religious life in that small community. A stained glass window in the church was the gift of Sir Arthur Hodgson in memory of the Hodgson family who did much for the Downs and for Queensland; the walls of the little church were beautifully decorated. The seats were tastefully decorated, and the organ, recently paid for, was a very fine instrument. All have been destroyed.\\" The church was rebuilt with funds raised by the community. The foundation stone of the new building was laid a week before the opening of the new Catholic church. The Darling Downs, including Cambooya, was well known for the production of cheese and other dairy products in the first half of the 20th century. For example, the Ramsay Cheese Factory, during the fourteen months prior to the end of 1906, made 248,686 lb or 111 tons of cheese from 273,003 gallons of milk. By 1912 there were butter an/or cheese factories at Allora, Cambooya, Clifton, Crows Nest, Dalby, Goombungee, Greenmount, Inglewood, Jandowae, Leyburn, Oakey, Pittsworth, Tannymorel, Toowoomba and Warwick. In the late 1930s the Downs' dairy industry peaked at 6500 farms and over 200,000 milking cows. Australian author Arthur Hoey Davis, who wrote under the pen name 'Steele Rudd', spent much of his childhood on his family's small block at Emu Creek near East Greenmount in the Cambooya district. He is best known for creating the Australian characters Dad 'n' Dave. Farmers arriving with milk at the Cambooya Cheese Factory, ca. 1913 A suburban rail motor service from Toowoomba along the Southern railway line commenced in May 1917, running to Wyreema, 10 miles away. It was extended to Cambooya and to Willowburn in 1918. They ceased around 1923.The Toowoomba Suburban Rail Motor Service Knowles, J.W.

The work premiered on 15 June 1985.Michael Nyman. Liner notes. The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover It was written to commemorate the deaths of 39 fans, almost all Italian, at the 1985 European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus at the Heysel Stadium. The whole piece was performed just once. In 1989, Nyman began \\"reassigning\\" elements of Memorial, as he often does with earlier work. The first appearance on a commercial recording was of the fifth movement, on the soundtrack of The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover. Background Nyman utilized a death march in his earlier work Drowning by Numbers, and revives the scheme for Memorial, clearly setting death and its emotional impact as the main theme of the composition. Indeed, Nyman explicitly dedicated Memorial to the memory of the Juventus F.C. fans killed in the Heysel Stadium tragedy, in May 1985. The composition borrowed a musical phrase from Baroque composer Henry Purcell's King Arthur, the prelude to \\"What Power Art Thou,\\" sung by the Cold Genius in Act III, but the phrase is repeated in countless times, in a minimalist fashion. The composition is dominated for the first two-thirds by the string and horn sections, backed up by bass guitar, and a drummer. Soprano Sarah Leonard comes in only in the last third of section, and her performance mainly consists of long wordless complaints, adding a dramatic effect to the composition. Her song is continuously an octave higher than the rest of the orchestra, thus creating a haunting effect that suggests pain and sorrow. Releases The fifth movement appeared in The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, and re-recorded versions appear on Michael Nyman Band's The Essential Michael Nyman Band and The Composer's Cut Series Vol. II: Nyman/Greenaway Revisited. After Extra Time and The Very Best of Michael Nyman: Film Music 1980-2001 are reissues of the Essential and soundtrack versions, respectively. The sixth movement has been released on compact disc under the title \\"Images Were Introduced\\" on the album The Kiss and Other Movements. The second and fourth appear on the limited edition album, La Travers√©e de Paris. The other movements remain unreleased, and Nyman has described the work as \\"dismantled.\\" Influence The composition was described in the Guardian by Waldemar Januszczak as 'a small piece of atonement'. It had a strong effect on movie director Peter Greenaway, who decided to model parts of his film The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover on this composition. In fact, this composition is perhaps the best example of the integration of Nyman's music to Greenaway's work. The final sequence of the movie was entirely choreographed around the fifth movement. The sequence represents a procession bearing the body of The Lover, prepared by The Cook, served by The Wife as a dish for her husband, The Thief. In the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympic Games, the Russian ice dance duet Pasha Grishuk and Evgeni Platov use the music in their free dance, winning gold medal in the sport. More recently, it was used in two documentaries, Man on Wire, and \\"Kijken in de Ziel\\" from Coen Verbraak. The composition is used during the weekend news edition on Channel 2 (Israel).

The Van de Graaff Building, also known as the Nuclear Physics Laboratory, is an annex built in 1964 behind and connected to Old Engineering Hall in order to house the world's first 3-stage Van de Graaff accelerator obtained by the University's Nuclear Physics Laboratory. The accelerator, which had numerous advantages over existing cyclotrons of the time, was financed with a $1.65 million grant from the National Science Foundation and a $1 million gift for the building construction obtained from the Sarah Mellon-Scaife foundation. The building construction and accelerator installation and operation were directed by Jim McGruer.

Further renovations to the first, second, and third floors utilizing funding obtained from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 were completed in 2012. A large, vibration isolated cleanroom was added on the first floor, while the entire third floor and most of the second were completely redone internally. An added annex, containing a student machine shop and a helium recycling system, was completed in 2015. External signage refers to the building as \\"Nuclear Physics Laboratory\\", and rooms are labeled with and referred to by the \\"NPL\\" prefix by many university personnel and departments. Pitt's official campus maps, and several internal departments, still list the building as the 'Van de Graaff Building', which is often a source of confusion, both for visitors and internally.

Born at Caen in Normandy, he entered the Abbey of St. Benedict at Maredsous, Belgium, in 1881 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1886. After a disastrous year as prefect of the college at Maredsous he devoted himself primarily to scholarly research, ranging widely across European libraries and archives. Maredsous remained his scholarly base until 1907 when he moved to the Abbey of St. Boniface in Munich. He spent the years 1914-18 in Switzerland; his support of Germany in World War I brought him lasting unpopularity in Belgium. He returned to Switzerland in 1939, spending his last years at Fribourg. He is buried at Einsiedeln. Morin's lifelong project was a new edition of the sermons of Caesarius of Arles. He also published important editions of various works of Jerome, of sermons of Augustine discovered subsequent to the edition of the Maurists, and of many other works, often in the series Anecdota Maredsolana. He was awarded honorary degrees by the universities of Oxford (1905), Budapest (1915), Zurich (1919), and Freiburg im Breisgau (1926).

The settlement of K√ºstrin-Kietz formed the western part of K√ºstrin which is now Polish Kostrzyn nad OdrƒÖ, until it was cut off by the implementation of the Oder-Neisse line in 1945. The town's quarters west of the Oder River then belonged to East Germany and were renamed Kietz in 1954. In a 1991 vote the inhabitants chose to readopt the historic denotation.

He entered the Royal Dutch Navy, becoming a midshipman in 1826, and rose through the ranks by serving on several vessels. He became a lieutenant, 2nd class in April 1831 and was promoted to lieutenant, 1st class in December 1845. He served as a training officer at the KIM (Royal Naval Institute) in Medemblik from 1847. From 1855 to 1857, Pels Rijcken was assigned as commandant of the Nagasaki Naval Training Center, teaching the principles of a modern naval science (navigation, cannonry, ship-handling) to samurai including Katsu Kaishu. He arrived as captain of the Gedeh which accompanied the steam warship, the ZM SS Soembing, a gift from King William III of the Netherlands to Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iesada.J. A. van der Chijs, Ne√™rlands streven tot openstelling van Japan voor den wereldhandel: Uit officieele, grootendeels onuitgegeven bescheiden toegelicht The Hague, Frederik Muller, 1867, p. 460).

The 15-story facility, completed in 1974, was designed by Kuhn, Newcomer & Valentour and houses the university's chemistry department. A three-story addition above Ashe Auditorium was completed in 2011. History Chevron Science Center sits on the site of the university's original building in the Oakland section Pittsburgh, the former State Hall Between 1910 and 1971, the site of Chevron Science Center had been occupied by the former State Hall, the first building erected upon Pitt's move in the early 20th century to the Oakland campus and at various times home to the university's library, administration, and engineering department. Chevron Science Center's $14.7 million cost ($ million today) was partially offset by a $2 million grant ($ million today) from the National Science Foundation. Its completion brought together under one roof many chemistry facilities that were, at the time, scattered among eight different buildings on Pitt's campus. Upon its completion, it was the largest school building for chemistry instruction and research east of the Mississippi River. The building also received a second place award in the \\"Lab of the Year\\" contest conducted by Industrial Research magazine. It contains a 500-seat auditorium dedicated to Lauren H. Ashe, a 1914 Pitt alumnus who was a pioneer in the pharmaceutical industry. The building was named in recognition of Chevron Corporation's donation of its then recently acquired $100-million, 85-acre (340,000 m2), fully equipped Gulf Oil Applied Research Center to the university in 1985. In 2008, a $5.5-million overhaul of the 14th floor was completed and included the creation of new organic chemistry research laboratories.Kimberly K. Barlow & Peter Hart, What's New?

It is the site of Neuhardenberg Palace, residence of the Prussian statesman Prince Karl August von Hardenberg. The municipal area comprises the villages of Altfriedland, Quappendorf and Wulkow. Neuhardenberg is part of the Amt (\\"collective municipality\\") Amt Neuhardenberg. Neuhardenberg Manor Names of the place The oldest record mentioning the place, then named Quilicz, dates back to 1348. Later the spelling was changed into Quilitz. When in 1814 Karl August von Hardenberg received the manor, he renamed the place right away into Neu-Hardenberg. On Labour Day, 1 May 1949, the place was renamed into Marxwalde after Karl Marx. This was reversed on January 1, 1991. Since then the place bears again the old name Neuhardenberg in this slightly altered spelling. History Parish church The construction of Neuhardenberg Manor with interior designs by Carl Gotthard Langhans dates back to the late 18th century. In 1763 the Prussian general Joachim Bernhard von Prittwitz had received Quilitz, a former property of the Pfuel noble family. The historic village was devastated by a blaze in 1801 and reconstructed as a Neoclassical model settlement according to plans designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. In 1814 King Frederick William III vested Hardenberg with the locality together with the princely title as a gratification for his merits as Prussian state chancellor. From 1820 on Schinkel also rebuilt the mansion, while the gardens were redesigned by Prince Hermann von P√ºckler-Muskau and Peter-Joseph Lenn√©. Carl-Hans Graf von Hardenberg held conspirative meetings here in preparation of the 20 July plot after which he was arrested and his properties were seized by the Nazi authorities. In 1945 Hardenberg again had to face the condemnation of his estates by the Soviet Military Administration. The mansion was turned into a school building. From 1957 on the Marxwalde airfield built in the 1930s was extended as the base of an East German Air Force wing. After reunification the manor was restored to the Hardenberg family and acquired by the Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband saving banks association in 1996. After renovation it was reopened in 2002 in the presence of German President Johannes Rau. It is today used as a conference building but also for cultural events.

History With the foundation of a plywood mill in 1906, the first manufacturing company came to Rehfelde. On September 3, 1907 the night the express train from Insterburg to Berlin derailed at a speed of about 85 km/h near Rehfelde station. On July 12, 1908 set up twelve citizens a volunteer fire department. In the early 20th century, the population rose sharply. This was due to rising rents in Berlin, which led to an increased influx. During World War I 24 community residents lost their lives. In 1922, the local branch of the Communist Party of Germany, five years later the Social Democratic Party were founded. In the period of National Socialism, some citizens of the municipality resisted the Nazis, including the communist Wilhelm Betke and the pastor Otto Perel. During World War II several houses were destroyed by bombing in the year 1944. Around 100 people lost their lives due to the war. After the war During the land reforms in the years 1945 to 1949, the government distributed about 1,000 hectares of land to settlers and farmers. On 20 February 1953, the Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft Friedrich Ebert was founded.

The species is known for its remarkable behaviours, like many other bowerbirds (Ptilonorynchidae), which include bower building and decorating, courtship displays and vocal mimicry. Spotted bowerbirds are locally common, however, overall the population is thought to be in decline.  Description  At 29 cm in length, spotted bowerbirds are intermediate in size among the bowerbirds, but are rather slim and compact. Spotted bowerbirds are sexually monomorphic, with a pale rufous head that is streaked with grey-brown and a nape adorned with a lilac-pink crest. The upperparts are blackish-brown and marked extensively with amber spots, while the paler underparts are cream with greyish scalloping and barring and a slightly yellow shade to the lower belly and undertail. The bill is black, the eyes dark brown and the legs olive- brown. Spotted bowerbirds have a diverse range of vocalisations. Typical calls include loud, harsh churrings and other notes, as well as the complex vocal mimicry characteristic of grey bowerbirds. Spotted bowerbirds are accomplished vocal mimics and have been known to simulate the calls of many birds as well as other sounds. When approached by humans or other potential threats, males at bowers and females at nests often mimic the calls of predatory birds such as the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax), blue-winged kookaburra (Dacelo leachii), grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis), grey butcherbird (Cracticus torquatus), pied butcherbird (Cracticus nigrogularis), australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), australian raven (Corvus coronoides), apostlebird (Struthidea cinerea) and honeyeaters (Meliphagidae spp.) among others. Other sounds mimicked include large herbivores moving through scrub or over fallen branches, the twang of fence wire, wood chopping, the crack of stock whip and the whistling flight of crested pigeons.466x466px  Taxonomy and Systematics  First described by John Gould as Ptilonorynchus maculata, then later changed to Chlamydodera occipitalis, it was again changed to Chlamydera maculata, which is the currently accepted name by some taxonomic authorities (e.g. James Clements, Birdlife International and ITIS ). Molecular studies by Kusmierski et al. lead Christidis and Boles to merge the genus Chlamydera with Ptilonorynchus, leading to the current alternative name of Ptilonorynchus maculatus. See bowerbirds for higher systematics. Spotted bowerbirds were formerly considered conspecific with the western bowerbird (Ptilonorynchus guttata), until the latter was defined as a separate species by Gould. The spotted bowerbird is a monotypic species with no subspecies described.  Habitat  Spotted bowerbirds occur most commonly in dry, open sclerophyll woodlands with dense understories of small trees and shrubs, where their plumage becomes cryptic. They show particular preference for habitats dominated by eucalypts spp. (Eucalyptus) and/or Brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) and have strong associations with riverine woodlands. Spotted bowerbirds often inhabit orchards, parks and are known to frequent rural homesteads and gardens.  Food  The diet of spotted bowerbirds consists mostly of fruit, flowers, and seeds, but arthropods are also consumed. They are also known to take food scraps from campsites and houses and raid orchards and gardens for fruit. Spotted bowerbirds usually forage alone or in small groups but are sometimes seen in flocks of 10-30 birds when not attending nests and bowers.  Behaviour   Breeding  The extended breeding occurs between July and March, with most eggs laid between October and February.  Bowers  279x279px Like most bowerbirds, Spotted bowerbirds are polygynous and males build and maintain bowers and display courts. These serve as a focal point for may social activities and are thought to act as an indicator of male quality for potential mates. Spotted bowerbirds build avenue-bowers of grass and twigs, that are wider than many other avenue building bowerbirds. Males may paint the walls of bowers using masticated grass and saliva. Bowers are generally built under large, thorny bushes that provide shelter and fruit. Some bower sites, known as traditional sites, may be retained for upwards of 20 years; rebuilt each year by a number of males in successive years.  Display Courts  Display courts are located immediately adjacent to bowers and are decorated with leaves, flowers, fruits, seed pods, insect frass and exuviae, shells, eggshells, bones, stones and charcoal. Man-made objects are also frequently used to decorate bower sites including glass, wire, foil and other metal objects. The number and types of decorations are linked to the mating success of males, suggesting that decorations also play a role in mate choice by females. The types of decorations preferred by spotted bowerbirds varies geographically, which may indicate that females prefer males who collect varying items, depending on their location.  Courtship Display  Once females have been attracted to bowers successfully, males perform elaborate courtship displays that consist of central and peripheral displays, with vocalisations being made throughout. Uniquely to spotted bowerbirds, the females watch the energetic display through the partially transparent northern wall of the bower. * Central displays are performed in the immediate vicinity of the bower and involve upright posture, raised wings and presentation of the retractile lilac-pink nuchal crest, which is larger in bower owning males. During this phase, movements are jerky, erratic and strained. 419x419px * Peripheral displays consist of males walking around their bower in wide circles with a raised head, open beak, cocked tail and drooped wings. Males often use decorations as props during display, either holding them in their bills or picking them up and aggressively throwing them down. Courtship displays can last minutes or sometimes more than an hour.  Nesting  Like most bowerbirds, males take no part in parental care. Females build nests in trees and bushes, but also occasionally in mistletoes (Loranthaceae) an average of 6m above the ground. Nests consist of an eggcup of fine twiglets built on a foundation of larger sticks and twigs. Clutches are usually a single egg that is oval shaped and pale greenish-grey with strong vermiculations of dark brown and black. Incubation and nestling periods remain unknown for this species.  Conservation Status  Spotted bowerbirds are listed as least concern by the IUCN Red List and are locally common, however, overall the species is thought to be in decline. Local extinctions are common across much of its range, particularly in the south west. The species is now extinct in South Australia, where it formerly had a small range, and is listed under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. Drivers of this decline may be illegal shooting and poisoning by humans who consider them a pest, predation by introduced species such as feral cats (Felis catus) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and habitat clearing and modification leading to fragmentation.

Previously, the Commission on Higher Education supervises the legal education in the Philippines but was replaced by the Legal Education Board since 1993 after the enactment of Republic Act No. 7662 or the Legal Education Reform Act of 1993. History The legal education in the Philippines was first introduced during the Spanish occupation when, in 1734, the University of Santo Tomas established the Faculty of Civil Law. After the Malolos Constitution was ratified, the Universidad Literaria de Filipinas was established by Joaquin Gonzales in 1899; the said institution offered several courses including law. However, the Literaria's existence was short lived as a result of the eruption of the Filipino-American conflict. During the American occupation, specifically in 1911, the University of the Philippines College of Law was established, through the vision and efforts of George Malcolm. The said law institution continues to be the one of the oldest state college of law in the country. The ratification of the 1935 Constitution paved the way for the establishment of law programs in various private colleges and universities in Manila (schools, at that time, were required to acquire license to operate from the Department of Public Instruction). At that time, there was hardly any kind of supervision of law schools, especially for private institutions. The Faculty of Civil Law of the University of Santo Tomas, the University of the Philippines‚ÄìCollege of Law, the former Colegio de Ateneo de Manila and the Philippine Law School were the leading law institutions during those period. After World War II and in the contemporary time, more law schools were then established. Legal Education Board The Legal Education Board supervises all law schools and continuing legal education providers in the Philippines. The Board is headed by a Chairman who is a retired justice of a collegiate court (i.e., Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan, Court of Tax Appeals, etc.). Regular members of the Board include a representative from each of the following: *Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) *Philippine Association of Law Schools (PALS) *Philippine Association of Law Professors (PALP) *active law practitioners *bona fide law students The Board has made legal reforms which include‚Äîthe stricter selection of law students and law professors; improvements in quality of instruction and facilities of law schools; provisions for legal apprenticeship of law students; and the requirement of attendance to continuing legal education seminars for practicing attorneys. Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Lawyers with names appearing in the Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court, unless disbarred, are all members of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP). However, to be IBP members of good standing, lawyers are required to complete, every three years, at least thirty-six hours of continuing legal education seminars approved by the Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Committee (MCLE). Members who fail to comply shall pay a non-compliance fee, and shall be listed as a delinquent member. The Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Office, established by the Supreme Court, is the official government agency tasked to implement compliance with the MCLE requirement. The MCLE Office is headed by former Supreme Court Justice Carolina C. Grino-Aquino, widow of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Ramon Aquino. Its office is located at the fourth floor of the IBP Building in Ortigas Center.  Legal systems The Philippine legal system is an amalgamation of the world's major systems. These systems include Roman civil law which was inherited from Spain; the Anglo-American common law which were derived from the laws of the United States; and Islamic law, otherwise known as the Sharia law, of the Muslim world. Private law and legal codes are substantially patterned after the civil law of Spain, while public law, including political law, is based on the Anglo-American legal system. Law degree programs Law degree programs are considered professional/post- baccalaureate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a bachelor's degree, with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas. Completion of a required course from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement in order to take the Philippine Bar Examination, the national licensure examination as precursor to admission to the practice of law in the country. Legal education in the Philippines normally proceeds along the following route: * Undergraduate education (usually 4 years) * Law school (usually 4 years) * Admission to the bar (usually by taking a Philippine bar exam) * Legal practice and mandatory continuing legal education Law degrees in the Philippines may be classified into three types‚Äîprofessional, graduate level and honorary. Professional law degrees In order to be eligible to take the bar examinations, one must complete the Juris Doctor (J.D.) program, which may be either the non-thesis or thesis course. Advanced degrees are offered by some law schools, but are not requirements for admission to the practice of law in the Philippines. *Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) ‚Äì The LL.B. was the most common law degree offered and conferred by Philippine law schools. It was a standard four-year law program covering all bar exam subjects. Almost all law schools followed a standard LL.B. curriculum, wherein students are exposed to the required bar subjects. Other schools, like the University of the Philippines College of Law, allow students to substitute electives for bar review subjects offered in the fourth year of study.Curriculum models, Philippine Association of Law Schools, 2006. In December 2018, as mandated by LEB, the LL.B. program was phased out and was migrated to the J.D. non-thesis program; such migration applied retroactively to LL.B. degree holders, meaning all LL.B. degree holders were also conferred of the new migrated degree. *Juris Doctor (J.D.) - The J.D. degree was developed and first conferred in the Philippines by the Ateneo Law School in 1991. The J.D. program is a four- year law program. Like the standard LL.B. program, the J.D. curriculum covers the core subjects required for the bar examinations. Unlike the LL.B., the Ateneo J.D. program requires students to finish the core bar subjects in 2 years, take elective subjects, undergo an apprenticeship, and prepare and defend a thesis. Currently, the program may be taken either with thesis or that with non-thesis. **Juris Doctor-Master of Business Administration, (J.D.-M.B.A.), ‚Äì The J.D.-M.B.A. program is a double degree program in law and management offered at the professional-graduate level. It was introduced and is so far offered only by the La Salle-FEU MBA-JD Program, a consortium of Far Eastern University Institute of Law and De La Salle Graduate School of Business. Under this program, the requirements of the J.D. and M.B.A. programs are satisfied by the taking of concurrent units of study, allowing students to complete the program in five instead of six years. Graduate law degrees Beyond the J.D. or LL.B., members of the Philippine bar have the option of pursuing graduate degrees in law. *Master of Laws (LL.M.) ‚Äì The LL.M. is a graduate law degree offered to holders of basic law degrees (LL.B. and J.D.). It is generally offered to law graduates and lawyers of any nationality. Six Philippine law schools so far conduct the program‚Äîthe Ateneo Law School, which offers an International Master of Laws program; the University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law, which first offered the LL.M.; San Sebastian College - Recoletos Graduate School of Law; University of Manila College of Law; Manuel L. Quezon University College of Law; Central Philippine University College of Law in Consortium with San Beda College; San Beda Graduate School of Law; and PLM Graduate School of Law of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (University of the City of Manila). LL.M. programs were once offered by the Far Eastern University Institute of Law, the Escuela de Derecho de Manila (now Manila Law College Foundation), and the University of the Philippines College of Law but were eventually phased out due to lack of enrollment and funding. *Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) ‚Äì The D.C.L. program is a doctoral program in law offered to holders of the LL.M. degree. Candidates who hold only LL.B. degrees may be admitted upon completion of prerequisite LL.M. subjects. The D.C.L. was pioneered by the University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law. Their program structure is highly similar to the D.C.L. offered in the Complutense University of Madrid.Official Prospectus, Law Department, University of Santo Tomas Graduate School, 2006. The PLM Graduate School of Law has already opened its own D.C.L. program.List of programs, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (University of the City of Manila), 2007. *Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D. or J.S.D.) ‚Äì The S.J.D. or J.S.D. program is currently offered only by the San Beda Graduate School of Law. While the candidate for the degree is required some academic units, the grant of the degree relies on the candidates research output as well as his or her participation in international symposia, seminars and programs as lecturer, panel presenter or paper presenter. The candidate presents a doctoral dissertation that is argued before a Panel of Oral Examiners and then delivers a 'lectio coram' -- a lecture in the presence of legal luminaries. Honorary law degrees Some Philippine universities also confer the honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degree. It is given to famous individuals who, in the discretion of the awarding institution, were found to have made significant contributions to a certain field, or to the improvement of society or development of the conditions of mankind in general. Ecclesiastical law degrees A few Roman Catholic seminaries and graduate schools offer degree programs in canon law, an ecclesiastical program that is not required in the Philippine Bar Examinations. The University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Canon Law runs the oldest academic programs of this kind. Its Licentiate of Canon Law (J.C.L.) and Doctor of Canon Law (J.C.D.) programs are open to priests, nuns, theologians, and even to lay people (i.e., trial court judges, law deans, family lawyers etc.). Judges of the Roman Catholic Marriage Tribunal typically hold academic degrees in the field.Official prospectus, University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Canon Law, 2006. Degrees in canon law, strictly speaking, are not considered law degrees in the Philippines. Developments There is a move among members of the Philippine Association of Law Schools (PALS) to convert their LL.B. programs into J.D. curricula. There are currently two possible directions for the change: First, the conversion of LL.B. programs through adopting a model substantially similar to the J.D. curriculum introduced by the Ateneo de Manila Law School (the J.D. Programs of the FEU-La Salle consortium and the University of Batangas Law School are of this mold), and second, simply changing the name of the degree conferred from \\"LL.B.\\" to \\"J.D.\\" while essentially retaining the same course offerings as those in the DECS Model Law Curriculum (DECS Order No. 27, series of 1989). Admission to the practice of law The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines has given the Supreme Court the sole power to admit individuals to the practice of law in the Philippines.Section 5, Article VIII, The Philippine Constitution, 1987. This power is exercised through a Bar Examination Committee, an ad hoc academic group tasked to formulate questions, administer proceedings, grade examinations, rank candidates, and release the results of the Philippine Bar Examination. To be eligible to take the national bar exam, a candidate must be a Filipino citizen, at least twenty-one years of age, and holder of a bachelor's degree and a law degree obtained from a government recognized law school in the Philippines. Graduates of law schools from other countries must obtain a law degree from the Philippines to qualify for the Philippine Bar.Section 2, 5-6; Rule 138, Revised Rules of Court. In March 2010 the Supreme court issued Bar matter 1153 allowing Filipino who are foreign law graduates to take the Bar exam provided that applicant complies with the following conditions: # completion of all courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Laws or its equivalent degree; # recognition or accreditation of the law school by the proper authority; # completion of all fourth year subjects in the Bachelor of Laws academic program in a law school duly recognized by the Philippine Government; and # must have completed a separate bachelor's degree.\\" Bar examinations The Philippine Bar Examinations is the national licensure exam for admission to the practice of law. It is conducted during the four Sundays of September, or October, or November of every year. It is arguably the hardest and the most media-covered of all government licensure examinations in the country.Alexander L. Lacson. \\"A Nation Under Lawyers.\\" The Practice: Business and Leisure Magazine for Lawyers. August‚ÄìSeptember 2004 Issue. It is also reputedly one of the hardest bar examinations in the world.Reports made by members of the Inter- Parliamentary Union, Session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, September 2005. For candidates intending to practice Islamic law in the Philippines, the Special Bar Exams for Shari'a Court Lawyers is given every two years. The Supreme Court Bar Office conducts the exam while the Office of Muslim Affairs determines the qualification and eligibility of candidates to the exams.Court En Banc Resolution, Supreme Court of the Philippines, September 20, 1983.  Attorneys-at-law  To be a full-fledged lawyer in the Philippines and be eligible to use the title Attorney, a candidate must graduate from a Philippine law school, take and pass the Philippine Bar Examinations, the candidate who passed the bar examinations is entitled to take and subscribe before the Supreme Court special en banc session the corresponding Attorney's Oath, as follows: The certificate to practice law will be granted by the Supreme Court after the lawyer sign his name in the Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court.The Legal Profession, a lecture delivered by Associate Justice Edgardo F. Sundiam of the Philippine Court of Appeals, Ateneo School of Law, June 2006. The full names of lawyers are found in the Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court, and in a similar list included in a Supreme Court publication entitled Law List. Philippine law schools Starting from 2017, the Legal Education Board had started implementing the Philippine Law School Admission Test (PhilSAT); the failure to pass such admission test prohibits a person from enrolling to any law schools in the Philippines. It is a one-day aptitude test intended to measure the academic potential of an examinee who wishes to pursue the study of law. , there are 108 law schoolsMilagros Santos- Ong, Office of the Director of Library Services, Supreme Court of the Philippines.

The word is from the Greek Œ∏œåŒªŒøœÇ, tholos (pl. tholoi), which means a circular building with a conical or vaulted roof. The Romans transliterated the word into the Latin tholus, which means cupola or dome.Simpson, D.P. (1968). Cassell's New Latin Dictionary; Funk & Wagnalls: New York, p. 604. In 1973, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted tholus as one of a number of official descriptor terms for topographic features on Mars and other planets and satellites.Greeley, R. (1994) Planetary Landscapes, 2nd ed.; Chapman & Hall: New York, pp. 35-36. One justification for using neutral Latin or Greek descriptors was that it allowed features to be named and described before their geology or geomorphology could be determined.Russell, J.F.; Snyder, C.W.; Kieffer, H.H. (1992). Origin and Use of Martian Nomenclature in Mars, H.H. Kieffer et al., Eds.; University of Arizona Press: Tucson, AZ, p. 1310. For example, many tholi appear to be volcanic in origin, but the term does not imply a specific geologic origin.Russell, J.F.; Snyder, C.W.; Kieffer, H.H. (1992). Origin and Use of Martian Nomenclature in Mars, H.H. Kieffer et al., Eds.; University of Arizona Press: Tucson, AZ, p. 1312. Currently (March 2015), the IAU recognizes 56 descriptor terms.

Aurin Biotech In August 2012, McGeer and his wife Edith founded Aurin Biotech Inc., following indications that the Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) complex inhibit activation of the Complement system. Since activation of the complement system is implicated in a number of diseases (see Complement system#Role in Disease), these indications suggested that ATA could be an effective treatment for these diseases. Aurinhttp://www.aurinbiotech.com was founded to explore the efficacy of using ATA and related compounds in the treatment of these diseases. The particular focus is on diseases that are caused or exacerbated by aberrant complement activation. Low molecular weight components of the aurintricarboxylic acid complex have been shown to be non-toxic and orally effective.

Built in the early 18th century, the mansion is one of the finest examples of Palladian architecture in the United States. Construction William Peters, an English lawyer and land management agent for the Penn family, bought the property, then a group of farms, in 1742. Peters designed and built the mansion in 1745 and planted formal gardens around it. During the American Revolution As the American Revolution approached, the estate passed to William's son, Richard Peters, Jr., who had been born there. Richard served as Speaker of the Pennsylvania Assembly, Pennsylvania State Senator and Judge of the United States District Court. An amateur scientist, he operated the estate farm as a working model of scientific agriculture. Many prominent figures in the Revolution stayed at the mansion at this time, including George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. Part of Fairmount Park City skyline at night from mansion The property became part of Fairmount Park in 1869 as part of a program to preserve the quality of the water supply. In anticipation of the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876, a large dining pavilion was built alongside the mansion. Belmont was added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places, June 26, 1956. The site continued to be used for public entertaining until it became a historic house museum under the management of the American Women's Heritage Society in 1986.

History Plaque on the ƒ¶amrija Tower ƒ¶amrija Tower was built in 1659 on a cliff on the southwestern coast of Malta, on the site of a medieval watch post. It is located between Gƒßar Lapsi, which is part of Siƒ°ƒ°iewi, and Wied i≈º-≈ªurrieq, which is part of Qrendi. It has excellent views of the island of Filfla. The tower is located a few hundred meters from two Neolithic temple sites, Mnajdra and ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim, although these had not yet been discovered when it was built. The tower's structure is similar to the other De Redin towers, having a square base with two floors. The entrance is on the upper floor, which can be reached by a retractable ladder. The nearest tower in the chain is the Sciutu Tower to the southeast. ƒ¶amrija Tower is the last tower on the southwest coast, so it has no other towers in its line of sight. It was originally armed with a 3-pounder gun and a ¬Ω-pounder gun, which were mainly used to signal to the other towers. Present day The tower was recently restored and partially rebuilt after parts of its external revetments collapsed. These works involved the reconstruction of the spiral staircase, along with the shaft and parapet. It now forms part of the ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim and Mnajdra Archaeological Park, which includes the temples, the tower, a memorial to Sir Walter Norris Congreve, a visitor centre and the surrounding area.

Denali Software Denali Software, Inc. was an American software company, based in Sunnyvale, California, now acquired by Cadence. The company produces electronic design automation (EDA) software, intellectual property (IP) and design cores and platforms for memory, other standard interfaces and system- on-chip (SoC) design and verification. It has its engineering offices in Sunnyvale, Austin and Bangalore. Incorporated in 1996, Denali is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California and serves the global electronics industry with direct sales and support offices in North America, Europe, Japan and Asia. On May 2010, Cadence Design Systems announced that it would acquire Denali for $315 million. Valid Logic Systems Valid Logic Systems was one of the first commercial electronic design automation (EDA) companies, now acquired by Cadence. It was founded in the early 1980s, along with Daisy Systems Corporation and Mentor Graphics, collectively known as DMV. The engineering founders were L. Curtis Widdoes, Tom McWilliams and Jeff Rubin, all of whom had worked on the S-1 supercomputer project at Livermore Labs. Valid acquired several companies such as Telesis (PCB layout), Analog Design Tools, and Calma (IC layout). In turn, Valid was acquired by Cadence Design Systems in the early 90s. Valid built both hardware and software, for schematic capture, logic simulation, static timing analysis, and packaging. Much of the initial software base derived from SCALD (\\"Structured Computer-Aided Logic Design\\"), a set of tools developed to support the design of the S-1 supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Later, Valid expanded into IC design tools and into printed circuit board layout. At first, Valid ran schematic capture on a proprietary UNIX workstation, the SCALDSystem, with static timing analysis, simulation, and packaging running on a VAX or IBM-compatible mainframe. However, by the mid-1980s, general purpose workstations were powerful enough, and significantly cheaper. Companies such as Mentor Graphics and Cadence Design Systems sold software only for such workstations. By 1990, almost all Valid software was also running on workstations, primarily those from Sun Microsystems.

Hunting in Russia has an old tradition in terms of indigenous people, while the original features of state and princely economy were farming and cattle-breeding. There was hunting for food as well as sport. The word \\"hunting\\" (\\"–æ—Ö–æ—Ç–∞\\", okhota) first appeared in the common Russian language at the end of the 15th century. Before that the word \\"catchings\\" (\\"–ª–æ–≤—ã\\", lovy) existed to designate the hunting business in general. The hunting grounds were called in turn lovishcha (\\"–ª–æ–≤–∏—â–∞\\"). In the 15th-16th centuries, foreign ambassadors were frequently invited to hunts; they also received some of the prey afterwards. So did Feodor I in particular, once sending out nine elks, one bear and a black-and-brown fox. The right of using the hunting grounds in Russia was once granted to every social class. The right of the nobility was even sometimes limited by agreements with others regarding hunting grounds. The hawkers and separate persons who dealt with hounds, beavers, black grouses, hares, etc. were permitted either on the landed properties, or on territories specified by local people. Though the Russian Orthodox clergy once disapproved the hunting, these persons were authorized to eat and feed their horses, hounds and falcons on others' account or even demand participation in hunting.Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary The Russian imperial hunts evolved from hunting traditions of early Russian rulers (Grand Princes and Tsars), under the influence of hunting customs of European royal courts. The imperial hunts were organized mainly in Peterhof, Tsarskoye Selo and Gatchina. During the soviet rule, state-sponsored hunting clubs were formed within the administrative boundaries or factories. Hunting clubs based in cities were allocated hunting grounds where club members were allowed to hunt according to the federal and local regulations. Following demise of the Soviet Union private individuals were allowed to lease hunting territories formerly used by government sponsored clubs. Many lease owners are wealthy Russians who are willing to spend large sums of money in order to maintain leased hunting grounds for their pleasure and sometimes to allow other hunters to use their territories for a fee. As a result, the quality and quantity of the game increased dramatically during the past 20 years in most parts of Russia. During the Soviet Union time, a single agency called \\"Glavohota\\" was granted an authority to conduct hunts for the foreign hunters. Nowadays many outfitters and booking agents organize hunting trips for the foreigners. The inevitable competition between such companies improved quality of hunts and brought down the prices which used to be extremely high. Big game Bear Russia's northeast part, the Kamchatka Peninsula and the coastal regions of the Pacific Ocean, have the highest density of brown bears. There are Eurasian brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos), Siberian brown bear (Ursus arctos beringianus), Syrian brown bear (Ursus arctos syriacus), Ussuri brown bear (Ursus arctos lasiotus), etc. Grand Prince of Moscow Ivan IV Vasilyevich was present at the bear hunts at the age of 13.–ö–∞—Ä–∞–º–∑–∏–Ω, –ù. –ú. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ, —Ç.

Wolf  The wolf is the most widespread large indigenous game animal in Russia. The best hunting time is considered to be January‚ÄìFebruary. Carcasses of hunted wolves in Kamyshinsky District, Volgograd Oblast, Russia. Wolves were hunted in both Czarist and Soviet Russia with borzoi by landowners and Cossacks.Chapter 10: Wolf Control Methods in Will Graves, and Valerius Geist, editors. Wolves in Russia. Detselig Enterprises Ltd. 210, 1220 Kensington Road NW, Calgary, Alberta T2N 3P5. USA. Covers were drawn by sending mounted men through a wood with a number of dogs of various breeds, including deerhounds, staghounds and Siberian wolfhounds, as well as smaller greyhounds and foxhounds,Chapter 8: Wolfing for Sport in Barry Lopez' Of Wolves and Men, 1978 Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, USA. as they made more noise than borzoi. A beater, holding up to six dogs by leash, would enter a wooded area where wolves would have been previously sighted. Other hunters on horseback would select a place in the open where the wolf or wolves may break. Each hunter held one or two borzois, which would be slipped the moment the wolf takes flight. Once the beater sighted a wolf, he would shout \\"Loup! Loup! Loup!\\" and slip the dogs. Thea idea was to trap the wolf between the pursuing dogs and the hunters on horseback outside the wood. The borzois would pursue the wolf along with the horsemen and yapping curs. Once the wolf was caught by the borzois, the foremost rider would dismount and quickly dispatch the wolf with a knife. Occasionally, wolves are captured alive in order to better train borzoi pups.Russia As I Know It, by Harry De Windt, Published by BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2009, , , 272 pages Before the Emancipation reform of 1861, wolf hunting was done solely by authorised firearm holders, usually police, soldiers, rich landowners or nobles. Upon learning of the frequency of attacks on livestock and humans, the Czarist Ministry of the Interior sent agents to Western Europe in order to learn how the people there dealt with wolf problems. Upon returning, the Ministry of Internal Affairs developed a plan in 1846 to deal with wolves involving the opening of wolf bounties and appointment of government hunters. Each hunter was given jurisdiction to hunt in one district, with more than one for large areas. Hunters were given 3 rubles for each male wolf killed and 1.5 for each cub, with a tail presented as proof. Each hunter would receive an annual salary of 60 rubles a year, provided he kill 15 adults and 30 cubs a year. Peasant hunters however were rarely rewarded, due to corrupt bureaucrats stealing the money. In 1858, after paying $1 250 000 for over a million wolves in Central Russia, officials became suspicious, and discovered that some hunters bought wolf pelts for low prices, cut them up and handed them to magistrates as wolf tails. In the latter years of the 19th century, Russian hunting societies began an energetic campaign against wolves. In 1897, members of the Moscow Hunting Society killed their first 1000 wolves, though the number of professional wolf hunters at the time was rather low. Serfs began hunting wolves after their emancipation in 1861, though rarely with success, as civilian firearms were highly expensive, and the cheaper ones were usually primitive and unable to bare the heavy ammunition necessary to kill wolves. After the Russian Revolution (1917), the newly formed Soviet government worked heavily to eradicate wolves and other predators during an extensive land reclamation program. During the Eastern Front, wolf populations increased, though after Nazi Germany's defeat, wolf hunts resumed. With the end of the war and the onset of aerial hunting, the USSR destroyed 42,300 wolves in 1945, 62,700 wolves in 1946, 58,700 wolves in 1947, 57,600 in 1948, and 55,300 in 1949. From 1950 to 1954, an average of 50,000 wolves were killed annually. In 1966, wolves had been successfully exterminated in 30 oblasts of the RSFSR. During this time, wolf depredations on humans and livestock had dropped by a factor of ten. However, with the publishing of a Russian translation of Farley Mowatt's fictional book Never Cry Wolf, wolf hunts decreased in popularity. Amid public outcry, Czarist and Soviet records of wolf attacks on both livestock and people were ignored and wolf hunts decreased in number, allowing wolves to multiply. 15,900 wolves were reportedly culled from the RSFSR in 1978, compared to 7,900 two years prior. With an increase in population, twice as many wolves were culled in the 1980s than in the prior decade. Wolves became extinct in Wrangel Island in the early 1980s. In 1984, the RSFSR had over 2000 wolf hunting brigades consisting of 15,000 hunters who killed 16 400 wolves. Overall, the Soviet Union culled over 1 500 000 wolves for a cost of 150,000,000 rubles on bounties alone. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many wolf bounties were lowered or dropped altogether. Wolf hunting continues in Russia, at the expense of individual hunters rather than the government. Hunting with hounds Peter II and his aunt Elizaveta Petrovna go hunting, a 1900 painting by Valentin Serov. Under Grand Duke Vasili III, who personally loved the huntings for hare, there were over one hundred chasseurs who dealt particularly with wolves and foxes. The court hunt of that time embraced the chasseurs with hounds (–≤—ã–∂–ª—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏), their head (–¥–æ–µ–∑–∂–∞—á–∏–π), borzoi hunters (–±–æ—Ä–∑—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏), dog- breeders and beaters. Additionally there were cooks, grooms and drivers. Depending on the number of hounds there were big and small hunts. The first one involved forty hounds and twelve packs of three borzois each, and the second consisted of eighteen hounds and twenty borzois in five packs. The gunless hunting with hounds, particularly for hares or foxes, became widespread in the Russian Empire in the 18th-19th centuries, after the reign of Empress Anna who liked gun deerstalking. Emperor Peter II and Empress Elizabeth were among the most prominent lovers of hunting with hounds. The longest hunt of Peter II took place in 1729 in Tula, where fifty foxes, five bears, five lynxes and many hares were baited between September 7 and October 16. In that time the state kennel consisted of two hundred hounds and 420 borzois. Poaching has been fought notably by Empress Anna and Empress Catherine II. As landlords, counts and dukes had kennels, there were stables and villages with serfs, who sowed oats which was to be mixed with meat as a hound forage. Each kennel could support up to 1,000 hounds. The Emancipation reform of 1861 put an end to hunting with hounds. In 1917 there were only two hound chases in the fading Russian Empire: Gatchina and Pershino, in the Tula Governorate. Hunting birds Noblewomen hunting. Taken in the 1890s. Orthodox martyr Saint Trifon is often depicted with a white merlin on his hand. Particularly the name of Moscow's Sokolniki Park refers to the rapid spread of falconry-related slobodas in Tsarist Russia. As indicated by English diplomat Jerome Horsey, Boris Godunov used to be a hawker. Meanwhile, the use of hunting birds was already popular among Russian nobility in the times of the Golden Horde. There were several hundred such birds in possession of Ivan IV, and even the road tax was collected in pigeons for falcons. However, the first famous hawker was Alexis I, who created the falconry statute book (–£—Ä—è–¥–Ω–∏–∫ —Å–æ–∫–æ–ª—å–Ω–∏—á—å—è –ø—É—Ç–∏). The white, red or speckled merlins were also in common usage in those days. The merlin cocks were called cheligi (—á–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏). The places where the birds were caught were called pomchishcha (–ø–æ–º—á–∏—â–∞) and the catchers - pomytchiki (–ø–æ–º—ã—Ç—á–∏–∫–∏). Before the reign of Feodor I each pomytchik community annually delivered three living falcons to the prince's falcon loft. In the time of Feodor I it became necessary to obtain two red merlins, three speckled and thirty-five grey. There were two state merlin lofts, in Semyonovskoye (in modern Sokolniki Park) and Kolomenskoye. An Italian ambassador, Horatio Calvucci, had been trying to get in and sketch at least one bird for six months; the embassy finally gained an access on February 13, 1662. In 1805 there were only fifteen hunting birds left in Semyonovskoye. The last event with hunting birds occurred during the coronation of Alexander II. The golden eagles were taken from Orenburg Governorate to hunt for wolves and foxes at that time. Walrus The first mention of Russia-related walrus hunting, in the Arctic part of the Northern Atlantic, is dated back to the late 9th century. At that time the Viking Ohthere of H√•logaland, sailing along the Kola Peninsula, landed somewhere on the White Sea coast and established trade relations with aboriginal people for walrus ivory. The Slavs and Saami people, who penetrated to this area in the early 12th century, could only hunt for small groups of walruses and came to the northern part of the White Sea from time to time. The Russian walrus hunting in that region started in the early 16th century. Purposeful and mass walrus hunting was stimulated by the exploration of the Arctic archipelagoes Novaya Zemlya and Spitsbergen with adjacent areas where the large walrus rookeries were concentrated. The collapse of Russian walrus hunting happened at the first half of the 19th century, being a result of interaction of both ecological and anthropological factors.

Born of British parents on holiday in Belgium, Pinhey made major contributions in entomology to the knowledge of butterflies, moths and dragonflies. Elliot Pinhey's interest in natural history first developed during his early education in England. He obtained a BSc at the University of London in mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology in 1934, after which he joined the teaching profession as a Science Master. His chronically poor health led to his doctor's suggesting he emigrate to a more congenial climate. Accordingly, he arrived in Southern Rhodesia in 1939 and took up a teaching post as Science Master. A stint with the Royal Air Force Meteorology department followed, and on his release he joined the Agriculture Department as economic entomologist, working on Acarina, Coccoidea and Chrysomelidae. His interest in Odonata surfaced in 1947 through J.A. Whelan who had joined his department, and Colonel F.C. Fraser who encouraged him. He joined the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria as assistant professional officer in entomology and later became the Museum's Odonata specialist. He was with the Coryndon Museum in Nairobi from 1949 to 1955 under Dr. LSB Leakey, during which period he was able to collect extensively in East and Central Africa, and develop an interest in Orthoptera and Hemiptera which he was not able to follow up. Pinhey was invited in 1955 to take up the position of Keeper of Invertebrate Zoology at the National Museum in Bulawayo. He was awarded a D.Sc. by the University of London in 1962 for his publications in entomology. He served as President of the Entomological Society of Southern Africa from 1974 to 1975, was an active member of the Societas Internationalis Odonatologica (SIO) and was widely regarded as the doyen of African Odonatology. Elliot Pinhey published almost 200 names for species, subspecies and forms of Odonata in thirty-three years, from 1950 to 1982. He named more than a tenth of known Afrotropical species, making him the most prolific author of that fauna aside from his predecessor, Frederic Fraser (Dijkstra et al. 2003). Sixty-three percent of his primary types are held in the Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo (NMBZ), where he worked from 1955 to 1980. His legacy is one of the major collections of African Odonata in the world and the most important one in the continent itself (Vick et al. 2001). There are 112 name-bearing types designated by Pinhey, Elliot Pinhey on a field trip on the edge of Dichwe forest, Rhodesia in 1978, taken by Cathy Car His numerous collecting trips led him to associate with such authorities as Dr Henry Bernard Davis Kettlewell (lepidopterist and geneticist known for his research on industrial melanism), Capt. Norman Denbigh Riley (1890‚Äì1979)(Keeper of Entomology at the British Museum), Richard South, Edward Bagnall Poulton (Hope Professor of Zoology at Oxford), G.D. Hale Carpenter (Hope Professor of Entomology) and Poulton's successor, Sir Guy Anstruther Knox Marshall FRS (1872‚Äì1959) specialist in Curculionidae of the British Museum (Natural History), Baron Charles de Worms and Frederick William Frohawk. Pinhey obtained material from species-rich, poorly accessible areas, such as NW Republic of Congo and near the confluence of the Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia borders. Therefore, his collection includes a large proportion of 'rare' species. Species described by Pinhey and known only from the type series and/or material in NMBZ are Chlorocypha rubriventris, Africallagma cuneistigma, Pseudagrion estesi, Aciagrion macrootithenae, A. nodosum, A. zambiense, Aeshna moori, Onychogomphus rossii, Paragomphus zambeziensis and Trithemis fumosa. New records have only come to light recently for Prodasineura flavifacies, Ceriagrion mourae and Paragomphus cataractae. Other rarities are Chlorocypha frigida, C. schmidti, Platycypha picta, Elattoneura incerta, Allocnemis mitwabae, Pseudagrion coeruleipunctum, P. greeni, Crocothemis brevistigma, Neodythemis fitzgeraldi and Trithemis brydeni. Family life Elliot Pinhey and his wife Nancy had one child, a daughter named Rosalind. They retired to Billingham, West Sussex where Elliot Pinhey fell ill in 1989 and had two light strokes. His failing health necessitated his staying at a nursing home in Cowfold near Horsham until his death in 1999. Papers and books *Pinhey, E., 1951. The dragonflies of Southern Africa.

The station, owned and operated by Strattan Broadcasting, is licensed to Brookville, Pennsylvania, the seat of government for Jefferson County. WJNG, licensed to Johnsonburg, is a full co- owned simulcast outlet of WMKX. History A \\"Magic\\" Beginning First issued a construction permit on June 6, 1980; WMKX first went on the air at the frequency of 95.9 in 1981, and became the second FM station in Jefferson County, as WPXZ, 15 miles southeast in Punxsutawney had been the first eight years before. WMKX was founded by Stephen S. Strattan and Joseph Donald Powers, adopting the moniker \\"Magic 96\\". It went on the air with a mostly automated format of adult contemporary music, which it would maintain until the late 1990s. Studios and offices were first located at 205 Main Street in downtown Brookville. In 1984, Jim Farley took over company president duties from Stephen Strattan. 1990s In the mid-1990s, another frequency of 103.3 was assigned to Brookville through the efforts of WPXZ licensee Renda Broadcasting, which had been looking to gain a foothold in the county seat. In order for the new station to go on the air, a series of channel shuffling would have to take place to accommodate the new frequency. The shuffling would enable WMKX to take WPXZ's frequency of 105.5 as its own, and with the move of that frequency northwest, it also enabled WMKX to petition the FCC for an effective radiated power increase from 3,000 to 25,000 watts (something that wasn't possible at 95.9 due to the presence of an FM station on 95.9 in Sharpsville, Pennsylvania, now WAKZ), thus taking the station from a local to more regional listenership base, allowing it to also serve the communities of Clarion and DuBois. With the right conditions, WMKX can be heard as far west as Butler, Pennsylvania. At around this same time, Strattan Broadcasting also applied for an FCC 'drop-in' frequency at 100.5 north of Brookville in Johnsonburg, Elk County. The 3,000 watt license was granted to Strattan Broadcasting, and after its construction, the station underwent a format change from adult contemporary to its current format. The station is live for the morning show until 1PM then it utilizes Dial Global's Classic Rock feed. WMKX Today In 1997, the new station, known as \\"Mega Rock\\" was born. The Johnsonburg station, WJNG, allowed WMKX's signal to expand into the northcentral portion of Pennsylvania, serving listeners in St. Marys, Ridgway, Smethport, and Kane. Though WJNG is a simulcast station, it maintains separate offices at 517¬Ω Market Street in Johnsonburg. What Happened to 95.9? As for what happened to WMKX's original frequency of 95.9, it was recovered by a local church and converted to an LPFM license, and had operated with a local Christian format staffed primarily by volunteers, for about five years. The church later closed the station, known as WWJL-LP, with a dark license in 2007. In May 2009, 95.9 was allocated to Sykesville, Pennsylvania and WZDB went on the air. It is now simulcasting WPQP. Administrative and programming functions continue to originate out of WMKX's longtime location at 51 Pickering Street in downtown Brookville. The station continues to operate under its original ownership by the Farley family, the principal owners of Strattan Broadcasting with Classic Rock Format 24/7.

After being awarded a Millennium Commission grant in 1995, the project commenced in 1996, and is now housed in the Wellcome Trust Millennium Building situated in the grounds of Wakehurst Place, West Sussex. Its purpose is to provide an \\"insurance policy\\" against the extinction of plants in the wild by storing seeds for future use. The storage facilities consist of large underground frozen vaults preserving the world's largest wild-plant seedbank or collection of seeds from wild species. The project had been started by Dr Peter Thompson and run by Paul Smith after the departure of Roger Smith. Roger Smith was awarded the OBE in 2000 in the Queen's New Year Honours for services to the Project. In collaboration with other biodiversity projects around the world, expeditions are sent to collect seeds from dryland plants. Where possible, collections are kept in the country of origin with duplicates being sent to the Millennium Seed Bank Project for storage. Major partnerships exist on all the continents, enabling the countries involved to meet international objectives such as the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation and the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations Environment Programme. The seed bank at Kew has gone through many iterations. The Kew Seed Bank facility, set up by Peter Thompson in 1980, preceded the MSBP and was headed by Roger Smith from 1980 to 2005. From 2005, Paul Smith took over as head of the MSBP.

The procedure is being carried out in a dust hood. Seed collections arrive at the MSBP in varying states, sometimes attached to fruits, sometimes clean. The collections usually also include a voucher specimen that can be used to identify the plant. The collections are immediately moved to a dry room until processing can be conducted where the seeds are cleaned of debris and other plant material, X-rayed, counted, and banked at . Seeds are banked in hermetically sealed glass containers along with Silica gel packets impregnated with indicator compounds that change colour if moisture seeps into the collection. Seeds are tested for viability with a germination test shortly after banking and then at regular 10 year intervals. If seed collections are low, re-harvesting from the wild is always the preferred option. Seed distribution When seeds are required for research purposes, they can be requested from the MSBP's seedlist. If it has the legal permission to do so, the MSB can then provide up to 60 seeds for free, to bona fide, non-commercial organisations for the purposes of research, restoration, and reintroduction. All seeds provided to institutions are on a non-profit mutual benefit basis. The MSB also operates the UK Native Seed Hub which aims to improve the resilience of the UK's ecological networks by providing high-quality UK native seeds to conservation and restoration groups.

Early life and career Frederick James Halliday was born on 25 December 1806 at Ewell, Surrey. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he was educated at Rugby School. However, a 1901 publication says that, although he went to Rugby in 1814, he entered St Paul's School, London in 1815, spent seven years there and thus \\"he may fairly be claimed as a Scholar of St. Paul's.\\" This is also the opinion of a historian of St. Paul's, Michael McDonnell, who notes that Halliday was sent to Rugby to be under the influence of its head master, John Sleath, and moved to St. Paul's as a consequence of Sleath being appointed as High Master there. Subsequently, he attended the East India College in Haileybury, before joining the Bengal civil service in 1824. He attended Fort William College in Calcutta, where he was taught by I. C. Vidyasagar. His first office in the civil service was as an assistant working for the supreme court in 1825. Halliday had become secretary to the Board of Revenue by 1836 and was appointed Home Secretary for the Government of India in 1849. He took a period of leave in England between July 1852 and November 1853, although he was frequently called upon to provide information to Parliament during that time. Lieutenant-governor Around May 1854, Halliday was appointed as the first Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. He took up residence at Belvedere House, the former home of Warren Hastings in Calcutta. Prior to that time the region had been overseen by the governor- general, and by a deputy-governor when the former was away. The deputies were appointed more on the basis of seniority than of merit. It had been recognised for some time that continued territorial acquisitions, which involved disparate populations and regions, both necessitated different administrative approaches and were causing the governor-general to be more frequently away from the area. The Marquess of Dalhousie, who was governor-general between 1847 and 1856, took the opportunity presented by the renewal of the East India Company's charter to reorganise affairs. It was anticipated that the appointment of Halliday would result in significant improvements to the administration of Bengal, and this proved to be the case because he had gained considerable administrative experience by this time. William Prinsep of Belvedere House, Calcutta. This became Halliday's official residence as lieutenant-governor from 1854. Among his achievements was the building of numerous roads that linked various towns. He also enabled much progress in the construction of the East Indian Railway. Both of these were seen by Halliday as necessities, for he recognised that speedy and accurate communication was a prerequisite for efficient administration. He introduced the Calcutta Municipal Act, enacted reforms of the police service (including better pay), tightened supervision of the inefficient justice system and increased the number of its officials. Arrangements were also introduced to limit civil disturbances and disruption by, for example, creating a force of military police. Although Bengal was on the periphery of events relating to the Indian rebellion of 1857, and Halliday was commended for his successes in dealing with civil unrest, he provided advice to Lord Canning, the governor-general, regarding how to deal with the rebellion elsewhere. He had past experience of uprisings, including one that had occurred at Santal in 1855, soon after his appointment to office. Aside from his administrative reforms, Halliday was also active in pursuit of social change. While serving as a magistrate in Hooghly district in 1829, he had witnessed the last legal sati (ritual burning of a widow) in Bengal, and as lieutenant-governor he sought to enforce the anti-sati legislation that had been enacted soon after. He was also involved in enabling the Widow Remarriage Act to facilitate the remarriage of Hindu widows, that piece of legislation being a consequence of agitation by, among others, his former mentor, Vidyasagar. Indeed, Vidyasagar enjoyed a close relationship to Halliday during the 1850s, and this helped achieve changes in other social policy spheres, such as education. Halliday was an enthusiastic supporter of the despatch on education formulated by Charles Wood in 1854, and as a consequence various measures were implemented. These included the establishment of director of public instruction for the region and the incorporation of the University of Calcutta. Halliday left the office of lieutenant-governor in May 1859. He had generally enjoyed the support of the governor-general during his tenure but he did antagonise some people within the official circles of the Indian government. Most notably, he had a long- running dispute with William Tayler, whom he considered to be incompetent. Halliday eventually removed Tayler from his position as Commissioner of Patna, following what Halliday considered to be a poor decision made by Tayler. This ultimately caused Tayler to resign and to bear a resentment that persisted until he died in 1892 and caused him publicly to seek redress for Halliday's actions. Subsequent life In 1860 Halliday was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He served as a Member of the Council of India from 1868 to 1886. Halliday, who had a lifelong interest in music, was a player of the contrabass and from this acquired the nickname of \\"Big Fiddle\\". He married Eliza Barbara Macgregor, the daughter of an officer in the army of the East India Company, on 25 December 1834. She predeceased him, in 1886, having borne several children, one of whom ‚Äî George Thomas Halliday ‚Äî was later a Lieutenant-General in the Bengal Cavalry. He died, aged 95, on 22 October 1901 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. His younger brother was General John Gustavus Halliday (1822‚Äì1917), and his grandson, Hastings Hadley D'Oyly (whom Clare Anderson thinks was probably named after Warren Hastings) was a member of the family of D'Oyly baronets.

History  The team debuted on WrestleMania XI when former WWF Champion Yokozuna was billed as Hart's mystery partner. This was Yokozuna's first appearance since 1994 Survivor Series. They defeated The Smoking Gunns to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. During their World Tag Team Championship reign, Owen Hart and Yokozuna rose to the top of the tag team division of WWF as they went on to make successful title defenses against the likes of The Smoking Gunns and The Allied Powers. The win over the Allied Powers at In Your House 2 PPV event was considered a major upset in fan's eyes at the time. During the next In Your House ppv event two months later, the World Tag Team Championship title defense was included but Hart was replaced by The British Bulldog because Hart was with his wife who was giving birth to their second child. Yokozuna and Bulldog defended the titles against Diesel and Shawn Michaels but lost to Diesel and Michaels when Diesel pinned Hart after a jacknife powerbomb who came to ringside late in the match. They went on to hold the title for 175 days during their first reign. Hart and Yokozuna were awarded the titles back the next day by their lawyer Clarence Mason because Hart was pinned in the match who was not a part of the match therefore Michaels and Diesel could not be champions. The same night, Hart and Yokozuna went on to lose the titles to The Smoking Gunns. After the match, their tag team disbanded as Yokozuna focused on singles career while Hart formed a tag team with The British Bulldog in 1996. Deaths Both men died aged 34.

Since both have great riches, killing Sigurd should be a win-win situation. Illustration by Jenny Nystr√∂m (1893). Sigur√∞arkvi√∞a hin skamma or the Short Lay of Sigurd is an Old Norse poem belonging to the heroic poetry of the Poetic Edda. It is one of the longest eddic poems and its name derives from the fact that there was once a longer Sigur√∞arkvi√∞a, but this poem only survives as the fragment Brot af Sigur√∞arkvi√∞u (see the Great Lacuna). According to Henry Adams Bellows, the poem was mainly composed for \\"vivid and powerful characterization\\" and not for the telling of a story with which most of the listeners of his time were already quite familiar. Bellows notes that the story telling is closer to the German tradition (found in the Nibelungenlied) than it is to the Scandinavian tradition, and that this is because the matter of Sigurd existed in many and varied forms in Northern Europe c. 1100 when the poem was probably composed. Synopsis The poem begins with the victorious young Sigurd the V√∂lsung's arrival at the court of Gj√∫ki and it informs that he swore oaths together with the two brothers (Gj√∫ki's sons Gunnarr and H√∂gni).They swear to be blood brothers. According to Bellows, this version belongs to the older Continental Germanic version in which Sigurd met the Gjukungs before he met Brynhildr, and he only meets her disguised as Gunnar. In a different version, he meets Brynhildr first before he meets the Gjukungs and he forgets her when Gu√∞r√∫n's mother Grimhild has given him a potion of forgetfulness. Both versions are present in Gr√≠pissp√°. The two brothers gave him many jewels and their sister Gu√∞r√∫n for wife, and they spent time together drinking and talking. Then the two brothers departed to woo Brynhildr and Sigurd joined them.Sigurd and Gunnar changed appearance, something that Grimhild had taught them. The V√∂lsunga saga tells how Sigurd and Gunnar met Heimir who told them that they had to cross the circle of fire to win Brynhildr. When Gunnar failed to do so, Sigurd took his form and crossed the wall of fire on Grani. The poet then jumps to the moment when Sigurd shared bed with Brynhildr by putting his sword between them. He never held her in his arms and gave her to Gj√∫ki's son (Gunnar). Then the poem dwells on Brynhildr and informs that she had never known either ill or sorrow. She was without blame and could not dream that she would have it, but fate would have it differently.Bellows suggests that this stanza may only mean that she lived happily with Gunnar until she had her quarrel with Gu√∞r√∫n. It may also refer to the version in which she lived with her brother Atli until he was attacked by Sigurd and Gunnar and he had to buy them off with Brynhildr, without her consent. This last version is referred to later in this poem and in Gu√∞r√∫narkvi√∞a I. Brynhildr decided that it was she who should have Sigurd and not Gu√∞r√∫n:Bellows comments that she has discovered that she has been deceived. In this poem, she has loved Sigurd from the beginning, but this does not fit the version of their first meeting that appears in this poem. However, it fits the other version in which she met Sigurd before he met Gj√∫ki, Gunnar and H√∂gni. She went to Gunnarr and told him that she would divorce him and that he would lose both her and her lands, unless he killed Sigurd and his son Sigmund.Sigurd's son whom Brynhildr wanted to see dead was only three years old, according to Bellows. Gunnarr was grieving, because he loved both Sigurd and Brynhildr, and after many hours of reflection, he summoned his brother H√∂gni, and asked him if he would betray their blood-brother Sigurd for his wealth:The motive of killing Sigurd for his gold was part of the German tradition in the Nibelungenlied, and it is also mentioned in Gu√∞r√∫narkvi√∞a I. H√∂gni responded that they were bound by oaths to Sigurd, and it would be to compromise the future of themselves and their descendants. Gunnarr then suggested that they incite their brother Guthormr who had not sworn any oaths to Sigurd. The poet then jumps to the moment when Gutthorm's sword was in Sigurd's heart.Bellows notes that there is no gap in the manuscript, but that some stanzas have probably been lost. There is a detailed account of the murder in the Brot af Sigur√∞arkvi√∞u and in the V√∂lsunga saga, where he also is killed in his bed and not in the forest. Sigurd, however, took his murderer with him: Gu√∞r√∫n who was lying beside Sigurd woke up and discovered that she was lying in his blood: She clasped her hands together so hard that Sigurd rose up and asked her not to weep, because her brothers were alive, but their son (Sigmund) was still too young to flee for his life. He said that it was Brynhildr who was to be blamed. Brynhildr had loved him above all other men, but he had been faithful to Gunnarr and kept his oaths.Bellows notes that Sigurd's guiltlessness fits the version of this poem where he met Brynhildr after he met Gunnarr. However, it does not fit the alternative version, in e.g. Gr√≠pissp√°, in which he met Brynhildr first and had the daughter Aslaug with her. Then Sigurd died and Gu√∞r√∫n swooned. She had clasped her hands together so hard that the cups in the cupboard rang and the geese in the courtyard cried.The information that the geese cried also appears in Gu√∞r√∫narkvi√∞a I. Brynhildr who heard Gu√∞r√∫n's cries laughed with all her heart:Compare Brot af Sigur√∞arkvi√∞u. Gunnarr told Brynhildr that she never laughed for good things and asked her why she was so pale. He told her that she would have been a worthier woman if she had seen her brother Atli killed.Bellows notes that this part belongs to the tradition in which Atli had been besieged by Gunnarr and Sigurd, and was forced buy them off with Brynhildr. In this version, she would have consented to marry Gunnarr only because Atli lied to her that Gunnarr was the hero Sigurd. This version also appears in Gu√∞r√∫narkvi√∞a I. Brynhildr responded that her brother Atli was mightier and would outlive him. She had not desired to have a husband, before the three kings, Sigurd and the Gjukungs (Gunnar and H√∂gni) had arrived. It had been to the gold-adorned hero Sigurd who was sitting on Grani that she had given her vows.According to Bellows, this is the version in which Atli tricked Brynhildr that Sigurd was Gunnarr. She had fallen in love with the warrior who was sitting on Grani decked with Fafnir's gold, and who she thought was Sigurd. In this version, there was no need for change of forms between Sigurd and Gunnarr. Although both Gunnarr and Sigurd were kingly, Gunnarr was not the like of Sigurd. Moreover, Atli had threatened her that she would lose her wealth, if she did not consent to marry. Brynhildr had pondered whether to fightBellows notes that Brynhildr appears as a valkyrie here. and defy her brother, but the riches of Sigurd had prevailed on her. She would only love one man in her life. Brynhildr then declared that she had decided to kill herself. Gunnarr tried to embrace her, but she pushed him away, and she pushed away everyone who tried to show her affection. In desperation, Gunnarr asked H√∂gni what to do. Gunnar said that they should ask their warriors to watch over Brynhildr and restrain her from killing herself until she forgot about it. H√∂gni only spoke a few words and he said that no one should restrain her because Brynhildr had been born for evil deeds and that she should not be born again.Bellows suggests that H√∂gni's connecting her impending suicide with her not being born again is an influence from Christianity. The poem had been composed not long after Christianization. Gunnarr turned away from Brynhildr who was dividing her gems while watching the killed slaves and bondwomen.Later in the poem, we learn that eight serfs and five female slaves had been killed in order to join Sigurd on his pyre. Then she put on her golden byrnie and pierced her own heart with a sword. She put her head on her pillow and said that those of her women who wanted her gold must be prepared to follow her in death. The others answered that enough people had died and her women should not win honour that way. Brynhildr responded that no one should die for her sake unwillingly, but if they would not join her, they would have little gold to wear. Brynhildr then told Gunnarr that his troubles were not ended, and she began to tell a prophecy about Gu√∞r√∫n. She would be given to Atli in an unhappy marriage, and she would bring woe to many warriors. She would also have a daughter named Svanhildr:Bellows comments that Svanhildr (\\"swan maiden warrior\\") is a very old legendary figure, who was incorporated with the matter of Sigurd to combine two sets of legends. Brynhildr said that she remembered how they deceived her, and continued by telling that Gunnarr would desire Oddr√∫nOddr√∫n is mainly known from Oddr√∫nargr√°tr, and Bellows suggests that she is a late addition to the cycle. for wife and they would love each other secretly because Atli would not allow them to marry. Then Gunnarr would suffer like she had suffered. Later, Atli would throw Gunnarr into a den of snakes,Compare Dr√°p Niflunga, Atlam√°l and Atlakvi√∞a. but Atli would lose both fortune and his two sons, and he would die pierced in bed with a sword by Gu√∞r√∫n. Brynhildr said that Gu√∞r√∫n would then do best to follow her husband by killing herself, if she followed good advice or had a similar heart to Brynhild's. Instead, Gu√∞r√∫n would go across the waves to the kingdom of J√≥nakr,Bellows notes that J√≥nakr only appears in Ham√∞ism√°l and in sources that are based on it. He states that the name is apparently Slavic in origin, and he appears only as the third husband of Gu√∞r√∫n and as the father of Ham√∞ir, S√∂rli and Erpr. with whom she would have sons. However, her and Sigurd's daughter Svanhildr would go far away, and due to Bikki's words, J√∂rmunrekkr would slay Svanhhildr in wrath.Bellows adds that Svanhildr married the Gothic king Ermanaric but, his follower Bikki suggested that she was unfaithful with Ermanaric's son Randver. The angry king then hanged his son and tore Svanhildr to pieces between horses. According to Bellows, Ermanaric's cruel actions were familiar traditions long before becoming part of the Sigurd cycle. This would be the end of Sigurd's line and this would increase the sorrow of Gu√∞r√∫n. Brynhild's last wish was that Sigurd's pyre be built wide enough for both her and Sigurd. The pyre would be covered with shields, carpets and killed slaves. She requested that the slaves should burn fully decked beside Sigurd. Two were to be at his feet and two at his head.Bellows adds that the burning of slaves together with their master was a general custom in northern Europe. The number of slaves, however, does not agree with the earlier part of the poem. There were also to be a brace of dogs and a pair of hawks. Between Sigurd and Brynhildr they were to put the sword that lay between them when formerly they were sleeping together and they were called wedded mates.See Gr√≠pissp√°. With her last words, Brynhildr added that when Sigurd entered the afterlife, the door should not shut behind him but remain open until his retinue had entered the hall.

Weidling then took with him his Chief-of-Staff, Colonel Theodor von Dufving, to look after the \\"military\\" side of his assignment, but kept Lieutenant Colonel Helmuth Reymann's former Chief-of-Staff, Colonel Hans Refior, to handle the \\"civil\\" side. The civil side included dealing with Joseph Goebbels and the Nazi Party. W√∂hlermann was asked to take command of \\"M√ºncheberg\\", while still remaining in overall charge of artillery. All through the night, Weidling and his senior officers struggled to make some sort of sense of the shambles that had been forced upon them. On 25 April, the \\"Nordland\\" SS Armored Infantry Division (SS Nordland Panzergrenadier Division) and \\"M√ºncheberg\\" were ordered by Weidling to launch a counterattack to clean up dangerous Soviet penetrations at Tempelhof Airfield and in Neukolln. During the morning of 26 April, \\"M√ºncheberg\\" attacked southward from the northwest end of the Tempelhof Airfield with its last ten tanks. But the attack soon came to a halt due to Soviet defensive fire. During that same morning, Weidling's command structure was changed yet again on the whims of German dictator Adolf Hitler. However, this time the change was for the good. Hitler promoted Lieutenant-Colonel (Oberstleutnant) Erich B√§renf√§nger to a Major- General (Generalmajor) and gave him the command of defence sectors A and B. This change meant that Mummert could return to the command of the \\"M√ºncheberg\\" Tank Division and W√∂hlermann could concentrate on his job as artillery commander. For Weidling, this was a great improvement. For the men of \\"M√ºncheberg,\\" experiencing their third change of command in little more than twenty-four hours, it merely added to their total bewilderment.

It is a parcel of Three Rivers Park, the city's urban waterfront park along its rivers that provides a continuous green trail link between existing and future riverfront destinations. Completed segments include South Shore Riverfront Park, Allegheny Riverfront Park, and Point State Park. It is owned by the Sports & Exhibition Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County Established in 2001, North Shore Riverfront Park stretches about one mile (1.6 km) between the Carnegie Science Center and the Three Sisters bridges--Roberto Clemente Bridge, Andy Warhol Bridge, and Rachel Carson Bridge. The park, which also skirts Heinz Field and PNC Park, offers walking and biking trails with unobstructed vistas of the cityscape. The park is designed with both a riverwall and riverwalk, which create a trail along the water‚Äôs edge. Boat tie-ups are located along the park to encourage water recreation. In front of each stadium is a large cobblestone quay that handles canoes and kayaks, as well as larger vessels that usually transport sports fans. A second park level includes large open spaces of grass and native landscaping, crossed by paths running in a southwest direction, mimicking the river. The largest of these panels, called the Great Lawn, is approximately three acres of grass. An esplanade runs at the top level of the park and features a broad walkway. Other features include Kayak Pittsburgh, the Water Steps (an interactive fountain), and the Market Street Pier. North Shore Riverfront Park also houses three memorials: the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. The park is a project of the Pittsburgh Sports & Exhibition Authority with help from the Riverlife Task Force.

Formerly known as a discourse community and having evolved from forums and web forums, knowledge communities are now often referred to as a community of practice or virtual community of practice. As with any field of study, there are various points of view on the motivations, organizing principles and subsequent structure of knowledge communities. Perspectives As a web or virtual construct, knowledge communities can be said to have evolved from bulletin board systems, web forums and online discourse communities through the 80s and 90s. When framed with the scores of social networking sites coming online at the turn of the millennia, knowledge communities can be described as another form of social media. The biggest difference between social network sites and knowledge communities is, social network sites typically lack moderation or an outcome orientation. Social knowledge management technologies such as Knowledge Plaza are emerging and aim at reconciling these differences. Stemming from social exchange theory, a well-established perspective is to view knowledge communities as a type of exchange. The motivations for participating in the exchange vary. The exchange remains open based on the perceived value (e.g., return on time investment) to knowledge community members. Knowledge communities can also be viewed as a method by which to do organizational or process innovation. KCs are often founded to introduce change to a system, an organizational or societal by identifying, creating, representing and/or distributing data, information and/or knowledge in and via a community context on the pretext that more significant value will be created via a knowledge value chain. From an organizational perspective, knowledge communities serve to maintain the strong ties and weak ties of the organization with many diverse publics; they help feed quality back into the organization (via more timely feedback and narrative analysis of discussions), drive organization credibility (via more rich exposure and building public trust by incorporating diverse opinion) and speed knowledge transfer and knowledge utilization, as well as do knowledge mobilization (e.g., by providing a conversation space to bridge gaps between research and practice). Common across perspectives is, knowledge communities can be employed to identify, create, represent, and/or distribute knowledge within and/or between populations. Organizational behavior and structure Knowledge communities nurture and facilitate ongoing relationships and a Knowledge Ecosystem where ideas are exchanged on an ongoing basis. Knowledge value is generated (derived, realized) during the transactional nature of the exchange. Existing knowledge can be synthesized (e.g. research fused with ideas from the field or other research) or new knowledge created via exchanges. KCs use a variety of two-way communication tools (e.g., via discussion board, article commenting, rating, poll, webinar ) to foster discussion and the exchange of ideas. The organizational structure of knowledge communities varies significantly based on sponsorship and purpose. Contribution, moderation and content governance within knowledge communities is typically distributed amongst a core set of community members who become community moderator\\\\facilitators. At a minimum, members of knowledge communities typically include a mix of subject-matter experts, moderators, facilitators and the general public or a target population. While information within a knowledge community is usually promoted to be open and public, persons are able to keep information private as well. Public information within knowledge communities is sometimes covered by Creative Commons Licenses and is given credit to the creators. Knowledge communities are seen as a bridge between traditional publishing models and an open access systems. Pitfalls Knowledge communities and communities or practice suffer from the same pitfalls of all communities. To some, the mission driven orientation can be a detractor to creativity. To others, the exchange aspects reek of the over commodification of culture and, by pooling experts or like-minded persons, KCs and CoPs can often be less diverse than traditional communities. Perhaps the societal response has been the emergence of social networks. Again, however, it is important to point out social networks and knowledge communities are related, but not the same.

He is regarded as one of the greatest directors in German-speaking theater. Biography Peter Zadek was born on 19 May 1926 to a Jewish family in Berlin. In 1934, he emigrated with his family to London where he later studied at Old Vic theatre, after a year at Oxford University.Hugh Rorrison \\"Peter Zadek\\", The Guardian, 3 August 2009 He began in weekly rep in Swansea and Pontypridd. He studied at the Old Vic, and his first productions included Oscar Wilde‚Äôs Salome and T. S. Eliot‚Äôs Sweeney Agonistes. Zadek caused a stir in London in the late 1950s with his productions of works by Jean Genet. Indeed, Genet was so outraged by Zadek's world premi√®re of The Balcony at the Arts in 1957 that he apparently bought a gun with the intention of shooting its director. He also worked as a director for the BBC in this period. Bremen years Returning to Germany in 1958, Zadek worked in Theater Bremen from 1962 to 1968. In 1969, he directed the film I'm an Elephant, Madame. It was entered into the 19th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won a Silver Bear award. Shakespeare as passion Zadek and his partner Elisabeth Plessen, have translated many of Shakespeare's works into German for the theater as well as works of Pinter and Chekhov, among others. Zadek was renowned for productions of Shakespeare's plays and for sparking a greater interest in English drama among German audiences. Almost three years, as the German critic and connoisseur of theater history, after his arrival in Germany was Zadek in to the German scene. 14 stagings in three years and four in the following six months: ‚ÄûZadek was in a rush of making‚Äú (im Rausch des Machens), and his ‚ÄûTheatermut‚Äú (theater- courage) rejected the literary Shakespeare and took his absurdly grotesque side out. Cf. the chapter Zadeks Rausch in G√ºnther R√ºhle: Theater in Deutschland 1945‚Äì1966. Seine Ereignisse ‚Äî seine Menschen. S. Fischer Verlag, M√ºnchen 2014. So Zadek's acclaimed staging of Der Kaufmann von Venedig (The Merchant of Venice) at Burgtheater in 1988 f. e. moved the story from the bankrupt businessman and the deadly pledge for the saving credit wisely and harmoniously into the modern every daylife.Cf. Urs Jenny: Die ganze Welt ist eine B√∂rse in: Der Spiegel 51/1988 http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13531895.html Illness and death Despite suffering from an illness, Zadek continued working in his later years. In 2008, he staged Pirandello's Naked at the St. Pauli Theater in Hamburg. Zadek's last production was Shaw's Major Barbara, performed at the Schauspielhaus Zurich in February 2009. He died in 30 July 2009 in Hamburg, survived by his two children, Simon Zadek and Michele Zadek-Ewing.  Head of theaters He headed up such major German theaters as the Schauspielhaus Bochum, where he coined deeply the so-called Zadek-Era until today. from 1972 to 1979. Here he paved the career of two German artists, first Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer, today one of the most popular Singer-songwriter's, who was his musical director then (1976) and also an actor in roles, such as the Till Eulenspiegel or Melchior in Frank Wedekind‚Äôs Fr√ºhlings Erwachen, and secondly the German Natias Neutert, who performed his One-Mensch-Theater.Cf. Neutert unterwegs in: Die Zeit, No. 32. 4 August 1978. In 1984, Zadek worked at the Freie Volksb√ºhne Berlin and got a great success with Josua Sobol‚Äôs playwright Ghetto with his discovery of the actor Ulrich Tukur (who later became staff actor within the ensemble of Deutsches Schauspielhaus) 1985‚Äì1989 at Deutsches Schauspielhaus, Hamburg. From 1992 to 1996 Zadek was appointed as one head among others at the Berliner Ensemble, the theater founded by Bertolt Brecht.Cf. Rolf Michaelis: Mords-Musical in: Die Zeit 20. July 1984 After German reunification the Senate of Berlin appointed a \\"collective\\" of five stage directors to serve as Intendanten (General Administrators): Peter Zadek, Peter Palitzsch (1918‚Äì2004),Hugh Rorrison Obituary: Peter Palitzsch, The Guardian, 28 December 2004 Heiner M√ºller, Fritz Marquardt and Matthias Langhoff. In this former East German theater Zadek was a director who represented the West. Indeed, he brought with him an international team that formed a \\"Western invasion\\" which revived the Berliner Ensemble. In addition to bringing great actors such as Gert Voss and Eva Mattes, Zadek brought in young prot√©g√© stage directors such as British director Rosee Riggs and also appointed renowned American Berlin-based conductor Alexander Frey as Music Director of the theater. Frey was the first American to hold any position at the Berliner Ensemble, as well as being the theatre's first non-German Music Director; his historic predecessors include the composers Kurt Weill, Hanns Eisler, and Paul Dessau ‚Äîall of them worked under Brecht.Cf.

Synopsis In Growing Up Brady, Williams discusses his childhood, the production of the 1969‚Äì1974 ABC sitcom The Brady Bunch, his relationship with co-star Maureen McCormick, disputes between series star Robert Reed and creator-producer Sherwood Schwartz, and various Brady Bunch spin-offs. An episode guide to the series is also included, as well as three negative critiques from Reed of the episodes \\"The Impractical Joker\\" and \\"And Now a Word From Our Sponsor\\" (both 1971), and \\"The Hair-Brained Scheme\\" (the series finale from 1974, in which Reed refused to appear). Two editions of the book exist: the first edition details his Brady co-stars attending his 1990 wedding to Diane Martin; that marriage ended in divorce two years later; the second edition, published several years later, replaces the references to Martin with his impressions of the feature films The Brady Bunch Movie and A Very Brady Sequel, and reflections on Reed's death in 1992 due to cancer and the subsequent media frenzy over the news that Reed had been diagnosed as HIV positive (misreported as AIDS) prior to his death.

Bustech manufactures fully built up integral buses and also bus bodies, built on chassis supplied by third party manufacturers. Bustech was established by the then owners of Gold Coast, Queensland bus operator, Surfside Buslines. In 1998, the first bus was completed in their original Ernest, Queensland factory. In Bustech's early years, production generally focused on producing low entry, route bus bodies for European chassis from manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Scania, predominantly under their VST model line. Smaller numbers of school buses and charter/touring vehicles were also produced. In 2004, Bustech relocated to a purpose built factory in Burleigh Heads, Queensland which remains their headquarters today. Bustech produced its first integral bus in 2007, the MDi, which is a midi-sized route bus using key components from ZF and Caterpillar. Bustech then expanded into full size route and school buses largely using Cummins engines. Bustech also produces an urban double deck bus known as the CDi and Australia's first locally engineered and built electric bus, the ZDi. Bustech products are also assembled under agreement with Elphinstone Engineering in Tasmania and with a joint venture partner, Precision Buses in Adelaide, South Australia, since 2017. Bustech previously formed part of the Transit Australia Group, but was retained by the Calabro family following sale in April 2019. In September 2019, it was announced that Bustech will be merging with Precision Buses, under a new holding company called Australian Bus Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fusion Capital Holdings.

Location The Victoria Lines run along a natural geographical barrier known as the Great Fault, from Madliena in the east, through the limits of the town of Mosta in the centre of the island, to Binƒ°emma and the limits of Rabat, on the west coast. The complex network of linear fortifications known collectively as the Victoria Lines, that cut across the width of the island north of the old capital of Mdina, was a unique monument of military architecture. Background When built by the British military in the late 19th century, the line was designed to present a physical barrier to invading forces landing in the north of Malta, intent on attacking the harbour installations, so vital for the maintenance of the British fleet, their source of power in the Mediterranean. Although never tested in battle, this system of defences, spanning some 12 km of land and combining different types of fortifications - forts, batteries, entrenchments, stop-walls, infantry lines, searchlight emplacements and howitzer positions - constituted a unique ensemble of varied military elements all brought together to enforce the strategy adopted by the British for the defence of Malta in the latter half of the 19th century. A singular solution which exploited the defensive advantages of geography and technology as no other work of fortifications does in the Maltese islands. The Victoria Lines owe their origin to a combination of international events and the military realities of the time. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, highlighted the importance of the Maltese islands. Beginnings By 1872, the coastal works had progressed considerably, but the question of landward defences remained unsettled. Although the girdle of forts proposed by Colonel Jervois in 1866 would have considerably enhanced the defence of the harbour area, other factors had cropped up that rendered the scheme particularly difficult to implement, particularly the creation of suburbs. Another proposal, put forward by Col. Mann RE, was to take up a position well forward of the original. The chosen position was the ridge of commanding ground north of the old City of Mdina, cutting transversely across the width of the island at a distance varying from 4 to 7 miles from Valletta. There, it was believed, a few detached forts could cut off all the westerly portion of the island containing good bays and facilities for landing. At the same time, the proposed line of forts retained the resources of the greater part of the country and the water on the side of the defenders; whereas the ground required for the building of the fortifications could be had far more cheaply than that in the vicinity of Valletta. Col. Mann estimated that the entire cost of the land and works of the new project would amount to ¬£200,000, much less than would have been required to implement Jervois' scheme of detached forts. This new defensive strategy was one which sought to seal off all the area around the Grand Harbour within an extended box-like perimeter, with the detached forts on the line of the Great Fault forming the north west boundary, the cliffs to the south forming a natural, inaccessible barrier; while the north and east sides were to be defended by a line of coastal forts and batteries. In a way, the use of the Great Fault for defensive purposes was not an altogether original idea, for it had already been put forward by the Order of Saint John in the early decades of the 18th century, when they realized that they did not have the necessary manpower to defend the whole island. The Order had built a few infantry entrenchments at strategic places along the general line of the fault, namely, the Falca Lines and San Pawl tat-Tarƒ°a, Naxxar. In fact, the use of parts of the natural escarpment for defensive purposes can be traced back even further, as illustrated by Nadur Tower at Bingemma (17th century), the Torri Falca (16th century) and the remains of a Bronze Age fortified citadel which possibly occupied the site of Fort Mosta. Building Plaque of the Victoria Lines Fort Madalena Fort Mosta Fort Binƒ°emma In 1873, the Defence Committee approved Adye‚Äôs defensive strategy and recommended the improvement of the already strong position between the Bingemma Hills and the heights above St. George‚Äôs Bay. Work on what was originally to be called the North- West Front began in 1875 with construction of a string of isolated forts and batteries, designed to stiffen the escarpment. Three forts were to be built along the position, at Bingemma, Madliena and Mosta, (designed to cover the western and eastern extremities and the centre of the front, respectively). The first to be built was Fort Bingemma. By 1878, work had still not commenced on the other two and the entrenched position at Dwerja; all of these were to be completed on the budget of 200,000. General Simmons recommended that the old Knights‚Äô entrenchments located along the line of the escarpment at Tarƒ°a and Naxxar were to be restored and incorporated into the defences. He also recommended that good communication roads should be formed in the rear of the lines and that those that already existed be improved. The fortifications of Mdina, the Island‚Äôs old capital, were to be considered as falling within the defensive system. The forts on the defensive line were designed with a dual land/coastal defence role in mind, particularly the ones at the extremities but, due to the topography in the northern part of the island, there were areas of dead ground along the coast and inland approaches which could not be properly covered by the guns in the main forts. As a result, it was decided that new works should be built between Forts Mosta and Bingemma and emplacements for guns placed in them. It was also considered advisable to have new emplacements for guns built to the left of Fort Madalena and in the area between it and Fort Pembroke. The latter fort was built on the eastern littoral, below and to the rear of Fort Madalena, in order to control the gap caused by the accessible shoreline leading towards Valletta. Gun batteries were eventually proposed at Tarƒ°a, Gƒßargƒßur and San Giovanni. Plans for these works were drawn up but only the one at San Giovanni was actually built and armed, while the two at Gƒßargƒßur were never constructed and that at Tarƒ°a, although actually built, was never armed. Limitations By 1888, the line of the cliffs formed by the great geological fault and the works which had been constructed along its length from Fort Bingemma on the left to Fort Madalena on the right constituted, in the words of Nicholson and Goodenough, \\"a military position of great strength\\". The main defects inherent in the defensive position were the extremities where the high ground descended towards the shore, leaving wide gaps through which enemy forces could by-pass the whole position. Particularly weak in this respect was the western extremity. There, a considerable interval existed between Fort Bingemma and the sea. Military manoeuvres held in the area revealed that it was possible for troops to land in Fomm ir-Riƒß Bay and gain the rear of the fortified line undetected from the existing works. To counter this threat, recommendations were made for the construction of two epaulements for a movable armament of quick-firing or field guns, the construction of blockhouses, the improvement of the wall which closed the head of the deep valley to the south of Fort Bingemma and the strengthening of the line of cliffs by scarping in places. It was also suggested that the existing farmhouses in the area be made defensible. There were even suggestions for the reconstruction and re- utilization of the old Hospitaller lines at ta' Falca and Naxxar, but only the latter was put to use, mainly because these commanded the approaches to the village of Naxxar, described as a position of great importance, in the event of a landing in St. Paul's Bay. A serious shortcoming of the North West Front defences was the lack of barrack accommodation for the troops who were required to man and defend the works. The lines extended six miles and the accommodation provided in the forts was rather scanty. Consequently, it was considered necessary to build new barracks capable of accommodating a regiment (PRO MPH 234) and later a full battalion of infantry, and a new site was chosen to the rear of the Dwerja Lines, at Mtarfa. Although initially designed as a series of detached strong-points, the fortifications along the North West Front were eventually linked together by a continuous infantry line and the whole complex, by then nearing completion, was christened the Victoria Lines in order to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897. The long stretches of infantry lines linking the various strong-points - consisting in most places of a simple masonry parapet - were completed on 6 November 1899. Other changes The line of the intervening stretches followed the configuration of the crest of the ridge, along the contours of the escarpment. The nature of the wall varied greatly along its length but basically consisted of a sandwich-type construction with an outer and inner revetment, bonded at regular intervals and filled in with terreplein. The average height of the parapet was about five feet (1.5 metres). The walls were frequently topped by loopholes, of which only a very few sections have survived. In places, the debris from scarping was dumped in front of the wall to help create a glacis and ditch. In places, the rocky ground immediately behind the parapet was carved out to provide a walkway or patrol path along the length of the line. A number of valleys interrupted the line of the natural fault and, at such places, the continuation of the defensive perimeter was only permitted through the construction of shallow, defensible masonry bridges, as can still be seen today at Wied il-Faƒßam near Fort Madalena, Wied Anglu and Bingemma Gap. Other bridges, now demolished, existed at Mosta Ravine and Wied Filip. During the last phase of their development, the Victoria Lines were strengthened by a number of batteries and additional fortifications. An infantry redoubt was built at the western extremity of the front at Fomm ir- Riƒß and equipped with emplacements for Maxim machine guns. In 1897 a High Angle Battery was built well to the rear of the defensive lines at Gƒßargƒßur and another seven howitzer batteries, each consisting of four emplacements for field guns protected by earthen traverses, were built close to the rear of the defensive line. Searchlight emplacements were built at il-Kunƒãizzjoni and Wied il-Faƒßam. Aftermath Military training exercises staged in May 1900 revealed that the Victoria Lines were of dubious defensive value. With the exception of the coastal forts, by 1907 they were abandoned altogether. In World War Two a Nazi invasion seemed likely so the lines were rehabilitated and new guard posts built along them as a second line of defence to the coastal defences. Again the lines were untested. Fort Mosta is still in use as an ammunitions depot, while Fort Madalena is still used by the Communications Information Systems Company of the AFM. In 1998 the Government of Malta submitted the Victoria Lines to UNESCO for consideration as a World Heritage Site. Large parts of the fortification walls have collapsed, although some parts in the countryside remain intact and in general the Victoria Lines have fallen into obscurity. The Maltese Tourism Authority is proposing that by the end of 2019 two trails along the Lines will become Malta‚Äôs inaugural national walkway.

On 23 December 1919 an order was issued on the formation of a museum-exposition \\"Life of the Red Army and Fleet\\" in the same location, whose purpose was to Inform the public about the achievements by post-October Revolution Soviet Russia in military education, culture and political discipline in the Red Army and Navy. In 1920 another exhibition was organised and dedicated to the 2nd Congress of the Communist International in Moscow about the life and deeds of the Soviet Republic and its young armed forces which defend the conquests of the proletariat. More than 150,000 people visited the exhibition. In 1921 the exposition was transformed into the Museum of the Red Army and Fleet, and it was moved to Vozdvizhenka 6 in 1922, into a building (demolished in the 1930s), opposite today's Russian State Library. The largest events in the museum's first years was the fifth anniversary exposition for the creation of the Worker-Peasant Red Army (RKKA) between 23 February and 1 November 1923 which was visited by 500 groups and 70,000 individuals. In 1924, following the opening of similar museums across the country, it was renamed the Central museum of the Red Army and Fleet. It moved to the left wing of the Central House of the Red Army on the Yekaterinvskaya (now Suvorova), in 1928. In 1951 the museum was once again renamed the Central Museum of the Soviet Army and in 1965 moved to its present location in a new, special building designed by architects N. Gaygarova and V. Barkhin. It was renamed once again the Central Museum of the Armed Forces of the USSR; it was given its present name in 1993.  Exhibits  German troop deployment instruction for Operation Barbarossa. A hat and overcoat worn by Joseph Stalin Over its history the museum has managed to accumulate the most prominent and important military relics of the Soviet period, creating a record of its military past. In total more than seven hundred thousand individual exhibits are now stored at the museum. The most valuable are displayed in the 25 halls of the main building. The period of the Russian Civil War includes a photocopy of the original decree outlining the creation of the RKKA which includes Lenin's corrections; a banner of the 195th infantry regiment into which Lenin was officially conscripted; weapons, documents, awards and personal belongings of famous Red Army men such as Mikhail Frunze, Grigory Kotovsky, Vasily Chapayev and Vasily Bl√ºcher as well as others, all help to re-create the post-revolutionary atmosphere. The most prized display is that dedicated to the Great Patriotic War, which includes the Victory Banner as well as all of the front banners and the captured Nazi ones that were used during the Victory Parade in 1945. The Great Patriotic War differs from World War II in that it began on 22 June 1941 with the German invasion of the Soviet Union. World War II (in Europe), started on 1 September 1939 with the co-ordinated attacks of Germany and the Soviet Union on Poland. Part of the Great Patriotic War section is devoted to the Soviet Union's allies on the Western Front. There are examples of Soviet propaganda posters depicting Germany being crushed between the two fronts and maps of the Allied advance from Normandy into Germany. British and American small arms and uniforms are displayed. A life-size diorama includes a Jeep pulling a field-gun in front of a wall-sized photograph of Omaha Beach. The photograph is Omaha Beach as depicted in the movie The Longest Day (1962), not of Omaha Beach in June 1944. Among the collection are items that once belonged to Adolf Hitler and other Nazi officials. The last halls display the post-war and modern developments of the Soviet Army and Navy, the Cold War section contains wreckage from the U-2 spy-plane that was piloted by Gary Powers and the involvement of Soviet forces in Cold War conflicts. A special display is dedicated to the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan and recent combat operations in Chechnya. Outside the museum, there is an extended collection of military equipment and technology, including armour, artillery, railway cars, aircraft, and missiles.

Named after the Maccabees and centering on football competitions, it was the first Jewish side to send a player, the goalkeeper Samuel Zauber, to the FIFA World Cup (at its 1930 edition in Uruguay). History Maccabi Bucure≈üti was founded in 1919 by a Jewish entrepreneur at a time when representatives of the ethnic minorities of Greater Romania established distinctive football sides (another such example was Elpis Constan≈£a, which was owned by a Greek-Romanian businessman). In 1925, a women's seven-a-side handball team was inaugurated as a branch of the Maccabi club, but, like all Romanian teams of the time, only played exhibition games (usually, as a prelude to competitive football matches). Before the 1940‚Äì1941 season, at a time when Romania adopted antisemitic policies, the club was expelled from official competitions. It reemerged in 1945 at the end of World War II and kept its name before merging with another club to form Ciocanul. For the 1946 season, the club was coached by Hungarian coach B√©la Guttmann, who went on to coach many prominent European and South American teams of the 1940s and 1950s. Due to food shortages, Guttmann insisted his salary be paid in vegetables.Contested Fields; A Global History of Modern Football He subsequently walked out on the Romanian club after a director attempted to intervene in team selection. German journalist Hardy Grune believed that he was frustrated with the corruption in the Romanian soccer world. As Ciocanul, the club played in two seasons in Divizia A. In May 1948, it merged with Unirea Tricolor Bucure≈üti, to create the present-day major Romanian club Dinamo, which was administrated by the Ministry of the Interior. During the 1947‚Äì1948 season they remained two separate clubs: Dinamo A (Ciocanul) and Dinamo B (Unirea-Tricolor).

It was released on the ESP-Disk label in October 1967. Overview It was recorded at Impact Sound in New York City, between May 6-9, 1967, by the Florida-based group, which at that point comprised main songwriter and singer Tom Rapp, Wayne Harley, Lane Lederer, and Roger Crissinger. Percussion was by session musician Warren Smith. The album presents a mixture of styles - \\"psychedelic folk reminiscent of Donovan collides with Farfisa-driven punk and hard-to-categorize repetitive minimalism, all thrown together with the undisciplined, creative exuberance of youth\\".Tom Rapp by Mark Brend \\"Another Time\\" is an acoustic song, the first that Rapp ever wrote, based on his experience in a car crash where he walked away unscathed, and, with \\"Morning Song\\", represents the most characteristic example of Rapp's later writing style. In contrast, \\"Drop Out!\\" and \\"Uncle John\\" are youthful protest songs. \\"(Oh Dear) Miss Morse\\" spells out in Morse code the word F-U-C-K, accompanied by banjo and organ. The album became the most successful ESP release ever, estimated to have sold between 100,000 and 250,000 copies. Early vinyl copies came with a small poster of the Hell panel from Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights, a detail of which was used on the front of the album sleeve. The album went through a number of cover variations. The original, first edition was brown monochrome with a white border along two sides of the cover. The second edition had a black and white cover with the group name in white along the top. The third edition was the white background and color section of the painting (see right). The album has been reissued numerous times on LP and CD, with various stereo mix variations. On October 20, 2017, Drag City - with the cooperation and participation of Tom Rapp and original engineer/producer Richard Alderson - released a \\"Fiftieth Anniversary Mono Restoration & Remastering\\" on CD and LP.

Both members were part of the Hart wrestling family, and died in their 30s. History Winning the World Tag Team Championship Owen Hart The team of brothers- in-law, Hart and Bulldog debuted on March 31, 1996 at the twelfth WrestleMania event as members of James E. Cornette's Camp stable along with Vader and went on to defeat Yokozuna, Ahmed Johnson and Jake Roberts. At In Your House 7, Hart and Bulldog defeated Johnson and Roberts. They teamed up with Vader again at In Your House 9 to defeat Ahmed Johnson, Sycho Sid and Shawn Michaels. At In Your House 10, Hart and Bulldog defeated The Smoking Gunns to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. Title defenses After winning the World Tag Team Champions, Hart and Bulldog started a feud with The Smoking Gunns whom they went on to defeat at In Your House 11 in a title match. At In Your House 12, they defended their title for a second time against (Fake) Razor Ramon and (Fake) Diesel. Following In Your House 12, Clarence Mason became their manager. They started a feud with Doug Furnas and Phil LaFon over the World Tag Team Championship after losing to them in a 4-on-4 Survivor Series match at Survivor Series. This led to a title defense at In Your House 13 against Furnas and LaFon which Hart and Bulldog lost by disqualification and thus retained the titles. Following In Your House 13, Bulldog fired Mason because he lost a match to Crush under Mason's management. Hart tried to convince Bulldog that it was wrong to fire Mason but the decision stood. Hart and Bulldog started a feud with Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) against whom they made two title defenses but lost by disqualification. At WrestleMania 13, Hart and Bulldog defended the titles against Mankind and Vader (who tagged with Bulldog and Owen in a 6 man tag team match at Wrestlemania 12 the year before) in a match which ended in a double count-out. Tensions between Hart and Bulldog At the 1997 Royal Rumble, Hart accidentally eliminated Bulldog from the Royal Rumble match. On February 26, 1997, Bulldog defeated his partner Hart in a tournament to be crowned the first-ever WWF European Champion in a 20-minute match. After this defeat, the tension between Bulldog and Hart began to build. After a title match against Headbangers, Hart and Bulldog got into a fight and Hart demanded that he wanted a title shot at Bulldog's European Championship. Reformation of the Hart Foundation On the March 31 edition of Raw Is War, the WWF Tag Team Champions Owen and Bulldog fought to no contest when Bret Hart came into the ring and pleaded with the two not to fight any more, talking about their family ties. The three then re-formed The Hart Foundation with Jim Neidhart and Brian Pillman. On the April 28 edition of Raw Is War, Owen defeated Rocky Maivia to win the Intercontinental Championship, making both him and Smith double champions, as Smith held the European Title. On the May 26 edition of Raw Is War, they lost the tag team titles to Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels. Hart, Bulldog and Neidhart defeated Sid and Legion of Doom at the 1997 King of the Ring. The entire Hart Foundation defeated Ken Shamrock, Goldust, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Legion of Doom at In Your House 16 in a 5-on-5 tag team match. WWF Tag Team Championship was vacated afterwards. When the tag titles were vacated as a result of a neck injury to Stone Cold Steve Austin, Owen (who had inflicted the injury on Austin) and Bulldog got a chance to win the titles for a second time in a Fatal Four Way Elimination Tag Team match where they were defeated by The Headbangers. The match also involved Legion of Doom and The Godwinns. The team became the tenth longest reigning World Tag Team Champions, for 246 days.

Life and career Mocky was born in Nice, France to Polish immigrant parents, Jeanne Zylinska and Adam Mokiejewski. His father was Jewish and his mother was Catholic.https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/16/jean-pierre- mocky-obituary Mocky appeared as an actor in the 1955 film Gli Sbandati and in many other movies, including some of those he also directed (Solo, L'albatros, L'Ombre d'une chance, Un Linceul n'a pas de poches). His 1987 film Le Miracul√© was entered into the 37th Berlin International Film Festival. He began as an actor in the cinema and theater. In particular, he played in Jean Dr√©ville's Les Casse-pieds (1948), Jean Cocteau's Orph√©e (1950) and Bernard Borderie's The Mask of the Gorilla (1957). But it was especially in Italy that he became famous, thanks to his role in I vinti by Michelangelo Antonioni. After working as an assistant with Luchino Visconti on Senso (1954) and Federico Fellini on La strada (1954), he wrote his first film, La T√™te contre les murs (1959) and planned to direct it himself, but the producer preferred to entrust the task to Georges Franju. He went on to direct the following year with Les Dragueurs (1959). Since then, he has never stopped shooting. As early as the 1960s, he was able to reach a wide audience with crazy comedies such as A Funny Parishioner (1963) and La Grande Lessive (1968). After May 1968, he turned to darker films with Solo (1969), in which he shows a group of young terrorists of the extreme left, then L'Albatros (1971) which shows the corruption of politicians. In the 1980s, he returned to success with a film denouncing, a year before the drama of Heysel, the excesses of some football fans (√Ä mort l'arbitre, 1984) and a comedy denouncing the hypocrisy around the pilgrimage to Lourdes (Le Miracul√©, 1987). In the 1990s and 2000s, his films met with less success, but Mocky continued to shoot with much enthusiasm. In the beginning, his films were dedicated to the uprising against the restrictions imposed by society. Later, he concentrated on farce, as in Bonsoir where the homeless Alex (Michel Serrault) pretends to be the lover of the lesbian Caroline (Claude Jade) in order to save her inheritance from her homophobic relatives. Mocky's cinema, often satirical and pamphleteer, is generally inspired by the truth of society. He worked with few resources and filmed very quickly. He worked with Bourvil (A Funny Parishioner, The City of Unspeakable Fear, La Grande Lessive and The Stallion), Fernandel (The Exchange and Life), Michel Simon (The Red Ibis), Michel Serrault (twelve films including Le Miracul√©), Francis Blanche (five films including The City of Unspeakable Fear), Jacqueline Maillan (five films), Jean Poiret (eight films) and with the stars Catherine Deneuve (Agent Trouble), Claude Jade (Bonsoir), Jane Birkin (Noir comme le souvenir), Jeanne Moreau (Le Miracul√©) and St√©phane Audran (The Seasons of Pleasure).

(Scotland) Act 1987 (1987 c. 47) was an Act of Parliament of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher was committed to the reform of local government finance; the solution decided upon by the mid-1980s was the introduction of the per-capita \\"community charge\\" -also called the Poll Tax - and the abolition of the previous \\"rates\\" system, which had been based solely on property ownership. In Scotland, a revaluation of the housing rates in 1985-1986 had increased the burden on homeowners. It was decided that the poll tax would be implemented in Scotland before the rest of the United Kingdom, and a bill was drafted and put before Parliament in late 1986 with this intention - it was the final major piece of legislation introduced before the election. It received its second reading on 9 December, when it was described by Malcolm Rifkind as a \\"radical reforming measure\\". Two significant amendments were made in response to backbench concerns. Firstly, it was to be implemented in one sweep in 1989, rather than progressively between 1989 and 1992, against the advice of the Scottish Office. The second change was to make each individual liable to the tax responsible for paying rather than designating a single \\"head of household\\" in each residence and requiring them to collect for the others.

Life Burd, the son of Colonel James Burd and Sarah (Shippen) Burd, was born February 5, 1749, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He studied law with his uncle, Pennsylvania Chief Justice Edward Shippen, whose daughter Elizabeth he married on December 13, 1778. He was a member of the Berks County Bar, and had a law practice in Reading, Pennsylvania. Upon the outbreak of the Revolution, Burd volunteered and eventually rose to major in Colonel Henry Haller's Pennsylvania Battalion of the Flying Camp. During the Battle of Long Island (1776), Burd was in command of an American pickets stationed at the Red Lion Inn, in the early morning hours of August 27, 1776 after an initial exchange of gunfire with British advance troops, he was taken prisoner along with 16 other Americans under his command. After his release, ill health prevented him from reentering military service, and he returned to his legal practice in Reading. He was appointed as Prothonotary of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on September 1, 1778 and served with great distinction until his resignation December 29, 1805. From 1790‚Äì1791, Burd served as a trustee of The Academy and College of Philadelphia, which became the University of Pennsylvania in 1791. He continued as a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania from 1791 until his death. In 1820, Burd sat for a portrait by Charles Willson Peale. Peale gave the portrait as a wedding present to Burd's niece, Eliza Burd Patterson, who was married in March 1820 to Peale's son, Rubens Peale.

This proposed mechanism may be similar to anabolic pathways for the synthesis of reduced organic carbon (e.g., carbohydrates) in phototrophic organisms, which convert photons from visible light with pigments such as chlorophyll whose energy is then used in photolysis of water to generate usable chemical energy (as ATP) in photophosphorylation or photosynthesis. However, whether melanin- containing fungi employ a similar multi-step pathway as photosynthesis, or some chemosynthesis pathways, is unknown. Observations Discovery Radiotrophic fungi were discovered in 1991 growing inside and around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine showed that three melanin-containing fungi‚ÄîCladosporium sphaerospermum, Wangiella dermatitidis, and Cryptococcus neoformans‚Äîincreased in biomass and accumulated acetate faster in an environment in which the radiation level was 500 times higher than in the normal environment. Exposure of C. neoformans cells to these radiation levels rapidly (within 20‚Äì40 minutes of exposure) altered the chemical properties of its melanin, and increased melanin-mediated rates of electron transfer (measured as reduction of ferricyanide by NADH) three- to four-fold compared with unexposed cells. Similar effects on melanin electron-transport capability were observed by the authors after exposure to non-ionizing radiation, suggesting that melanotic fungi might also be able to use light or heat radiation for growth. Comparisons with non-melanized fungi Melanization may come at some metabolic cost to the fungal cells. In the absence of radiation, some non- melanized fungi (that had been mutated in the melanin pathway) grew faster than their melanized counterparts. Limited uptake of nutrients due to the melanin molecules in the fungal cell wall or toxic intermediates formed in melanin biosynthesis have been suggested to contribute to this phenomenon. It is consistent with the observation that despite being capable of producing melanin, many fungi do not synthesize melanin constitutively (i.e., all the time), but often only in response to external stimuli or at different stages of their development. The exact biochemical processes in the suggested melanin-based synthesis of organic compounds or other metabolites for fungal growth, including the chemical intermediates (such as native electron donor and acceptor molecules) in the fungal cell and the location and chemical products of this process, are unknown.  Protection against radiation  An experiment has been made at the International Space Station in December 2018 and January 2019 to test whether radiotrophic fungi could be used as protection against radiation, especially in space. The experiment used Cladosporium sphaerospermum. Results have been prepublished for peer-review in July 2020 and seem promising.

Later aircraft from the company were heavily influenced by this early design.Donald 2002, p. Sheet 7. Design and development Formed in 1934 by James Martin and Captain Valentine Baker, the Martin-Baker company had embarked initially on an unsuccessful two-place low-wing monoplane design known as the MB 1 before completing an autogyro design by Mr. Raoul Hafner tested by Captain Baker at Heston Aerodrome. Attracting financial aid from a business friend with an interest in aviation, Martin turned to the design and manufacture of a small, two-seater touring aircraft bearing the same designation as the earlier project. Departing from the unconventional mid- engine configuration, the new aircraft was nonetheless, an example of an advanced design. Construction involved a simple but highly ingenious method of using round section thin gauge steel tubing throughout the structure with a fabric covering. Powered by a neatly cowled six-cylinder inline 160 hp Napier Javelin engine driving a fixed-pitch wooden propeller, the tubular mounting was designed so that all parts were accessible for easy servicing and was electrically started. A simple, tubular construction undercarriage carried low pressure tyres and employed shock absorber struts. Martin believed that simplicity would lead to efficiency and took care to eliminate complicated operations, with the result that the prototype was rapidly put together by a small group of 12 semi-skilled workers. This design philosophy was carried throughout the simple structure with much forethought given to its cockpit and general layout. The wings were also designed to fold rearwards as a one-person operation, for ease of storage.Lumsden and Heffernan 1985, p. 340. Long triangular welded-aluminium fuel tanks, designed to be quickly detachable, were carried in the centre of each wing spar.Green 1979, p. 74. Although the main interest of this aircraft was in its design, a contemporary aeronautical journal reported: \\"The seats are comfortable and the cockpit is totally enclosed with an oval transparent hood. The windscreen is a sharp vee, with vertical front panes, which should not collect fine rain or snow and should obviate any reflection from internal or external lighting.\\" Testing and evaluation Aerodynamically a straightforward design, when flight tested in April 1935, the MB 1 (G-ADCS) reached a top speed of and was found to possess pleasant flight characteristics, which became a hallmark of Martin-Baker designs. The Chief Test Pilot for the MB 1 was Captain Baker.\\"Martin, James.\\" cartage.org., Cartage. Retrieved: 29 July 2009.

Biography Hans Klok was born in Purmerend, Netherlands. On his tenth birthday, he received a magic set as a present and began performing for friends at their birthday parties. He started his professional career in magic as a teenager. At the age of fourteen, he became youth champion of the Netherlands and Europe in conjuring, and won the Wenegini Prize. In 1990, Hans and his assistant Sittah won the Grand Prix of the Netherlands and the Henk Vermeijden Cup with \\"the fastest metamorphosis in the world\\". By age 23, he was part of a touring show with Dutch comedian Andr√© van Duin. In 1994, he performed for the first time on the Las Vegas Strip, as part of NBC‚Äôs The World's Greatest Magic, broadcast live from Caesars Palace to an audience of 60 million people. Hans used the period after that to prepare his first theatre show, which had its premier in October in the Luxor Theater in Rotterdam. In 1998, he had a second theatre show, 'Magic Live on Stage', followed by 'Magic Impossible'. During the opening of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, about 500 million football fans in 152 countries saw Klok make the 18-carat gold World Trophy appear out of thin air in a glass cage. In 2007, Klok had a show on the Las Vegas Strip. The Beauty of Magic was a 90-minute production presented in a large theater at Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino. It debuted on 1 June and closed in mid-December. The show included Pamela Anderson, who paraded onstage in a glittering bathing suit for about 10 minutes as one of Klok's assistants, participating in a couple of illusions including being sawed in half. Klok had previously featured Carmen Electra in his illusions. Klok has worked on Klassetv, an English program for Dutch kids. He is taking help from English Children in the British School of Amsterdam and possibly the International School of Amsterdam. Klok toured Europe in 2010 and 2011 with his show The Houdini Experience, a loving tribute to one of his childhood heroes, done after the success of Hurricane. For the 2011 Dutch daredevil TV-Show Try before you die 2 Klok, for his dare, was asked to take part in a Chippendales-show performed at The Chippendales Theatre (Rio All- Suite Hotel & Casino) in April 2011. In February and March 2012, Klok visited the UK with his stage show The Houdini Experience, playing a five-week run at the Peacock Theatre in London, The gala opening night featured model and actress Linda Lusardi taking on a similar role to Pamela Anderson and acting as Klok's assistant for the evening, including the Buzzsaw finale. He then appeared on BBC TV's magazine programme The One Show to publicise his run, which led to him performing at Stella McCartney's London Fashion Week 2012 party-themed fashion show. There, he entertained the invited VIP guests with a number of tricks and illusions, including the levitation and sawing in half of TV presenter and model Alexa Chung. When interviewed on the Channel 5 talk show LIVE with Gabby, he revealed that his appearance at the Stella McCartney show came about after model Kate Moss saw his appearance on BBC TV's The One Show publicising his UK visit and suggested to McCartney that she should feature him in her show. The original plan for his appearance at McCartney's show was that Moss was to act as his assistant, and she spent several days working with him to rehearse the levitation and sawing illusions, plus a third illusion (not performed in the final show) in which she was beheaded by a guillotine. However, she was unable to perform in the show after suffering a temporary paralysis of her right arm a few days beforehand, and so Chung stepped in at short notice to replace her.LIVE with Gabby, Channel 5, 22 March 2012. On 19 March 2012, he was named a member of the Inner circle with Gold Star by Jack Delvin, president of The Magic Circle, a title which is reserved for a few select members. During the UK visit, Klok made a guest appearance on the final episode of the BBC TV show The Magicians, during which he broke his own world record for the number of illusions performed in a five-minute period by performing no fewer than 12 large illusions in 5 minutes. In May 2013 Klok performed the Illusion Challenge again in the Plus Grand Cabaret du Monde, which was broadcast on France 2, a French television channel. This time he performed 15 illusions in 5 minutes, breaking the world record once again. In the last three years Klok has successfully toured in The Netherlands and Germany, with sold out theatres wherever he goes. On 10 July 2013 Klok performed the Jaws of Death above the Amstel in Amsterdam, as a publicity stunt for his \\"The New Houdini\\"show.

The pact was signed in 39 BC between Sextus Pompeius and the members of the Second Triumvirate ‚Äî specifically, Mark Antony and Gaius Julius Caesar, the later Roman Emperor Augustus. The triumvirs allowed Sextus Pompeius to retain his control of Sicily and Sardinia and also granted him control of Corsica and the Peloponnesus. They also promised him a future augurate and consulship for 33 BC. In exchange, Pompeius agreed to end his blockade of Italy, supply Rome with grain and halt his piracy.Ward, Allen M., et al. A History of the Roman People. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 2003. The pact later fell apart when one of the triumvirs, Mark Antony, refused to cede control of Achaea. Pompeius then resumed hostilities against Rome before being defeated in 36 BC at the naval Battle of Naulochus by the Republican general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.

A Gothic fieldstone church was erected in the 13th century. The church and large parts of the village were devastated by a fire in 1808. In 1877 L√∂wenberg gained access to the new Prussian Nordbahn railway line from Berlin to Neubrandenburg. The municipality is known for (Schloss Liebenberg) built in 1745, the former residence of Prince Philip of Eulenburg (1847‚Äì1921) who from 1886 on held a homophile political salon - the Liebenberg Circle - here. Members included the Berlin military commander Kuno von Moltke, the later Chancellor Bernhard von B√ºlow and Emperor Wilhelm II. The circle broke up in 1907 with the Harden- Eulenburg Affair. Transportation L√∂wenberg is situated at the junction of the Bundesstra√üen 96 and 167. The L√∂wenberg railway station is served by the Nordbahn line from Berlin to Stralsund. In east-west direction train connections are also available toward Prenzlau and Rheinsberg. Further Nordbahn railway stations are also in the villages of Gr√ºneberg and Nassenheide.

History and project Simon Bedwell and John Russell spent a few years on sporadic art events and fake mailout-only 'shows' in the years after leaving St Martins artschool, then in 1991 organised their first proper show, with fellow ex-St Martins friend Dino Demosthenous, in an ex-Barclays on Lewisham Way, South London; this is where the name BANK came from. Dino Demosthenous left in 1992. In 1993, Russell and Bedwell were joined by Milly Thompson, David Burrows and Andrew Williamson (Bedwell, Burrows and Williamson having worked as a group sporadically for the 2 years previously, with shows at Richard Demarco gallery Edinburgh, and Clove 2, London). Burrows left BANK in 1995, Williamson in 1998, Russell in 2000. When BANK's own gallery, Gallerie Poo Poo, closed after the three-day show Press Release in January 1999, the group began to exhibit their collective work in other venues: The Mayor Gallery, London, Magasin 4, Bregenz, Rupert Goldsworthy Gallery, New York, Anthony Wilkinson Gallery, London, Chapman FineARTS, London, Suburban, Chicago, and finally the inaugural show at Store, London, after which Milly Thompson and Simon Bedwell began to work separately as artists whilst managing the BANK archive. BANK works have continued to circulate in exhibitions in the UK and abroad, most recently in The Banquet Years, a mini-retrospective at MOT International, London, who now represent the 'estate' of BANK as well as Bedwell and Russell. BANK's contribution to UK contemporary art was a series of curated group shows, often with comical, and sometimes offensive, titles. As a group they adopted an aggressive stance towards the mainstream contemporary art scene of the time. The approximately twenty shows curated by BANK included the work of the BANK artists alongside the work of several future Turner Prize nominees and winners. Although the BANK exhibitions were mostly held in warehouse spaces on Curtain Road, then Underwood Street (both Shoreditch, London) the name of the gallery changed. Initially it was BANKSPACE, then DOG, and finally Gallerie Poo-Poo. The various artworks were bound together, via polemical mailouts, deliberately overt thematizing and radically non-hierarchical methods of display, within single sprawling installations with a penchant for what then seemed like visual vulgarity. BANK also published a satirical magazine delivering tabloid-style critiques of the art world. Headlines included, \\"AD MAN YOU‚ÄôRE A BAD MAN,\\" and, \\"GALLERIES 'ALL OWNED BY RICH PEOPLE' SHOCK.\\"Art in America, October, 2003. Other \\"frankly adolescent\\" headlines were \\"ARSE COUNCIL\\", \\"SIMON PATTERSON - ONE IDEA, EIGHT YEARS\\", \\"CARRY ON CURATING\\", \\"PIPPA-LOTTA-RIST-ACTION\\" and \\"SAM-TAYLOR WOULD-NOT\\"Matthew Collings, Art Crazy Nation, 21 Publishing Ltd., 2001, pp36-37. These 34 tabloids, along with the Fax-Back project - in which gallery press releases were returned to galleries with corrections and commentary - have since become BANK's best known work. Julian Stallabrass describes BANK‚Äôs activity as \\"the parodic creation of corporate identity at the centre of which (as their name suggests) is a noisy and constant reference to that matter of which the art world usually whispers: money.\\"Julian Stallabrass, High Art Lite: British Art in the Nineties, Verso, 1999. pp69-70.

Founded in 1896 Miss Mary Cabell Richardson of Covington, Kentucky, the Order‚Äôs mission is to ‚Äúcommemorate the services of those men who, prior to July 4, 1776, singly exercised supreme executive power in the American colonies and who laid in them the foundations of stable government and of the respect for the civil law and authority which made the maintenance of their future independence possible.‚Äù History The first two Governors General served the Order for the first seven years of its existence. In 1903, Miss Gail Treat of East Orange, New Jersey became the new Governor General of the Order. Ms Treat was a descendant of Robert Treat, whose served as governor from 1683-1698. Miss Treat would serve as Governor General from 1903 to 1944 and upon her death all of the records of the Order vanished and the group entered a period of dormancy. In 1954 a group of members reorganized the Order and sought to preserve whatever records and information they could locate. The Order published a register of known members in 1980, and in 2004 the Lineage Book II was produced. In 2006, the Order published a comprehensive list of the Colonial Governors Prior to 4 July 1776. The Order presently consists of over 500 members throughout the United States of America and overseas and has its annual meeting in April of each year in Washington, DC at the Metropolitan Club.

Geography  Altd√∂bern lies in Lower Lusatia, but is not part of its sorbian inhabited area. The flat landscape is dominated by large forests and new lakes created from the remainings of former opencast lignite mines since the 1990s. One of these is 880 ha (2200 acre) large Altd√∂berner See, east of the town. Its flooding is planned to be finished in the 2020s. The municipality of Altd√∂bern also contains the settlements Pritzen, Peitzendorf and Chransdorf and the villages Ranzow and Reddern. The municipalities of Altd√∂bern, Bronkow, Luckaitztal, Neupetershain (Nowe Wiki) and Neu-Seeland together form the collective municipality Amt Altd√∂bern.  Culture and architecture  The baroque castle of Altd√∂bern (Schloss Altd√∂bern) with its surrounding park (Schlosspark) is just northwest of the central market square (Markt). The first castle was built in the 16th century in renaissance style, but later replaced by a new building in baroque architecture including rococo elements. Intense restorations are still in progress, but the interior of the castle can be visited during special events such as the annual park festival (Parksommertr√§ume). The landscape park also contains a small French garden and the large Salzteich lake. The Protestant church at the market square was built only in 1918‚Äì1921, after the medieval predecessor burned in 1914. Other Protestant churches exist in Pritzen and Reddern. A minor catholic church exists at the Waldstra√üe in Altd√∂bern.

Interpretation This poem is considered one of the shorter poems included in the first book of poems published by Wallace Stevens. The poem meditates on Stevens's increasing awareness, also notably expressed in \\"The Anecdote of the Prince of Peacocks\\" (1923), that there are significant differences between imaginative activity and ordinary experience. This theme can be understood as signalling that writing poetry has dangers. Poetic drowsing is liable to attack by the Indian, or by Berserk in \\"Peacocks\\", defeating imagination's task of transforming the ordinary. This sense of danger is absent in such earlier poems as \\"Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock\\" (1915), where the old sailor need fear no such violence as he catches tigers in red weather.

When a boxer is knocked down in a fight, the referee will count over them and the boxer must rise to their feet, unaided, by the count of ten or else deemed to have been knocked out. A long count occurs when a boxer is given more than the allotted time (a notional ten seconds) to rise to his or her feet. History There have always been controversial counts in boxing. In 1900, Terry McGovern was reputedly down for up to 20 seconds after being floored by Oscar Gardner; McGovern knocked Gardner out in the next round. In 1915, Bombardier Billy Wells received a long count in his fight with Dick Smith. When Wells was knocked down, referee Tom Dunning, officiating from outside the ring, did not begin the count until he had climbed into the ring, which gave Wells an extra six seconds to recover. The term is now often associated with Jack Dempsey's 1927 heavyweight championship fight against Gene Tunney. In the seventh round, Dempsey knocked Tunney down, but did not go to a neutral corner as a new rule required him to. Referee Dave Barry did not start counting over Tunney until he had ushered Dempsey to a neutral corner, wasting several seconds. Tunney rose to his feet, having been on the canvas for around 17 seconds, and went on to win a decision, thus retaining his title. The controversy over the long count ensured the fight went down in history as The Battle of the Long Count. Since then, there have been many other fights which have had a long count controversy. Archie Moore maintained that Rocky Marciano had received extra time to recover when the referee erroneously gave Marciano a standing eight count after being knocked down by Moore in their 1955 fight. In their 1965 rematch, Sonny Liston was knocked down by Muhammad Ali but, in the confusion that followed, Liston was down for more than 10 seconds before getting up and resuming the fight. At Nat Fleischer's prompting, referee Jersey Joe Walcott then stopped the fight 17 seconds after the knockdown. In a 1966 match, referee Billy Conn was accused of giving Carlos Ort√≠z a long count against Sugar Ramos, which led to a rematch being ordered. In February 1990, following James \\"Buster\\" Douglas' upset victory over Mike Tyson, Tyson's camp led by Don King tried to overturn the result, arguing that Douglas had spent between 13 and 14 seconds on the canvas after being knocked down by Tyson in an earlier round, and had therefore been knocked out first. Manny Pacquiao's camp alleged Juan Manuel M√°rquez received a slow count from Joe Cortez in their 2004 featherweight title bout. Lucian Bute's 2008 fight with Librado Andrade had a long count controversy which drew comparisons with Dempsey-Tunney. Bute, ahead on points, was knocked down in the final seconds of the bout, rose at the count of six, and then the referee interrupted the count in order to send Andrade back to a neutral corner. By the time the count had finished, twenty seconds had elapsed. Timing Despite the Marquess of Queensberry Rules stipulating that a fighter has ten seconds to rise from a knockdown, studies of knockouts have shown that a referee's ten count does not typically last ten seconds. When Billy Conn was counted out against Joe Louis, the count lasted 12.4 seconds. Several Mike Tyson opponents were given a ten count which lasted over ten seconds. In Tyson's fight with Douglas, Douglas received a ten count which lasted 14 seconds. Ingemar Johansson was thought to have got a short count after being knocked down by Floyd Patterson in their 1961 rubbermatch, having been counted out despite rising a split second before the referee reached ten. Film footage showed Johansson had actually been down for between 11 and 12 seconds. Ultimately, a referee's ten count is rarely a precise ten seconds; rather, it is simply a human's count to ten.

Arnmore is a location at Kippen, Stirlingshire, neighbouring Broich, the home of William Schaw, his successor as master of work. Schaw is regarded as a founder of Freemasonry. Carnock, the location, is to the east of Stirling. Alexander Drummond had been a supporter of the Earl of Angus and went with him to exile to England in 1529. Robert built up the Carnock lands into a holding recognised as a free barony. Robert's first wife, Agnes (or Margaret), was a sister of Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange.

S. Mylne, Master Masons to the Crown of Scotland (1893), p. 54. As an architect his significance lies in the inventory of repairs for royal palaces of 7 May 1583 with its appreciation of the landscape around Stirling Castle, with its river valleys dotted with the castles of the Scottish nobility. Drummond hoped to design and build a gallery and roof terrace on the west quarter of the palace to appreciate the views. He also intended to re-site the royal chapel. In the words of his estimate: > \\"The westquarter thairof to be all tane downe to the ground thane to big and > beild the same up agane in the maist plesand maner that can be devyssit: > quhilk quarter off the said paleys is the best and maist plesand situatioune > off ony of his hienes palayes by ressone it will have the maist plesand > sycht of all the foure airthis (directions), in speciall park and gairdin, > deer thairin, up the riverais of Forthe, Teyth, Allone, and Guddy to > Lochlomwnd, ane sycht rownd about in all pairtis and downe to the revear of > Forthe quhair thar standis many greit stane howssis\\" > > The west quarter thereof to be all taken down to the ground then to build > the same up again in the most pleasant manner that can be divised: which > quarter of the said palace is the best and most pleasant situation of any of > his majesty's palaces by reason it will have the most pleasant sight of all > the four directions, especially the park and garden, the deer there, up the > rivers of Forth, Teith, Allan, and Guddy, to Loch Lomond, a sight round > about in all parts and down to the river of Forth where there stands many > great stone houses.Henry Paton, Accounts of the Masters of Work, vol.1 > (Edinburgh, 1957), pp. 310-314, 310. Nothing was done to the west quarter of Stirling Palace at this time, and by 1625 a part of the building had fallen down the hillside. The rest of quarter survives as a passage or gallery used in 1594 during the baptism of Prince Henry.Dennis Gallagher & Gordon Ewart, Sirling Castle Palace, Archaeology and Historical Research (Historic Scotland, 2008), pp. 20, 52-53 Drummond also predicted that a dilapidated part of Linlithgow Palace was in danger of collapse, and recommended immediate intervention. The building fell twenty years later; > \\"Item the westquarter of the Paleys of Lythquow is altogidder lyk to fall > downe that ane hunder pundis will do mair presently to the said work nor ane > thowsand pundis will do quhen it is fallin downe.\\" > > Item the west quarter of the Palace of Linlithgow is altogether likely to > fall down, that ¬£100 will do more presently to the said work than ¬£1000 will > do when it is fallen down.Henry Paton, Accounts of the Masters of Work, vol. > 1 (Edinburgh, 1957), p. 311. Drummond did not have an opportunity to carry out these works. His successor William Schaw rebuilt the chapel in 1594. Drummond's only certain works are repairs and alterations to roof and parapet at Doune Castle and some repairs at Stirling Castle.William Fraser, The Red Book of Menteith, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1880), pp. 419-421: Mylne, Rev. R. S., Master Masons, (Edinburgh, 1893), p. 60. Drummond had coal mines in his lands and supplied coal for domestic uses to the town of Stirling, agreeing with William Bell, a merchant in Stirling, to set and use a standard measure for a \\"burgess load\\", for coal supplied from the mine of Bannockburn. Drummond's agreement with the town's officials was recorded in the official Register of Deeds, a register of obligations still preserved in the General Register House in Edinburgh.The coal agreement can be found in the National Archives of Scotland, RD1, volume 8, folios 228-229 Drummond's own house at Carnock was demolished in 1941, abandoned and unsafe due to subsidence caused by coalworking, essential during the 1914-18 war. It had an interesting plan with two staircases. The armorial panel of 1548 with his coat of arms and that of Marjorie Elphinstone can be seen at Sissinghurst Castle Garden, painted ceiling boards and the front door of the house are displayed at Stirling Smith Museum and Art Gallery.Carnock House is described; MacGibbon & Ross, (1887), ii, 490-496; RCAHMS Stirlingshire vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1963), 380-1 The oak beams from the ceiling have been dated to 1589 and carry inscriptions exhorting moral precepts, some from the Bible, some from the Stoic philosopher Gaius Musonius Rufus, perhaps following the English author William Baldwin although using Scottish spellings.

F. Warner, Library of James VI (Edinburgh, 1893), pp. xii, lxxi. Midhope Castle, filmed as the Lallybroch setting in Outlander, belonged to his brother Alexander Drummond. Possibly changes and alteration at Midhope were due to his brother, the master of work. Another brother, Charles, was Provost of Linlithgow. In 1582 Robert's eldest son Patrick Drummond of Monzie feuar of Carnock, was involved in the Ruthven Raid. In July 1583 he lost his court role as a Master of the stable and went into exile in England. His brother John Drummond of Slipperfield and Hawthornden was also discharged from his place as usher.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), 648: Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1581-1583, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1910), p. 560: Amy Juhala, 'For the King Favours Them Very Strangely', in Miles Kerr- Peterson and Steven J. Reid, James VI and Noble Power (Routledge: Abingdon, 2017), p. 171. Robert's son-in-law Adam Erskine, Commendator of Cambuskenneth, was a leader of the Gowrie regime. These connections may have led to Robert's replacement as royal master of work by William Schaw before November 1583, after the fall of the Gowrie Regime.For Drummond's last payment as master of work and Schaw's first payment 1583 see National Records of Scotland E22/6 f97r, f133v. His inventory of repairs of May 1583 makes provision for Mary, Queen of Scots or the potential bride of James VI at Stirling Castle: \\"oure Queeyne withe hir tryne of ladyis may pas forthe off this new devissit work into the said chappell loft\\".Accounts of the Masters of Work, vol.1, (Edinburgh, 1957), 311. The estimate demonstrates Drummond's involvement with the Ruthven regime and, perhaps, its cynical negotiation with Queen Elizabeth I for the conjoint 'associated rule' of Mary and James VI in the Spring of 1583. The fictional double portrait of Mary and James of 1583 was made for this negotiation.James Kirk in Scotland Revisited, ed. Jenny Wormald, (1985). Drummond crossed the Tweed into exile in England at Wark Castle on 27 April 1584 with the Earl of Angus and his followers.Joseph Bain, Calendar of Border Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1894), p. 134. Drummond, his son-in-law Adam Erskine, Commendator of Cambuskenneth, and his sons Patrick, John, Robert, and William, were accused by Duncan Forrester of Queenshaugh of threatening him. In July 1586 when Forrester was travelling from Kirkliston to Edinburgh, William Drummond shot at him with a pistol. James Drummond, Commendator of Inchaffray, agreed to offer ¬£1,000 as a caution for their good behaviour.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 95-6, 98, 153. In 1587 Carnock got into difficulties selling a property to Thomas Forrester of Durrishall, and Carnock, Bannockburn and his Stirling townhouse were otained for a time by Lord Doune.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 229. Robert was witness at the christening in Stirling on 19 October 1589 of Mr William Drummond and Christine Brodie's daughter Janet.The Scottish Antiquary: or Northern Notes & Queries, vol.8, no.29 (1893), p. 36 He died in 1592. Epitaph The poet Alexander Montgomerie who flourished at the court of James VI in the same years as Drummond wrote an epitaph to the architect. The poem speaks of Robert Drummond as a leader in building and planting in Scotland. In the manuscript volume of Montgomerie's poems called the \\"Ker Manuscript\\" Drummond's name was added to the title by his grandson, the poet William Drummond of Hawthornden.David J. Parkinson, Alexander Montgomeie, Poems, vol. 2 (STS; Edinburgh, 2000), pp. 1, 80-81, the manuscript is Edinburgh University Library MS De.3.70. :Stay Passinger thy Mynd, thy futt, thy ee, :Vouchsaif a we his Epitaph to vieu :Quha left bot feu, behind him sik as he :Syn leirnd to de to live agane aneu. ::All knoues this treu, who noble Carnok kneu. :This Realme may reu that he is gone to grave'. :All buildings brave bids DROMMOND nou adeu; :Quhais lyf furthsheu he lude thame by the laiv. :Quhair sall we craiv sik policie to haiv? :Quha with him straiv to polish, build or plante? :These giftis I grant god lent him by the LaivDavid J.

History The Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club was founded (as the \\"Seawanhaka Yacht Club\\") in September 1871 aboard the sloop Glance, anchored off Centre Island. Glance's captain, William L. Swan, was elected Seawanhaka's first Commodore. For many years, club meetings were held aboard this flagship. In the 1880s the Club maintained a clubhouse and anchorage at Stapleton, Staten Island near the clubhouse of the New York Yacht Club. In 1881 Seawanhaka held Cup races from the New York harbor to Sandy Hook, NJ. Clubhouses In 1881, the club leased space on Centre Island, and the word \\"Corinthian\\" was incorporated into the club's name. In 1887 the organization leased a club house in Manhattan. Finally, in 1891-1892, the club returned to Centre Island, where a new club house was opened, and the club merged with the Oyster Bay Yacht Club. Recognizing its important history, the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.National Register of Historic Places, listed January 8, 1974.

The Load Waterline Length was usually placed under a class limit, where any amount beyond the limit was counted double. In the 1893 America's Cup the limit was set at 85 ft, so the Load Waterline Length of an 86 ft yacht would have counted as 87 ft.

Although briefly evaluated as a fighter by the Royal Air Force, the MB 2 was limited in design potential and never entered series production. Design and development James Martin, broadly responding to Specification F.5/34 for a fighter using an air-cooled engine for hot climates, designed a fighter using the simple basic structure employed and developed in his earlier MB 1. Constructed of steel tubing, the MB 2 incorporated many detailed improvements which further simplified production as well as repair and maintenance. Powered by a special Napier Dagger III HIM 24-cylinder H-type engine of 805 nominal bhp, but capable of operation at 13 lb boost to give over 1,000 hp for takeoff, driving a fixed-pitch, two-blade propeller, the MB 2 was capable of 300+ mph (480 km/h) speeds \\"on paper.\\" The undercarriage was fixed but cleanly faired in two trouser-type fairings, the port one carrying the oil-cooler. A retractable undercarriage to improve performance was \\"in the works\\" when the design was abandoned. The fuselage lines were square cut and exceptionally clean, with almost constant depth from nose to tail. An unusual feature, at that time, was that the fuselage was slightly longer than the wingspan, a feature retained in later Martin-Baker designs, which contributed to good stability and control in yaw. One of the hallmarks of Martin-Baker designs was the simple but efficient installation of main systems. The clean and orderly cockpit was set well back, allowing a good view downwards behind the wing. A crash post was fitted, which automatically extended to minimise structure damage and injury to the pilot in the event of a nose-over landing. A small, tapered tailplane was mounted on the top of the fuselage well forward of the stern post, while the fin and rudder combination was roughly triangular in side elevation. This arrangement placed most of the effective rudder area below the tailplane, thus providing an adequate balance to the keel surface and assuring good recovery from spins. In initial MB 2 configurations, there was no fin and the rudder was mounted on the fuselage but lateral stability was unsatisfactory, with the fixed fin added later. Operational history Testing and evaluation The MB 2 was first flown by Captain Valentine Baker at Harwell on 3 August 1938 and initially tested with markings MB-1 (G-AEZD not carried). The Aeroplane stated, \\"[I]n spite of its fixed undercarriage, the MB 2 had a performance as good as that of contemporary fighters and a capacity for quick and cheap production by the simplicity of its structure and easy assembly\\". Repair and maintenance were also simple,Bowyer 1984, p. 35. and these factors might have influenced the authorities towards putting the MB 2 into production when the country's fighter strength was disproportionately low. The MB 2 was subsequently acquired by the Air Ministry in June 1939 as P9594 and returned to A&AEE; for a second assessment after modifications were made to tail control surfaces. The MB 2 also spent some time at the Air Fighting Development Unit (AFDU), RAF Northolt, before returning to Martin-Baker late in 1939, where it still survived in December 1941, although probably flown little or not at all after the outbreak of war. Around this time Martin was considering various other ideas, both for complete aircraft and for certain components. The aircraft designs included a twin-engined 12-gun fighter and a twin-engined multi-seat transport, both featuring the finless layout of the early MB 2 airframe. In the fighter design, the trailing edge of the engine nacelles provided additional vertical control surfaces, and also incorporated the patented ducting system evolved by Martin to reduce drag caused by the engine exhaust. The most promising of the concepts became the MB 3 which would eventually spawn the superlative MB 5 prototype.Green 1979, pp. 78.

It stars Hugh Quarshie, Tomas Arana, Barbara Cupisti, Asia Argento, Feodor Chaliapin, Jr. and Giovanni Lombardo Radice. Although it was originally conceived as the third installment in the D√®moni series, Soavi insisted the film to be distant from the series, wanting it to be ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù, and re-wrote the screenplay to remove any connection to the series. Filming was primarily shot in the Matthias Church in Budapest, with additional footage filmed at studio sets in Rome and in downtown Hamburg, Germany.  Plot  In medieval Germany, a band of Teutonic Knights massacre a village of supposed devil-worshippers and bury their bodies underground, building a Gothic cathedral over the mass grave as a means to contain the demonic evil within. In the present day, the cathedral's new librarian Evan arrives for his first day on the job. He meets Lisa, an artist supervising a restoration of the church's elaborate frescoes, who introduces him to the surly Bishop and the kindly Father Gus. The Bishop warns Evan not to enter the church's catacombs, nominally due to their instability. Lisa begins restoring a fresco in the cellar, when she uncovers a hidden compartment containing a mysterious parchment carrying what resemble architectural schematics. Evan sneaks the parchment out of the church under the suspicious Bishop's nose, and goes home with Lisa. Bonding over a mutual interest in medieval art and architecture, the two start to make love, when Evan has a sudden realization and finds hidden Latin text on the parchment referring to a \\"stone with seven eyes.\\" As Evan explores the catacombs to find the stone, Gus and Lisa experience strange, paranormal visions. Meanwhile, the Bishop finds the parchment and begins studying it closely. Searching the cellar, Evan uncovers the stone in a hidden crypt; a seal embedded into the ground above a cross. Evan manages to pry open the seal, revealing a vast, seemingly endless black void. A blue light radiates from the hole and reveals a sack. Tomas opens the sack, and is grabbed by hands from the inside before he blacks out. When he regains consciousness, the sack and hands are gone, and his wrists are bleeding. Evan closes the hole and the sacristan enters in search of an intruder. Evan knocks him out and flees, becoming pale and bloody. Losing control of his hands, he tears out his still-beating heart and bites into it. At home, Lisa experiences dreams of the unsealed hole and a vast, candle- filled atrium. Awake and waiting for Evan's return, she is attacked by a goat- headed demon and flees in terror. Returning home, the sacristan begins experiencing the same symptoms as Evan. The next day, Lisa goes to Evan's office, where he is acting strangely. He tries to sexually assault her and she flees, shocked and horrified. Evan likewise menaces the sacristan's daughter Lotte, with whom he'd previously been amiable. Evan and the sacristan both become increasingly disheveled and violent. Lotte flees her apartment when she sees her father reflected as an ape-like demon. Having a moment of clarity, the sacristan rushes to the confession booth, and tells Father Gus that he has become demonically possessed and fears losing control. To Gus' horror, he rushes to the cellar and kills himself with a jackhammer, begging for forgiveness before he dies. His death seemingly triggers security mechanisms that cause the church to seal shut, trapping everyone inside. Among the occupants are a class of schoolchildren on a field trip, a bride taking wedding photographs, an elderly couple, and a teenage couple. The occupants begin experiencing increasingly elaborate and deadly visions. The bride sees her reflection rapidly age, and in a fit of madness tears the skin off her own face. One of the schoolchildren sees his friend turn into his doppelganger before being killed. The teenager sees his girlfriend in the embrace of a gargoyle. As the occupants try to find a way out, Gus confronts the aloof Bishop, and discovers him on the rooftop with a stash of occult parchments and schematics for the church. He reveals that he intends to let the evil inside kill the occupants before being unleashed on what he sees as a sinful and corrupt world, before committing suicide. Those inside start dying in droves; the teenage couple manage to dig through a thin section of the floor and rappel down beneath the church, only to unknowingly enter a subway tunnel and be struck and killed. The sacristan reanimates, now completely possessed, and kills the schoolteacher. At a nightclub in town, Lotte senses something wrong and rushes back to the church, using a secret passageway in the aqueduct to get inside. Meanwhile, Lisa enters into a trance and wanders into the cellar, finding herself in the same candlelit atrium of her dreams. Surrounded by the reanimated specters of the church's victims, she lies atop an altar and is raped by Evan, now fully transformed into a gargoyle-like demon. Searching the Bishop's office, Gus finds the ancient records recounting the church's creation. Lotte enters, and upon sees someone who looks like her in a woodcut depicting the massacre (implied to be her in a past-life). Suddenly flooded with memories from centuries prior, she reveals that the church's architect was left to die in the church he had built, and that his body contains a self- destruct mechanism for the entire building. Gus tells Lotte to flee, and he makes his way through the cellar and to the chapel hall as the dead bodies of the massacre victims begin to rise. Gus reaches the altar, and finds a massive pile of reanimating corpses rising out of the ground. He finds the architect's body hidden beneath the floor, and activates the self-destruct mechanism. The building collapses, killing everyone inside, including Gus, Lisa and Evan. Only Lotte escapes. Some time later, Lotte returns to the ruins of the church with flowers. A passing truck uncovers the stone seal and blows it open. As she hears the sounds of horses running, blue light emits from within, just like when Evan first opened it, and she smiles enigmatically.

In an interview conducted on January 22, 1988, directors Lamberto Bava and Dario Argento were discussing a follow-up to Demons 2 stating that they were working on a follow-up film, with Argento stating it would not be called Demons 3, but potentially Ritorno alla casa dei demoni (). The third Demons film had a story developed by Franco Ferrini and Dardano Sacchetti which involved an airplane that had to make an emergency landing where it finds itself on an island with a volcano where the passengers. Sacchetti explained that the situation was for them to arrive in a \\"weird hell\\" and compared the film to Alien, but with the isolated place being an airplane opposed to a spaceship and the demons replacing the aliens. After developing several drafts, the writers abandoned the story with Sacchetti stating that they had trouble creating a story set in an isolated area of the airplane. The screenwriters eventually developed a new screenplay set in a church which acted as a passage into hell. Argento would later state that The Church \\"was never Demons 3, Nobody but Lamberto ever wanted to make Demons 3; I didn't want it, the studio didn't want it, nobody wanted it.\\" The decision of re-starting the screenplay from the beginning led to Bava leaving the project as he began working on a set of television films in October 1988. This led to director Michele Soavi to enter production as the director, right after he had completed his film Stage Fright. Soavi was surprised at Bava leaving the project, stating \\"I couldn't be he had worked on it for so long and didn't want to complete the project.\\" Soavi made some changes to the script, including a new opening scene influenced by John Milius' film Conan the Barbarian. Soavi declared that he \\"loved the first part, but in the middle it was a little silly, so I got together with Franco Ferrini and worked on it to make it stronger.\\" Shooting of the film took place from September 1988 to November 1988 with a budget of three and a half million dollars. On finding the appropriate church for the film, Argento stated they looked throughout Europe: Italy, France, Germany and Switzerland and found that nobody wanted them to shoot in their church due to the nature of the film. Finding it easier to shoot in Eastern Europe, the crew explored Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria eventually settling on a Church in Hungary. The film was shot at Matthias Church in Budapest, in Hamburg, and at both R.P.A. Elios Studios and De Paolis In.Ci.R. studios in Rome. Soavi described his filming experience as exhausting, noting that he \\"was free, and I could do what I wanted... but I also sufferd a lot because of the difficulties, the vicissitudes, the delays.\\" While preparing for the film, Argento learned that Keith Emerson would be interested in writing the score, having worked with him previously on Inferno. Having received his twelve-track demo which Argento did not like: \\"They were terrible. Noe even a child would have written music like that. A sort of bombastic march, it sound like the Carabinieri fanfare.\\" Only three tracks by Emerson were used in the film: an organ-driven main title theme, a track titled \\"Possession\\" and a rearranged version of Bach's Prelude 24. For the rest of the score, Soavi inserted two tracks by Philip Glass and relied on Fabio Pignatelli who is credited as Goblin. Soavi has derisively referred to them as \\"Pizza Schlock\\", and expressed that he wanted The Church to be more sophisticated. In an interview with Cinefantastique, Soavi explained that he wished to move beyond with his creations following the film's release, and because of that he parted ways with Argento, ending their long-time creative partnership. Release The Church was distributed theatrically in Italy by Cecchi Gori in Italy on 10 March 1989. The film grossed a total of 1,926,277,000 Italian lire domestically. The film was the 36th top grossing film in Italy that year with Italian film historian and critic stating its gross diminished as the film rating board gave the film a F.M.18 certificate for \\"the many, particularly violent and shocking scenes which are considered unsuitable for the sensitivity of the spectators in developmental age.\\" In comparison, the biggest film of the year in Italy was Roberto Benigni's Il piccolo diavolo which grossed 17 billion Italian lire. One year later, the film commission overturned the previous ruling and considered the films \\"violent and shocking scenes\\" as \\"...not particularly and intensely underlined within the general context of the film\\" and changed the rating to V.M.14. The film was released in the United States on August 22, 1990 where it was distributed by TriStar Pictures. Critical response In a contemporary review, Variety referred to the film as a \\"technically proficient but empty horror exercise\\", praising the score by Goblin. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 64% based on 11 reviews.

Avery in the Tribune Building in New York City. The first signer of the Order's \\"Institution\\" (founding document) was Major General Fitz John Porter who was a veteran of both the Mexican War and the Civil War. Eighteen others signed the Institution of which five were Mexican War veterans, nine were descendants of American Revolutionary War officers and four who were descendants of officers who served in the War of 1812. The resultant Order was initially known as the Military and Naval Order of the United States and was organized and later incorporated under that name. Its hereditary line of descent spans the period of American history since national independence during the Revolutionary War. Initially membership in the Order was limited to officer veterans (and their hereditary descendants) of the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the Mexican War. (In addition, there is a requirement that ancestors who were militia officers must have had active service during wartime.) Although there were many individuals who served as officers in the American Civil War and the Indian Wars who were living at the time of the Order's founding, that service did not qualify them for membership as those wars were considered to be domestic rather than foreign wars. In April 1895, the name of the Order was officially changed to its present name ‚Äì The Military Order of Foreign Wars of the United States (MOFW). By the end of 1896, commanderies had been formed in seven states. The MOFW was patterned after the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) which was a military society for officers, and their descendants, who had served the Union during the American Civil War. As MOLLUS had restricted its membership to officers who had served in one particular war, the need was felt to have an organization for the descendants of officers who had served in the American Revolution, War of 1812 and the Mexican War ‚Äì as well as the few surviving Mexican War veterans who were officers. The influence of the Order spread rapidly and soon commanderies (state level organizations) were formed in other states. It was deemed advisable to form a National Commandery to centralize and coordinate the activities of the various state commanderies, and which would have general supervision and control over the policies and activities of the Order. The National Commandery was founded at a joint meeting of the individual state commanderies in March 1896 and General Alexander S. Webb was elected as the first Commander General. The motto of the Military Order of Foreign Wars is the Latin phrase Deus et Libertas meaning God and Liberty. The War and Navy Departments, and later the Department of Defense, under various resolutions of Congress, gave recognition to the Order and permitted the wearing of its insignia on uniforms. Membership qualifications For the first two years of the MOFW's existence, membership categories were limited to Veteran and Hereditary companions who were either veteran officers or descendant of veteran officers who had served during the American Revolution, War of 1812, War with Tripoli or the Mexican War. Service during the American Civil War and the Indian Wars did not qualify as those were considered domestic rather than foreign conflicts. In 1896 the membership category of Honorary Companion was created for presidents of the United States and officers who had attained the rank of major general or rear admiral. President William McKinley, President Grover Cleveland and Lieutenant General John M. Schofield were among the earliest honorary companions. The qualifications for Honorary Companions were later changed to require that officers be equal to or higher than lieutenant general or vice admiral. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898 provided the Order with a great number of new Veteran Companions ‚Äì particularly the Pennsylvania Commandery which, according to the MOFW Register published in 1900, accounted for over half of the Order's membership. Among the individuals who joined the MOFW between 1898 and 1900 were Admiral George Dewey, future president Theodore Roosevelt and future General of the Armies John J. Pershing. Most senior officers who served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War were also veterans of the Civil War, and many belonged to both the MOFW and MOLLUS. In 1928, a fourth membership status (junior companion) was created for sons of companions who had not reached the majority age of 21. In 1969, companionship was extended to those who served in an enlisted status during a foreign war and were later commissioned. In time, the Order's membership qualifications were expanded to include service during conflicts with foreign powers which include, but are not limited to, the War with Spain, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the War in Iraq and the War in Afghanistan. Combat or \\"in theater\\" service is not required for membership. The membership of the Order and the number of state commanderies over the 100 years of the Order's existence has fluctuated, typically increasing after the end of a war and declining during times of peace. The Order's stringent and high eligibility requirements make it difficult for the Order to recruit members in large numbers. However, this selectivity has enabled the Order to sustain itself for over 100 years because it continues to fill its ranks with individuals of the highest caliber, patriotism, loyalty, and character.

Presidents of the United States and the MOFW Five Presidents of the United States are known to have been companions of the MOFW. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower joined the MOFW as Veteran Companions. Presidents Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison and William McKinley joined the MOFW as honorary companions. (Presidents Harrison and Cleveland could also have joined the MOFW as hereditary companions.) At least eight presidents were eligible to join the MOFW as veteran companions but are not known to have joined the Order: Harry S Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush. (President Truman was also eligible to join as an hereditary companion.) Former president George W. Bush is eligible to join the MOFW as an hereditary companion by right of his father's service during the Second World War. Presidents Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover were also eligible for hereditary companionship as they had ancestors who served as officers during the American Revolution. Of the presidents who have served since the Order's founding in 1894, seven presidents ‚Äì William McKinley, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump ‚Äì have been ineligible for both veteran and hereditary companionship as they are not known to have had qualifying ancestors. (All of them, except Wilson and Trump, did have ancestors who served as soldiers during the American Revolution; however, none of their ancestors has been proven to have been an officer.) Of the presidents who lived prior to the Order's founding, seven had military service which would qualify their descendants for hereditary companionship in the Order. These presidents were George Washington, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Franklin Pierce, and Ulysses S. Grant. Five other presidents who lived prior to the Order's founding ‚Äì John Tyler, James K. Polk, Abraham Lincoln, Rutherford B. Hayes, and Chester A. Arthur ‚Äì had ancestors who had served as officers during the American Revolution or the War of 1812; and, thus, their descendants are eligible for hereditary membership in MOFW.

Information about Menna comes primarily from his richly decorated tomb (TT 69) in the necropolis of Sheikh Abd al-Qurna at Thebes. Though his tomb has traditionally been dated to the reign of Thutmose IV, stylistic analysis of the decoration places the majority of construction and decoration of the tomb to the reign of Amenhotep III.  Titles  Damaged depiction of Menna before Osiris in his tomb Menna was unique for the 18th Dynasty because he carried titles associated with both temple and palace administration. Though the pharaoh technically owned both temple and palace agricultural estates, administration of these institutions was traditionally separated. Egyptologist Dr. Melinda Hartwig argues that the high cost of Amenhotep III‚Äôs ambitious building projects resulted in a consolidation of temple and royal grain administration in order to pay the workers Amenhotep III utilized to construct his monuments. These workers were typically paid with grain, so the combination of temple and palace administration under one person allowed for greater efficiency of wealth redistribution. Menna‚Äôs titles as recorded in his tomb chapel are: * Scribe * Overseer of Fields of Amun * Overseer of Plowlands of Amun * Overseer of Fields of the Lord of the Two Lands * Scribe of the Fields of the Lord of the Two Lands of South and North * Scribe of the Lord of the Two Lands  Family  Menna‚Äôs wife, Henuttawy, was likely a woman from a more influential family. She herself carried the titles of \\"Chantress of Amun\\" and \\"Lady of the House\\", both of which speak to her noble birth and possession of property. Her father may well have been Amenhotep-sa-se (TT75) who held the title of \\"second prophet of Amun\\" placing him second only to the high priest within the hierarchy of Karnak temple. Menna and Henuttawy had five children: two sons, Se and Kha, and three daughters, Amenemweskhet, Nehemet, and Kasy. Amenemweskhet held the title of \\"Lady-in-Waiting\\", which tied her closely to the royal household. Her sister, Nehemet is depicted wearing a crown typically worn by ladies-in-waiting and may have also carried this title. In Menna's tomb (TT69) Nehemet is labelled with the words \\"mAat-Xrw\\" which means \\"true of voice\\" or \\"justified\\". This indicates that she was likely deceased by the time the tomb was decorated. Menna's son, Se, was a \\"scribe of counting grain of Amun\\", and Kha was a minor priest known as a \\"wab-priest\\". Two more women, Way and Nefery are depicted in Menna's tomb. They both carry the titles of \\"Chantress of Amun\\" and \\"Lady of the House\\". They are also labelled with the word \\"sA.t\\" which can mean 'daughter' but can also mean 'daughter-in-law'. Their title of \\"Lady of the House\\" indicates that they were married, so they may well have been the wives of Se and Kha.  Tomb (TT69)  Much of the information that remains about Menna comes from his tomb in the Theban Necropolis, TT69. Like many Egyptian tombs of the time, the tomb consists of a sunken forecourt, a broad outer room (known as the 'transverse room' or 'broad hall') a long inner room (the 'long hall\\"), a central shrine, and a sloping passage leading to a burial chamber. The broad hall, long hall, and shrine of Menna‚Äôs tomb were beautifully decorated, and still retain much of their vibrant color. The decoration of the tomb focused on Menna's position within the Egyptian administration, and on his transition from a living person in this world, to an effective and powerful ancestor in the next. Scenes of agriculture are common, as are scenes showing offering bringers giving food and drink to Menna, often accompanied by his wife, Henuttawy. Scenes of the funeral rites and judgement before Osiris also appear. Art historical analysis of the style of decoration within the tomb has shown that though the tomb may have been begun during the reign of Thutmose IV, the majority of the painting was carried out during the reign of Amenhotep III. TT69 is notable for having the earliest depiction of the Weighing of the Heart ceremony to appear on the wall of a tomb.

Anne Hummert (n√©e Schumacher) (January 19, 1905 ‚Äì July 5, 1996) was the leading creator of daytime radio serials or soap opera dramas during the 1930s and 1940s, responsible for more than three dozen series. Biography She was born in Baltimore, Maryland, one of four children. Little is known about her parents or her childhood: some sources say her father Frederick was a police lieutenant;Jim Cox, Frank and Anne Hummert's Radio Factory, McFarland, 2003, pp. 17-18 census documents say he was a steamfitter and contractor, and still other sources say he was an engineer.\\"We Pay Our Respects.\\" Broadcasting Magazine, April 1, 1935, p. 31.

She then took a job with the Paris precursor of the International Herald Tribune. It was in France that she married reporter John Ashenhurst, a former member of The Baltimore Suns editorial staff, in July 1926.\\"Ashenhurst--Schumacher.\\" The Baltimore Sun, August 14, 1926, p. 5.

Frank Hummert.\\"Hummerts' Mill.\\" Time Magazine, January 23, 1939, p. 30. At the Blackett-Sample-Hummert agency, she rose in the ranks and became a full partner in 1933, earning $100,000 a year. Radio historian Jim Cox noted that when the two teamed to create daytime radio serials, they... :...intended to seize the housewives‚Äô attention and alter the pattern of their daily existence... Radio as Americans experienced it during its golden age likely would have been vastly different had Frank and Anne Hummert not been on the scene to influence it so pervasively. After their first major success, Just Plain Bill, they followed with Ma Perkins, Skippy, Backstage Wife and Young Widder Brown. Their professional collaboration led to a personal relationship that neither had expected: Frank Hummert was a widower, after the death of his wife, Adeline, and he was twenty years older than his assistant. As for Anne, she was still getting over her divorce from her husband John and was not expecting to remarry. Frank and Anne got married in 1935, and friends would later describe their marriage as \\"one of the great love matches.\\" Robert McG. Thomas Jr. \\"Anne Hummert, 91, Dies.\\" The New York Times, July 21, 1996, p. 27. Following their marriage, Frank and Anne Hummert moved to New York where they launched their company, Air Features, a radio production house. The Hummerts produced many radio drama series, including Amanda of Honeymoon Hill, Front Page Farrell, John's Other Wife, Little Orphan Annie, Judy and Jane, Mr. Chameleon, Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons and Our Gal Sunday. They soon had as many as 18 separate 15-minute serials airing for a total of 90 episodes a week. They also produced The American Album of Familiar Music. From their estate in Greenwich, Connecticut, Anne Hummert delivered a large weekly word count, outlining all of the plot twists for all of her programs. The Hummerts farmed out the writing to scripters, known as \\"dialoguers,\\" who embellished her synopses into complete scripts for Stella Dallas, Young Widder Brown and other soap operas. Actress Mary Jane Higby observed, ‚ÄúUnquestionably, they had a profound influence on the whole literature of soap opera. They, more than anyone else, determined the shape it took.‚Äù According to Jim Cox, by the 1940s, the Hummerts controlled four-and-a-half hours of the national weekday broadcast schedule. Their programs brought in more than five million letters a year. By 1939, the Hummert's programs were responsible for more than half the advertising revenues generated by daytime radio. They also did primetime musical shows, such as Waltz Time. The Hummerts each had an annual income of $100,000. Frank Hummert died at 76 in 1966. Anne Hummert was a multimillionaire when she died July 5, 1996, in her Fifth Avenue apartment at the age of 91. See also *List of radio soaps References *Cox, Jim.

In 2002, Coppa became the first Bonanno made man to turn state's evidence. Biography Coppa was born in Manalapan Township, New Jersey. He graduated from high school and spent a few months in college before dropping out. Coppa lived in New Jersey and Staten Island, but operated his criminal activities on the eastern edge of Bensonhurst and Williamsburg on the corner of Broadway and Kent] in Brooklyn. This area included a low-income municipal housing project called Marlboro Houses, where he eventually became involved in drug trafficking.\\"Born to Steal: When the Mafia Hit Wall Street\\" By Gary Weiss Coppa acquired many assets, including parking garage leases, soft drink vending machine and coin-operated telephone contracts and a chain of rotisserie chicken restaurants. Through his wife and sons, Coppa owned a school bus company named Three Brothers{ My Three Sons, Daniel T and Frezcon}. He used his influence to win a city contract to bus children with disabilities to and from school. Criminal career At age 19, Coppa was arrested for attempted burglary of a clothing store, but did not spend any time in prison. Coppa began his serious criminal career selling stolen watches and furs from transport truck hijackings, grossing $20,000. In Bensonhurst he associated with the Colombo crime family and Genovese crime family before he eventually joined the Bonanno family. He elevated himself from a \\"sidewalk soldier\\" to a shady businessman. Coppa was one of the Bonanno family's biggest mobsters on Wall Street and is credited for practically inventing the pump-and-dump stock scheme. In the early 1970s, Coppa first became involved in stock fraud schemes. Coppa and his associates bought stock in Tucker Drilling, a nearly worthless oil drilling company. Coppa bribed stockbrokers to sell the stock to the public at high prices. For brokers who did not cooperate in the scheme, Coppa employed threats and physical violence. When the stock price reached a high point, Coppa and his associates sold their stock holdings. The remaining investors lost their investments. In 1977, boss Carmine Galante inducted Coppa into the Bonanno family in recognition of his ability to earn money. In 1978, Coppa survived an assassination attempt. As he was entering his Mercedes Benz, at the Bagel Nosh restaurant on Richmond Ave and Victory Blvd on Staten Island, a bomb detonated. Coppa escaped with third degree burns and shrapnel wounds to his face, chest and legs. In 1979, Coppa was convicted for his role in the Tucker Drilling scam but successfully avoided a prison sentence. After undercover FBI agent Donnie Brasco had his assignment ended in July 1981, Dominick Napolitano, who was one of the men responsible for bringing him into the family, on August 17, 1981, Frank Lino and Stefano Canone drove Napolitano to the house of Ronald Filocomo, a Bonanno family associate, for a meeting. Napolitano was greeted by Coppa, then thrown down the stairs to the house's basement by Lino and shot to death.Raab, pp. 617‚Äì620 Napolitano's body was discovered the following year.Crittle, pp. 102‚Äì104 During the 1980s, Coppa was indicted for income tax evasion for not declaring income received from his bus company. In 1992, Coppa was convicted and received several years in prison. In 1994, Coppa was released from prison. By the late 1990s, Massino and Coppa had become close associates. Massino appreciated Coppa because his stock schemes netted large amounts of money for the Bonanno family. During this period, Massino and Coppa went to France with their wives to celebrate Massino's birthday. Coppa paid for the entire trip, which included stays at expensive hotels and meals at classy restaurants. On March 3, 2000, Coppa was indicted on stock fraud charges. From 1993 to 1996, Coppa and other Bonanno associates collaborated with brokers at two defunct stock firms, White Rock Partners and State Street Capital Markets, to drive up the price of some penny stocks. In 2002, Coppa was convicted and sentenced to seven years in federal prison. Government witness In October 2002, having served several months on his recent stock fraud conviction, Coppa was indicted again on racketeering charges of extortion against Barry Weinberg, a Bonanno business associate. To avoid prosecution on his own criminal charges, Weinberg secretly recorded conversations for law enforcement in which Coppa pressed him for extortion payments. Facing charges that would have all but assured he would die in prison if convicted, Coppa decided to become a government witness, later declaring that, \\"I didn't want to do no more time.\\" He became the first member of the Bonanno family to break his blood oath; until then the Bonannos had been the only family to have never had a member turn informer since the Castellammarese War. Coppa's defection precipitated a mass defection of Bonanno leaders to the government, eventually including Massino himself. Coppa testified against Massino. According to Coppa's testimony, the government allowed him to keep $1.7 million in personal assets and a townhouse in Florida.

The (2+2) poset (black Hasse diagram) cannot be part of an interval order: if a is completely right of b, and d overlaps with both a and b, and c is completely right of d, then c must be completely right of b (light gray edge). In mathematics, especially order theory, the interval order for a collection of intervals on the real line is the partial order corresponding to their left- to-right precedence relation‚Äîone interval, I1, being considered less than another, I2, if I1 is completely to the left of I2. More formally, a poset P = (X, \\\\leq) is an interval order if and only if there exists a bijection from X to a set of real intervals, so x_i \\\\mapsto (\\\\ell_i, r_i) , such that for any x_i, x_j \\\\in X we have x_i < x_j in P exactly when r_i < \\\\ell_j . Such posets may be equivalently characterized as those with no induced subposet isomorphic to the pair of two-element chains, in other words as the (2+2)-free posets . The subclass of interval orders obtained by restricting the intervals to those of unit length, so they all have the form (\\\\ell_i, \\\\ell_i + 1), is precisely the semiorders. The complement of the comparability graph of an interval order (X, ‚â§) is the interval graph (X, \\\\cap). Interval orders should not be confused with the interval-containment orders, which are the inclusion orders on intervals on the real line (equivalently, the orders of dimension ‚â§ 2).  Interval orders and dimension  An important parameter of partial orders is order dimension: the dimension of a partial order P is the least number of linear orders whose intersection is P. For interval orders, dimension can be arbitrarily large. And while the problem of determining the dimension of general partial orders is known to be NP-hard, determining the dimension of an interval order remains a problem of unknown computational complexity. A related parameter is interval dimension, which is defined analogously, but in terms of interval orders instead of linear orders. Thus the interval dimension of a partially ordered set P = (X, \\\\leq) is the least integer k for which there exist interval orders \\\\preceq_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\preceq_k on X with x \\\\leq y exactly when x \\\\preceq_1 y, \\\\ldots, and x \\\\preceq_k y. The interval dimension of an order is never greater than its order dimension,.  Combinatorics  In addition to being isomorphic to (2+2)-free posets, unlabeled interval orders on [n] are also in bijection with a subset of fixed- point-free involutions on ordered sets with cardinality 2n . These are the involutions with no so-called left- or right-neighbor nestings where, for any involution f on [2n], a left nesting is an i \\\\in [2n] such that i < i+1 < f(i+1) < f(i) and a right nesting is an i \\\\in [2n] such that f(i) < f(i+1) < i < i+1 . Such involutions, according to semi-length, have ordinary generating function : F(t) = \\\\sum_{n \\\\geq 0} \\\\prod_{i = 1}^n (1-(1-t)^i). The coefficient of t^n in the expansion of F(t) gives the number of unlabeled interval orders of size n. The sequence of these numbers begins :1, 2, 5, 15, 53, 217, 1014, 5335, 31240, 201608, 1422074, 10886503, 89903100, 796713190, 7541889195, 75955177642, ‚Ä¶ Notes References *. *. *. *. *.

Its population continued to increase throughout the nineteenth century. In 1972, a city was built to combat the housing crisis but also to maintain a young population in Naast who tended to emigrate. With the others villages Casteau, Horrues, Chauss√©e-Notre- Dame-Louvignies, Neufvilles, Soignies (town) (Zinnik), and Thieusies, they compose the municipality of Soignies since 1977.  Etymology  For the first time Naast was mentioned in 1119 or 1225. For some it would come from the Germanic \\"Knasque\\" which means soft, wet or swampy ground. For others, this name would come from a Germanic word meaning \\"nearest\\".  History  In the Middle Ages, the lordship of Naast was very important. It passed to count du Hainaut in 1339. In 1830, the industry itself did not exist in Naast, but rather crafts. There was a tuilery, a distillery, two flour mills, three iron marshals, a charron, a cooper, a wooden turret, etc. At the end of the XIX century, agriculture occupied an important place in economic life. The trade in these products had developed mainly thanks to the railway that passed through the village. There was a mustard factory and two quarries for the extraction of blue stone, probably opened in 1897.  Gallery  Image: Naast JPG000.jpg|Naast, The church.

The Sect (Italian title: La Setta) is a 1991 Italian horror film co-written and produced by Dario Argento, directed by Michele Soavi, and starring Kelly Curtis and Herbert Lom. It follows an American schoolteacher living in Frankfurt who finds herself at the center of a plot devised by a Luciferian cult. Plot In 1970 in Southern California, a group of hippies and their children are approached at a desert encampment by Damon, a wayward traveler. They welcome him and serve him a meal. At nightfall, he kills each of them in ritualized murders with the help of several assailants, invoking Lucifer during the killings. In 1991 Frankfurt, Germany, a man named Martin Romero pursues Mary Crane through the city streets before murdering her in her home. When confronted in a U-Bahn station by police, he claims to have been forced to commit the crime before taking a gun and killing himself. Meanwhile, schoolteacher Miriam Kreisl nearly hits an elderly man, Moebius Kelly, with her car, near Seligenstadt. Unaware that he is in fact an elder of a Satanic sect, she invites him to stay at her home. While she sleeps, he releases a beetle on her body which crawls into her nose. After, Miriam is woken by a disturbing nightmare, and finds Moebius unable to breathe. She leaves the house to retrieve a doctor; meanwhile, Moebius, having faked his condition, ventures into a secret tunnel leading to caverns beneath Miriam's home‚Äîa place she is unaware of‚Äîand performs a Satanic ritual. Miriam returns with Dr. Franz Pernath, and the two discover the open passageway. In a chamber, they find Moebius's dead body with a shroud over his face. Police remove his body, and the event leaves Miriam rattled. Alone at the house, Miriam's pet rabbit enters the underground chamber, forcing her to chase after it. She discovers a woman hiding in the chamber who has stolen one of her nylon stockings. She fights with the woman and demands to know how she got there, but the woman flees the house into the night. The following day, Claire Heinz, the mother of one of Miriam's students, goes missing. When Miriam brings Claire's daughter home, she speaks with Mr. Heinz, who informs her that Claire, an entomologist, had recently discovered an extinct species of beetles from 10,000 years ago. While viewing an illustration of the beetle, Miriam is inexplicably overwhelmed and loses consciousness. Later, at Miriam's house, her friend Kathryn is attacked by a malevolent force, and flees in terror. After, Miriam receives a mysterious phone call from Moebius. Later, at a truck stop, Kathryn uncharacteristically propositions a man for sex. During the liaison, she brandishes a butcher knife. When the man's friends come to look for him, they discover him hysterically stabbing Kathryn; he claims he was \\"only doing what she wanted.\\" Doctors attempt to revive Kathryn in the hospital, but she dies on the operating table. The surgeon informs Miriam that during a moment of lucidity, Kathryn begged to see her. Miriam is allowed into the operating room to view Kathryn's body, which inexplicably comes to life. She attacks Miriam before slitting her own throat, and collapses, dead. The surgeon explains it as a potential case of catalepsy, but Miriam is no less disturbed. To prove that Moebius is dead, Franz ventures to the hospital's mausoleum to uncover his body, but finds it has disappeared. Simultaneously, the surgeon who operated on Kathryn brings Claire, drugged, to Damon and other members of the sect in the woods near Miriam's home. While Miriam sleeps, Franz explores the underground chamber, and finds a tunnel in a well that leads outside to the woods, where Damon and the others are performing a ritual on Claire's body. He disrupts the ritual, and is chased by the sect. Miriam awakens shortly after, and finds Franz under the spell of the sect, attempting to kill her. She flees in her car, but accidentally crashes, and is forced to return to her house on foot. Franz is left at the car, which is profusely leaking gasoline, ending in an explosion which kills him. At the home, Miriam is confronted by Moebius, who explains to her that the sect has, unbeknownst to her, guided and orchestrated her life to fit their master plan: she will give birth to the Antichrist. The sect impregnates Miriam in the well, and in a dilation of time, she births the child. When Moebius hands her her son, Miriam flees, and leaps into the fire caused by the car accident. At dawn, firemen extinguish the flames, and Miriam emerges unscathed, her child having sacrificed himself to protect her. Cast Release The Devil's Daughter was releaed in Italy in early 1991. The film was shown under the title The Sect at the 1991 Toronto Festival of Festivals as part of their Midnight Madness screening.

It is specifically designed to measure resistors that are constructed as four terminal resistors. Background Resistors above about 1 ohm in value can be measured using a variety of techniques, such as an ohmmeter or by using a Wheatstone bridge. In such resistors, the resistance of the connecting wires or terminals is negligible compared to the resistance value. For resistors of less than an ohm, the resistance of the connecting wires or terminals becomes significant, and conventional measurement techniques will include them in the result. Symbol for four terminal resistor To overcome the problems of these undesirable resistances (known as 'parasitic resistance'), very low value resistors and particularly precision resistors and high current ammeter shunts are constructed as four terminal resistors. These resistances have a pair of current terminals and a pair of potential or voltage terminals. In use, a current is passed between the current terminals, but the volt drop across the resistor is measured at the potential terminals. The volt drop measured will be entirely due to the resistor itself as the parasitic resistance of the leads carrying the current to and from the resistor are not included in the potential circuit. To measure such resistances requires a bridge circuit designed to work with four terminal resistances. That bridge is the Kelvin bridge. Principle of operation Circuit diagram of Kelvin bridge A commercial Kelvin Bridge The operation of the Kelvin bridge is very similar to the Wheatstone bridge, but uses two additional resistors. Resistors R1 and R2 are connected to the outside potential terminals of the four terminal known or standard resistor Rs and the unknown resistor Rx (identified as P1 and P‚Ä≤1 in the diagram). The resistors Rs, Rx, R1 and R2 are essentially a Wheatstone bridge. In this arrangement, the parasitic resistance of the upper part of Rs and the lower part of Rx is outside of the potential measuring part of the bridge and therefore are not included in the measurement. However, the link between Rs and Rx (Rpar) is included in the potential measurement part of the circuit and therefore can affect the accuracy of the result. To overcome this, a second pair of resistors R‚Ä≤1 and R‚Ä≤2 form a second pair of arms of the bridge (hence 'double bridge') and are connected to the inner potential terminals of Rs and Rx (identified as P2 and P‚Ä≤2 in the diagram). The detector D is connected between the junction of R1 and R2 and the junction of R‚Ä≤1 and R‚Ä≤2.All About Circuits The balance equation of this bridge is given by the equation :\\\\frac{R_x}{R_s}=\\\\frac{R_2}{R_1}+\\\\frac{R_\\\\text{par}}{R_s} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{R'_1}{R'_1+R'_2+R_\\\\text{par}} \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{R_2}{R_1}-\\\\frac{R'_2}{R'_1} \\\\right) In a practical bridge circuit, the ratio of R‚Ä≤1 to R‚Ä≤2 is arranged to be the same as the ratio of R1 to R2 (and in most designs, R1 = R‚Ä≤1 and R2 = R‚Ä≤2). As a result, the last term of the above equation becomes zero and the balance equation becomes : \\\\frac{R_x}{R_s}=\\\\frac{R_2}{R_1} Rearranging to make Rx the subject : R_x=R_2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{R_s}{R_1} The parasitic resistance Rpar has been eliminated from the balance equation and its presence does not affect the measurement result. This equation is the same as for the functionally equivalent Wheatstone bridge. In practical use the magnitude of the supply B, can be arranged to provide current through Rs and Rx at or close to the rated operating currents of the smaller rated resistor. This contributes to smaller errors in measurement. This current does not flow through the measuring bridge itself. This bridge can also be used to measure resistors of the more conventional two terminal design. The bridge potential connections are merely connected as close to the resistor terminals as possible. Any measurement will then exclude all circuit resistance not within the two potential connections. Accuracy The accuracy of measurements made using this bridge are dependent on a number of factors. The accuracy of the standard resistor (Rs) is of prime importance. Also of importance is how close the ratio of R1 to R2 is to the ratio of R‚Ä≤1 to R‚Ä≤2. As shown above, if the ratio is exactly the same, the error caused by the parasitic resistance (Rpar) is completely eliminated. In a practical bridge, the aim is to make this ratio as close as possible, but it is not possible to make it exactly the same. If the difference in ratio is small enough, then the last term of the balance equation above becomes small enough that it is negligible. Measurement accuracy is also increased by setting the current flowing through Rs and Rx to be as large as the rating of those resistors allows. This gives the greatest potential difference between the innermost potential connections (R2 and R‚Ä≤2) to those resistors and consequently sufficient voltage for the change in R‚Ä≤1 and R‚Ä≤2 to have its greatest effect. There are some commercial bridges reaching accuracies of better than 2% for resistance ranges from 1 microohm to 25 ohms. One such type is illustrated above. Laboratory bridges are usually constructed with high accuracy variable resistors in the two potential arms of the bridge and achieve accuracies suitable for calibrating standard resistors. In such an application, the 'standard' resistor (Rs) will in reality be a sub-standard type (that is a resistor having an accuracy some 10 times better than the required accuracy of the standard resistor being calibrated). For such use, the error introduced by the mis-match of the ratio in the two potential arms would mean that the presence of the parasitic resistance Rpar could have a significant impact on the very high accuracy required. To minimise this problem, the current connections to the standard resistor (Rx); the sub- standard resistor (Rs) and the connection between them (Rpar) are designed to have as low a resistance as possible, and the connections both in the resistors and the bridge more resemble bus bars rather than wire. Some ohmmeters include Kelvin bridges in order to obtain large measurement ranges. Instruments for measuring sub-ohm values are often referred to as low- resistance ohmmeters, milli-ohmmeters, micro-ohmmeters, etc. References Further reading * External links * DC Metering Circuits chapter from Lessons In Electric Circuits Vol 1 DC free ebook and Lessons In Electric Circuits series. * Discussion of 4 terminal measurement and ohmmeters in general. * Discussion of 4 terminal measurement.

At the time of its introduction in late 2007, it was noted for its combination of a lightweight, Linux-based operating system, solid- state drive (SSD), and relatively low cost. Newer models added the options of Microsoft Windows operating system and rotating media hard disk drives (HDD), and initially retailed for up to 500 euros. The first Eee PC was a milestone in the personal computer business, launching the netbook category of small, low-cost laptops in the West (in Japan, subnotebooks had long been a staple in computing). According to Asus, the name Eee derives from \\"the three Es\\", an abbreviation of its advertising slogan for the device: \\"Easy to learn, Easy to work, Easy to play\\". In January 2013, Asus officially ended production of their Eee PC series, citing declining sales due to consumers favoring tablets and Ultrabooks over netbooks. However, they subsequently restarted the line with the release of the EeeBook series in 2015.  History   Eee 700 series  SD card reader, two USB ports, the VGA output and the Kensington Security Slot Asus announced two Eee PC models at Computex Taipei 2007: the 701 and the 1001. The 701 base model Eee PC 4G was released on 16 October 2007 in Taiwan. Three additional models followed. Both the price and the size of the device are small in comparison with similar Ultra-Mobile PCs. The Eee series is a response to the XO-1 notebook from the One Laptop per Child initiative. At the Intel Developer Forum 2007, Asus demonstrated the Classmate PC and the Eee PC, and listed specifications for four models of the Eee PC. In some countries, the products have the marketing names EeePC 8G, 4G, 4G Surf, and 2G Surf, though in other countries the machines are still designated by the model numbers 700 and 701. The 4G Surf uses socketed RAM but some revisions do not have a door to access the slot. Asus released a version of the Eee PC with Microsoft Windows XP pre-installed in January 2008. In Japan, the version is known as the 4G-X. Some early 700-series models drained the battery approximately 10% per day when the unit was completely powered off and not plugged in, thus emptying the battery even when not in use.  Modding  Some users of the 701 physically modified the machine to replace the 4 GB solid state drive. The 8 GB versions of the 700 series leave the SSD area on the motherboard empty and connect their SSD as an internal PCI Express Mini Card. Replacing the SSD requires only an SSD compatible with the connector. The SSD area on the motherboard may also be used to install other devices, accommodate physically larger SSDs, or even hard-solder an SSD salvaged from a 2 GB or 4 GB 700 model. As this requires only soldering on a new device without removing an old one, the risk of doing so may be acceptable to some users.  Eee 900 series  White 900 series The Eee 900 series was launched in Hong Kong on 16 April 2008, and in the UK on 1 May 2008 for ¬£329 (approximately 410 ‚Ç¨ or 650 US$ including VAT). It was launched in the US on 12 May 2008. The Eee 900 series dimensions are a little larger than the 70x models‚Äìmeasuring 225 √ó 165 √ó 35 mm (WxDxH) (8.8\\" √ó 6.5\\" √ó 1.4\\") and weighing around 1 kg (2.2 lb). The machine has a multi-touch trackpad allowing two- finger scroll and zoom via a \\"pinch\\" gesture, and is available with Linux and/or MS Windows XP configurations, depending on the market. The Intel Atom version is named the EeePC 900a and comes with an 8GB or 16 GB SSD. Some of these Eee PCs also have a 4 GB SSD installed similarly to that in the 701 for a total storage space of 20GB. Those that do not are named the Asus EEE 900 16G. The MS Windows XP version is named the EeePC 900 Win and also comes in two versions: one with a total storage of 12 GB (one 4 GB SSD and one 8 GB SSD) and one with 16 GB (on a single SSD). The Linux 20G version is sold for the same price as the MS Windows 12G version. In the case of the 16G EEEs, the MS Windows version costs more than the Linux version. The Windows version comes with Microsoft Works and Windows Live Suite preinstalled. It also includes StarSuite 8. The machines are otherwise identical to each other with 1 GB of RAM, an 8.9-inch (226 mm) 1024√ó600 LCD and a 1.3-megapixel webcam. This model has the same Intel Celeron CPU as the Eee PC 700, running at its full 900 MHz clock speed (rather than the 630 MHz speed seen in the Eee PC 700).  Other Eee 90x models  On 3 June 2008, Asus unveiled the Eee 901 at Computex Taipei. It was a revision of the 900 series with a different chassis. The 901 features an Intel Atom Diamondville CPU clocked at 1.6 GHz, an \\"expanded\\" battery (listed as 6-cell), and \\"Super Hybrid Engine\\" software for power management which will provide a battery life of 4.2-7.8 hours. Bluetooth and 802.11n Wi-Fi are also included. The 901 uses the Intel 945GME chipset, meeting the requirements for MS Windows Vista or 7 Aero. The 901 is otherwise similar to the 900, shipping in Linux or MS Windows XP configurations with flash memory storage of different sizes. It was discovered that the Eee 901 has capacity for a \\"3GCard\\" upgrade. The Eee PC 900D has 8GB flash memory and Windows XP preinstalled. The Eee PC 904HD was one of the first Eee PC models which features an 80 GB HDD instead of an SSD. It features an Intel Celeron M running at 900 MHz and gets power from a 6-cell battery. Like other Eee PC 90x models, it features 802.11 b/g WLAN and a 1.3M pixel webcam. MS Windows XP comes pre-installed. The Eee PC 904HA's dimensions are 266 mm(W) √ó 191.2 mm(D) √ó 28.5 mm~ 38 mm(H). The 8.9-inch screen has a native resolution size of 1024√ó600 pixels (WSVGA). The CPU is an Intel Atom N270 @ 1.6 GHz, and the standard model came with 1 GB DDR2 RAM occupying the single memory slot. The 160 GB Hard Disk Drive had Microsoft Windows XP Home pre- installed. Also standard are the 6-cell battery, the 1.3M pixel webcam and integrated microphone, and both ethernet and Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g network connections. The Eee PC 900A features almost the same specs as the Eee PC 901 (except the primary SSD, Bluetooth, 1.3M pixel webcam and the 6-cell battery, that has been replaced by a 4-cell battery), but in a case nearly the same as used in the Eee PC 900 model. On 17 June 2009, Asus released the Disney Netpal (Eee PC MK90), which is similar to the Eee 90x models.  Battery controversy  There was some controversy regarding the battery supplied with the EeePC 900. Versions pre-released to many non-UK journalists and reviewers were equipped with a 5800 mAh battery, but the first retail versions in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and Singapore were shipped with a smaller, 4400 mAh (76% of that capacity) battery, which commentators note has led to a great variation in the machine's battery life in reviews, in some cases as much as 90 minutes. As a result of the objections to this, Asus provided a free battery replacement program in Hong Kong and Singapore, and ran a paid- for battery exchange program in the UK. Asus has stated that the smaller battery is \\"presently the standard battery supplied in the UK\\" and \\"the default standard battery pack for Asus Eee PC 900 worldwide\\". Asus provided a battery exchange to all UK Eee PC 900 customers for ¬£10, and released a firmware update which claimed to extend battery life by 30 minutes (\\"BIOS 0601: Updated all battery discharge tables to extend battery life\\"). In Australia and Italy, the situation was reversed: Reviewers received EeePC 900 systems fitted with the 4400 mAh battery but the retail models were equipped with the 5800 mAh battery. Customers of Media Markt in Italy received the EeePC 900 at the beginning of sales (May/June) with a 5800 mAh battery and later (June/July) with a 4400 mAh battery. Best Buy's custom variants of the 1000HD and 900A also both include a 4400 mAh battery. Part of the above problem extends from the fact that the entire range was substantially more successful than Asus had originally anticipated. Currently, Asus has several large complexes scattered throughout Taiwan and China, with the largest in the city of Suzhou (China), being the size of eight football fields. Upon the unexpected success of the range, Asus factories worked around the clock to keep up supply and further development. Consequently, even within Asus testing labs in Taipei, many variations were found within test models. Generally, however, Asus does inform reviewers that the final retail model may contain different features from those offered in the review model.  Eee PC 1000 series  Black 1000 series; 1000HD model shown The 1000 series launched at Computex Taipei on 3 June 2008. It featured a new 10-inch (254 mm) screen and a 1.6 GHz Intel Atom CPU, although built-in power management software can increase the speed to 1.7 GHz. The 1000 model ships with Linux, an 8 GB SSD and a 32 GB SSD (totalling 40 GB); the 1000H model ships with Windows XP Home or Linux and an 80 or 160 GB SATA HDD. Both the 1000 and the 1000H support up to 2 GB of DDR2 RAM of 667 MHz clock speed. The 1000 has a rated battery life of 4.2‚Äì7.5 hours, while the 1000H is rated for 3.2‚Äì7 hours. It also offers a keyboard that is 92% the size of generic notebooks, aiming to make it more comfortable to type. Like the Eee PC 901, the new machines feature 802.11n Wi- Fi and Bluetooth. WiMAX is not currently supported. The 1000HD (released in September 2008) is a slightly cheaper version of the 1000 series. It features the same specifications as the 1000H, except it uses a 900 MHz Celeron CPU chip. The 1000HA (released in October 2008) also costs less than the 1000H, but has the same Intel Atom 1.6 GHz CPU, a 160 GB HDD, and 1 GB of RAM. It also has wireless and on some models, Bluetooth. The 1000XPH has the same Intel Atom 1.6 GHz CPU, an 80 GB HDD, and 1 GB of RAM. Other amenities include 10/100 LAN and 802.11 b/g Wireless LAN adapters, an integrated webcam, but no Bluetooth. The 1000HG features a Huawei 3G-Modem. In February 2009, Asus unveiled the 1000HE, using the new Intel Atom 280 processor, with a 10-inch LED-lit display at 1024x600 physical but 1024x768 virtual, 6-cell battery with an advertised 9.5 hours of battery life, 160 GB HDD running at 5400RPM, Bluetooth, 802.11n wireless networking, 1.3-megapixel camera, and revised keyboard similar to Apple's keyboards. Although the screen resolution on the 1000 series is 1024x600, it has pixel mapping (memory addressing) which covers a virtual 1024x768 desktop. One could choose with a simple Fn key combination what graphics mode to operate in: either 800x600, 1024x600 (native resolution), virtual 1024x768 compressed (vertically compressed into 600 space), and 1024x768 with panning. The latter mode would display only 660 vertical pixels at a time, but as the pointer approached the top or bottom of the screen the display content would shift the \\"hidden\\" pixels into view to better display certain websites. It also freed more screen real estate for other tasks, such as web browsing or office applications, by allowing the user to move some things, like the top empty grey window frame area (otherwise wasted) off-screen. A similar panning effect can be achieved on other Linux systems using xrandr. Asus 1005HA-V, with \\"seashell\\" design; the screen hinges to sit behind the base At CeBIT 2009, Asus unveiled the 10-inch EEE 1008HA, introducing the new design concept \\"Seashell\\". The 1005HA comes in three models. From least to most expensive, they are the 1005HA-B, the 1005HA-V and the 1005HA-P. The 1005HA-B has a removable 3-cell battery with a rated 4-hour life per charge, a 1.3-megapixel camera, and uses the N270 processor. At the higher end, the 1005HA-P has a removable 6-cell, 5600 mAh, 63 W/h battery with rated 10.5 hour battery life, a 1.3-megapixel camera and uses the N280 processor. There is also a 1005HA-H model, sold in Poland, equipped with a 6-cell battery, an N270 processor and a 0.3-megapixel camera. Asus officially announced the first Eee with Nvidia Ion graphics, the 1201N, on 19 November 2009, later replaced by the 1201PN and 1201NLand then 1215N, with a more powerful Atom D525 dual-core processor and Ion 2 graphics. The 1215 series then saw the release of the 1215B, which came with an E-450/E-350/C30/C50/C60 processor, a \\"Zacate\\" APU. The 1215B has USB 3.0 ports, as well as a CPU and BIOS that support full hardware virtualization in both Linux (via KVM, Xen, VirtualBox, VMware) and Windows (via XP mode, VirtualBox, VMware). The 1215B is the first of the Eee PC line of computers that supports virtualization. The 1215B was subsequently replaced by the upgraded 1225B, which replaced the E350 APU of the previous model with the E-450 APU which provides a minor speed bump to the CPU and turbocore for the GPU. Eee 1025c and 1025ce These were released in 2012 and described as the last in the line of the Asus Eee PC series. With only 1 GB memory, standard USB2 ports and sluggish performance, these were not especially notable releases other than for their exceptional battery life. Other reported problems are the lack of a hatch to access the memory, so RAM cannot be upgraded without breaking open the case; also, there is a single mono speaker rather than dual stereo speakers. Eee 1015 series In 2013 Asus restarted the Eee PC series with the 1015E models, some of which are on Windows 8 and some on Ubuntu Linux. These come with 2 GB memory and USB3 ports. The 1015E fixes some of the problems with the 1025C by using a faster processor, 2GB memory and stereo speakers. The RAM is soldered in place and cannot be upgraded. Due to improved performance, the battery life is shorter than that of the 1025 series. It is possible to reduce the processor clock speed to increase battery life.  EeeBook  Further Information: Asus EeeBook In 2014 Asus relaunched the Eee PC with the EeeBook lineup of computers, starting with the X205TA model. By 2017 the EeeBook lineup was succeeded by the Asus VivoBook E Series. Some EeeBook laptops were rebranded to VivoBook E Series laptops; the EeeBook E202 was rebranded to the VivoBook E202, ending the EeeBook lineup again. The EeeBook lineup consists of the E202 (E202SA), E502 (E502SA and E502MA) and X205 (X205TA).  Hardware  Asus Eee PC 701, with fountain pen for scale, running Ubuntu Netbook Edition Rechargeable CMOS battery Asus Eee PC series models 1005ha, 1005hab, 1008ha, and others use Varta ML1220 or equivalent Maxell, Sanyo and Panasonic ML1220 lithium ion coin cell rechargeable batteries, terminated with a two-pin Molex connector plug.  Processor  Eee PC models have typically used netbook specific processors or ultra-low voltage versions of mainstream processors. The earliest Eee PC models used a 900 MHz Intel Celeron M processor underclocked to 630 MHz. Later models shipped with Intel Atom and AMD Fusion processors.  Display  The Eee PC 700 has an 800√ó480 pixel, 7 inch (178 mm) display, measured diagonally. The screen does not cover the entire space within the lid; instead it is flanked on the sides by stereo speakers, and above by the (optional) camera in the trim at the top. The Eee PC 900 and 901 come with a 1024√ó600 pixel 8.9-inch (226 mm) display, almost filling the lid. Later models came with 10 inch to 12.1 inch displays and up to 1366√ó768 resolution. With all models, an external display can be supported through a standard VGA connector. On some early models this connector lacks the screws to secure it to the Eee PC, which some consider a safety precaution. The manufacturer does not give any specifications on maximum resolution and display configuration (mirroring, extended desktop), but most models can handle an external display at native resolution of 1440√ó1050, and even 1600√ó900, although performance starts to slow down. Models that ship with Xandros do not have access to the full capacity of the external VGA output by default, allowing only 'mirroring'. Users must reconfigure their xorg.conf file, or install a more recent OS to allow the higher resolution output. Asus Eee PC 1215P Seashell with Intel dual-core cpu (N 570) and a 12.1\\" HD display The EEE PC900 has a tendency for the display to fail with black blobs due to air leakage. This is repairable but depending on exact replacement unit sometimes needs the eight-pin EEPROM moved from the old display to the new one, and a single track linked to regain picture and brightness control after the new one is fitted.  Keyboard  On a normal, full size computer keyboard, the 10 keys Q‚ÄìP measure 190 mm (7.48 in). The 700 and 900 series are equipped with similar keyboards, 82% of the size of a generic one, meaning that the Q‚ÄìP keys measure 155 mm (6.10 in). The 1000 series, as it fits in a more spacious case, has 92% of a full size keyboard, where the Q‚ÄìP keys measure 175 mm (6.89 in). Some Eee PC lines such as the 1000HE and 1215s uses the island-style keyboard, similar to keyboards used in Apple computers and Sony's VAIO series, where the keys are reminiscent of Scrabble tiles, being spaced apart and raised from the surface below.  Storage  Removable 8 GB SSD in Eee PC The early model Eee PCs use a solid-state drive for storage (instead of a hard drive), which consumes less power when in use, allows the device to boot faster, generates no noise, and is less susceptible to mechanical shock damage than hard drives. A downside of SSD storage (flash memory) is that an individual sector can be written only about 200,000 times. This problem can be partially mitigated by intelligent wear leveling, resulting in a MTBF similar to conventional platter-based hard drives. The SSDs used in early Eee PCs also had extremely poor random write performance; the S101 does not have this problem. In the 2 GB and 4 GB models of the 700 series of the Eee PC, the SSD is permanently soldered to the board. In the 8 GB model, the SSD is a card connected via the internal PCI Express Mini Card connector, leaving the original SSD area on the motherboard empty. The Eee PC 900 comes with a removable PCI Express Mini SSD module, with or without four additional 1 GB memory chips soldered on the main board. Different models come with different-sized SSDs. One Linux version has 4 GB, a MS Windows XP version has 8 GB, and all remaining ones, MS Windows XP or Linux, have 16 GB. The Eee PC 1000 contains a fast 8 GB internal SSD and a slower 32 GB internal flash drive. Some models, such as the 1000H and 904HD, do not have a SSD, and instead have a SATA internal hard drive of either 80 or 160 GB, which can be upgraded by the user. All Eee PC models also include a memory card reader, supporting SD, SDHC and MMC cards for additional storage, while the Eee PC S101 also has support for Memorystick and MS-PRO. Eee PC 1004DN is the first model with a Super-Multi optical disc drive (ODD) that reads and writes data to DVD or compact disc.  Memory  Most early Eee PCs use 533/667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM via a standard SO-DIMM module, which can be swapped out. The 700 and 701SDX have RAM soldered to the motherboard. Other models (like the white 4GS-W010) lacked memory access panels and required disassembly to upgrade memory. Later models, such as the black model EEEPC 4G SURF (4GS-PK008), and newer white models (4GS-W010), have a removable panel on the underside that allows the user to change the RAM without fully disassembling the system. Asus reverted to soldering RAM directly onto the mainboard in their later releases of the Eee PC range. The Asus technical data for the 1025c and 1025ce models is seen as erroneous by certain online retailers offering RAM upgrades.  Cooling  In an EE380 talk,video archive an Asus engineer mentioned that the Eee PC uses the keyboard shielding as a heat sink to absorb the heat generated by the processor. Three chips need heatsinking, and this is achieved by heat- conductive adhesive pads which sit between the chip heatsink flats and the keyboard shield and connect them thermally. It is important to ensure that the heatsink pads are replaced correctly after maintenance such as cleaning or replacing the fan. The Eee PC has a fan and vents to cool off the system.  Operating systems (software user environment)  Most Eee PC models were shipped with either Windows XP or a Linux distribution called Xandros. Later models (e.g. 1015E) ship with Windows 7 Starter or Linux Ubuntu installed. Users have tried to install various other operating systems on Eee PCs. The following are known to work on most models: * Linux, especially Lubuntu, Debian, Salix, SliTaz, PepperMint <6, Bodhi 4.x, and other Linuxes still available in 32bit and employing an interface (environment) with a small memory-footprint * Chrome OS and Android x86 * Mac OS X: v10.4, v10.5 and v10.6 * Microsoft Windows XP * EasyPeasy Linux (custom for the eeePC, now discontinued but still available for download) * Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 and 10 Some of the above operating systems, while they may have been available, and some barely worked sluggishly, are no longer up to date. Some have even been discontinued or now only offer 64bit versions which are not compatible with the eeePC series.

Configurations  The 700 series units were shipped in three colors besides black and white. EeePC in its case Naming of the 700 series of models of the device appears to relate to the size of installed SSD, camera, and battery size. The Eee PC Surf models include the 4400 mAh battery pack and no webcam, while the non-Surf models have the 5200 mAh battery pack and a webcam installed. The model numbers (700, 701) may still be the same as has been seen on pre-production samples. Asus may offer upgrades for the SSD storage via the empty Mini PCIe slot, which has been shown to be labeled FLASH_CON in take-apart photos of the 4G. When a Mini PCIe card is inserted into the spare empty slot, the internal SSD is disabled, making the device unable to boot from the original SSD. There are also signal lines for a USB port on the Mini PCIe pins which have been used to connect various USB devices internally. Some 701 models with serial numbers starting at 7B do not have a second mini PCIe slot soldered onto the motherboard, though the circuit traces and solder pads remain. In the 70x series, the pre-installed Xandros operating system has a Linux kernel with a kernel option set limiting the detected RAM size to a maximum of 1 GB, even if a larger RAM module is installed. The actual capacity is shown in full in the BIOS setup and under other OSes. However, it is possible to recompile the kernel with support for more RAM. The 900 and later laptops had the kernel pre-configured to support up to 4 GB of memory address space.  Fanbase and Continued Use  The ASUS Eee PC series of netbooks still attract a small crowd of people who need an affordable, lightweight and tiny netbook for traveling. Due to their lack of powerful processors and modern compatibility, however, they are nearing little to no use today due to being replaced by Chromebooks and other cheaper alternatives.

It is most commonly a bacterial infection, although bacterial culture may be negative. Often referred to as fat/big leg disease, it is sometimes known as weed or Monday morning disease (not to be confused with the more common usage of MMD referring to exertional rhabdomyolysis or azoturia). This article refers mainly to sporadic lymphangitis. Ulcerative lymphangitis is referred to in passing, as it is managed in a similar manner. Epizootic lymphangitis is similar to glanders, but caused by the fungus Histoplasma farciminosum.OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2004 Chapter 2.5.13, Causes Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis has been cultured from some cases (particularly of ulcerative lymphangitis; however, in others, bacterial culture is negative. This may be because: * a) The micro-organism responsible is difficult to culture (e.g. many Mycoplasma species). * b) The organism has been effectively eliminated by the immune system and the pathology is due to an excessive immune response after the organism has been cleared. * c) The organism is not a bacterium but a fungus, so is very difficult to culture. * d) The disease has another cause. Of these, a) is thought to be the most likely, and d) the most improbable. Clinical signs Extreme swelling of a limb, usually a hind limb, is seen, often as far proximally as the hock, or occasionally as far proximally as the stifle. In some cases, swelling continues through the udder or sheath and along the subcutaneous abdominal veins. In the early stages, the swelling is primarily a \\"pitting oedema\\"; in other words, if pressed, a depression remains in the skin of the limb. The affected leg may reach twice or even three times its normal size, and may be very sensitive to the touch. In chronic cases, much of the swelling is firm, as scarring and fibrosis occur. Lymphangitis is commonly associated with a wound, which may be very minor. This is a likely entrance for bacterial access to the lymph ducts. The degree of lameness is variable, but may be sufficient to give the impression of a fracture. The horse may or may not be pyrexic (fevered). The limb may occasionally ooze serum. In ulcerative lumphangitis, \\"cording\\" of the lymphatics and the formation of hard nodules and abscesses may also occur; occasionally, a greenish, malodorous discharge is present. In the US in particular, the disease may be characterised by multiple small, open sores.. RR Pascoe, DC Knottenbelt, Manual of Equine Dermatology Published 1999, Elsevier Health Sciences (p. 109) Diagnostics Radiography and ultrasonography are often used to rule out the differential diagnoses of a fracture or tendinitis. Ultrasonography can also help to define boundaries of abscess pockets. Aspiration of a fluid sample for microbial culture is worth trying, but is often unrewarding. Treatment The mainstays of treatment are the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics (typically potentiated sulfonamides or penicillin and streptomycin, but doxycycline may be the most effective). If possible, microbial culture and sensitivity testing should be performed, so the most efficacious antibiotic can be chosen. However, intracellular organisms such as Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis will be susceptible to certain antibiotics in vitro that are not effective for the specific organism in the horse. These horses are typically treated with rifampin in addition to one of the previously mentioned antibiotics. In addition, anti-inflammatories are important, to reduce the swelling and pain of the inflammatory response. NSAIDs are commonly used (flunixin is the drug of choice, but phenylbutazone may also be used). Corticosteroids are sometimes used in severe cases, but should be used with caution due to their potential to weaken the immune response to infection, and the possibility of inducing laminitis. In ulcerative lymphangitis, intravenous iodine salts may also be used; and abscesses should be poulticed or lanced. Ideally, an abscess should only be lanced after it has matured well and has an obvious soft spot, or the procedure should be guided with ultrasound to find the best site for drainage that avoids important structures.RJ Rose & DR Hodgson, Manual of Equine Practice Copyright WB Saunders (2000). (p. 180) Physical therapy is also important, particularly maintaining movement by walking out and massage to improve lymphatic drainage and reduce the oedema. Bandages may also be useful, as may cold hosing in the initial phase. A sweat bandage or poultice is often applied. An overly tight bandage should not be applied, as swelling may continue, decreasing circulation through the limb, and potentially causing a bandage-bow. After-care often is advised to include consistent turnout and exercise. Outcome The initial pain and lameness usually respond rapidly to treatment, but the swelling may persist for many weeks. In addition, once a horse has had an episode, it appears to be predisposed to recurrence, and may suffer from \\"filled legs\\" permanently ‚Äì i.e. if left in a stable and relatively immobile, poor lymphatic circulation results in a passive oedema of the previously affected limb, that dissipates on exercise. In more severe cases, the limb may never return to normal size. In these cases, permanent scarring of the lymphatics and other tissues is likely. Treatment in these cases is unrewarding, and euthanasia may be indicated if the condition causes unmanageable lameness.

She was educated at home and interested in poetry from an early age. She became a widow when she was still young and became the principal of Xunxi Girls' School. Both she and her sister Xu Yunhua were part of the South Association. In 1906, she hired Qiu Jin, an anti-Qing Empire revolutionary and poet, as an assistant. They quickly became close friends. Together with Qiu Jin, Xu Zihua started the magazine Chinese Women's News, which published about issues that were at the time considered radical feminist, such as self-education, child education, Western-style healthcare, and economic self-sufficiency. Both Wu Zhiying and Xu Zihua contributed to Qiu Jin a lot on her road of feminism, and at the same time they were also affected by Qiu Jin's ideas about equality between men and women. Qiu Jin was executed in 1907. Four months after her execution, Wu Zhiying send a message to Xu Zihua to discuss the process of Qiu Jin's wish to be buried in Xiling and to help arrange her funeral. Several thousand people came and it turned into a public protest. Both Xu Zihua and the other chief mourner, Wu Zhiying, were on the Qing government's wanted list. Still, Xu Zihua continued to compose poems and essays in Qiu Jin's memory. During this process, her daughter became ill with Diphtheria. The tragedy Xu Zihua encountered greatly affected her health in both body and spirit. Her life after meeting Qiu Jin was dedicated to the revolutionary cause and to writing poetry about ideology and about parting with her daughter and her best friend Qiu Jin. Her poetry is collected in Xu Zihua shiwen ji. Dec. 9th, 1912, after reconstructs of the Fengyuting, Xu Zihua requests of revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen to give condolence to Qiu Jin's grave and write her a brief couplet to compliment her heroic deeds. Xu Zihua died in 1935, leaving one surviving son, Mei Xin.

The neighborhood straddles the Amtrak railroad lines, which lies just east of and parallel to the Post Road (US Route 1). Its boundaries are Neptune Street to the North, Alger Avenue to the South, Post Road to the West, and Greenwich Bay to the East. Chepiwanoxet Way, an underpass beneath the Amtrak lines, now serves as the only street access in and out of the neighborhood. Native Americans, who fished its island and shores, named this area between Post Road and Greenwich Bay \\"Chepiwanoxet.\\" Settled as a colonial farm in early 18th century, it became a beach resort with hotel and shore dinner hall after the Chepiwanoxet railroad station opened in around 1837. Small lots were sold for summer cottages to upstate residents and for homes to workers in Cowesett hill estates in late 19th century. Before World War I, the Gallaudet Corporation built a causeway to the island for its seaplane factory, with many workers living here. The Chepiwanoxet entrance sign states that Warwick bought the island in 1994 for a city park. Name Chepiwanoxet, known also in earlier sources as Chepinoxet, is a Narragansett word. It may be derived from chepi 'separated,' -wan (particle) -ok 'little' -sett 'place', meaning perhaps 'Little Separated Place,' or possibly 'Little Place at the Northeast,' compare chepew√©ssin 'northeast wind.'Francis Joseph O'Brien, Jr. (Moondancer) and Julianne Jennings (Strong Woman), An Introduction to the Narragansett Language: A Study of Roger Williams' A Key into the Language of America.

Chepiwanoxet History (not yet published) Geology Chepiwanoxet is underlaid by sedimentary rocks of the Coal Age (Pennsylvanian period, about 300 million years old). This rock formation is long, extending from Hanover, Massachusetts, south to the mouth of Narragansett Bay, and wide from Providence to Fall River. It underlies the entire Narragansett Bay, including the Providence River, Greenwich Bay, Fall River, the Sakonnet River, plus both East and West passages out to the ocean. Chepiwanoxet and East Greenwich are just inside the western edge of the Rhode Island formation. The new Bedrock Geologic Map of Rhode Island gives more details of what underlies the unconsolidated surface material. Chepiwanoxet sits atop the western edge of the Rhode Island Formation of the stratified Narragansett Bay Group of the Pennsylvanian period (between 323 and 290 million years ago). The Narragansett Bay Group rocks are part of the Esmond-Dedham subterrane of the Southeastern New England Avalon zone. Uphill from the Post Road (US Route 1) is the boundary between the Rhode Island Formation and the older Scituate Igneous Suite (granite and diorite/gabbro rock) of the Devonian period (408 to 362 million years ago), which extends westward to the Connecticut border. The real beginning of Chepiwanoxet Island came as a result of the last great ice sheets, which bulldozed rock and stone from Canada to Rhode Island. Along the way, each glacier gouged up billions of cubic meters of underlying bedrock, and then ground local and imported rocks together, creating much of the glacial deposits existing today. When the Earth's temperature rose about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, the glaciers began melting faster than they were moving forward leaving huge deposits of sand and feeding many rivers and streams that rose sea level and washed sand into the coves and bays. For extended periods, the ice advance equaled the rate of melt, and piles of sediment were deposited in terminal or end moraines, such as on Block Island and in Charlestown (hills in the southern part of the state).1976, Dr. Alonzo Quinn: Rhode Island Geology for the Non-Geologist The Soil Survey of Rhode IslandRector, 1981 lists Chepiwanoxet Point and nearby shores as \\"Hinckley gravelly sandy loam\\"; a very porous, well-drained soil of glacial origin, which is of poor topsoil quality. The soil type change (to a bit of \\"Walpole sandy loam\\", associated with severe wetness) can only occur in the marsh. Island Creation Theory The original island was created as an outwash deposit during a brief pause in the last glacial retreat from melt water runoff carrying eroded sand down a stream from the high hills (Love Lane and Cowesett Hills area) forming a small navigable river mouth called Arnold's Cove suitable only by skiffs and small sailboats (cc. 1800s). The island's tidal flow between Greenwich Cove to the South and Chepiwanoxet Beach to the North kept the small cove open with a navigable channel for small boat use more so at high tide and presumably good shellfishing in low tide. Early bay navigation charts (e.g. 1777 Charles Blaskowitz; US Geological Survey 1891 Atlas of Rhode Island; ca. 1895 Narragansett Bay) and city maps (1831 Stevens map of Warwick) clearly show Chepiwanoxet as an island separated by water from the mainland. The cove today remains as a very productive nursery for a wide range of baby fish species, horseshoe crabs, periwinkles, which helps make the north side the State's most productive and varied juvenal species population compared to all other test beaches during the annual multi-month shore seine testing by the RI Department of Environmental Management marine biologists (as repeated told over recent decades to the author). A causeway built by the Gallaudet Corporation (cc. 1916) allowed truck access to the island for seaplane manufacturing factory. Arnold Cove today is a silted in marsh with only a narrow, winding channel, exiting North toward Chepiwanoxet Beach that is no longer navigable. The cove is quickly being populated by Phragmites reed grass, an invasive species that can grow over 15' high and quickly crowds out natural habitats. If uncontrolled Phragmites may totally fill the entire cove in several decades. The shore along Chepiwanoxet once was one long winding sandy beach continually fed by erosion of the many high hills along the bays West coast. But with development by railroad and home shore erosion protection with rock rip-rap, stone and cement walls that virtually stopped beach nourishment. Chepiwanoxet's beaches are mostly eroded away leaving rocky shores with sand stripped away by naturally occurring long-shore currents moving South and East north of the island and North and East south of the island. The two currents, along with Arnold Cove's river deposits, helped add sand to create the island along with its two long shallow sandbars heading Northeast and Southeast. Key Modern History Facts The triangular shaped island became a peninsula in the early 20th century when the Gallaudet Aircraft Company constructed America's first seaplane-only factory at Chepiwanoxet cc. 1916. To allow truck access to the factory, the south channel to Greenwich Cove filled in with sandy gravel dumped into the marsh, making a causeway from Alger Avenue that still remains. As a result of blocking water circulation around the island, Arnold Cove lost its small boat access from silt deposits in the tidal marsh located on the North side of the island. With the island made of glacial outwash sand deposits it remains subject to shore erosion. The Gallaudet Company built wood bulkheads around the North, East and South shores with rock rip-rap on the waterside and fill behind. With many factory workers living north of the old cove, a narrow wood plank bridge was built across the marsh to allow quicker access to/from work. During the Gallaudet Factory period, the Bostich Staple Corporation, located in East Greenwich, was allowed to dump hundreds of truckloads of waste metal staples along the east facing shore behind the wood bulkhead to control erosion from the 1930s to the early 1950s. The staples rusted in large heaps that gradually were eroded/dissolved by the salt water. In the early 2000s after becoming a city park, Warwick had most of the remaining rust piles removed, but beach walkers can still discover small rust pieces lying about which locals jokingly call \\"Bostaplite\\" rock. A few wood piles remain widely scattered along the shore showing how much sand has eroded particularly in the north-east corner popular with fishermen. The factory built seaplanes, including the Gallaudt 'Battlecruiser' D series for the U.S. Navy during World War I. Following the war and loss of government interest in seaplanes, the corporation moved to Connecticut, leaving its factory empty and virtually unused through World War II into the 1950s. (the author played among the buildings as a child. Currently all the factory buildings have been demolished, but two cement floors remain with the larger floor of the metal boiler plant and the smaller floor, a bit to the Northwest, was the brick kiln for drying wood for the seaplanes. That floor has a brick border showing where the building walls surrounded that kiln. In 1946 the Amtrol Company started on Chepiwanoxet Island by the brothers Chester and Kenneth Kirk. The factory manufactured water pressure control tanks in one of the empty seaplane buildings. They worked there until 1953 when hurricane Carol hit Rhode Island and flooded the factory grounds. The Kirk brothers and two other employees survived the flood by floating on a garage door to the shore near the old Warwick Coal Company about two miles north. The company immediately moved their manufacturing to higher ground in West Warwick (as told by Ken Kirk to the author in the 1980s). A few years after hurricane Carol, the Chepiwanoxet Marina was built along the south shore of the island bordering the Gallaudet wood shore wall, and using a large single floor surviving building for boat inside winter storage. Its wood piers and floating docks pointed south into Greenwich Cove, a few wood piles remain. That marina, according to Frank Pettis, longtime owner of Pettis Marine in Pawtuxet, was the first true marina built in Rhode Island as personally told to the author). This the first marina, unlike most others was not converted from a boatyard, but built specifically for pleasure craft. The marina lasted less than 10 years. Today one can see some original marina piles where the docks once floated. Note that the piles all lean south showing effects of winter ice pressure out from the shore. In 1994 the island was purchased by the City of Warwick as the Chepiwanoxet Park and is open to the public, but with limited parking for about 8 cars. Visitors can walk the shore especially when below high tide, or along several sandy trails crossing the island. Shellfishing is allowed along the North and East facing sides on Greenwich Bay, but closed along the South shore facing Greenwich Cove. Geography Chepiwanoxet Point is mapped on the East Greenwich 7.5-minute quadrangle. Bedrock and surficial geologic maps for the quadrangle were published by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Rhode Island State Geologist.

The cone of power is visualized as a cone of energy that encompasses the circumference of the circle of Wiccans and tapering off to a point above the group.Puckett, Robert (2008). Re-enchanting the World: a Weberian Analysis of Wiccan Charisma. Handbook of Contemporary Paganism. Brill Publications. Retrieved 2019-03-07. As a group, the cone is formed by the Wiccans standing in a circle, sometimes holding hands, and focusing on a single point above the group and in the centre of the circle. They then dance, drum, chant, or perform various other ritual gestures, in order to raise the energy and extend it upwards.\\"The Mystica\\". Retrieved 2019-03-07. ^Wigington, Pat. The Cone of Power. ThoughtCo. Retrieved 2019-03-07. When the state that these actions create has reached a peak, the ritual leader will signal the group and the energy is released upwards and the cone is ‚Äúsent‚Äù towards the goal^Wigington, Pat. The Cone of Power. ThoughtCo. Retrieved 2019-03-07. This is called \\"Raising the Cone of Power\\".  Uses  The cone of power is used in Wicca because it is believed that through work, Wiccans can raise energy from their bodies that can be directed towards their magical goals. This work is most commonly done through singing, dancing, chanting, and/or drumming. This energy is directed upwards towards their gods and their goals being achieved. Wiccans claim that the cone of power has been utilized to end wars, but can function on a smaller level as well. The cone of power can be used to target a specific person, bring good fortune, or accomplish a specific goal. The goal of the cone of power depends entirely on the goals of the coven performing it.  Importance of the cone shape  The cone itself holds significance in Wicca. The cone is most commonly linked to the chakras. The base of the cone correlates with the root chakra at the base of the spine. The root chakra forms the base of the cone. The cone then extends upwards to the crown chakra at the top of the head forming the point of the cone. The chakras themselves deal with the flow of energy in the body, and the cone of power is created by harnessing the body‚Äôs natural energy and directing it upwards. The shape of the cone can also be broken down into a circle and a triangle. Both of these shapes have significance in Wicca. The circle represents the sun, unity, and rebirth. The triangle itself is associated with the elements and with pyramids. Pyramids represent higher spiritual desires. Wicca is a religion that is based on nature, so these symbols hold importance. The Triangle is also a symbol for the Triple Goddess, an important Wicca Goddess.  Early examples  One of the first cited examples of the cone of power comes from Gerald Gardner. Gardner, the founder of the Gardnerian tradition of Wicca, who wrote in his early writing that his New Forest Coven performed a cone of power ritual to keep Hitler‚Äôs troops from invading Great Britain. Other early examples where witches have claimed to use the cone of power against enemies are: * 1588, cone of power helped to defeat the Spanish Armada * 1805, cone of power raised against Napoleon's planned invasion Tom Metcalfe (2016), Operation Cone of Power: When British Witches Attacked Adolf Hitler https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/86145/operation-cone-power-when-british- witches-attacked-adolf-hitler [accessed 2020-02-22] * 1971, California witches gathered and performed a cone of power ritual to end the war in Vietnam  Increasing effectiveness  There are a few ways Wiccans are taught to increase the effectiveness of the cone of power ritual. The overall success of the magic is first dependent on the intention or goal of the people performing it. The best way to increase the overall effectiveness of the ritual is to work magic in a group. While you can perform this ritual by yourself, doing it in a group is seen to be more effective. The methods taught to increase the success are grounding and centering your energy, creating a sacred space, specifically a circle, and being trained to focus your attention on the stated goal of the magical ritual. This enable the achievement of the so-called ecstatic trance required to release the energy upwards and send it to the stated goal.

(Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Berlin) Location of the province of Verona Eolates gracilis, a fossil perch. (Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Berlin) Bolca is a village in the Veneto, on the southern margin of the Italian Alps. It is a frazione of the comune of Vestenanova, in the province of Verona. The area is famous for the marine fossils from the lagerst√§tte of Monte Bolca. It was one of the first fossil sites with high quality preservation known to Europeans, and is still an important source of fossils from the Eocene. Geography Bolca lies in the Lessini Alps. Monte Bolca was originally at the bottom of the Tethys Ocean before being uplifted from the ocean floor during the formation of the Alps. This happened in two stages, one 24 million years ago and one between 30 and 50 million years ago. History The area was settled in prehistoric times, there are remains of a hill fort on Monte Purga dating from around 1000 BC. The Romans were active in the area, and by 1000AD the village had come under the control of a convent of the Augustinian Eremitani. In the thirteenth century the fortunes of the Vestenanova area were closely tied to the Ghibelline Ezzelino da Romano family, the Lords of Verona, whose estates were razed in 1260. The Mezzagonella's castle of \\"Bubulka cum Vulpiana\\" was seized by Mastino I della Scala, Ezzelino III da Romano's successor, from Ludovico count of San Bonifacio during the 1269-70 war between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. From then on the village was part of Verona, but gained its independence in 1326 by edict of Cangrande I della Scala. In 1387 the area passed to the Duchy of Milan; under Gian Maria Visconti it fell to Venetian rule from 1410 until the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia became part of the Austrian Empire, during which time Francis I of Austria spent three days in Bolca. In 1821 Bolca was split from Volpiano, the former being joined to Vestenanova, whilst Volpiano became a frazione of Crespadoro, a town now in the province of Vicenza. The fossils at Monte Bolca have been known since at least the 16th century, and were studied intensively in the 19th century once it was definitively proven that fossils were the remnants of dead animals. Fossils Strictly speaking, the Monte Bolca site is one specific spot near the village of Bolca in Italy, known as the Pesciara (\\"The Fishbowl\\") due to its many extraordinarily well preserved Eocene fish fossils. However, there are several other related outcroppings in the general vicinity that also carry fossils, such as Monte Postale and Monte Vegroni. The term Monte Bolca is used interchangeably to refer to the original site, or to all the sites collectively. The entire formation consists of of lithographic limestone, all of which contain fossils, but interspersed in which are the lagerst√§tte layers that contain the highly preserved specimens. Within these layers, the fish and other specimens are so highly preserved that their organs are often completely preserved in fossil form, and even the skin color can sometimes be determined. The normal rearrangement of the specimens caused by mud-dwelling organisms in the layer before it turned to stone has been avoided‚Äîit is assumed that the mud in question was low in oxygen, preventing both decay and the action of scavengers. Fossils from Monte Bolca are commonly available for sale by commercial fossil dealers, and due to their popularity and preservation regularly sell for several hundred euros. Fossil species include the moonfish Mene rhombea and Mene oblonga, the batfish Eoplatax papilio, the spadefish Exellia velifer, the \\"angelfish\\" carangid, Ceratoichthys, a crocodile, Crocodilus vicetinus, and a snake, Archaeophis bolcaensis. Economy The area is dependent on tourism and agriculture; the famous wine regions of Valpolicella and Soave lie just to the south. In the village there is a museum with three rooms of fossils from the area.

Recorded by Nick Lowe, who had also released the first Stiff single, the title and cover were intended as a humorous response to the David Bowie album Low, which had been released earlier in the year. Lowe decided that as Bowie had made an album with his name, but without the final e, he would reciprocate by making a record with Bowie's name, also lacking the final e. Of the four tracks on the EP, only \\"Marie Provost\\" was initially re-released on an album, 1978's Jesus of Cool (issued as Pure Pop for Now People in the US), although all four tracks appear on the 2008 deluxe re-release edition of Jesus of Cool. The opening track \\"Born a Woman\\", written by Martha Sharp, had previously been performed by Sandy Posey \\"as a lament about the world's cruelty and inequality\\", whereas Lowe sings it with glee, unclear whether he is \\"decrying the information he's sharing or reveling in it\\". \\"Marie Provost\\" was written about the death of silent screen star Marie Prevost, whose body was discovered several days after she had died, alone and penniless in her Hollywood apartment. When she was found, she had bite marks on her legs, courtesy of her dog. That was the basis for the refrain, \\"She was a winner / that became the doggie's dinner\\", as well as other lines indicating that her pet dachshund had eaten her. In contrast to the sad content of the lyrics, which evoke the transitory nature of fame, the melody is deliberately \\"bouncy ... with chiming guitars\\".

Parker House is a house located in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, United States. The house was designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1892 and is an example of his early work. Real-estate agent Thomas H. Gale had it built and sold it to Robert P. Parker later that year. The house was designed by Wright independently while he was still employed by the firm Adler & Sullivan, run by engineer Dankmar Adler and architect, Louis Sullivan; taking outside commissions was something that Sullivan forbade. The Parker House is listed as a contributing property to a U.S. federally Registered Historic District. History The Robert P. Parker House is one of three houses along Chicago Avenue in Oak Park which have come to be known as American architect Frank Lloyd Wright's \\"Bootleg Houses.\\"\\"Robert P. Parker House,\\" Oak Park Tourist, excerpted from: Sprague, Paul E. Guide to Frank Lloyd Wright & Prairie School Architecture in Oak Park Oak Park Bicentennial Commission of the American Revolution and Oak Park Landmarks Commission, Village of Oak Park: 1986, (). Retrieved 9 June 2007. The triplet of houses includes the Thomas H. Gale House and the Walter Gale House as well as the Parker House and they were designed by Wright independently while he was still employed by Adler and Sullivan. Architect Louis Sullivan loaned Wright money during the construction of his own home and studio and Wright was working it off at the firm. Independent work was forbidden by Sullivan.Lockwood, Charles. \\"The houses Wright built,\\" The New York Times, 8 June 1986. Retrieved 9 June 2007. The Parker house is especially similar to the Thomas H. Gale House. The houses were designed on a speculative basis for Wright neighbor Walter Gale in 1892. In all, Wright designed nine \\"bootleg houses\\" moonlighting while still under contract with Sullivan. When Sullivan found out about the side projects, in late 1892 or early 1893, Wright was dismissed. The Parker House is one of four that still stand. They were built later that same year, 1892, by real-estate agent Thomas Gale, who sold the Parker House to attorney Robert Parker. The three houses were part of a series of homes that had nearly identical plans with only small differences. They include the aforementioned Walter Gale House and Thomas H. Gale House, the Francis Woolley House, also located in Oak Park, and the Robert G. Emmond House in LaGrange, Illinois. Parker, an attorney, bought the house from the Gales early on in the building process as his name appears on the plans.Heinz, Thomas A. The Vision of Frank Lloyd Wright, Chartwell Books, Inc., Edison, New Jersey: 2006, pp. 55-56, (). Architecture The polygonal dormers on the Parker House are featured in all of the bootleg houses that survive. The design for the Parker House and the Thomas Gale House, and to some extent the Walter Gale House, were derived from the more expensive Emmond House in LaGrange. The homes all feature irregular roof composition with high pitches and polygonal dormers. The Parker House reflects the style of Wright's first teacher Joseph Silsbee. Sullivan's influence can also be seen in the taut masses of the house, his philosophy of \\"geometric simplification\\" is evident in the Parker House's design. While generally cast in the Queen Anne style of architecture the Parker House has more ample rounded forms than the common Queen Anne homes being built at the time. The small size is deceiving as the Parker House is spacious. The turret bays have walls that are more than half consisted of windows. The fireplace is set in the center of the house which allows it to heat and service two rooms, the parlor and the dining room. The side elevations of the Parker House are symmetrical but adjacent buildings are built too close for the design to be seen clearly. Significance Though small in size and adorned with inexpensive detailing, the Parker House and the Gale House are of significance because of what they reveal about Frank Lloyd Wright's development as an architect. The house is listed as a contributing property to the Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District.\\"Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District,\\" Property Information Report-District listing, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.

It belongs to the Amt (\\"collective municipality\\") Neuzelle, which has its administrative seat in the neighbouring Neuzelle municipality. Geography The municipal area is located in the historic Lower Lusatia region, close to the border with ≈ªytowa≈Ñ in Poland. Near the village of Ratzdorf, the Lusatian Neisse discharges into the Oder River. Both rivers mark the German eastern border along the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line. Subdivision Since 31 December 2001, the Nei√üem√ºnde municipality consists of the following four villages: * Breslack () * Coschen (K√≥≈°yna) * Ratzdorf * Wellmitz History Archaeological excavations of Globular Amphora culture artifacts denote a settlement of the area since the Neolithic. The region along the Oder and Neisse rivers was settled by Polabian Slavs (Sorbs) from about 600 onwards and in 965 became part of the Imperial March of Lusatia. The village of Wellmitz was first mentioned in a 1300 deed issued by Margrave Theoderic IV. The etates then belonged to the Cistercian abbey of Neuzelle, confirmed by Emperor Charles IV in 1370. In 1846 Wellmitz and Coschen were connected to the Lower Silesian- Mark Railway line from Berlin to Breslau. The village of Ratzdorf was heavily affected by the 1997 Central European flood; reconstruction was funded, inter alia, through a substantial donation by US singer Michael Jackson.

The local Lutherans built it during a period of religious persecution, when they were allowed to erect only wooden churches. That is why even nails were made exclusively of wood. The construction was financially supported by Protestants from various countries, including Sweden and Denmark.Slovak tourist board The only stone part of the church is its sacristy, originally built in 1593 as a pub outside the city walls. In the 17th century, the Roman Catholic dynasty of Habsburgs persecuted Protestantism in the Habsburg Monarchy, which included territory of present Slovakia at that time. The number of churches was limited to one in each free royal town, Ke≈æmarok being one of them. The construction material had to be the cheapest possible (wood at that time) and a church had to be completed in 365 days. Furthermore, the site of a new Protestant church had to be chosen by a royal commission. In Ke≈æmarok, a royal commission deliberately chose an ancient pub as a place of worship, in order to humiliate the local Protestant community.Municipal website of Ke≈æmarok The pub was subsequently incorporated into a hastily constructed religious building as a sacristy. The oldest parts are an epitaph from 1688 and a Renaissance baptistery from 1690. They are the only remaining parts of the first church. The second wooden church, erected in the Baroque style in 1717, completely replaced the first building. It has the shape of an equal-armed Greek cross. The space can accommodate 1,541 worshipers. According to a legend, circular windows were made by Swedish sailors contributing to the construction. The organ, completed in 1729, is known for its perfect sound despite having only wooden pipes. The church has been protected by the state as an important historical monument since 1892. In 1985, the Slovak National Council (parliament) proclaimed it a National Historical Monument. An expensive reconstruction followed in the 1990s. The church is one of only five Lutheran wooden churches remaining in Slovakia.
