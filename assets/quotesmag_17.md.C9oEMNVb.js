Dubai is home to the largest population of Filipinos in the UAE, followed by Abu Dhabi and Al Ain. In 2007, Filipinos in the UAE sent more than US$500 million in remittances back to the Philippines. Filipino workers Filipinos in the United Arab Emirates are primarily migrant overseas workers employed in the architecture, construction, cargo shipping design engineering, energy, information technology, marketing, medical, real estate, retail, telecommunications, and tourism sectors or as domestic helpers. The Philippine Department of Labor and Employment also has two Philippine Overseas Labor Offices (POLOs) in the UAE, in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. These offices, as well as agreements between the Filipino and UAE governments, have set the monthly minimum salary for OFW's at US$400. Because of the high number of Filipinos in the UAE, OFW's have called more direct flights from the UAE to the Philippines. Population decline The global financial crisis of 2008–2009 has taken a toll on the working Filipino population in the United Arab Emirates, and in December 2008 alone, 3,000 Filipino workers lost their jobs. The overall population shrank by 20% at the end of 2008 as compared to the end of 2007. The Embassy of the Philippines in the UAE asked laid-off Filipinos to register, because of the possibility of job openings in Qatar. However, the decline could also be attributed to new visa and passport requirements that the government of the UAE instituted midway through 2008, affecting up to 20,000 Filipinos. Those with expired visas were stranded on the Iranian island of Kish, and at Al Buraimi, Oman near the Oman/UAE border. 300 Filipinos had fled to the Philippines because of the Stranded filipinos and 65 Filipinos got their tickets free by the Consulate of the Philippines See also * Philippine Business School (www.uaeadvise.com) * The Philippine School, Dubai References United Arab Emirates Asian diaspora in the United Arab Emirates Philippines–United Arab Emirates relations ","title":"Filipinos in the United Arab Emirates"},{"id":"16127633","text":"USS Wilkes may refer to: *, a torpedo boat which served around the turn of the 20th century *, a destroyer which served during World War I *, a destroyer which served during World War II See also  Charles Wilkes United States Navy ship names ","title":"USS Wilkes"},{"id":"16127637","text":"Summer Rains is the third studio album from the folk/swing band The Ditty Bops released in 2008.

The college preparatory school enrolls students in grades Pre-K-12. As of the 2015–2016 school year, 1,130 students were enrolled, making Parish the 3rd largest private school in Dallas County. History Parish Episcopal School was founded as Parish Day School in 1972 enrolling students between Pre-kindergarten through the 6th grade. It was founded by Mary Loving Blair, who served as the first head of school until 1980, when she was replaced by Gloria Snyder. It was under the administration of Gloria Snyder that the school expanded up to grade 12 and was renamed \\"Parish Episcopal School\\" in 2001. After adding additional grades, Parish purchased a second campus on the intersection of Midway Road and Alpha Road in Farmers Branch, Texas, which would house students from grades 3 to 12. The current head of school is David Monaco, who replaced Snyder in 2009. Monaco was previously at Ravenscroft School in Raleigh, North Carolina. Parish graduated its first high school class of approximately 46 students in May 2007; it graduated a second class of 75 students May 2008. From 2003 to 2008, the Upper School grew from 50 students to 380, and from 5 teachers to more than 45.

The duo was nicknamed the “Eisler brothers” by music critic W.Liefland. They later also experimented with different genres and sound collages, including electronic devices. The duo played in many international festivals and concerts in cities as diverse as Tel Aviv, Zagreb, West and East Berlin and South America. History and music Before the duo started, Heiner Goebbels especially admired the capabilities of Don Cherry, with whom about 15 years later he engaged in his project “Der Mann im Fahrstuhl,” adapted from Heiner Müller. In 1972, Goebbels moved from Landau to Frankfurt/Main to study sociology and complete a work on the German/Austrian composer, Hanns Eisler. Meanwhile, Alfred 23 Harth was finishing his degree as an art teacher at the university in Frankfurt/Main, as well as his conscientious objector's civilian service in 1973-4, and in 1975 returned after three months of activity playing with the loft jazz scene in New York City (together with Jay Clayton, John Fischer and Perry Robinson). Previously, he had formed the groups Just Music (1967–72) and E.M.T. (1972–74). He was then searching new musical companionship in the local Frankfurt music scene and joined a jazz-rock band comprising Goebbels on keyboards and drummer Uwe Schmitt, later in Gestalt et Jive, that shortly after broke apart while leaving some previously booked concerts open. Harth encouraged Goebbels to play one of the remaining concerts, freely improvising in a duo with him. They exchanged information and during a rehearsal Harth played the melody of some Eisler songs on saxophone, which Goebbels accompanied on the piano. They continued improvising freely, thematically deconstructing Eisler's music just to have it emerge again in a twisted manner. They also extended the range of their instruments. A first Duo Goebbels/Harth concert took place in 1975 at a special event for artist friends in Frankfurt/Main. Goebbels and Harth played their fresh repertoire of music at the \\"1.Ersatzausstellung\\" by Vollrad Kutscher and Stephan Keller, from which photographs found their way to covers of the later LPs and CDs of the duo Goebbels/Harth. Christoph Anders, a later member of the wind band Sogenanntes Linksradikales Blasorchester and Cassiber, was in the audience and since then became a friend to the two musicians. The enthusiastic reaction of the audience to their humorous and skilled diversity lead to more concerts for the newly formed duo Goebbels/Harth. Soon they contacted Jost Gebers from FMP, whom Harth knew from his LP production with E.M.T. and arranged a live recording session at the \\"Flöz\\" in 1976 in West Berlin, which emerged as the LP \\"Vier Fäuste für Hanns Eisler\\" which boosted the duo's recognition. The same year, Goebbels started formal music studies at the Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst Frankfurt am Main. In 1978 the duo played at the Deutsches Jazzfestival Frankfurt and started to work on a second LP \\"Vom Sprengen des Gartens\\" for SAJ/FMP (1979), where they also worked in a manner removed from their European heritage by implementing ideas from German composers, such as Bach and Schumann in their free improvisations. Joachim-Ernst Berendt called this LP \\"one of the most important German jazz LPs in the 1970s.\\" Around 1978-79, Goebbels and Harth started to compose for the theatre as well as film music for German director Helke Sander. In 1981, Berendt together with the duo produced the LP, \\"Zeit wird knapp\\" by including love poems and ballads from Bertolt Brecht, for which they recruited vocalists Dagmar Krause and Ernst Stötzner. The duo then artistically shaped the German new wave music/Neue Deutsche Welle in their style with their LPs \\"Indianer Für Morgn\\" and \\"Frankfurt/Peking\\" by also using synthesizer, electronic devices, and extended instruments. They made a short adaption of the Revolutionary opera Pekinese, which in 1996 led Japanese avant-garde musician Otomo Yoshihide to incorporate samples of it into a project with his group Ground Zero. The duo then carried out two tours to South America with the help of the Goethe Institute. Around 1983-84, the creative spirit of the pair diminished. In 1987, Harth had been playing reeds and brass instruments in Goebbels’ performance \\"Der Mann im Fahrstuhl\\" at the Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville in Victoriaville, Quebec, Canada ( together with Arto Lindsay and Heiner Müller). At the same festival, a final significant Goebbels/Harth event took place through a live recording, which became a kind of synopsis of the duo's entire repertoire over its long history. After a few more duo events and the unreleased last recordings “Duos für Fritz,” Harth disbanded the duo in 1988. In 1991 together with Akashi Masanori (evva) Harth produced the best-of CD \\"Goebbels Heart,\\" for which he had asked artist and writer friend Wolf Pehlke to put his image from the book of art works, \\"Goebbels Heart\\" (1986) on the CD cover to symbolize that the duo's work had been definitively concluded. In 2007 Harth together with Chris Cutler produced the CD reissue of the two first duo LPs. In 2020 the duo's Revolutionary opera Pekinese together with Otomo Yoshihide's group Ground Zero was released on vinyl in France. Other activities * So-Called Left-Radical Brass Band / \\"Sogenanntes Linksradikales Blasorchester\\" (SLB), (1976–1981) In 1976 Goebbels and Harth put an orchestra together that was designed to play mainly in the streets during the then political demonstrations of the left-radical German student movement to add colour to their activities. * Film music for \\"Der subjective Faktor\\" and \\"Der Beginn aller Schrecken ist Liebe\\" by Helke Sander, (1980–81) * The music theatre \\"Abrazzo Oper\\" in 1981 with actor Peter Franke, Goebbels, Harth, Johannes Krämer from Just Music (band), Rolf Riehm (SLB), Annemarie Roelofs (from Harth's LP project \\"Es herrscht Uhu im Land\\" in 1980) and Uwe Schmitt, for which the duo composed together with Riehm. * The avant- rock group \\"Cassiber\\" with Christoph Anders, Chris Cutler, Goebbels, Harth. *The avant-rock group \\"Cassix\\" in cooperation with Stormy Six (Rock in Opposition), 1983 *The avant-rock septet \\"Duck and Cover\\" in 1983 *Theatre music for \\"Kiebich und Dutz\\" and \\"Die Reise nach Aschenfeld” together with F.K.

Hollander or Gino Hollander (1924 – August 27, 2015) was an American painter. He began painting in New York City during the abstract expressionist movement. Biography =Early life= Hollander's father was in the fur business, enabling the family to travel to Europe including a nine- month stay in Paris. At age 13, he experienced his first adventure with a 1,000-mile bike trip up the Connecticut River Valley alone. He was a member of the United States Army's 10th Mountain Division Ski Troops and is a veteran of World War II. =New York City= In the mid-20th century, he was a successful filmmaker along with his wife Barbara Hollander before he started painting in 1960, during the abstract expressionism movement in New York City. He became one of the group that defined this movement and whom all hung out at the famous Cedar Tavern. Acrylic paint was just emerging at that time and Hollander was among the first to explore its possibilities. From 1960-1962, he had his studio and the first Hollander Gallery on Bleecker Street, in Greenwich Village. During that time his paintings sold to the likes of Jacqueline Kennedy, Steve McQueen, Norman Rockwell, and Ralph Lauren. =Spain= Despite having experienced initial success in New York, Hollander moved his family to Spain in 1962, to find his voice in painting. He often bartered paintings to support his family while he continued developing his style. Hollander and his wife Barbara took their children on archaeological trips, following the road construction crews which were building new highways throughout Spain, unearthing ancient treasures. They created Museo Hollander, renamed Pizarra Municipal Museum , located in an old Cortijo. The museum was to exhibit this collection of Spanish artifacts that span along with Hollander's own paintings. In 1990, the Hollanders donated their museum to the government of Spain and were nationally awarded in honor of the King's birthdate a Medallion de Plata for contributing to the country's growth in tourism. =Aspen= After nearly 20 somewhat reclusive years in Aspen, Colorado during which he appeared in the film \\"Mountain Town\\", Hollander gave in to his lungs' demands in the near 8,000-foot altitude and moved with his wife Barbara to Ojai, California. =California= Hollander died, surrounded by his family, at the age of 91 in Newport Beach, California.  Artistic Style  Hollander's work is reflective of his ethos; he makes art because he must, and while he is aware of the art world, it's only vaguely so. His work is honest and emotional; he paints for himself. He has no wish to engage in a dialogue with the viewer. It is for him to paint, for the viewer to view. He refuses to title his paintings. He tells no stories. To him, “there is nothing verbal about a canvas. A painting is simply one way to express a feeling and feelings can only be made less if they are talked to death.\\" His portraits are purposely poised on the far edge of nothingness, faces left blank or at best enigmatic. His figures are abstracted and his abstracts disturbingly figurative. He'll paint through the day and on into the night, each canvas a different mood. From stark black and white to a splash of brilliant colors and on to a subtle moody sepia, then back to a black and white, gentle this time. He is a complex man and his canvasses reinforce this complexity in the very simplicity of their form and content. \\"I chose painting for the immediacy of the moment the medium can allow—its immediacy of expression. I find my deepest moments are of feeling and that is what I strive for in my painting. The art of painting provides me with a constant mirror of my being—both successes and failures, the good moments and bad. I prefer to paint it all as it comes. Painting takes on a rhythm like breathing: loose, tight, whatever. Living and painting become one. I believe in the universality of art’s function, a heritage of involvement of everyone – the youngest to the oldest, the artist, the viewer. A subliminal communication of feelings about the human condition. My paintings are expressly directed to evoke an emotional reaction from the viewer.\\" - Gino Hollander, 2010.

The double-flowered trait is often noted alongside the scientific name with the abbreviation fl. pl. (flore pleno, a Latin ablative form meaning \\"with full flower\\"). The first abnormality to be documented in flowers, double flowers are popular varieties of many commercial flower types, including roses, camellias and carnations. In some double-flowered varieties all of the reproductive organs are converted to petals -- as a result, they are sexually sterile and must be propagated through cuttings. Many double- flowered plants have little wildlife value as access to the nectaries is typically blocked by the mutation.  History  Double flowers are the earliest documented form of floral abnormality, first recognized more than two thousand years ago. Theophrastus mentioned double roses in his Enquiry into Plants, written before 286 BC. Pliny also described double roses in 1st century BC. In China, double peonies were known and selected by around 750 AD, and around 1000 AD double varieties of roses were cultivated to form the China rose (one of the ancestors of modern hybrid tea roses). Today, most cultivated rose varieties bear this double-flower trait. Double-flowered Arabidopsis Herbalists of the Renaissance recognized double flowers and began to cultivate them in their gardens--Rembert Dodoens published a description of double flowers in 1568, and John Gerard created illustrations of many double flowers beside their wild-type counterparts in 1597. A double-flowered variety of Marsh Marigold was discovered and cultivated in Austria in the late 16th century, becoming a valued garden plant. The first documented double-flowered mutant of Arabidopsis, a model organism for plant development and genetics, was recorded in 1873. The mutated gene likely responsible for the phenotype, AGAMOUS, was cloned and characterized in 1990 in Elliot Meyerowitz's lab as part of his study of molecular mechanisms of pattern formation in flowers.  Genetics of double-flower mutations  ABC model of flower development. Double flower varieties often arise from mutations affecting C class genes. Double- flower forms often arise when some or all of the stamens in a flower are replaced by petals. These types of mutations, where one organ in a developing organism is replaced with another, are known as homeotic mutations. They are usually recessive, although the double flower mutation in carnations exhibits incomplete dominance. In Arabidopsis, which has been used as a model for understanding flower development, the double-flower gene AGAMOUS encodes a protein responsible for tissue specification of stamen and carpel flower segments. When both copies of the gene are deleted or otherwise damaged, developing flowers lack the signals to form stamen and carpel segments. Regions which would have formed stamens instead default to petals and the carpel region develops into a new flower, resulting in a recursive sepal- petal-petal pattern. Because no stamens and carpels form, the plants have no reproductive organs and are sexually sterile. Mutations affecting flower morphology in Arabidopsis can be described by the ABC model of flower development. In this model, genes involved in flower formation belong to one of three classes of genes: A class genes which affect sepal and petal formation, B class genes which affect petal and stamen formation, and C class genes which affect stamen and carpel formation. These genes are expressed in certain regions of the developing flower and are responsible for development of organs in those regions. Agamous is a C class gene, a transcription factor responsible for activating genes involved in stamen and carpel development.

Under this system, government authority was divided among secular and religious administrations, both unified under the nominal authority of the Zhabdrung Rinpoche. Druk, meaning \\"thunder dragon\\", refers symbolically to Bhutan, whose most ancient name is Druk-yul. Desi, meaning \\"regent\\", was the chief secular office in realms under this system of government. History In Bhutan, the office of Druk Desi was established by the Zhabdrung Rinpoche, Ngawang Namgyal in the 17th century under the dual system of government. Having fled sectarian persecution in Tibet, Ngawang Namgyal established the Drukpa Lineage as the state religion. Under the Bhutanese system, the powers of the government were split between the religious branch headed by the Je Khenpo of the Drukpa Lineage and the civil administrative branch headed by the Druk Desi. Both the Je Khenpo and Druk Desi were under the nominal authority of the Zhabdrung Rinpoche, a reincarnation of Ngawang Namgyal. The Druk Desi was either a monk or a member of the laity—by the nineteenth century, usually the latter; he was elected for a three-year term, initially by a monastic council and later by the State Council (Lhengye Tshokdu). The State Council was a central administrative organ that included regional rulers, the Zhabdrung's chamberlains, and the Druk Desi. In time, the Druk Desi came under the political control of the State Council's most powerful faction of regional administrators. The Zhabdrung was the head of state and the ultimate authority in religious and civil matters. The seat of central government was at Thimphu, the site of a thirteenth-century dzong, in the spring, summer, and fall. The winter capital was at Punakha, a dzong established northeast of Thimphu in 1527. The kingdom was divided into three regions (east, central, and west), each with an appointed penlop (governor), holding a seat in a major dzong. Districts were headed by dzongpens (district officers), who had their headquarters in lesser dzongs. The penlops were a combination of tax collectors, judges, military commanders, and procurement agents for the central government. Their major revenues came from the trade between Tibet and India and from land taxes. It is believed that the death of Ngawang Namgyal in 1651 was concealed for some 50 years as authorities sought his reincarnation as successor. At first the system persisted, however the Druk Desi gradually gained political power and civil wars ensued. Once a reincarnation was found, the Druk Desi was unwilling to part with his acquired power, and the power of the Zhabdrung gradually declined. Similarly, the Druk Desi also lost control over the local rulers and penlops (governors). The country devolved into several semi-independent regions under the control of penlops. In practice, the Zhabdrung was often a child under the control of the Druk Desi, and regional penlops often administered their districts in defiance of the Druk Desi. The Constitution of Bhutan, enacted in 2008, confirms Bhutan's commitment to the dual system of government. However the title \\"Druk Desi\\" never appears in the Constitution, and all administrative powers are vested in the Druk Gyalpo and civilian offices directly. Furthermore, the Druk Gyalpo appoints the Je Khenpo on advice of the Five Lopons(learned masters), and the democratic Constitution itself is the supreme law of the land, as opposed to a Zhabdrung figurehead.

He was a son of Elbert Roosevelt (1767–1857) and Jane (née Curtenius) Roosevelt (1770–1846). Among his siblings were Peter Curtenius Roosevelt and the Rev. Washington Roosevelt. A member of the Roosevelt family, he was a great-grandson of Johannes Roosevelt, making him a distant cousin of U.S. Presidents Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Through his maternal grandmother, Catharine Goelet Curtenius, wife of New York State Auditor Peter Theobaldus Curtenius, he was also a member of the Goelet family. His grandfather was partners in business with his grandmother's brother Peter Goelet. Career Roosevelt was an early and prominent member of the Locofocos, or Equal Rights Party, a radical faction of the Democratic Party. He was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1836 and served one year. Roosevelt was an opponent of the monopoly banking system and cited bank paper currency as the cause of economic problems. After the Panic of 1837, when New York's economy worsened and the working population suffered, he changed his views, calling for a communist economic system with greater government involvement. Roosevelt was also an inventor and an advocate of patent reform. In the 1850s, he invented a warship design, but neither the United States nor Russia were interested; he later proposed trade unions to increase the profits of inventors. Roosevelt was also a diplomat in Russia during the Crimean War (from 1853 to 1856), where he was the \\"herald who carried the official dispatches between St. Petersburg, Paris, Vienna, and Berlin.\\" In 1884, he gave a \\"rambling talk\\" at the People's Hall about \\"bulls and bears, the Stock Exchange, national banks, over-speculation, specie and paper currency, and financial depression.\\" Personal life In New York City, Roosevelt had an office at 52 Exchange Place, and lived at 411 West 23rd Street.

The art of this artist, who has long been based in Japan, is rooted in an Eastern appreciation of the nature of materials and also in modern European phenomenology. The origin of Mono-ha may be found in Lee's article \\"Sonzai to mu wo koete Sekine Nobuo ron (Beyond Being and Nothingness – A Thesis on Sekine Nobuo.\\"Original title is \\"存在と無を越えて–關根伸夫論\\" (Art magazine Sansai 三彩, Japan, June 1969), Kim Mi Kyung, \\"Study on Sekine Nobuo Ron (1969) by Lee Ufan\\", Journal of Korean Modern Art History, Association for Education of Korean Art History, Seoul; Korea, pp. 234–78, 2005 Once this initial impetus given, Mono-ha congealed with the participation of the students of the sculptor Saito Yoshishige, who was teaching at Tama University of Art at the time. One evidence may be found in the book [ba, so, toki] (場 相 時, place phase time) (Spring, 1970).Kim Mi Kyung, \\"Rereading Lee Ufan in the contexts of Japanese Mono-ha, and Korean Monotone Painting and Experimental Art\\", Asian Studies Conference Japan (ASCJ), Sophia University, Ichigaya Campus, Tokyo, June 21, 2003 Lee, the main theorist of the Mono-ha (“School of Things”) tendency in Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s, was trained as a philosopher. As a painter, Lee contributed to 'Korean Monotone Art' (Dansaekjo Yesul, 單色調 藝術),Recently the Korean term \\"Dansaekhwa\\", a rough translation of 'Monochrome Painting' was used from the loosely defined nomenclature in the exhibition of National Museum of Contemporary Art, Korea in 2012. But numerous artists could not be accurately studied so long as they were related to the concept of “Dansaek (monochrome)” or “hwa (painting)”. They are rather to be approached from the consideration for the realm of materials, subjectively located in space and time, hence re-reading “The Monotone Art” (not \\"the monochrome painting\\"). Lee's concept of Mono-ha has been misidentified with 'monochrome painting' in Korea. See Kim Mi Kyung, Experimental Art and society in the 1960–70s Korea, Doctoral thesis, Ewha Womans University (Seoul; Korea), August, 2000 and Kim Mi Kyung, \\"Re-reading Korean Contemporary Art\\", special lecture at Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York, April 15, 2014. the first artistic movement in 20th century Korea to be promoted in Japan. He advocates a methodology of de-westernization and demodernization in both theory and practice as an antidote to the Eurocentric thought of 1960s postwar Japanese society. Lee divides his time between Kamakura, Japan and Paris, France.  Career  Born in Haman-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do in 1936, Lee Ufan was raised by his parents and Confucian grandfather. Lee studied painting at the College of Fine Arts at Seoul National University for just two months and moved to Yokohama, Japan in 1956, where he earned a degree in philosophy in 1961.Lee Ufan: Marking Infinity, June 24 – September 28, 2011 Guggenheim Museum, New York. Whilst studying philosophy Ufan painted in a restrained, traditional Japanese style, eschewing the expressive abstraction of the contemporary Japanese Gutai movement.Lee Ufan Tate Collection. After graduating from the university in Japan, 1961, he threw himself against the South–North unification movement and the military regime. In 1964, Lee was arrested and tortured by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA).www.tagboat.com Lee spent his early working years pursuing careers as an art critic, philosopher, and artist.Benjamin Genocchio (May 15, 2011), Lee Ufan Blouinartinfo. In Japan he became an active participant in the countercultural upheavals surrounding the Anpo Movement of the 1960s.Ken Johnson (June 23, 2011), A Fine Line: Style or Philosophy New York Times. He came to prominence in the late 1960s as one of the founders and theoretical leaders of the avant garde Mono-ha (School of Thing) group.Nancy Kapitanoff (March 31, 1991), Japan Exports Different Perspective with Museum Exhibit Los Angeles Times. Mono-Ha was related in Arte Povera movement of the 1960s and Japan's first contemporary art movement to gain international recognition. The Mono-Ha school of thought rejected Western notions of representation, choosing to focus on the relationships of materials and perceptions rather than on expression or intervention. The movement's goal was to embrace the world at large and encourage the fluid coexistence of numerous beings, concepts, and experiences. Lee U-fan's position in the philosophy department at Nihon University in Tokyo earned him a distinguished role as the movement's spokesman. In 1973, he was appointed Professor of Tama Art University in Tokyo and he stayed there until 2007.Lee Ufan, September 3 – October 2, 2009 Galerie Thaddeus Ropac, Paris. Yoshio Itagaki was one of his students in 1989–1991. He is Professor emeritus at Tama Art University.

In his early painting series, From Point and From Line (1972–84), Lee combines ground mineral pigment with animal-skin glue, characteristic of nihonga painting in which he was trained. Each brushstroke is applied slowly and is composed of several layers. Where the brush first makes contact with the canvas, the paint is thick, forming a 'ridge' that gradually becomes lighter. Rarely does his brush touch the surface more than three times.Lee Ufan, April 2 – May 10, 2008 Lisson Gallery, London. The artist refers to this as yohaku or the art of emptiness.[Lee Ufan, From Line, 1978] Christie's Post War and Contemporary Art Afternoon Session, 14 November 2007, New York. In the From Point works he adopted a similar method in order to produce a fading series of small, discrete, rectangular brushstokes. In 1991 Lee began his series of Correspondance paintings, which consist of just one or two grey-blue brushstrokes, made of a mixture of oil and crushed stone pigment, applied onto a large white surface. On average it takes Lee about a month to finish a painting, on canvases that typically measure about 60 by 90 inches, although they can vary in size from a few inches to 10 feet per side. He completes no more than 25 works a year. Lee Ufan Relatum with four stones and four irons 1978 Lee's sculptures, presenting dispersed arrangements of stones together with industrial materials like steel plates, rubber sheets, and glass panes, recast the discrete object as a network of relations based on parity between the viewer, materials, and site. In his sculptural series Relatum, each work consists of one or more light-colored round stones and dark, rectangular iron plates.Lee Ufan Lisson Gallery, London.  Exhibitions  From his first solo exhibition in Japan in 1967, Lee Ufan was invited by Manfred Schneckenburger to participate in Documenta VI (1977) in Kassel, and in 1969 and 1973 he represented Korea in the Bienal de São Paulo.Lee Ufan, January 21 – February 28, 2004 Lisson Gallery, London. His work was included in the 1992 Tate Liverpool exhibition, \\"Working With Nature: Traditional Thought in Contemporary Art from Korea\\", the first major survey of Korean art shown in Britain. In 1997 he had a solo exhibition at the Jeu de Paume, Paris and in 2001 the Kunstmuseum Bonn held a major retrospective of his work. Major exhibitions of Lee's painting and sculpture were later held at the Yokohama Museum of Art in 2005 and the Musée d'art Moderne Saint-Etienne in France in December 2005. The Situation Kunst (für Max Imdahl), a museum associated with Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, opened in 2006 with a gallery devoted to a permanent installation of Lee Ufan's paintings and a garden of his sculpture. However, it was Lee's \\"Resonance\\" exhibition at Palazzo Palumbo Fossati during the 2007 Venice Biennale that won him critical acclaim and a wider audience. In 2011, Lee Ufan: Marking Infinity was exhibited at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, organized by curator Alexandra Munroe, with over 90 works, from the 1960s to the present. Art critic Robert C. Morgan writes in The Brooklyn Rail: \\"What makes Lee Ufan’s work exhilarating is the structure—not in the pragmatic sense, but in the virtual/tactile sense; that is, the manner in which the 'weight' comes down to the gravity of seeing: we see and touch the work, less in actuality than conceptually.\\" In 2014, Lee was the seventh guest artist selected for the contemporary art program of the Palace of Versailles.Lee Ufan at Versailles Pace Gallery. after Jeff Koons in 2008, Xavier Veilhan in 2009, Takashi Murakami in 2010, Bernar Venet in 2011, Joana Vasconcelos in 2012 and Giuseppe Penone en 2013. In 2019, Lee became the first single-artist to take over the entire plaza of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in the museum's 44-year existence. A site-specific commission, Lee Ufan: Open Dimension features 10 new sculptures that will activate the museum's plaza through September 13, 2020. In 2020, Lee's work will be displayed at the STARS: Six Contemporary Artists from Japan to the World exhibition in Mori Art Museum in Tokyo, Japan. In the exhibition it will feature one of Lee's earlier works, \\"Relatum\\" along with the three-dimensional work, \\"Relatum - Dissonance\\" and two large-scale new works, \\"Dialogue\\" paintings.  Collections  Lee is represented in major museum collections including: MoMA, New York; Guggenheim Museum, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Tate Gallery, London; Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo Holland; the National Museums of Modern Art in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka; the Yokohama Museum of Art and the National Museum of Contemporary Art in Seoul. His work is also held in the permanent collection of the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art and the Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park.  Recognition  In 1997, Lee was invited to serve as visiting professor at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He received the UNESCO Prize at the Shanghai Biennale in 2000; the Ho-Am Prize of the Samsung Foundation in Korea in 2001; and the 13th Praemium Imperiale for painting in 2001. In 2010, the Lee Ufan Museum, a building designed by Tadao Ando and operated by Benesse, opened on the island of Naoshima, Japan.  Art market  Lee's paintings regularly fetch six-figure dollar sums at auction. A 1980 canvas with a series of vertical blue lines, for example, went for $410,000 at Sotheby's in New York in 2010.Edan Corkill (August 1, 2010), Korean at the forefront of Japan's modern art The Japan Times.

The term was originally coined for single proton, single electron processes that are concerted, but the definition has relaxed to include many related processes. Reactions that involve the concerted shift of a single electron and a single proton are often called Concerted Proton-Electron Transfer or CPET. In PCET, the proton and the electron (i) start from different orbitals and (ii) are transferred to different atomic orbitals. They transfer in a concerted elementary step. CPET contrast to step-wise mechanisms in which the electron and proton are transferred sequentially. :ET :[HX] + [M] → [HX]+ \\\\+ [M]− :PT :[HX] + [M] → [X]− \\\\+ [HM]+ :CPET :[HX] + [M] → [X] + [HM] Examples PCET is thought to be pervasive in redox reactions that appear to be net hydrogenations and dehydrogenations. Relevant examples include water oxidation in photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation and oxygen reduction in many pathways for respiration. Inorganic chemists often study simple reactions to test this mechanism, one example being the comproportionation of a Ru(II) aquo and a Ru(IV) oxo reactants: cis-[(bipy)2(py)RuIV(O)]2+ \\\\+ cis-[(bipy)2(py)RuII(OH2)]2+ → 2cis-[(bipy)2(py)RuIII(OH)]2+ PCET is also often invoked in electrochemical reactions where reduction is coupled to protonation or where oxidation is coupled to deprotonation. \\"Square scheme\\" used to discuss PCET (diagonal) vs discrete electron transfer and proton transfers. Although it is relatively simple to demonstrate that the electron and proton begin and end in different orbitals, it is more difficult to prove that they do not move sequentially. General sequential pathways are higher in energy than concerted pathways. The main evidence that PCET exists is that a number of reactions occur faster than expected for the sequential pathways. In the initial electron transfer (ET) mechanism, the initial redox event has a minimum thermodynamics barrier associate with the first step. Similarly, the initial proton transfer (PT) mechanism has a minimum barrier associated with the protons initial pKa. Variations on these minimum barriers are also considered. The important finding is that there are a number of reactions with rates greater than these minimum barriers would permit. This suggests a third mechanism lower in energy; the concerted PCET has been offered as this third mechanism. This assertion has also been supported by the observation of unusually large kinetic isotope effects (KIE). A typical method for establishing PCET pathway is to show that the individual ET and PT pathways operate at higher activation energy than the concerted pathway. In some literature, the definition of PCET has been extended to include the sequential mechanisms listed above. This confusion in the definition of PCET has led to the proposal of alternate names including electron transfer-proton transfer (ETPT), electron-proton transfer (EPT), and concerted proton-electron transfer (CPET). Also distinct is hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), in which the proton and electron start in the same orbitals and move together to the final orbital. HAT is recognized as a radical pathway, although the stoichiometry is similar to that for PCET.  References  1.Weinberg, D. R.; Gagliardi, C. J.; Hull, J. F.; Murphy, C. F.; Kent, C.

He wrote two sirventes and has three other works attributed to him. He participated in the wars of John Lackland in France. He was a son of the famous troubadour Bertran de Born and his first wife, Raimonda, born shortly after their marriage in 1179. His full brother was Itier and his half brothers were Bertran and Constantin, sons of his father's second marriage, to Felipa, in 1192. Since the younger Bertran would have only been fourteen at the time of the troubadour's activity, the filhs of the chansonniers must be the eldest son. Bertran and his brother Itier were dubbed sometime before 1192. The sirventes \\"Quan voi lo temps renovelar\\", written in 1206 in the style of his father, is attributed to \\"Bertran de Born\\" in the chansonniers, but since the elder Bertran had retired to the monastery of Dalon in 1197, this reference must be to his son. The sirventes is preceded by a long razo explaining the misfortunes of John Lackland and his evil, which is the subject of the poet's vitriol. An interesting cultural cross-reference occurs in the work when Bertran mentions the chanson de geste called the Siège d'Orange. Bertran's second sirventes, \\"Un sirventes voil obrar d'alegratge\\", was a personal love poem to his lady, Flor de Lis (unknown by name).

User maps are created by uploading and geotagging media. When media is associated with a location on a map, the media is known as a map article. Map articles may include text, photos, paths, icons, video, web links, and RSS feeds. Auto-Geotagging Mount Hood Ski Adventure Map: Geotagged and uploaded with a Sprint BlackBerry Pearl 8130 MapWith.Us implemented automatic geotagging (auto-geotagging) via cell phones in late 2007. The free mobile application allows users at remote locations to create real-time Web-based maps by uploading and geotagging photos with cell phones. The application works by utilizing several different capabilities within a modern cell phone. When an image is captured by the cell phone camera, the built-in GPS tags the image with the present location. The images are afterwards uploaded via the cell phone's Internet data connection to the MapWith.Us website, where they are compiled into photo album map articles. Maps, including mobile maps, are made private by default but users may publish the map with a password to a select audience, or without restriction. Collaborative Mapping MapWith.Us makes every map a collaborative map by default, with per-user data segmentation accomplished via overlays. Each overlay contains a group of map articles that can be toggled on and off by the viewer. For example, a map might include overlays of a hiking trip with photos and annotations of two hikers, Jane and Bob. The map was created and is owned by a third user, Nancy, but Jane and Bob liked her trail, so they added items. Nancy doesn't know Jane or Bob, but her published map contains their collaborative submissions, with the option of viewing the added content at any time. However, all access rights remain the privilege of the owner, who can detach overlays without directly affecting the user-submitted content. MapWith.Us also provides standard flavors of collaboration, letting map owners grant other users the right to add, edit, or delete map articles directly on a map's surface.  History  MapWith.Us was created by GeoMonkey, Inc., a Vancouver, Washington, United States-based company. In 2006, GeoMonkey introduced its geosocial website, allowing users to create and share collaborative maps. The first basic form of the tool was developed by Dr. Orest Pilskalns, a professor of Computer Science at Washington State University Vancouver, and students of his CS 420 course, Software Engineering in Practice. With support from the Washington State University Research Foundation, several graduating students (Kevin Karpenske, Adam McDonald, Jacob Moore) continued development on the tool to turn it into a commercially viable service. GeoMonkey launched its website in 2006 offering numerous tools, for several of which there are patents pending. The site operates under the tagline “A Community Worth Sharing.” In 2008, GeoMonkey, Inc. renamed its service to MapWith.Us to reflect its mapping roots and practical applications. The company simultaneously added several new services, most prominently its mobile application.

His first album 'Corruption e do so' (meaning in Krio, corruption is enough) struck a chord not only in Sierra Leone, but across Africa. Early life and music career Joseph Gerald Adolphus Cole, better known as Daddy Saj was born in 1978 in Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone to Creole parents. At the age of eight, the young Daddy Saj joined his church choir, where he was one of the most talented singers. In his teens he found inspiration from some American based Hip hop artists. Daddy Saj fled Sierra Leone as a refugee and moved to Conakry, Guinea in 1997 when the government of the then-president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was ousted by a group of soldiers in the Sierra Leonean army. He did this in order to save himself from being kidnapped as a child soldier. While in Guinea, he became more ingrained in music, and became friends with many other musicians from West Africa. When he return to Freetown, he linked up with one of Sierra Leone's most famous musicians and producers Jimmy B (born Jimmy Bangura). Jimmy B signed him to his Paradise Family label. Jimmy B had already had good exposure in music internationally. Jimmy was a pioneer in promoting Sierra Leone music to the outside world. As Daddy Saj put it \\"...so for me it was a great privilege to work with him, it was like being in a furnace; purifying myself for the tasks ahead [laughter].\\" Daddy Saj recorded several hit songs with the Paradise Family. He then left Paradise Family in 2003 to start his own label, Daddy Saj Entertainment. His debut album ‘Corruption’ was released in 2003, and quickly became a bestseller not only in Sierra Leone, but throughout many countries in Africa. Many Sierra Leoneans welcomed the song ‘Corruption E Do So’ (meaning in Krio “Corruption is Enough is Enough”) at a time when corrupt practices by authorities and had become rampant in the country. The song spread like wild fire in terms of the rate of airplay on radio stations, as well as its rotation in street bars, pubs and restaurants. However the airplay of the song did not last long. Some top government officials, including some members of parliament and ministers publicly announced their opinion that the song contained words which did not reflect the reality of the government of Sierra Leone. They warned that the song could become a catalyst for public unrest. Even though the Sierra Leone Anti-corruption Commission started to use the song as their theme in the fight against corruption – and even sponsored the distribution of it, politicians called for a ban of the song. Also, rumours started going around that there was a five million Leones price tag on for his arrest. His second album Densay Densay (meaning 'Rumours, Rumours' in Krio), also aimed to change some social attitudes, those towards sexual harassment. The album talks about women in Sierra Leone who often have no choice but to sleep with their employers to keep their jobs and support their family. His third album named 'Faya 4 Faya' was also an instant hit throughout West Africa.

She also served as editor of the American Archivist from 1946–1949. Norton was posthumously recognized in the December 1999 American Libraries article naming \\"100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century\\" for her influence on the archival profession.Kniffel, L., Sullivan, P., McCormick, E. (1999, December). \\"100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century\\". American Libraries, 30(11), 38. Norton promoted the establishment of archives as a profession separate from history or library science and developed the American archival tradition to emphasize an administrator/archivist rather than an historian/archivist. She encouraged learning through experimentation, practical usage, and community discussion. While editor of The American Archivist she emphasized technical rather than scholarly issues, believing that archival records were useful in ways other than scholarly research. By stressing the legal authority of government records, Norton believed archives could gain funding and government support through educating potential users about the legal protection records could provide them. Her influence and writings within the field of archives remain, for the large part, unchallenged. Biography =Early life= Margaret Cross Norton was born on July 7, 1891, to Samuel and Jennie Norton in Rockford, Illinois. Samuel worked as the deputy county clerk, and Jennie was Winnebago County's deputy county treasurer. As the daughter of civil servants, Norton was accustomed to discussions between her parents on how best to execute their record-keeping responsibilities. Her mother's bookkeeping skills and her father's references to the Illinois Revised Statutes helped Norton recognize the \\"practical and legal values of local government records\\". Norton later claimed that her archival philosophy was heavily influenced by her parents' work and household discussions.Margaret Cross Norton 1947 Norton obtained her bachelor's and master's degrees in History from the University of Chicago in 1913 and 1914, respectively. She then continued her education at the New York Library School in Albany, New York. After graduating with a Bachelor of Library Science in 1915, she worked as a cataloger for Vassar College Library in Poughkeepsie, New York. During this time, Norton attended an American Historical Association lecture by Waldo Gifford Leland, who emphasized the need for a national archives. While this lecture inspired Norton to pursue an archival career, she soon left her position at Vassar College to become a manuscripts assistant at the Indiana State Library in 1918. After working there a year, she returned to the University of Chicago to complete a fellowship, then again moved on to become a cataloger at the Missouri State Historical Society from 1920 to 1921. While working at the Missouri State Historical Society, Norton was offered the position of Illinois State Archivist. At the time she was 30 years old. Margaret Cross Norton 1948 =State archivist and professional impact= Norton accepted the position as Illinois State Archivist, but deferred her start date for more than four months to travel to the few archives that existed throughout the United States at the time. During her trip, she learned about the passive nature of the current American archives, and their practice to accept any records that were offered to their repository. In April 1922 she began her 35-year career as Illinois State Archivist. Within months of her starting at the State Archives, Norton traveled to the Mississippi Valley Historical Association's meeting in Des Moines, Iowa. While there, Norton visited Cassius Stiles, the agency head of the State Archives. Previously an administrative clerk, Stiles presented a new organization of record keeping. He arranged his collections by provenance and prepared administrative histories of each Iowa state department to aid in his work. A combination of this work style and Norton's early experience with public records aided in developing \\"her regard for the legal and administrative values of the records of government and the importance of their arrangement by source.\\" The availability of Hilary Jenkinson's Manual of Archive Administration \\"also confirmed Norton's theories on the \\"utility of governmental records and the importance of provenance.\\" As one of three divisions of the Illinois State Library, the Illinois State Archives reported directly to the Illinois Secretary of State and had a minimal assistant staff. Due to competition with the other two divisions, Norton often worked alone and faced budgetary restraints. While reorganizing and updating the archives, Norton discovered numerous historical and legal documents, including an 1823 Governor's letterbook explaining the chain of custody of a plot of land involved in a pending lawsuit. The information contained within this document was used to save millions of Illinois State dollars. In addition, Norton found other significant items, including an 1818 census record (when Illinois become a State in the Union), and records from the Illinois General Assembly during the time period in which Senator Abraham Lincoln and Senator Stephen Douglas were members. These discoveries demonstrated the legal and administrative value of archival records. In 1934, the Illinois State Arsenal Building was destroyed in a fire. The need for a new archival building that could protect the invaluable records housed within became a priority for Norton. She lobbied the state legislature for additional funding for a new, secure, and safe Archives building. Norton successfully secured $500,000 in appropriated funds from the General Assembly and $300,000 from the Federal Public Works Administration. Designed according to Margaret Norton Cross' specifications,[19] the new building was \\"designed to protect the state's records of enduring value from the hazards of fire, humidity, heat, vermin, theft and exposure.\\" At this time the Illinois State Archive building was only the third public archives building in the United States and during World War II, if an attack were imminent, the National Archives and Records Administration was prepared to move their most valuable materials to Norton's new building.  Archives as a respected profession  Norton became a well-known proponent for the promotion of the utilitarian value of archives. \\"One might conclude from the report that the ideal archivist is a scholar sitting in a remote ivory tower safeguarding records of interest only to the historian. In reality the archivist is at the very heart of his government and the archival establishment is a vital cog in its governmental machinery. Archives are legal records the loss of which might cause serious loss to citizens or the government.\\" -Margaret Cross Norton writing to dissent the verbiage put forth by the committee of archival training Margaret Cross Norton was also a founding member of the Society of American Archivists, acting in a variety of roles throughout her decades-long tenure. Those roles included the society's first vice president from 1936 to 1938, the society's fourth president from 1943 to 1945), and a Council member and editor of the American Archivist from 1937 to 1942 and 1946 respectively. Her activities in the American Historical Association (AHA), the American Library Association (ALA) and the National Association of State Libraries (NASL) are also well documented. Through these associations, she published writings and made public addresses broadcasting her focus on the utilitarian value of archives and a desire to distinguish the archive professionals as separate from historians and librarians. One such address at the 1929 annual AHA meeting was met with skepticism. Six months later, however, a very similar speech with accompanying article was accepted and well regarded by the NASL. This and many other papers became landmarks for the push towards professional recognition of archivists as skilled professionals.  Pioneer for gender equality  In addition to helping the archival field develop as a profession free from historians and librarians, Norton was also a pioneer woman of her time. From 1936 to 1972, only about 15% of chair positions were held by women and female membership in the SAA and other professional associations was very limited. Despite this, Norton made an impact on her colleagues. Her election as the first female president of the SAA was significant for the archival field and women in professional roles. She was one of the first females to hold many of her professional titles. She also wrote numerous articles on the administrative aspect of the field. In one article, admitted \\"she deliberately overemphasized the administrative roles of archivist rather than their role as historians because too many so-called archivists shirked service to their institutions while writing or studying history for their own self-edification.\\" =Retirement and afterward= Margaret Cross Norton Building Today Norton retired in 1957. After retirement, she made every effort to limit her influence and weight in the workings of the Illinois State Archives. She also mentioned that she much preferred to walk by the lake and watch the bunnies. When she died at the age of 92 she left all of her personal holdings to the SAA. Upon the SAA's examination of her house, they discovered a framed picture of the Illinois State Archives Building on her bedside nightstand.

Main characters ; : :Yoko is the titular heroine of the series. She has two main abilities. The first is , where she shoots a coiling strand of fire out of her fingertips. There is also , which is just a larger, more powerful variation. The second ability is shukichi, an ability which allows her to teleport objects. Although she is generally fearless in the face of evil spirits, she is terrified of normal dogs. Later on in the series, it is revealed that Yoko is not an inukami at all, but rather a kitsune (which would explain her fear of dogs; foxes and dogs are natural enemies) and the daughter of the legendary Dai Yoko (Great Fox Spirit). During an escape from Hake, she met the child Keita, who was with her for three days and shared his chocolate cake with her, which became one of her favorite things. Due to this incident, she wanted to become Keita's inukami to make a contract with him and made sure this would happen by scaring away the other inukami candidates Keita in fact did have. The manga version of Yoko is very child-like, much more mischievous, and has been hinted to be a nine tailed kitsune. ; : :Keita is the main protagonist of the series. He was considered a failure by his family due to his attitude towards their ancient duty to vanquish evil, treating it like a part time job, and his initial inability to find an inukami to bond with. Even though Yoko becomes his inukami and is fully interested in him, he has a bad habit of flirting with other girls; it is later revealed that Keita is mortified by the thought that, if he should develop a relationship with Yoko, he might become tamed by a woman and is not ready to settle down yet, in the anime this is replaced by the thought of Yoko having a litter of puppies rather than a human baby. He is frequently punished for his transgressions by Yoko, to whom he had to promise that he would be loyal to her, that he would be hers and that he would be her toy, to do with whatever she wanted, before she would contract with him. He wears a dog's collar as a symbol of this pact — an item he originally intended as his 'vow gift' to Yoko. In the anime series, Yoko has frequently landed him in jail by teleporting him into a public place without his clothes, causing him to be mistaken for a streaker and arrested for indecent exposure. Due to this, he has been named Ra-ō (Naked King) by the city's perverts (male and female alike). When he is naked, his groin is replaced by a child's drawing of an elephant. :Keita possesses considerable athletic skills, can make frog-shaped talismans up to around the size of his fist from rubber which he can use to make ranged attacks, and is a practitioner of xingyiquan. Despite his flaws, Keita has considerable redeeming qualities; he is determined, usually fearless, and loyal to his friends and to people under his protection. Keita's grandmother is the head of the Kawahira family. She has contracted a male inukami named Hake. In the manga, Keita is a chain smoker and is much more serious than his anime counterpart. He also appears to care for Yoko a great deal, but has problems taking her seriously because of her impulsive and mischievous behavior. ; :Karina is a police official who frequently calls on Keita and Yoko for help with cases that have a spirit, monster or magical event at its core. He has stated that he is collecting the \\"devil's toys\\" created by an ancient wizard named Sekidōsai. He has more than once gotten Keita off the hook when the latter is once again arrested for indecent exposure after angering Yoko. Karina wields an enchanted weapon he calls Angel Blade in combat. One of its signature attacks is the Holy Crush. It is later revealed that Sekidōsai is his ancestor; the two men look very much alike, except for their different hair colors. Their characters are very different as well; whereas Karina is a morally upstanding person, Sekidōsai is a pervert. However, it is later hinted at that, subconsciously, Karina may be a pervert, although definitely not to the same extent as his ancestor. He is frequently shown in a variety of fetishes, some granted by misinterpreted wishes and others the products of his subconscious desires. ; :Tomekichi is 'the traveling cat', a two-tailed nekomata (a feline spirit-being capable of walking upright and speech, said to grow to about the size of a dog) who is traveling around to search for a statue of Buddha. The kindly feline is doing so in honor of a priest who once took care of it and Tomekichi's ancestor cat which he loved and treated well, the priest ended up losing the statue of Budda before he died. Even though his main duty is to search for the statue, he is also seen taking various jobs, such as being a referee for a medium's tournament. Tomekichi apparently holds considerable esteem among his own people; on one occasion, he leads several other felines in the performing of a barrier spell-chant, which was cast in his name. ; :Hake is the Inukami of the head of the family who gives out most of the missions for the other members of the Kawahira family. He made a contract with the head of the family when she was near Keita's age on a Non- contract day (coincidentally her birthday fifty years before the start of the series), which he claims was because he was bored with his eternal, uneventful life. The contract item he was given are the decorative beads he wears. ; : :Kaoru is Keita's cousin. Contrary to Keita, Kaoru has a pack of ten Inukami and he is generally well-thought of, being more restrained and respectable of demeanor, although he is no less kind at heart. All Kaoru's inukami care deeply for him and he seems to return the sentiment, although his connection with Nadeshiko is strongest of all and is probably romantic in nature. Like Keita, Kaoru is quite athletic and a powerful magic-user; his signature move is to command the wind to deliver destructive blasts with the medium of an orchestra conductor's baton. In the anime only, it is later revealed that Kaoru is under a curse that planted him in a fake body, one that is close to dying. He shared this secret only with Nadeshiko, whom he revealed that he loved. He was raised by an evil magician that feeds off of the despair emitted by the people around him. Kaoru therefore had everything taken from him by the magician. He later sacrifices himself to save Nadeshiko, and it is then that he confesses his love. ;Hakusan Meikun :Hakusan is a large green frog who after breaking a rule in heaven became a fallen wizard. Keita made a contract with him due to his kindness and freed him from his sentence he was serving above earth in a cloud invisible to humans. In return Hakusan gave Keita the magical ability to make frogs explode on impact. Kaoru's pack ; : :Nadeshiko is an Inukami from the same area as Yoko, who has contracted with Keita's cousin, Kaoru. In sharp contrast to all other Inukami, she initially appears to be pacifistic and to regret the vanquishing of spirits and monsters. Her attitude and unwillingness to join in fights lead to her being temporarily expelled by her pack. Hake sends Nadeshiko to work with Keita as an example to Yoko, who has commented that Nadeshiko is the only one of Kaoru's pack of Inukami with any merit, but resents having her near her contractor, especially since Keita is clearly attracted to Nadeshiko. When the pack challenges Yoko so Nadeshiko might stay with Keita for good, they lose spectacularly and Nadeshiko ends up saving them, showing she has considerable courage and regaining the pack's appreciation by placing herself between Yoko and the pack alpha, Sendan. She constantly wears maid attire, and it is worth noting that Nadeshiko sees Keita's positive qualities from the start and may once have considered contracting with him. She and Kaoru seem to share a special bond that causes some jealousy from her pack-mates at times. Her item, like all the other girls, is a ring, but it is placed on the ring finger of her left hand. This may have been done to hint at how Nadeshiko and Kaoru feel about each other. Nadeshiko's senses are apparently keener than those of the other Inukami and Yoko has said that Nadeshiko has an ability the rest of her pack lacks. :In the anime, it is later revealed that Nadeshiko is a brutally powerful warrior if roused, the master of a power she calls 'the Hammer of Destruction', which smashes everything in its path. At the beginning of the series, Nadeshiko had 'given up her power to Heaven', due to an incident when she had lost herself in the frenzy of battle and nearly destroyed a human village. For a time, she refused to fight anyone or take a master - until she met Kaoru. Only when Kaoru is killed by Jasei does Nadeshiko reclaim the Hammer, which is powerful enough to overwhelm even Jasei. ; : :Tomohane is the youngest of the pack of Inukami that has contracted with Kaoru. She has the special ability to track the path of otherworldly entities and apparently has some skill with chemistry. As the youngest and weakest member of her pack, Tomohane fears that she will hold her allies back and so she tries very hard to keep up with the rest of the Inukami. After an adventure involving Keita and a minor spirit-creature - a mujina - which she later adopted as a pet and named Maron, Tomohane was the second of Kaoru's Inukami to recognize Keita's good side. ; : :Sendan is the leader of Kaoru's pack of Inukami. She seems strict and demanding, but appears so because she seems to have the wellbeing of her contractor and master at heart at all times. Only perfect service is good enough for 'Kaoru-sama'. Sendan is the younger sister of Hake, the male Inukami that serves the head of the Kawahira family. Like her older brother, she always carries around a fan. ; : :Igusa is another member of the pack that serves Kaoru. She has green hair, which she wears in two braids and she wears spectacles. Igusa secretly writes shōnen manga under the pseudonym 'Ruriko Saffron' and is extremely shy, causing her to be nervous when around Keita when he's in a perverted mood or when she perceives him to be thus. Despite her fear of perversion in men, she appears to be a closet fan of shōnen-ai situations herself - a fact she apparently hides from her fellow pack members. ; : :Tayune is the sporty-looking, short-haired member of the pack that serves Kaoru. Tayune is a physical person, quick to beat Keita when she feels he is being perverted towards her, quite loud and prideful. Oddly, she is apparently also deathly afraid of ghost stories and scary things. In combat, she sometimes wields a short staff as a blunt weapon. She is often teased by her fellow Inukami for being scared, and for supposedly getting romantically attached to Keita. Tayune is brutally powerful in combat, possibly second only to Nadeshiko when the latter is fully empowered among Kaoru's inukami. ; :A gray-haired Inukami who near-constantly wears a white lab coat and may be the oldest of Kaoru's Inukami. Gokyōya is studying seriously to become a doctor at some point and is close friends with two other of Kaoru's Inukami, Furano and Tensō. Before she became Kaoru's inukami, she was linked by contract to Keita's father, Sōta; she still has warm feelings for him, which she has in part transferred to Keita. Gokyōya may be the oldest of Kaoru's inukami, as she displays greater maturity than many of her pack members. ; & : :Twin sister Inukami, both contracted to Kaoru. They wear identical dresses, blue with white in the front. Their hair is a light purple tied into one ponytail, Imari's on the right of her head, Sayoka's on the left, held by a giant bead. The twins are usually in perfect agreement, the only time they are seen fighting each other is when they are gunning for the No. 1 rank in Kaoru's pack, or when under the influence of a love philter. They are almost never seen apart and finish each other's sentences often. The hobby of the twins is growing weird vegetables and plants and testing out their effects, mainly on Keita. In combat, they typically team up on enemies, attacking from opposing sides and sometimes taking items from their target as they strike. Although they are accepted members of Kaoru's pack, their pack-mates consider the twins sly and somewhat unscrupulous and untrustworthy. During the conflict over ranking within the pack, none of the other inukami involved wanted to accept any position beneath the twins, since they feared they would be forced to do all the twins' chores or suffer other troublesome situations. ; :An Inukami in Kaoru's pack who wears miko attire and has short yellow hair. She has a limited ability to predict the future, though this seems to be a random chance. Furano is one of the least bashful and shy of the inukami in service to Kaoru, as she showed willingness to strip for Keita so that she could obtain the No. 1 ranking in Kaoru's household. She responded positively to Karina having his hand on her breast and is also of age, as she confirmed when she said that she could \\"Perform a little extra fan service\\" since she was \\"An 18+ character\\". She is closest to Gokyōya and Tensō among her fellow inukami. ; :An Inukami in Kaoru's pack. She wears overalls and has long brown hair that falls down to cover her eyes. Tensou rarely talks, instead opting to draw on her sketch pad a picture of what the person just described. The drawings are done fast and with much detail and accuracy. When Tensō does speak, it is in a low, quiet voice, normally only supplementing what others say. She is perhaps the most reclusive of the Inukami, but is close friends with Gokyōya and Furano. Citizens of the Darkness A group whose name was conceived by Naoki Kawarazaki. Basically, it consists of every person who is 'outside society' in some manner, usually because of some sexual or personal habit which is generally considered undesirable. They consist of such people as peeping toms, otaku, flashers and lingerie thieves. They consider Keita to be one of them, to his immense chagrin. Despite their personal quirks, the Citizens of the Darkness come to the aid of the 'Citizens of the Light' (just about anyone who isn't one of them) several times against Sekidōsai and Jasei. As Kawarazaki has said, without the world of light, there can be no world of darkness. ; :Naoki Kawarazaki is Keita's senpai at school and a dedicated otaku. He pursues Yoko as he wants to use her as a model for a dōjinshi character, but unfortunately makes the mistake of complimenting her tail for its plumpness and comparing it to a tanuki's. Apparently, Inukami admire thin tails. He is a cosplay maniac, who enjoys seeing both men and women of any age dressed in \\"moe\\" female clothing. Kawarazaki is the first to name and organize the citizens of the darkness in the battle against Sekidōsai. He sometimes comes off as a pervert or psycho, (such as when he chases Tomohane around the entire city to use her as a model), but his intentions are always good, earning him respect from Keita and Yoko. ;Boss :A large, muscular man who terms himself a \\"lingerie artist,\\" but is simply called an underwear thief by most other people. He is quite knowledgeable on various brands and manufacturers of underwear and has received special training so he can remain unobserved while he goes about his 'life's path'. The Boss has on several occasions annoyed Kaoru's inukami by (attempting to) steal their lingerie, but he has also been instrumental in the battle to destroy the robot Xanthippe. Whenever he is seen, the Boss wears trousers, boots and lingerie; generally a pair of panties on his head and a bra on his chest. He apparently forms a team with the Peeping Doctor and the Chief Clerk. ;Peeping Doctor :A man dressed in a top hat and dinner suit, who apparently has developed his skills at hiding into the ability to become invisible. While most of the time he uses this power for peeping on women, Kaoru's inukami among them, he also uses it to help Keita during battles against Sekidōsai. He has considerable skill in the art of invisibility, as he can sneak past most of Kaoru's inukami, and was able to get close enough to Sekidōsai to steal his book, dodge his attacks and escape. The Peeping Doctor claims that he never returns to any place where he has been spotted and affects gentlemanly airs despite his unpleasant hobby. He apparently forms a team with Boss and the Chief Clerk. ;Chief Clerk :The third member of the team further consisting of the Boss and the Peeping Doctor, the Chief Clerk is a man who usually wears a three-piece suit and much resembles a bespectacled salaryman. The main physical difference between him and any other salaryman is that he constantly goes about tied up in bondage ropes. Another glaring difference is that most businessmen do not, generally speaking, go about begging to be punished; the Chief Clerk is a fervent masochist who constantly begs people to scold and/or punish him and managed to anger Yoko greatly by asking her to break him to her will. In combat, the Chief Clerk's masochistic tendencies sometimes come in use, as even Jasei's skeletal troops seemed to be taken aback by his aggressive solicitation of punishment. Main antagonists ;Boryoku no Umi (Sea of Violence) : :Boryoku no Umi is a Shinigami, a member of a race of powerful 'death gods/spirits' which, in the inukami setting, behave in a manner often hinting of insanity. A shinigami can do just about anything and will do anything - on a twisted whim. They delight in sowing death and destruction, with Boryoku no Umi being no exception. Boryoku no Umi first appears as the nemesis of the Shindō family, whose last member's guardian contracts Keita and Yoko to protect her. During his battle with Keita, he reveals that he has often granted the wishes of humans for the same price; by contract, he is allowed to murder the family members as they reach adulthood, one by one, until the whole family is dead. In the case of the Shindō family, Boryoku no Umi delighted in fighting any protectors they contracted with their own favored style of combat - and winning, killing all those who would not surrender. In addition to wearing a black shinigami robe, which deflects most ranged attacks, Boryoku no Umi is skilled in a vast array of martial arts and possesses powers of evil magic. Some of his favorite tricks are to awaken a person's deepest fears to paralyze them, or to evoke madness and terror by uttering a deafening shriek. In the end, it turns out a shinigami is not a match for an angered kitsune. ; : :Dai Yoko is, in the words of inukami Hake, \\"A great monster that manipulates the dark side, petrifies his opponents, specializes in fire based spells\\" - namely the Jaen and Dai Jaen techniques also used by Yoko, only much more powerful - \\"shakes the universe with a single leap and can do anything with his breath. He is strong and arrogant. When he feels irritated, he will destroy a whole mountain.\\" Dai Yoko is an elder kitsune who was sealed under a large stone by the founding patriarch of the Kawahira family and is also the father of Yoko, who he usually addresses as 'my dear daughter' or 'cute Yoko'. While all the things Hake said about him are true and do not even mention his ability to turn back time within a certain area, Dai Yoko is also a doting father. He is apparently incapable of being angry with his daughter, although she twice aided in sealing him to prevent him from doing damage. A bit of an embarrassing parent, Dai Yoko revealed he has been keeping a picture diary of every moment in his daughter's life, no matter how private. While he is initially dead-set against his daughter being together with Keita, he comes to change his mind, mainly because he is tricked into believing their relationship had already caused Yoko to become pregnant. In past times, Dai Yoko apparently defeated the evil wizard Sekidōsai in single combat. The reason he came up against the Kawahira family is that he wanted to conquer their mountain so his daughter would have a place to nap. ; : :Sekidōsai is a wizard of terrible power, who has managed to live well over 400 years. Of late, he has been forced to go into hiding inside a painting he made when he lost his powers, but he has already made plans to revive himself. Sekidōsai is the ancestor of Shirou Karina, who bears a striking resemblance to him. The main external difference is that Sekidōsai has a different hairstyle and white-blond hair. The characters of the two men are diametrically opposed; where Karina is a defender of justice and an agent of the law, Sekidōsai's main desire is to create a world without restrictions, where all can live according to their very darkest desires. In addition, Sekidōsai is a voluntary exhibitionist. :During his long life, Sekidōsai created several powerful items: :#The book which caused the rising of the 'demon' in the first episode of Inukami, which can apparently also reflect attacks made against its bearer. :#The mechanical rooster Socrates, which can change the clothing of people within a certain range to match the strongest desires of a person in its vicinity. :#A robot oddly named Xanthippe, whose main weapon is a drill, set in its groin. :#The Daisakkai, which appears to be a kind of magical computer that initially serves to govern the world inside Sekidōsai's painting refuge. Later, it manages Sekidōsai's stolen energies. Daisakkai's ultimate purpose is to use the energies it receives to grant any single wish. ;Jasei :Jasei is a wizard who claims to have 'mastered the art of magic'. His human body was destroyed during a magical experiment, but he lives on in a state reminiscent of lichdom, with a large gem in what would have been his abdomen apparently sustaining his existence on Earth. Jasei powers his unnatural existence by feeding on despair. He is powerful and cunning, willing to concoct schemes which may take years to come to fruition, in order to reap the greatest possible amount of despair for his personal enjoyment. One example of this was his raising and tutoring Kaoru Kawahira to be a good and kind person, after having placed the boy's soul in a counterfeit body, all with the eventual goal of revealing the depth of his own evil, sadism and treachery so Kaoru's heart and spirit would be broken. Jasei is an even more powerful wizard than Sekidōsai, as he proved capable of hoodwinking the latter without his even noticing, and after harnessing Dai Yoko, and Sekidōsai's powers wields enough of it to overwhelm most of the Inukami and Yoko combined.

It was first surveyed in 1815. The meridian, a north-south line, starts from the old mouth of the Arkansas River and runs north. Another survey line related to it is the base line running west from the old mouth of the St. Francis River. These survey lines govern all land surveys in four states and a large portion of the land surveys for two more. Monuments have been erected where the two lines meet at , and the surveyors' skill has been commemorated at the Louisiana Purchase State Park in eastern Arkansas. The Fifth principal meridian is nearly coincident with 91° 3′ 42″ longitude west from the Greenwich meridian. In Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, and North Dakota, it is the sole principal meridian used in the PLSS. It is used in Minnesota west of the Mississippi River and west of the third guide meridian north of the river. In South Dakota the meridian covers roughly the eastern half of the state: all land east of the Missouri River plus the surveys on the west side of the river to a limiting line following the third guide meridian of the sixth principal meridian system, White River, and the west and north boundaries of the Lower Brule Indian Reservation. Marker at the point of beginning in a headwater swamp in Arkansas This was the first meridian of the new Louisiana Purchase, which covered about . There was much discussion regarding where the baseline would be, with the primary candidate originally being an extension of the Third principal meridian baseline. However, it was ultimately decided to use the confluence of the St. Francis River and the Mississippi River for the base line, and the confluence of the Arkansas and Mississippi for the meridian. Two survey teams started on the same day and proceed north (led by Prospect K. Robbins) and west (led by Joseph C. Brown), respectively. The initial point was located as the place where these surveyed lines intersected (this is one of many examples where the meridian line and base line determined the initial point, rather than the other way around). As a result the initial point is in the middle of a high water swamp, on land that belonged to the Davidsons of Marvell, Arkansas. The family made this portion of their farm available to the state, and today the site, Louisiana Purchase State Park, consists of a boardwalk leading from a parking lot into the swamp. At the terminus of the boardwalk there is a granite monument which reads, \\"This stone marks the base established Nov. 10, 1815 from which the lands of the Louisiana Purchase were surveyed by United State Engineers, the first survey from this point was made to satisfy the claims of the soldiers of the War of 1812, with land bounties.

Italian Baroque (or Barocco) is a stylistic period in Italian history and art that spanned from the late 16th century to the early 18th century. History The early 17th century marked a time of change for those of the Roman Catholic religion, a symbolization of their strength as a congregation and the intelligence of their creative minds. In response to the Protestant Reformation of the earlier 16th century, Roman Catholics embarked on a program of restoration, a new way of living that became known as the Counter Reformation. The purpose of the Counter Reformation was aimed at remedying some of the abuses challenged by the Protestants earlier in the century.John Varriano, Italian Baroque and Rococo Architecture, New York: Oxford University Press, 1986. Within the church, a renewed Catholic culture was imposed on Italian society. It started with the Council of Trent, imposed by Pope Paul III, a commission of cardinals who came together to address issues of the Catholic Church and regain faith among worshipers.Blakemore, 1997 This resulted in guidelines established by the Church for the commissioning work of artists to communicate biblical truths and ideals. Secular construction New secular construction resulted from the establishment of pioneering religious orders. Between 1524 and 1575, the Barnabite, Jesuit, Oratorian and Theatine orders came into being, and as their influence spread, more and more new churches began being built. By 1725, there were 323 churches in Rome alone, serving a permanent population of fewer than 150,000 people. Because of this rapid growth in church building, it became the responsibility of these religious orders to spread the word of Catholicism to the population. Religious books were increasingly being printed in Venice for distribution to the clergy and literate worshipers, passed out during mass and offering continuous reminders of the presence of Christ on everyday life.Holmes, 1997 Churches had now become a place for encouragement- spaces of expansive beauty and decoration. The Roman Church realized the power that art could have to inspire and, therefore, they became preoccupied with extravagance and display. Their intent was to overwhelm viewers, catch their attention, and make them want to see more. Entering a Baroque church where visual space, music and ceremony were combined was a powerful device for securing loyalty of congregations. The bigger and more beautiful the space, the more people wanted to go. Complex geometry, curving and intricate stairway arrangements and large-scale sculptural ornamentation offered a sense of movement and mystery within the space. Il Gesù was the first of many Counter-Reformation churches built in Rome; serving as the mother church of the new Jesuit order. Designed by Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola, the church of Il Gesù soon became the prototype for the Baroque churches that the Jesuit order built or rebuilt during the Counter-Reformation era. The interior of the Gesu was a study of the grandeur that Roman classicism could offer when combined with simplicity in large scale. High windows puncture the nave's barrel vault, as a ring of windows in the drum of the dome bring beams of natural light into the interior, creating a dramatic contrast of light and darkness in relatively dim space. The plan of Il Gesù became the standard for churches for years to come; a breakaway from the ideal central-plan church of the Renaissance into something new. The Latin Cross variation created a greater sense of spatial unification within the space. In his design for the church of Il Gesù, Vignola broadened the nave and made the transepts and side chapels smaller, creating a better and brighter focal point for the main space and allowing more room for the congregation at mass. The cultural patronage of the pope in Rome was an extreme case of diversity in comparison with surrounding Italian city-states. The pope served his role as not only the head of the Catholic Church, but as the acting ruler for the city. He [the pope] controlled what was built and who was commissioned to build it. In 1605, at the very beginning of his pontificate, Pope Paul V commissioned Carlo Maderno to redesign St. Peter's Basilica. It was at the age of 72, in 1546, when Michelangelo first took hold of the unfinished rebuilding project started by Bramante. When Michelangelo died, the construction of the, then, Greek-cross section surrounding the Papal altar and the tomb of Peter had been completed only as far as the top of the drum. The dome then became completed, with some modifications, by Giacomo della Porta in 1590.Blakemore, 1997, p.143 It was the continuous debates over the religious and aesthetic benefits of keeping the Greek-cross plan or enhancing the space by extending it into Latin-cross plan that led Paul V to boldly commission for Maderno's services. Maderno's initial projects, including the long nave addition, which created a new Latin-Cross solution upon the ground plan, the façade and the portico, became an instantly recognizable image of Rome and the heart and spirit of Catholic Christianity. To settle the problem of excess open space within the updated basilica, Pope Urban VII commissioned Gian Lorenzo Bernini to design the internal space. Bernini became responsible for much of the internal appearance of the basilica, notably the baldacchino (1624–33) erected over the dome of St. Peter. It acts as a main focal point in the space, combining both sculpture and architecture into a unified art piece. Complex in form and ornate with sculpture, the baldacchino serves as a great example of the Baroque ‘style’, massive and ornate, glorifying the church and the Catholic religion. This space is an example of quadratura, an attempt to create an illusion through architecture, painting, and sculpture. Painting and sculpture create an illusion of never-ending height and dramatic composition. Interiors Pietro da Cortona was one of the painters of the 17th century who employed this illusionist way of painting. Among his most important commissions were the frescoes he painted for the Palace of the Barberini family. Pietro da Cortona's compositions were the largest decorative frescoes executed in Rome since the work of Michelangelo at the Sistine Chapel. Harold Osborne, author of The Oxford Companion of Art, comments on his work the ‘Divine Providence’ completed for the Barberini palace: Stucco became one of the overall key characteristics of Baroque interiors, enhancing wall spaces, niches, and ceilings. It was the reverence for the church that provided funding for more and more building projects which, in turn, brought even more worshipers into the city –as many as five times the permanent population during a Holy Year. With this boom in tourism, a continuing job opportunity arose for the citizens of Rome. The construction industry in Rome soon became the largest employer in the city. Throughout Italy inspiring architects received training on-the-job. In most parts of Italy, local architects satisfied building needs, but in Rome architects were specifically commissioned either by the Papal state or family dynasties to work on their projects. Families associated with the papacy, including the Barberini, Borghese, Chigi and Pamphili, were extremely well off and, in turn, some of the richest and grandest villas were constructed for them. Competition between these ruling families meant they rivaled each other in the elaborateness of the detailing in their homes as well as in the churches they supported. The hot climate of Italy influenced the choosing of materials and planning of architecture. For flooring, tile, marble and stone were used; terrazzo flooring, created by chips of marble case into cement, was also sometimes used in interiors. All of these materials helped cool the space. Consideration of geographic location was also examined during construction planning. For example, on average, Sicily receives 1,000 more hours of sunshine each year than Turin. The facades in Sicilian-built architecture seem extremely massive in comparison to contemporary ones in the Italian mainland. Regional variations like this can be seen throughout Italy, including Rome. The role of furniture in Roman interiors was to emphasize social status and to simply add a decorative element to the interior. Carving was the preferred method of decorating furniture; while walnut was the primary furniture wood. Emphasis for furniture was on carved and turned members, which were elaborately placed on high-back armchairs and tables. Spatial relationships for the interior in the age of the Baroque changed from the block structure of the Renaissance to more open planning. Grand proportions were typical in Baroque interiors. The salone was given high priority, again with an emphasis on exaggerated decoration, this time incorporating accents into the room at different heights. Niches, entablatures, pediments and wall reliefs created dynamics within the space.  See also  * Timeline of Italian artists to 1800 * Massimo Colella, Il Barocco sabaudo tra mecenatismo e retorica.

The Musgrave Baronetcy, of Hartley Castle in the County of Westmorland, was created in the Baronetage of England on 29 June 1611 for Richard Musgrave, Member of Parliament for Westmorland.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage 1900 He was the member of a family that had been settled at Musgrave in Westmorland for many centuries and of which an earlier member, Thomas Musgrave, was summoned to the House of Lords as Baron Musgrave in 1350 (see this title for more information). The second Baronet represented Westmorland in the House of Commons and served with distinction as a Royalist in the Civil War. He was offered a peerage as Baron Musgrave, of Hartley Castle in the County of Westmorland, but did not take up the patent. The fourth Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Carlisle, Westmorland, Appleby, Oxford University and Totnes. The fifth Baronet represented Carlisle and Cumberland in Parliament while the sixth Baronet represented Westmorland. The eighth Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Petersfield and Carlisle and the eleventh Baronet sat for Cumberland East and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Westmorland. The family seat was Hartley Castle, near Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria. The Musgrave Baronetcy, of Hayton Castle in the County of Cumberland, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 20 October 1638 for Edward Musgrave. The third Baronet represented Cumberland in the House of Commons. The title became extinct on the death of the tenth Baronet in 1875. The Musgrave Baronetcy, of Tourin in the County of Waterford, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 2 December 1782 for Richard Musgrave, a member of the Irish House of Commons, with remainder in default of male issue of his own to his younger brothers and the heirs male of the body. On his death in 1818 he was succeeded according to the special remainder by his younger brother Christopher Frederick, the second Baronet. The third Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for County Waterford. The fourth Baronet served as Lord-Lieutenant of County Waterford. The family seat was Tourin House, near Cappoquin, County Waterford. The Musgrave Baronetcy, of Drumglass in the County of Antrim, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 4 March 1897 for the industrialist and philanthropist James Musgrave.

The Inner Harmony of the Japanese House The term originally meant a study and a place for lectures on the sūtra within a temple, but later it came to mean just a drawing room or study.Iwanami Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version From this room takes its name the shoin-zukuri style. In a shoin-zukuri building, the shoin is the zashiki, a tatami-room dedicated to the reception of guests. The emerging architecture of the Muromachi period was subsequently influenced by the increasing use and appearance of shoin. One of the most noticeable changes in architecture to arise from the shoin came from the practice of lining their floors with tatami mats. Since tatami mats have a standardized size the floor plans for shoin rooms had to be developed around the proportions of the tatami mat; this in turn affected the proportions of doors, the height of rooms, and other aspects of the structure. Before the shoin popularized the practice of lining floors with tatami mats it had been standard to only bring out a single tatami mat for the highest-ranking person in the room to sit on. The architecture surrounding and influenced by the shoin quickly developed many other distinguishing features. Since the guests sat on the floor instead of on furniture, they were positioned at a lower vantage point than their Chinese counterparts who were accustomed to using furniture. This lower vantage point generated such developments as the suspended ceilings which functioned to make the room feel less expansive, and also resulted in the ceilings rafters being no longer visible as they were in China. The new suspended ceilings also allowed for more elaborate decoration, resulting in many highly ornate suspended ceilings in addition to the much simpler ones. Another characteristic development to arise from the lower vantage point were the tokonoma and chigaidana. The tokonoma was an elevated recess built into the wall to create a space for displaying the Chinese art which was popular at the time at a comfortable eye level. The chigaidana, or \\"staggered shelves\\", were shelving structures built into the tokonoma to display smaller objects. Occurring at the same time as the development of the shoin architecture, the fusuma, or \\"sliding doors\\", were becoming a popular means to divide rooms. As a result, columns began to be created that were square-shaped to accommodate the sliding doors. The asymmetry of the tokonoma and chigaidana pair, as well as the squared pillars differentiated the shoin design with the Chinese design at the time which preferred symmetric pairs of furniture and round pillars. Soon after its advent shoin architecture became associated with these evolving elements as it became the predominant format for formal gathering rooms.

History The Bridewell Taxis shone brightly but briefly as one of the few bands from east of the Pennines to make an impact on what was to become known as the Madchester scene. Early years The group came together in Leeds during 1987 and were originally called Morality Play. Their first public performances were at an Unemployed Music project in Leeds that also helped launch contemporary other Leeds collaborations including Nightmares on Wax ((George Evelyn/John Halnon)) and Demo featuring singer/bassist Bobbi (iddod) Moore (iddod, The Postcards,8 Miles High), drums/Percussion Mark Gorman (Demo, Snatch), Lead guitar/Rhythm Guitar Shaun Greaves (The Postcards) Mick Roberts at that time had been working on song lyrics ( Unlimited Days, Just Good Friends, In God We Trust) and ideas with childhood friend John Halnon (NOW) and Marcus Waite (Violet Hour). After singer Mick Roberts joined, the band changed its name to The Bridewell Taxis, a nickname for the police vans that delivered drunks and criminals to the town's police station, or Bridewell, situated under the Leeds Town Hall. A number of the band were familiar with this form of transport. Rehearsals were often intense fractious occasions above the Market District Boys Club. From their very first gig in 1988 at the Royal Park, with support Pale Saints, it was apparent that the band were offering a different sound and sensibility to their immediate Leeds peers such as The Wedding Present, Cud and the Pale Saints. Whilst the band members all hailed from east Leeds, unlike their former student rivals (although Mick Roberts was originally from Wales), they had more in common with the growing northern music scene in Lancashire featuring Liverpool-based bands such as The La's, The Real People and The Farm and the early Inspiral Carpets, The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays from Manchester. The Taxis had a unique selling point with the arrival of Chris Walton on trombone which only served to emphasise the hard, fast, Northern Soul beat they often used whilst all around were slipping into the funky drummer, baggy beat. The Taxis' place in the scheme of things was cemented by a prestigious support slot at The Happy Monday's first Leeds gig on 28 February 1989 at The Warehouse. Both bands ended up having internal fights on stage that night, keyboardist Gary Wilson attacking guitarist Sean McElhone after the latter's instrument malfunctioned. Over the next six months regular gigging including support slots with The Farm and Cud consolidated the band's position as up and coming band with a large local following. The band's first release was a blue flexi-disc, \\"Lies\\" c/w \\"Just Good Friends\\" given away free with a Wakefield fanzine which cost 20p. The pressing soon sold out and a few years later, at the height of their popularity, the flexi-disc was changing hands for over £20. London-based publishers, Empire Music, part of China Records, offered the band a publishing deal in late 1989. Take off The band's next break came in Autumn when the Inspiral Carpets invited them onto their Find Out Why national tour as support act (29 August to 4 September). One night on the tour (3 September) would see a strange hybrid band take the stage at Burberry's Birmingham when a local, third on the bill act failed to show. Inspiral's roadie at the time was Noel Gallagher and he performed a few impromptu jams and Beatles covers on guitar together with Inspiral Craig on drums, Bridewell Mick on vocals, Bridewell Sean on guitar and Bridewell sound engineer and manager Alaric Neville on bass, all to a handful of disinterested punters. The urgent need for a release to go with the tour had led to the band's manager, along with a businessman-fan Dave Bell, to fund their first EP, Just Good Friends, released on their own Stolen Records in the Autumn of 1989. It reached number 18 on the UK Indie Chart. On 1 October the band were on the bill at the final Futurama festival in Bradford run by legendary Leeds promoter John Keenan, along with the best of the crop of bands that would make waves in 1990. The Taxis started 1990 as full-time musicians with their second single, \\"Give In\\" c/w \\"Whole Damn Nation\\" which featured a dance remix of the later track. This served to get their name and music out into the growing cross-over dance scene. Many of the indie concerts of this era would feature a DJ dance set that started after the band finished, bringing the warehouse rave vibe into regular venues for the first time. The band were now headlining their own gigs in the north of England and became regulars at such venues as the Warehouse in Leeds, The Boardwalk in Manchester and The Leadmill in Sheffield. Another big support slot this time with The Stone Roses put them in the public's eye along with some positive live reviews in the national music press. On 19 April they became the first non-Manchester band to play the Factory Records night in Paris at the La Locomotive Club within the Moulin Rouge. The band booked coaches for Leeds and Manchester fans to join them in France for the weekend. The gig was successful but the aftermath less so. A semi-clothed Mick was chased through the streets over an extortionate brothel bar bill and was later seen three floors up on a narrow ledge of the hotel looking like he was about to jump to his death, he was coaxed back inside but passed out in his room. He hung his coat on a light fitting and in the middle of the night the hotel fire alarms went off with everyone evacuated to the street below as acrid smoke from a burning sports top filled the building. Mick's room door was forced open and he was resuscitated.The Expression She Pulled, issue 2, \\"The Bridewell Taxis in Paris, (June 1990) A song for the Cage album came out of the near death experience that night, \\"Paris\\". Third single \\"Honesty\\" proved a crowd favourite and highlighted songwriter Mick Roberts growing realist style. It took the form of dialogue between him and his long suffering partner; her trying to persuade him to give up crime and him explaining \\"Honesty looks good on you, it's not for fools like me, I've felt its hands around my neck and I couldn't start to breath\\". This was no empty song writing exercise as some members of the band had been arrested for selling pills and speed after a gig at The Moles Club, Bath. It was a time when the more gentile southern youth considered any scally with a northern accent as having access to top drugs unavailable to them, an invitation the Taxis found hard to pass by. Prison was only avoided in Bath when the remaining bag of disco biscuits (MDMA) was found to contain vitamin pills. Later Mick narrowly avoided a prison sentence again after being convicted of stealing carpets from the Hilton hotel in Leeds. The video for Honesty featured a scene with Mick and drummer Glenn Scullion shoplifting clothes and then bumping into a real policeman, clearly on purpose. The video was banned by MTV and the Chart Show although \\"Honesty\\" would still make the Indie Top 10. The band were booked to play the Mean Fiddler Stage at Reading Festival on 26 August and compere John Peel, who had already been playing their singles, made a point of catching the set, offering a Peel Session as a result. The session was broadcast on 18 September. Fourth single \\"Spirit\\" came out on 5 November, allied to a LFO remix. It would be both the highpoint of the band's career and the start of their troubles. On the eve of the first day's recording session Mick disappeared following a domestic crisis. The rest of the band carried on recording backing tracks while roadies and friends searched the city. He was found at the end of a two- day drinking binge and the vocal on the recording was coaxed out of the still drunk singer a line at a time, although he couldn't remember the chorus so the track was released without one. \\"Spirit\\" was the band's biggest selling release, generating a lot of airplay, press coverage and compilation releases. The accompanying 22-date national tour filled most of November and included such major university venues as Leeds, Sheffield, Warwick and Kent, along with The Haçienda club in Manchester which would be filmed for a video release. After a short break, December saw the band on a four date tour of Scotland. They were now being courted by a number of major record labels; CBS, BMG, EMI, London Records and Chrysalis. Crash landing Spirit's strong showing in the indie charts finally persuaded Chrysalis Records to offer the band a record deal at the end of the year. At a showcase London date at the Camden Palace arranged by the company's PR staff, trouble erupted between travelling Leeds fans and locals. Members of the band, who had taken full advantage of the free hospitality on offer, left the stage to join in the fight. The band's next gig was at Bradford Queens Hall, also with Chrysalis A&R; in attendance. After the first few songs it became apparent that various band members were in different chemically-altered states of mind; the concert soon fell apart as band members left the stage one by one. Chrysalis proceeded to replace the Bridewell Taxis in their plans with their second choice Yorkshire indie band, The Poppy Factory whose leader, Mick Dale would go on to find fame as part of Embrace. On 14 January 1991, after an all day drinking session in an east Leeds pub, The Station at Cross Gates, singer Mick Roberts was caught up in a bar room brawl which resulted in him being stabbed in the throat and neck. An artery was severed and he narrowly survived massive blood loss, being taken by ambulance to the nearby St James's University Hospital. The story was covered by both the Daily Mirror and Daily Star as well as the national music press. A period of re-constructive surgery followed with all band activity, touring, rehearsing and writing curtailed. By the end of March the need for a new release was pressing. As no new songs had been written a cover of Blue Öyster Cult's \\"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\\" was recorded, the track's title making a reference to Mick's recent brush with death. It came out as their fifth single on 13 May. The band's original pacey and raw style was replaced with a slowed down and polished production by Chris Nagle but the track wasn't well reviewed. Following a national headline tour in May the band toured with the reformed Buzzcocks in June. The LP \\"Invisible To You\\" was a collection of the Stolen Records releases to date with two new tracks, although these were actually recorded at the Spirit session during Mick's absence. It was launched at a massive home town concert at Leeds Town Hall on 5 July which was also filmed for a video release. This was to prove the last gig with Chris Walton. Carl A. Finlow was subsequently recruited to the line up on keyboards with the intention of adding a more programmed, dance element to the band. Despite its relative lack of new material, \\"Invisible\\" sold well and remained in the indie charts for six weeks. As a result, Sony CBS offered a provisional record deal, funding the recording of four new tracks on 12 September for a planned single, \\"Smile\\". The tracks as delivered were rejected and the release cancelled, the reported reason being that they sounded unlike the existing, successful album. Despite guitarist Sean McElhone announcing he was leaving, a pre-Christmas concert was booked at the Warehouse, Leeds on 11 December. The concert was poorly attended and beset with technical problems. The band left the stage to boos from their home town audience and split up that night.The Expression She Pulled Vol 8, Leeds (1991) Resurrection The Bridewells' final performance at the Warehouse, Leeds, March 1993. After the breakup of the original line up, Mick Roberts, Carl A. Finlow and Alaric Neville continued to write and play together. Following a request for a Motown cover version from Imaginary Records Chris Walton re-joined. Marvin Gaye's Inner City Blues was demoed along with a handful of new songs. A cassette of the session found its way to Phil Manzanera, Roxy Music guitarist, studio and label owner. He offered an album and single deal on the condition the band could play live to support the release. A rhythm section was quickly hired; Keith Manasseh Jackson from Leeds band \\"Nuff Sed\\" on drums and Chris Harrop from The Ukrainians on bass. To replicate the overdubbed brass live, Andy Stocks joined on trumpet. Since the stabbing Mick's hearing had been degenerating leading to vocal problems so a second singer was added, Michelle Jasmin formally of fellow Leeds band \\"The Windowpanes\\". The band played its first gig at the Warehouse, Leeds on 17 February 1992, billed as The Bridewells. An EP, \\"Smile I Still Care\\" was recorded at Phil Manzanera's studio in Chertsey, West London, in late March. Sean McElhone contributed guitar to the title track and Phil Manzanera provided the guitar solo for \\"World of Lies\\" It was released on Expression Records on 15 June and the band toured with The High. In late June the band were back in the studio to record the album \\"Cage\\" also released by Expression on 19 October. A national tour followed, culminating in a home town gig at the Warehouse, Leeds on 17 November. The band (minus Mick) provided the backing for BMG artist Christine Levine on one track \\"The Devil Inside You\\" It had become apparent during the recording of the album that Mick's loss of hearing was having an adverse effect on the volume he needed for monitoring and live gigs were becoming difficult. This combined with financial troubles at Expression effectively brought the band to a halt. The final act was a performance filmed at the Warehouse for ITV featuring the album title track, \\"Cage\\" and a new song \\"World Stop Turning\\", taped on 23 March 1993. Postscript Following the final break up of the band Mick Roberts and Sean McElhone were briefly re-united in the mid-1990s in a local Leeds band \\"Home\\" who played a handful of gigs in the city. Original bass player Simon Scot became a successful DJ. Chris Walton and Andy Stocks provided the brass for The Ukrainians track \\"Polityka\\" on the album \\"Kultura\\" (Cooking Vinyl, 1994), Carl A. Finlow returned to producing dance music initially in partnership with DJ Ralph Lawson. Alaric Neville continued as a sound engineer and producer working principally with The Ukrainians, Oysterband, and Chumbawamba, Keith Manasseh Jackson joined Stomp (dance troupe), Chris Harrop became the guitarist in Black Star Liner. In 2005, prompted by the wave of successful reformations among their contemporaries including The Happy Mondays, three original members, Mick Roberts, Sean McElhone and Glenn Scullion, got back together to play some dates. They were joined by twins James (bass) and Jools Metcalfe (guitar). The band played a sell-out reunion gig in Leeds in October 2005 and followed that with two more home town dates. The following year, the band embarked on a mini-tour, kicking off with a sell-out at the Hope and Anchor, Islington, and ending with a final show for over 1,000 at Leeds University Union. The band split again in June 2006. In 2014 the Bridewell's former guitarist, Jools Metcalfe, announced he was to stand as UKIP candidate for Leeds NW in the 2015 General Election declaring he was a 'local politician standing for local culture and values' Mick is continuing to write, perform and explore new ideas with childhood friend and expat John Halnon, effectively coming full circle, and intends to release new material of an immersive nature in 2018.

It was a conventional single-bay biplane with unstaggered wings of equal span. It was equipped with fixed tailskid undercarriage, and the pilot and instructor sat in tandem, open cockpits. The design was submitted to the Romanian Air Force for consideration, and elicited sufficient interest to result in an order for two prototypes to be placed. Upon delivery, one of the aircraft was used for flight tests, while the other was tested on the ground. After nearly a year, an order for 10 aircraft was placed, which were delivered to the air force's pilot training school at Tecuci. The new trainer soon found recognition, flown by SET chief test pilot Gheorghe Stefanescu to first place in the aerobatics competition at the 1929 Romanian national aviation meet, and by Lt Octav Oculeanu to win the Aviator Mircea Zorileanu Cup at Bucharest later that year. In December 1930, the air force placed an order for 20 more aircraft in two slightly different batches.

Sited at two locations to the east and west of Singapore Changi Airport, it co-shares runway facilities with the civilian airport and currently occupies a third runway slated for future expansion for civilian use by Singapore Changi Airport. Together, the two airfields house 121 Squadron, 112 Squadron, No 145 Squadron, the Field Defence Squadron, the Air Logistics Squadron and the Airfield Maintenance Squadron. The air base badge carries the motto Together in Excellence. History =RAF Changi= RAF Changi badge A satellite image of RAF Changi taken during the United States Department of Defense's Corona KH-4 reconnaissance satellite programme on 2 April 1963 (Singapore time) The area where Changi Air Base now sits was once a large encampment of British Army artillery and combat engineer units based in Singapore between the mid-1930s up until 1942, when the island fell under Japanese occupation after the British surrender that year. This large encampment, comprising several barracks and military administrative buildings such as Roberts Barrack and Selarang Camp, were used together with the nearby Changi Prison (previously a maximum-security incarceration complex for civilians) for housing many of the Allied prisoners-of-war (POWs) after Japan took over control of Singapore. The construction of the current airfield in Changi Air Base was initiated by the occupying Imperial Japanese military forces using those same Allied POWs imprisoned in the Changi area as forced labourers, building two roughly-paved landing strips between 1943 and 1944, intersecting in a cross-shaped layout and in approximately north-south and east-west directions (similar to what was done at Kallang Airport by Japanese occupation forces) to allow planes to land and takeoff in any possible direction all around. This Japanese-built airfield facility became a Royal Air Force station after the Japanese occupation in Singapore abruptly ended following the Japanese surrender in 1945 and was then renamed as RAF Changi in 1946 by the returning British military authorities. Now, it was the newly-imprisoned Japanese troops under British captivity which were then made to improve both runways, reinforcing the north-south runway for military aircraft and adding perforated steel plates on the east-west runway. ;Units * Air Command Far East and Air Headquarters Malaya Communication Squadron RAF * Air Headquarters Malaya Communication Squadron RAF * Far East Communication Squadron RAF * Headquarters Air Command Southeast Asia (Communication) Squadron RAF * No. 33 Squadron RAF * No. 48 Squadron RAF * No. 52 Squadron RAF * No. 81 Squadron RAF * No. 84 Squadron RAF * No. 103 Squadron RAF * No. 110 Squadron RAF * No. 205 Squadron RAF * No. 215 Squadron RAF * No. 656 Squadron RAF Completed post-war, non-flying RAF Chia Keng — a GCHQ radio- receiving station, was a satellite station of RAF Changi (being the Headquarters Air component part of British Far East Command) until the withdrawal of British troops from Singapore at the end of the 1960s. Also, the nearby RAF Hospital Changi (now defunct as Changi Hospital and more prominently known as Old Changi Hospital, OCH) functioned as the primary British military hospital which provided medical care for all British, Australian and New Zealand servicemen (collectively, these three Commonwealth states which based troops in Singapore became known by the term \\"ANZUK\\", for Australia, New Zealand and the UK) stationed in the eastern and northern parts of Singapore while Alexandra Hospital was directed for those stationed in the southern and western areas of Singapore. =Changi Air Base= Upon the withdrawal of British forces from Singapore, RAF Changi was renamed as Changi Air Base (CAB) and was handed over to the SADC (predecessor of Republic of Singapore Air Force) on 9 December 1971. Thereafter, the airfield received its first flying squadron of SADC – the Alouette Squadron and their Alouette IIIs helicopters shortly after New Year's Day 1972. With the arrival of the first Shorts Skyvans in 1973, SADC began to form the 121 Squadron at Changi Air Base and it is currently the oldest resident squadron of the airfield. The novel 'The Sound of Pirates' by former RAF airman Terence Brand is based in the 1960s both on the airfield and in the surrounding areas. Singapore Changi Airport In June 1975, the Singapore government acquired about two-thirds of the airbase (saved for the main flight-line, hangar/aircraft maintenance facilities and control tower which were located in the western section of the airbase) for the construction of the new Singapore Changi Airport, with the new runways in close alignment with the original north-south runway. The east- west runway was almost erased from the map, currently surviving as a taxiway to the apron area which has remained operational as part of Changi Air Base.

Pauline Duvernay or Yolande Marie-Louise Duvernay or Yolande Marie Louise de Varnay (December 1812 – 2 September 1894) was a noted French dancer. Biography Pauline Duvernay was born at Versailles and became a student of Hippolyte Barrez at the Paris Opera Ballet, where she also worked with Auguste Vestris, and Filippo Taglioni. She made her debut on the stage of the Théâtre de l´Académie Royale de Musique in Paris performing Venus in Jean- Baptiste Blache's Mars et Vénus. That same year she made her debut in London at the Drury Lane Theatre in Jean-Pierre Aumer's La Belle au bois dormant (\\"Sleeping Beauty\\"). Working with the renowned Ballet du Théâtre de l´Académie Royale de Musique (today known as the Paris Opera Ballet), she also gave outstanding performances in Jean Coralli's La tentation (music by Fromental Halévy and Casimir Gide) in 1832. Her beauty and dancing skills captivated audiences in Paris and London, and she enjoyed tremendous popularity. She retired in 1837, at the height of her career, marrying an English banker and Member of Parliament, Stephens Lyne-Stephens, thought to be the richest commoner in England at that time. Duvernay devoted herself to charity work. Stephens bought Lynford Hall near Thetford in 1856, intending to develop its with mansion house, parkland and lake as a hunting retreat, and commissioned the architect William Burn to refurbish it. His death in 1861 set off a frenzy of fortune hunters, who went so far as to tamper with their family trees in order to bolster their claims to the estate.Lynford Hall The fortune had been amassed by William Stephens of Cornwall, an illegitimate child born in 1731. He started a glass factory in Portugal with his brother and members of the related Lyne family. Stephens had influential political connections in Portugal, exempting his business from taxes.Amazon.co.uk: Glass: The Strange History of the Lyne Stephens Fortune: Jenifer Roberts: Books A childless widow, Duvernay had a liaison with General Edward Stopford Claremont who had been the British Military Attaché to France.

Using the terminology of Frank Harary. it can be stated as follows: If G and H are two graphs on at least three vertices and ƒ is a bijection from V(G) to V(H) such that G\\\\\\\\{v} and H\\\\\\\\{ƒ(v)} are isomorphic for all vertices v in V(G), then G and H are isomorphic. In 1964 Harary extended the reconstruction conjecture to directed graphs on at least five vertices as the so-called digraph reconstruction conjecture. Many results supporting the digraph reconstruction conjecture appeared between 1964 and 1976. However, this conjecture was proved to be false when P. K. Stockmeyer discovered several infinite families of counterexample pairs of digraphs (including tournaments) of arbitrarily large order.. Erratum, J. Graph Th. 62 (2): 199–200, 2009, , ... The falsity of the digraph reconstruction conjecture caused doubt about the reconstruction conjecture itself. Stockmeyer even observed that “perhaps the considerable effort being spent in attempts to prove the (reconstruction) conjecture should be balanced by more serious attempts to construct counterexamples.” In 1979, Ramachandran revived the digraph reconstruction conjecture in a slightly weaker form called the new digraph reconstruction conjecture. In a digraph, the number of arcs incident from (respectively, to) a vertex v is called the outdegree (indegree) of v and is denoted by od(v) (respectively, id(v)). The new digraph conjecture may be stated as follows: ::If D and E are any two digraphs and ƒ is a bijection from V(D) to V(E) such that D\\\\\\\\{v} and E\\\\\\\\{ƒ(v)} are isomorphic and (od(v),id(v)) = (od(ƒ(v)),id(ƒ(v))) for all v in V(D), then D and E are isomorphic... The new digraph reconstruction conjecture reduces to the reconstruction conjecture in the undirected case, because if all the vertex-deleted subgraphs of two graphs are isomorphic, then the corresponding vertices must have the same degree. Thus, the new digraph reconstruction conjecture is stronger than the reconstruction conjecture, but weaker than the disproved digraph reconstruction conjecture. Several families of digraphs have been shown to satisfy the new digraph reconstruction conjecture and these include all the digraphs in the known counterexample pairs to the digraph reconstruction conjecture.  Reduction  * All Digraphs are N-reconstructible if all Digraphs with 2-connected underlying Graphs are N-reconstructible. *All Digraphs are N-reconstructible if and only if either of the following two classes of Digraphs are N-reconstructible, where diam(D) and radius(D) are defined to be the diameter and radius of the underlying graph of D. *#Digraphs with diam(D) ≤ 2 or diam(D) = diam(Dc) = 3 *#Digraphs D with 2-connected underlying graphs and radius(D) ≤ 2 *  Present Status  As of 2018, no counterexample to the new digraph reconstruction conjecture is known.

Structure The molecular structure of the hormone has been characterized rather recently. Bursicon is a 30 kDa neurohormone heterodimeric protein which is encoded by CG13419 gene and made of two cysteine knot subunits, Burs-α and Burs-β. It is nondialyzable and loses its activity in alcohol, acetone, some proteases and trichloroacetate, renaturates after adding ammonium sulfate. Function Bursicon plays a very important role in insect wing expansion during the last step of metamorphosis: maturation of the wing. At this time, the newly emerged adult removes dead cells of larval tissues. In Drosophila and Lucilia cuprina fly, the epidermis of wing is detached by extensive cell death apoptosis, at the time of wing spreading. The cells that undergo death are removed from the wing cuticle and are absorbed into the thoracic cavity through wing veins. Subsequent wing maturation is disrupted if the process of cell death is inhibited or delayed somehow. Bursicon is released just after eclosion and induces epidermis cell death. At the same time it hastens the tanning reaction, and hardens the newly expanded cuticle of the wing. Where the peptide is found Bursicon is found in different insects and considered to be unspecific. It is produced by median neurosecretory cells in the brain, circulates in blood and stored in corpora cardiaca. The structure of the protein has been investigated well in fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), and in some insect species bursicon gene has been sequenced, including the mosquito (Anopheles gambiae), cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus), locust (Locusta migratoria), and mealworm (Tenebrio molitor). The hormone is also present in the silkworm (Bombyx mori), blow fly (Calliphora erythrocephala), and cockroach (Periplaneta americana). Effect of absence Firstly, mutants of Drosophila melanogaster that lack bursicon gene can not spread their wings after eclosion. Secondly, the elongated abdomen shape of a newly eclosed fly remains for a much longer period of time. In addition, the abdomen of a fly is less melanized.

Life Stolz was born at Bühl, Baden. He first studied at the gymnasium at Rastatt (1818–27), and then proceeded to the University of Freiburg. After attending lectures in jurisprudence for a brief period, he devoted himself to the study of theology (1827–30). He fell into scepticism; but after studying philology at the University of Heidelberg from 1830 to 1832 he regained his former Catholic faith. Having determined to embrace the clerical state, he entered the ecclesiastical seminary at Freiburg in the autumn of 1832, and in August, 1833, was ordained to the priesthood. During the following eight years he was engaged in parochial work, being curate first at Rothenfels in the Murgthal, and from June, 1835, at Neusatz, in the district of Bühl. In the autumn of 1841 he was appointed instructor in religion at the gymnasium of Bruchsal, and on 1 March 1843, teacher of moral and pastoral theology at the theological college of Freiburg. From May, 1845 he was temporary director of this institution, but his appointment as permanent director was prevented by opponents holding more liberal views. He launched polemical attacks on dissenting Catholics in a number of tracts published in 1845.Helmut Walser Smith, Protestants, Catholics and Jews in Germany, 1800-1914 (2001), p. 197. In 1845 he became doctor of theology, and in the autumn of 1847, despite the opposition to his appointment, was made professor of pastoral theology and pedagogics at the university. On 13 October 1848, he was named ordinary professor, and during 1859-60 he was rector of the university. After the revolutionary turbulence of 1848, he alleged a Jewish-Masonic conspiracy.Roisin Healy, The Jesuit Specter in Imperial Germany (2003), p. 49. He was made honorary doctor of the theological faculty of the University of Vienna in 1865, and in 1868 archiepiscopal spiritual counsellor. Stolz was active in the charitable and social fields. In 1851 he founded at Freiburg the Catholic Journeymen's Association after the model of Kolping's, and conducted it as director and later as diocesan president. He also introduced into Freiburg the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, of which he remained director until his death. He devoted all the income from his writings to charity, to the Catholic Church, and to home and foreign missions. He died at Freiburg im Breisgau. Works As a theologian Stolz was opinionated. Johann Baptist von Hirscher's writings, for which he had an unbounded veneration, were his chief authority. Among his theological writings were: *\\"Katechetische Auslegung des Freiburger Diöcesan-Katechismus (Hirscher's Katechismus) für Geistliche, Lehrer und Eltern\\" (3 vols., Freiburg, 1844–47); *\\"Ueber die Vererbung sittlicher Anlagen\\" (University Report, Freiburg, 1859); *\\"Erziehungskunst\\" (Freiburg, 1873; 7th ed. by Julius Mayer, 1910); *\\"Homiletik als Anweisung den Armen das Evangelium zu predigen\\", published by Jakob Schmitt after the author's death (Freiburg, 1885; 2nd ed., 1899). In the domain of popular religious literature, Stolz united a broad sense of humour and effective satire with religious feeling. His \\"Kalendar für Zeit und Ewigkeit\\", written for the years 1843-47, 1858–59, 1864, 1873–81, and 1884, was widely read. These discourses were collected and issued in four volumes under the titles \\"Kompass für Leben und Sterben\\" (1861 and frequently); \\"Das Vaterunser und der unendliche Gruss\\" (1861); \\"Wachholder-Geist gegen die Grundübel der Welt: Dummheit, Sünde und Elend\\" (1879); \\"Die Nachtigall Gottes\\" (1888). Very popular also was his \\"Legende oder der christliche Sternhimmel\\" (in parts, 1851–60; 12th ed. in 1 quarto vol., 1904; 10th ed. in 4 octavo vols., 1894). With this must be associated another ascetico-religious work, \\"Die heilige Elisabeth\\" (1865; 16th ed., 1909), which many consider the ripest work of Stolz. As the fruits of his travels in Spain in 1850 he published (1853) the humorous work \\"Spanisches für die gebildete Welt\\" (12th ed., 1908); his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1855 resulted in \\"Besuch bei Sim, Cham und Japhet, oder Reise in das Heilige Land\\" (1857; 10th ed., 1909). The works \\"Witterungen der Seele\\" (1867; 7th ed., 1910, \\"Wilder Honig\\" (1870; 4th ed., 1908), and \\"Dürre Kräuter\\" (1877; 4th ed., 1908), consist of excerpts from his diaries. Stolz also wrote a number of pamphlets and brochures, some of polemical and some of moral and ascetical contents, collected under the title of \\"Kleinigkeiten\\" (2 collections, 1868 and 1887; 4th ed., 1909). His works were issued in nineteen volumes in Freiburg (1871–95), exclusive of the \\"Legende\\" and the explanation of the catechism; a popular edition of his works appeared in twelve volumes (1898–1909). From his papers were edited an autobiography, \\"Nachtgebet meines Lebens. Nach dem Tode des Verfassers herausgegeben und durch Erinnerungen an Alban Stolz ergänzt von Jakob Schmitt\\" (Freiburg, 1885; 2nd ed., 1908), and \\"Predigten\\" (ed. Julius Mayer, Freiburg, 1908). Another source is the correspondence of Stolz with the convert, Julie Meineke, edited by Mayer under the title \\"Fügung und Führung\\" (Freiburg, 1909). Extracts from the writings of Stolz are given in the works \\"Edelschöner Stellen aus den Schriften von Alban Stolz. Ausgewählt von Heinrich Wagner\\" (Freiburg, 1905; 3rd ed., 1910), and \\"Bilder zur christkatholischen Glaubens- und Sittenlehre, aus den Schriften von Alban Stolz, Geistlichen und Lehrern sowie dem christlichen Volke gewidmet von Karl Telch\\" (Freiburg, 1909).

Biography Kinjikitile was born in what is now Tanzania (then German East Africa, later Tanganyika). In 1904, the then relatively unknown Kinjikitile disappeared from his home in Ngarambe, Matumbi. The Matumbi people practiced Folk Islam. He returned after a few days and said that he had been possessed by a spirit medium called Hongo, believed to take the form of a snake. Kinjikitile claimed to have communicated with the deity Bokera through the spirit Hongo. He encouraged his followers to overlook tribal differences and unite against the Germans. He told his followers that their ancestors had commanded him to lead a rebellion against the German colonial empire. This helped start the Maji Maji Rebellion. Kinjikitile gave his people holy water (\\"maji\\") to protect them from German bullets. After a group of Matumbi attacked the home of a local official in July, 1905, Kinjikitile was arrested by German troops. He was hanged on August 4, 1905 for treason.

On August 5 Robert Ford and John Hutchings, from the British screw sloop HMS Icarus, were killed by an unknown swordsman in the Marayuma entertainment precinct of Nagasaki, which had been opened to trade and port calls by British ships since the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce of 1858. The men, both aged 23, had been drinking, and were sleeping near the entrance to a \\"tea house\\". The British Consul in Nagasaki, Marcus Flowers, blamed the Tokugawa shogunate for failing to protect the men and believed that the Kaientai led by Sakamoto Ryōma was behind the killings. This belief was based on rumours that the men had been seen in the area, combined with the departure of a Tosa steamer from Nagasaki soon after the incident. Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu was pressured by Sir Harry Parkes, head of the British Legation in Edo, to find the culprit. The shogunate was not disposed to dispute the evidence, since it conveniently weakened a feudal domain whose loyalty was increasingly uncertain.Jansen. Sakamoto Ryoma and the Meiji Restoration (1961) page 305 An agreement was reached that the governor of Nagasaki would be dismissed and 500 men would be sent to police the foreign quarter. Subsequently, Parkes sailed to Tosa, arriving in Kōchi September 3, 1867. There he was met by shogunate commissioners who had arrived earlier, to demand reparations from Tosa daimyō, Yamauchi Yōdō. Tosa official Gotō Shōjirō led negotiations on the Japanese side, and after several days it was evident that the British lacked sufficient evidence to convict the Kaientai. It was decided to reconvene the investigations in Nagasaki, where more evidence was presumably available, and Parkes's assistant Ernest Satow was delegated to accompany the Tosa delegation (which included Sakamoto Ryōma) back to Nagasaki on September 9. Once back at Nagasaki, the charges against the Kaientai were dropped on October 4. It was revealed one year later that a samurai of the Fukuoka Domain had murdered the men, and shortly after committed ritual suicide. The Fukuoka clan subsequently paid compensation to the sailors' families in England. The affair diminished British trust and confidence in the shogunate and their control over Kyūshū, one of many factors leading to British support of the Satchō Alliance during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration the following year.

In 1938, the company made a deal with the Romanian government that would have seen it relocate its manufacturing facilities to Moldavia, with the government promising to purchase a minimum order of aircraft each year from the new plant. This venture was to have been called \\"Industria Nationala Aeronautica\\" (\\"National Aeronautical Industry\\"), but it failed to materialise when the Second World War intervened.

In France, for the purposes of the census, the INSEE has defined several population indicators that allow people who live in more than one place to be counted in each place, to study and keep count of population movement. So each commune in France does not have only one figure for the population, but several; for example students may be counted both where they study and where they live when not studying. A parallel may be drawn to English laws that allow students to register and vote in local elections in more than one place.  How it is measured  The population figures of France depend on the definition of \\"French\\". INSEE, the French national statistics bureau has two definitions: * All of the 65,585,857 people (as of 1 January 2013) who reside in France, including 33,817,227 women and 31,768,630 men which is 235,676 more people than January 1, 2012. This is the definition used most frequently, especially by INSEE for censuses that count all people residing in France, regardless of their nationality. French is the demonym of France, that is to say that people who live in France are called French. The census of people residing in France, regardless of nationality, is provided by INSEE under the vocabulary Total population of France. As of 1 January 2008, the population of France was 63 753 140 inhabitants residing in Mainland France, Réunion, Mayotte, Martinique, Guadeloupe and French Guiana. * All of the 63,379,349 people as of January 1, 2013 of French nationality (i.e. French Passport Holders), whether they live in France or abroad. They are the citizens of the French Republic \\"without distinction of origin, race, or religion\\". The Civil Code defines French nationality, the conditions for obtaining it and the rights and duties inherent to it. The number of French (in the sense of \\"persons having French nationality\\") is estimated on January 1, 2013 to be 65,585,857 inhabitants minus 3,817,562 foreigners, plus 1,611,054 expatriate French nationals which gives the total number of French Nationals to be 63,379,349. Statistical view The figures given by INSEE for a particular commune are : ; Population municipale : a count of the people who live in a house, flat etc. in the commune ; Population comptée à part : those living in a collective or temporary manner (prisoners, soldiers, hospital patients, nuns, monks, students) ; Population totale : the sum of population municipale and population comptée à part ; Doubles comptes : a sub- division of population comptée à part, comprising those who have a second residence in another commune and are already counted in that commune's population municipale ; Population sans doubles comptes : the population totale minus the doubles comptes The population sans doubles comptes is therefore always no smaller than the population municipale and no larger than the population totale. To evaluate the population properly, one should use the population sans doubles comptes. Since 1999, places with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants have had a census every five years, with one-fifth of the places each year being subject to census. Since 2004, places with 10,000 inhabitants or more have an annual census of a sample 8% of the population. This is carried out in January and February. A census collector leaves a questionnaire and collects it at a later date. Since this time, population municipale and population sans doubles comptes have had the same meaning.  Legal aspects  Census results are official by law. The population totale is used when applying rules and regulations to budget and finance, in particular in section R2151-2 of the Code of Territorial Collectives. But the population municipale determines the size of a council and the scrutiny of municipal elections, R2151-3.

The palace (puri) was erected at the end of the 17th century, but largely destroyed during the Dutch colonial conquest in 1908. Today the basic remains of the palace are the court of justice, the Kertha Gosa Pavilion, and the main gate that bears the date Saka 1622 (AD 1700). Within the old palace compound is also a floating pavilion, the Bale Kembang. The descendants of the rajas that once ruled Klungkung today live in Puri Agung, a residence to the west of the old palace, which was built after 1929.Adrian Vickers, 'Sights of Klungkung; Bali's most illustrious kingdom', in Eric Oey (ed.), Bali, Island of the Gods. Singapore: Periplus 1990, pp. 166-7.  The origins of the palace  The assembly hall at the palace, 1930's The Klungkung kingdom was considered to be the highest and most important of the nine kingdoms of Bali from the late 17th century to 1908. It was the heir of the old Gelgel kingdom, which had dominated the island since long but had broken up in the late 17th century. In 1686 (or, in another version, 1710), Dewa Agung Jambe I, a prince descending from the old Rajas of Gelgel, moved to Klungkung (also known as Semarapura) and built a new palace or puri.Angela Hobart et al.,The People of Bali. Oxford: Blackwell 2001, pp. 42-4; Adrian Vickers, Bali, a Paradise Created. Singapore: Periplus 1989, pp. 56-8. Although he did not have the prerogatives of his Gelgel forebears, the new palace maintained a degree of prestige and precedence on the politically fragmented island. The palace was built in square form, being roughly 150 meters on each side with the main gate to the north. It was divided in several blocks with various ritual and practical functions. The complex displayed a deep symbolism according to a fixed structural pattern.C. Geertz,Negara; The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali. Princeton: Princeton University Press 1980, pp. 110-3. This book provides a layout map of the Klungkung Palace as it was in c. 1905, just before the Dutch conquest (p. 110).  The Kerta Gosa  The city was known at that time for its arts, painting, dance and music. At the end of the 18th century, the Kerta Gosa Pavilion, also spelt Kertha Gosa or Kertha Ghosa, the hall of justice, was erected in the north-eastern corner of the palace compound. It typified the Klungkung style of architecture and painting. Because the Kerta Gosa was the court of the high king of Bali, cases on the island which could not be resolved were transferred to this site. Three Brahmana priests presided over the court. The convicts (as well as visitors today) were able to view the ceiling which depicted different punishments in the afterlife, the results of karma, while they were awaiting sentencing. The ceiling paintings of the Kerta Gosa are one of the outstanding examples of the Kamasan (or Wayang) style.Idanna Pucci, Bhima Swarga; The Balinese Journey of the Soul. Boston etc.: Bulfinch Press, pp. 14-8. The paintings were probably originally done in the middle of the nineteenth century, and renewed in 1918, 1933 and 1963, with individual panels repaired in the 1980s and 1990s. Leading artists of Kamasan village such as Kaki Rambut, Pan Seken, Mangku Mura and Nyoman Mandra have been responsible for the repaintings in the twentieth century. The main paintings depict the story of Bima in heaven and hell, but other stories depicted are the Tantri, the Garuda story, and scenes predicting the portents of earthquakes (Palindon).  Early history  The descendants of the first king, Dewa Agung Jambe (r. 1686-c. 1722), ruled under varying fortunes for more than two centuries. They were always known by the title Dewa Agung. Dewa Agung Gede alias Surawirya (r. c. 1722-1736) allied with the influential king of Mengwi and performed an expedition to Java together with him.H. Creese (1991), 'Sri Surawirya, Dewa Agung of Klungkung (r. c. 1722-1736); The historical context for dating the kakawin Parthayana' ,Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land-en Volkenkunde147-4, pp. 402-19. After his death in 1736, internal fighting broke out between his two sons Dewa Agung Gede (Jr.) and Dewa Agung Made. The former called in help from the Karangasem kingdom, but was defeated.I Wayan Warna et al. (1986), Babad Dalem; Teks dan terjemahan. Denpasar: Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Propinsi Daerah Tingkat I Bali, pp. 115-7. The victor Dewa Agung Made was succeeded by a mentally ill son, Dewa Agung Sakti (r. before 1769-end of 18th century). His wife fled to Karangasem where her son Dewa Agung Putra I was brought up. In about the end of the 18th century his Karangasem helpers established him on the throne of Klungkung. Dewa Agung Putra I appears to have been a strong leader but fell in a minor war in Bangli in 1809. He left a son, Dewa Agung Putra II (r. 1814-1850) and a daughter and co-regent, Dewa Agung Istri Kanya.Adrian Vickers,Bali, A Paradise Created. Singapore: Periplus 1989, p. 66.  The Dutch interference  Together with the other Balinese rajas, Dewa Agung Putra II signed a contract with the Dutch colonial authorities in 1843, but the varying interpretations of the contract soon caused friction. This was the background to the three Dutch military expeditions in 1846, 1848 and 1849. The last of these expeditions invaded Klungkung territory. The enterprising queen Dewa Agung Istri Kanya fought the Dutch to a standstill, and this was followed by a general reconciliation between the Balinese rajas and the Dutch authorities.WA Hanna (2004), Bali chronicles. Singapore: Periplus, pp. 82-3, 94-9. In the following decades the kingdom was led by a grandson of Dewa Agung Sakti, Dewa Agung Putra III (r. 1851-1903 ). He was an activist leader who intervened in the affairs of the other south Balinese kingdoms, which were still only nominally attached to the Dutch East Indies. In 1885 he imprisoned the Raja of Gianyar, and in 1891 he was heavily responsible for the destruction of the Mengwi kingdom. After 1900 Dutch presence made itself increasingly felt in south Bali. In this situation Dewa Agung Putra III died and was succeeded by his son Dewa Agung Jambe II (r. 1903-1908 ). He took a defiant attitude against the encroaching colonialism.WA Hanna, idem, pp. 139-43.  The fall of Klungkung  One of the gates to the palace The alleged plundering of the stranded ship Sri Kumala in 1904, led to a renewed Dutch military foray in 1906. The colonial troops captured Badung after a suicidal attack on the invaders, a so-called puputan (\\"finishing\\"). Two years later, in a similar manner, an incident in nearby Gelgel triggered a punitive colonial expedition to Klungkung (see Dutch intervention in Bali (1908)). The local Balinese elite chose to make a last stand against the Dutch. Dewa Agung Jambe II, the members of his dynasty and their retainers sallied forth from the palace and engaged in a puputan. The fight, which took place on 18 April 1908, proceeded until the death of the last of the combatants, which included women and children. Those not killed by Dutch bullets were finished off by other members of the royal group. M. Wiener (1995),Visible and invisible realms; Power, magic and colonial conquest in Bali. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. After the puputan, the surviving members of the royal family were exiled, and the palace was largely razed to the ground. In 1929 the family was allowed to return, and settled in the newly built Puri Agung. Today, the history of Klungkung, and the puputan, are commemorated in a museum close to the remains of the palace. To the north of the palace a monument has been erected to the memory of the puputan incident.
