Schirick made one plate appearance for the St. Louis Browns on September 17, 1914, as a pinch hitter. With the hometown Browns down 12-2 in the bottom of the ninth to the Washington Senators, Schirick walked for pitcher Allan Sothoron, who coincidentally was also making his major league debut in the game. This made Schirick (whose records do not show him playing for any other pro team, even in the minors) one of only five MLB players with one distinction: he drew a walk in his only plate appearance and did not play in the field. (The most famous of these five: Eddie Gaedel.) Schirick is also credited with stealing two bases, presumably second and third, since he is not credited with scoring a run; this makes him the only player in MLB history to play in only one game with two steals.\\"Dutch Schirick Statistics and History\\". baseball-reference.com.

History The battle at Lake Providence was meant to be in conjunction with Confederate attacks against Union supply depots at Young's Point and Milliken's Bend ordered by Confederate General Richard Taylor on June 7. However the Confederate commander, Lt. Col. Frank Bartlett set out 48 hours behind schedule, building a floating bridge to cross Bayou Macon and pushing on toward the Federal garrison at Lake Providence on June 9. Bartlett’s command was made up of the 13th Texas Mounted Infantry Regiment and the 13th Louisiana Cavalry Battalion. The Union forces were commanded by Brig. Gen. Hugh T. Reid and greatly outnumbered Bartlett's force. Reid's brigade was a mixed command of white soldiers from the 1st Kansas Mounted Infantry and the 16th Wisconsin Infantry and United States Colored Troops from the 8th Louisiana Infantry.Hugh Thompson REID Reaching the banks of Lake Providence six miles west of their objective, the Confederate cavalrymen encountered two Companies of the 1st Kansas Mounted Infantry at Bayou Baxter, and Corporal William F. Parker of Company K, 1st Kansas was mortally wounded in the skirmish. Bartlett's force captured nine supply wagons and 36 mules. The Federals withdrew toward the town of Lake Providence, crossing the bridge over the Tensas Bayou before destroying the span. The Kansans took a position along the streambank where they were reinforced by the remainder of their regiment as well as the 16th Wisconsin and the black soldiers of the 8th Louisiana. In spite of a strong Federal presence, Bartlett formed a line of battle supported by artillery and advanced toward Tensas Bayou while a 6-pdr gun was moved into position near the present-day Club House of the Lake Providence Country Club. Confederate Pioneers attempted to rebuild the bridge, but Reid's sharpshooters drove off the artillery and a brief skirmish ensued, in which Second Lieutenant Francis Becker of Company I, 1st Kansas and Sergeant Carlisle McClung of Company F, 13th Texas were killed, and a Lieutenant and two Privates of the 13th Texas were captured. A heavy force of Union skirmishers eventually caused the Confederates to withdraw toward Floyd, Louisiana, after having suffered two men killed, five wounded and three captured. The Federals lost one man killed and another mortally wounded, both from the 1st Kansas Mounted Infantry. The three Confederate attacks against Federal supplies in Louisiana failed and the Union grip on Vicksburg continued to tighten. Opposing forces Union Post of Lake Providence: Brig. Gen. Hugh T.

History  A 2018 stamp dedicated to the 100th anniversary of NSS In late September 1991, the Soviet republic of Armenia declared its independence and therefore began the process of restructuring its Soviet-era security agencies, including the Committee for State Security (KGB) of the Armenian SSR. According to a law on the structure and composition of the government adopted on 4 December 1991, the KGB was renamed into the State Directorate of National Security, with Major General Husik Suren Harutyunyan becoming its first director, serving until February 1992. Between 1996 and 1999, the government went through the process of uniting the Ministry of National Security and the Ministry of Internal Affairs into one department. Despite rumors that the NSS will be dismembered into several departments to follow a Russian format, the service runs with a KGB-style semi-militarized structure which remains unchanged since its establishment. On 17 December 2002, President Robert Kocharyan restructured the National Security Ministry into the NSS.https://www.sns.am/en/history/https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries- crossroads/2006/armenia The agency has a great reputation in Armenia due to its secrecy and professionalism compared to other state structures. While other government agencies, such as the Police of the Republic of Armenia, are unpopular because of personnel misconduct and corruption scandals, the NSS has succeeded in maintaining its integrity and that of its personnel.

It is a plant pathogen and a wood decay fungus. The name ostrea, from the word 'oyster', describes its shape. With concentric circles of many colors, it highly resembles Trametes versicolor, turkey-tail, and is thus called the 'false turkey-tail'. The stemless fruiting body is shell-like and grows high. It is tough and inedible. It grows on tree bark. This fungus is native to North America, where it is widespread and grows all year round. Description S. ostrea spread on a tree. It gets its name 'false turkey-tail' because it mimics Trametes versicolor. They can be distinguished as T. versicolor has numerous pores on the underside of its fruiting body, unlike S. ostrea. Also, S. ostrea is more red in color. Factors such as its relatively large size and shell-like (not flat) body distinguish it from other members of the genus Stereum. The fruiting body is wide, shaped like a shell and thin. Its surface can be hairy or smooth at the very first, growing smoother with age. The concentric zones can have a variety of colors - ranging from yellowish red to a dark brown. If algae grow on it, the color can change to green. The flesh is very thin and too tough to eat, with no distinct odor. The fungus lacks a stem. The underside is smooth and lacks pores, white to gray or a reddish-brown shade in color. The spore is white, and measures x . It is inedible. Chemical properties S. ostrea, a plant pathogen, grows on tree barks. Stereum ostrea produces lignolytic enzymes, which decompose lignin. The enzyme production was compared for ten days with Phanerochaete chrysosporium, in a liquid medium. S. ostrea produced a higher number of laccase, lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase enzymes. the discoloration of the dye Remazol confirmed the presence of enzymes. Methoxylaricinolic acid and laricinolic acid have been isolated from this mushroom. Sterostreins A–E (1, 2, 3a/3b, 4, and 5) have been found in S. ostrea, of which sterostrein A showed antimalarial activity and was cytotoxic. Habitat and distribution Stereum ostrea is saprophytic in nature. It is a plant pathogen, growing on hardwood tree barks, especially oak, and decaying parts. It leaves white deposits in these places. It grows individually, but in a dense manner. Phlebia incarnata, another fungus, is most commonly found growing alongside or even intermingled with this species. This fungus can be parasitized by jelly fungi. It grows all year round and is widespread in North America.

A key component in lateral force transmission in skeletal muscle is the extracellular matrix (ECM). Skeletal muscle is a complex biological material that is composed of muscle fibers and an ECM consisting of the epimysium, perimysium, and endomysium. It can be described as a collagen fiber-reinforced composite. The ECM has at least three functions: (1) to provide a framework binding muscle fibers together and ensure their proper alignment, (2) to transmit the forces, either from active muscle contraction or ones passively imposed on it, and (3) providing lubricated surfaces between muscle fibers and bundles enabling the muscle to change shape.Rowe, R.W.D. (1981). Morphology of perimysial and endomysial connective tissue in skeletal muscle, Tissue Cell, 13, 681-690. The mechanical properties of skeletal muscle depend on both the properties of muscle fibers and the ECM, and the interaction between the two. Contractile forces are transmitted laterally within intramuscular connective tissue to the epimysium and then to the tendon. Due to the nature of skeletal muscle, direct measurements are not possible, but many indirect studies and analyses have shown that the ECM is an important part of force transmission during muscle contraction.Bloch, R.J., Gonzalez-Serratos, H.

Mechanical role of the endomysium Shear displacements between two adjacent muscle fibers showing the endomysium in its (a) unconstrained state and (b) after shearing. The muscle fibers within a fascicle are surrounded by the endomysium. The structure of the endomysium is generally equivalent for all skeletal muscle from different muscles and species. Many of the muscle fibers end within the muscle and do not connect to the tendon directly, thus necessitating a force transmission pathway via the endomysium. The planar network of the collagen fibers appears to be randomly distributed at first glance, but detailed analysis has shown that the network is not truly random and that there is a preferred direction that changes with muscle length. Any linkage transmitting force from the muscle fibers to the tendon must be non-compliant (i.e. high stiffness) in order to be efficient. Experimental force-length measurements showed that the passive tensile properties of relaxed muscle were mainly from the elastic resistance of the myofibrils and not the connective tissue.Magid, A., Law, D.J. (1985). Myofibrils bear most of the resting tension in frog skeletal muscle, Science, 230, 1280-1282. Also, analysis of the non-linear tensile properties of the endomysium showed that under normal physiological conditions the collagen networks were too compliant in tension to act as efficient force transmitters in tension. Therefore, the concept of shear linkage between adjacent muscle fibers in the endomysium was introduced.Trotter, J.A., Purslow, P.P. (1992). Functional morphology of the endomysium in series fibered muscles, J Morphol 212, 109–122. The figure to the right is a model consisting of two parallel muscle cells with the endomysium sandwiched between them. Assuming the simplest linear models, the shear stress (F/LW) and the shear strain (ΔL/H) in the endomysium can be related to the shear modulus (G) by the following equation: G=\\\\frac{F}{\\\\Delta L}\\\\frac{H}{LW} where * F is the force generated along the direction of the muscle action * W is the width of the muscle fiber * L is the length of the muscle fiber * {\\\\Delta L} is the change in length of the assembly * H is the thickness of the endomysium If the change in length (ΔL) is approximated as the longitudinal tensile displacement, the apparent tensile modulus (Eapp) becomes: E_{app}=G\\\\left( \\\\frac{L}{H} \\\\right)^{2} The length of the muscle fiber (L) is orders of magnitude larger than the thickness (H), making the term (L/H)2 very large. Therefore, the apparent longitudinal modulus much greater than the true shear modulus. Because the endomysium is so thin, even large shear strains would only result in minute tensile elongations. If the apparent longitudinal modulus is represented in series with the fibers, the modulus of the composite structure (Ec) is: \\\\frac{1}{E_{c}}=\\\\frac{1}{E_{f}}+\\\\frac{1}{E_{app}} and is dictated by the fiber modulus Ef, because Eapp is many orders of magnitude higher. This shear force transmission pathway from one muscle cell to its neighbors is highly efficient and because it has low tensile stiffness, it does not restrict changes in muscle fiber length and diameter during muscle contraction.Purslow, P.P. (2002). The structure and functional significance of variations in the connective tissue within muscle, Comp Biochem Phys A, 133 (4), 947-966. Mechanical role of the perimysium Unlike the endomysium, the perimysium has large variations in quantity and organization from one muscle group to another.Borg and Caulfield (1980). Morphology of connective tissue in skeletal muscle, Tissue Cell, 12 (1), 197-207. Muscles contain far more perimysial than endomysial connective tissue, and it has also been observed that the ratio of the dry mass of perimysium to that of endomysium ranges between 2.8-1 and 64-1.Light, N., Champion, A. E., Voyle, C. and Bailey, A. J. (1985). The role of epimysial, perimysial and endomysial collagen in determining texture in six bovine muscles, Meat Sci, 13, 137-149. The anatomical arrangement of the connective tissue at each level of organization influences the function of the muscle. Attachment of the perimysium to the endomysium at the perimysial junctional plates (PJPs). The collagen fibers in the perimysium usually orient between 45 and 60 degrees to the long axis of the muscle fibers in their relaxed state. Well defined contact regions between the endomysium and perimysium were observed and coined the perimysial junctional plate (PJP).Passerieux, E., Rossignol, R., Chopard, A., Carnino, A., Marini, J.F., Letellier, T., Delage, J.P. (2006). Structural organization of the perimysium in bovine skeletal muscle: Junctional plates and associated intracellular subdomains, J Struct Biol, 154 (2), 206-216. These sites were hypothesized to be a focal region for delivery of tension during muscle contraction. To test the possibility of tensile force transmission via the perimysium, it was experimentally shown that cutting of the aponeurosis in a pennate muscle did not prevent tension generation further along towards the tendon. Also, in a separate study it was clearly demonstrated that the perimysium could transmit force if tendons normally transmitting force from distinct parts of the extensor digitorum longus muscle were cut. Although a lot of evidence may seem to point to lateral force transmission via the perimysium in tension, the experiments were conducted at very high loads. Under sufficient stress, the collagen fibers of the perimysium begin to orient parallel to the stress direction. The stretching and reorientation of the perimysium makes it much stiffer and able to transmit tensile force. Scanning electron microscope images have shown that the perimysium has an organized crimped structure. The crimped structure of the perimysium makes it very compliant in tension under normal physiological conditions allowing the muscle to change shape, thus rendering it unfeasible for tensile force transmission. Although strong efforts have been made to demonstrate the mechanical role of the perimysium as a force transmission pathway during active contraction of the muscle, an accepted model has yet to be derived. It can also be suggested that the perimysium could transmit force generated in fascicles to neighboring fascicles by shear, similar to the endomysium described above. The perimysium is significantly thicker than the endomysium. Even if the shear modulus of the perimysium were within an order of magnitude of the endomysium, the perimysium would still be a lot more compliant in shear than the endomysium, also making it an inefficient force transmission pathway.Purslow, P.P. (2010). Muscle fascia and force transmission, J Bodyw Mov Ther, 14 (4), 411-7. There are alternate theories on the role of the perimysium being strictly for distributing passive forces imposed on the muscle and that the perimysial network's main purpose is to prevent over-stretching of the muscle fascicles.Purslow, P.P. (1989). Strain-induced reorientation of an intramuscular connective tissue network: implications for passive muscle elasticity, J Biomech, 22 (1), 21-31.

A third-generation member of the Clark banking family, Clark was a senior partner in the E. W. Clark & Co. investment house, a vice president of the First National Bank of Philadelphia, and a manager of Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company. In his leisure time, he was a prominent cricket player in Philadelphia-area clubs, served as commodore of the Philadelphia Corinthian Yacht Club, and was a part- owner of the Irolita Kennels. Biography He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 17, 1857. He was the eldest of six siblings, including a brother, Clarence Munroe Clark, born to Mary Todhunter Sill (1835-1908) and Edward White Clark (1828-1904). His grandfather was Enoch White Clark (1802-1856). Edward was called \\"Jr.\\" to distinguish him from his father. Clark, who attended Germantown Academy and the University of Pennsylvania, He married Lydia Jane Newhall (1858-1936) on October 31, 1882, in Philadelphia. They had two sons, George Newhall Clark (1887-1906), who died while at Harvard of influenza; and Sydney Procter Clark; and two daughters, Frances Clark Stoddard, and Christine Clark Willetts. In 1904, he became a senior partner at E. W. Clark & Co. He became a trustee of the Pomfret School, and gave the school a dormitory, Dunworth, in 1905. In 1907, he donated the Clark Memorial Chapel to honor his deceased son. In 1925, he bought the yacht Resolute. In 1930, with Winthrop Aldrich and Vincent Astor, he financed the sloop Enterprise to compete in the America's Cup. He died on April 4, 1946, at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Clubs He was a member of the Rittenhouse Club, the Racquet Club of Philadelphia, the Germantown Cricket Club, the Union League, the New York Yacht Club. Cricket Clark was a prominent cricketer, playing as a right-handed middle- order batsman and a right-arm medium bowler, bowling in the round-arm style. His career in front-rank American cricket lasted from 1877 to 1906, during which he played for many different sides. Between 1880 and 1897, he appeared in 27 matches that are considered as \\"first-class cricket\\", some of them all- American games and others against touring teams from England. His highest first-class score was an innings of 147 made in a rather strange match in 1894 in which his team batted for the whole of the two days allotted to the game, which was therefore left drawn.

It consisted lands around Ksani and two more neighbouring south-western valleys, thus making two administrative entities: Ksniskhevi, with its centre in Kvenipnevi and Tskhradzmiskhevi with its centre in Largvisi, which is also home of the Largvisi Monastery. Tskhradzmiskhevi started to become dominant in the 10th century when it included gorges of Lekhura, Medjuda and upper side of the river Liakhvi. After incorporating of neighbouring southern gorges, the residence was relocated from Largvisi to Kvenipnevi. According to Vakhushti's references, during the reign of Tamar the Great, Kartli and Ksani were separated Dukedoms.

This highway passes through the Cochin Special Economic Zone and connect such major industrial units as HMT, FACT, and Kochi Refineries as also the various oil terminals at Irumpanam and also boost the flow of cargo traffic both from the port and the airport. The District Headquarters is located on this road. The IT Expressway to Infopark is starting from this road. The 13-km road constructed in the first phase acting as a by-pass to the NH 47 within the Kochi city limits. Petroleum tankers from Irumpanam oil terminals can now move north up to Kalamassery without entering the core city areas. To ensure a smooth and durable road, natural rubber modified bitumen (NRMB) is used. Phases Phase I The first phase is between Kalamassery HMT () and Karingachira Church () near Tripunithura including construction of ROB (Railway Over Bridge) at Irumpanam yard () and ROB at CRL Junction. It was inaugurated in May 2003. Phase II Development of between HMT and Cochin International Airport and up to Kariyad (near Angamaly, ) in NH 47. Land acquisition for this phase is in progress, construction is progressing in HMT - NAD stretch. Estimate to complete the work is Rs. 662-crore.

He was also noted as a portrait painter and as an engraver, who created the first paper currency in Connecticut Colony. His son Jeremiah Jr. was involved with the foundation of Yale University. Life Dummer was born in Newbury, Massachusetts, the first son of Richard Dummer and his second wife, Frances Burr. At the age of 14, he was apprenticed to John Hull, the mintmaster at Boston. Hull recorded at the time that he \\"received into my house Jeremie Dummer ... to serve me as Apprentice eight years\\". When he was 23 he started on his own and became a prolific and notable silversmith making tankards, beakers, porringers, caudle cups and candlesticks. The fluted band on a plain surface is characteristic of his work. He is said to have introduced into American silver the ornamentation known as \\"gadrooning\\", curved flutings on the surface of silver. He held many public offices, and was a Member and Captain of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Society in 1671 and Constable of Boston in 1675–76. He was appointed Freeman of Boston in 1680, a member of Capt Hutchinson's Company in 1684, a member of the Council of Safety against Andres in 1689, a Selectman of Boston 1691–92, Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for Suffolk County 1702–15, Treasurer of Suffolk County 1711–16, and was a member in full communion at the venerable First Church. He was also an engraver, and engraved plates for currency: in 1710 he printed the first paper money in Connecticut. When the government of Connecticut decided in 1709 to issue paper currency, or Bills of Exchange, Dummer was selected to do the engraving of the plates and the printing of the bills. Journals of the council for 1710 show transactions with Dummer relating to this currency, and in 1712 Governor Saltonstall laid before the Council Board Dummer's bill for printing 6,550 sheets of this paper currency. Dummer's former apprentice, John Coney, had the distinction of engraving the plates for the first paper money issued by Massachusetts some years previously, the first issued on the American continent, although some sources also credit Dummer with the engraving of the Massachusetts copper plates. Dummer was also one America's foremost early portrait painters. Among his paintings are a self-portrait and portrait of his wife, Anna, together with portraits of many of his contemporaries. He died on May 24, 1718 in Boston. His obituary printed in the Boston News-Letter on June 2, 1718 said: > Departed this life Jeremiah Dummer, Esqr., in the 73rd year of his Age, > after a long retirement ... having served his country faithfully in several > Publick Stations, and obtained of all that knew him the Character of a Just, > Virtuous, and Pious Man; Apprentices His apprentices included: *John Coney (brother-in-law) (c. 1668) *Eleazer Russell (c. 1677) *Edward Winslow (c. 1682) *Kiliaen Van Rensselaer (1683) *John Edwards (c. 1684) *John Allen (1685) *John Noyes (c. 1687) *William Cowell Sr. (c. 1695) *Daniel Gookin (1696–1704) *Shubael Dummer (nephew) (c. 1699) Works He was a prolific craftsman and over one hundred pieces listed as made by him have been preserved.

The bowl was made and presented to Brattle in 1695 by his Harvard students, as the original inscription \\"Ex dono Pupillorum\\" indicates. The Brattle coat of arms is engraved on the rim. The bowl bears Dummer's mark, a heart-shaped device within which are his initials, with a small pellet between the initial, and a fleur-de-lis. It was made for domestic use. * Communion cup, c. 1700.

In 1672 she gave the cup to the First Church of Dorchester, Massachusetts where it held communion wine. Works at auction From time to time, Dummer's work comes up for auction. In January 2005, several pieces of silver from the First Church of Christ, Farmington, Connecticut came up for auction at Sotheby's, New York. Top prices were achieved by a silver two-handled cup c. 1690 ($144,000), a silver two-handled cup c. 1675 ($168,000) and a silver two- handled cup, by John Hull and Robert Sanderson, overstruck by Jeremiah Dummer, c. 1670 which fetched the top price of $204,000. In January 2007, a beaker from 1670 was auctioned at the New York auction house Christie's, with an estimate of $150,000 to $250,000. The cup, which was given to The First Church in Salem in 1684 by Francis Skerry, who ran a local malt house, realised $204,000, and was bought by an \\"anonymous collector\\".

Each image represents the subject of its respective poem. Although presented as a drawing, the poems are read as if they were written in traditional stanzas. Both poems are organized into four verses that contain 7 to 11 syllables, and use the AB-AB rhyme scheme. El Puñal The first poem, \\"El Puñal\\"(The Dagger), concerns itself with the \\"first look of passion\\" that is driven \\"like a dagger into the heart\\" of the speaker of the poem. The poem takes the form of a dagger to emphasize the idea of the game behind the volume of poems. El Talón Rouge The subject of \\"El Talón Rouge\\"(The Rouge Heel) is a heeled shoe that reminds the poem's speaker of the love that causes him suffering. The inclusion of the word \\"Rouge\\" in the title and the mention of the color crimson in the poem imagines the blood coming from the speaker's heart, and alludes to two classic models of passionate love: the Moulin Rouge in Paris, and the other model from the French play by Bizet, Carmen.

It was originally forked from ACIS 7.0 in November 2001, and the first version became available in Inventor 5.3 in February 2002. On the day of the announcement, VP of Autodesk, Robert Cross, denied that the genesis of ShapeManager was the purchase by Dassault Systèmes of ACIS from Spatial Corp in July the previous year, though industry experts commented on Autodesk's exposure to dependence on technology controlled by its main competitor (Dassault owns SolidWorks). The move was enabled by a clause in the 1990 contract between Autodesk and Spatial that made Autodesk a joint developer (with some restrictions) of the software with Spatial and provided an option to buy out of the contract to continue development of the source code on their own at a later date for $6.4 million. Following this move, Dassault filed an injunction on 27 December 2001 for breach of contract against Autodesk and D-Cubed, the contractors who were then working on the kernel, on the technicality that these contractors had been allowed to access the source code. The lawsuit eventually came to an end on 2 October 2003 in favour of Autodesk after the jury had deliberated for under two hours and basically agreed with the videotaped testimony from Spatial's co-founder, Richard Sowar, who confirmed that D-cubed had been contracted to work on various parts of the code by both companies throughout the decade without any suggestion of a breach of contract. Dassault's appeal that this evidence should not have been admitted to the court was also lost in 2006.

The Roman road from Aquilea to Poetovio (via Emona and Celeia) ran through the area, and the location at Šempeter is in line with the Roman custom of burial grounds near main roads outside their cities. It was used between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD and is associated with the nearby Roman town of Celeia. At some point in antiquity the area was flooded and covered with gravel from the Savinja River, thus preserving the site until it was discovered by chance in 1952, when a statue of a seated woman was found when digging up an orchard. The site was excavated between 1952 and 1956 and again in 1964, when a further section of the necropolis was uncovered.Slovenian Tourist Board site Some graves have aediculae with sculptures and reliefs that are displayed in situ in the archaeological park under the auspices of the Celje regional museum.

The comedy song was written about the eponymous Gillian McKeith, a celebrity nutritionist famous for presenting television programmes such as You Are What You Eat, who was competing in the tenth series of the reality television series I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. Background Gillian McKeith is a British nutritionist who has become famous for presenting shows presenting healthy living, most notably You Are What You Eat. She was invited to appear on the reality television programme I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2010. During her time in the Australian jungle, she was regularly chosen to take part in a variety of tasks involving the consumption of usually inedible creatures such as insects and spiders, as well as larger body parts of animals. Despite agreeing to participate in the programme, McKeith upset her fellow celebrity campmates by refusing to attempt the tasks. There were also suspicions of her faking phobias to gain publicity, while she continually pretended to faint during the tasks. Brett Domino is the alter-ego of Rob J Madin, a musician who has had success with his comedy videos on the video- sharing website YouTube. He wrote the song about McKeith, despite not having watched 'I'm a Celebrity'. He was short of material for a comedy gig, so decided to write a song about something that was trending on Twitter that week. Release The song was released on 22 November 2010 on the iTunes Store. The single received support from Chris Moyles, who played the song multiple times on his breakfast show during the week. In its first week it entered the chart at number 29, charting above new entries from the celebrated acts Kylie Minogue, Usher and Gorillaz, as well as the newly digitised Beatles song \\"Let it Be\\".

Previously she worked at Commentary, PJ Media, Human Events, and The Weekly Standard. Her work has been published in media outlets including Politico, New York Post, New York Daily News, National Review, and The Jerusalem Post. In September 2020, Rubin announced that she no longer identified as a conservative. Early life and education Rubin is Jewish and spent her early years in the New Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia, moving with her family as a child to California in 1968. She received her B.A. and J.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, finishing first in her class in law school, according to Rubin. Career Labor and employment law Before moving into opinion writing, Rubin was a labor and employment lawyer in Los Angeles, working for Hollywood studios, for 20 years. She now describes herself as a \\"recovering lawyer\\". Commenting on working with her from 2000–05, Hollywood animator and trade union leader Steve Hulett described her to Media Matters as \\"always funny, with sharp observations. I never got the impression she was anything but a Democrat ... she was mildly critical of some of Kerry's campaign moves during the '04 campaign, but she wasn't in the Bush camp . Opinion writer In 2005, she moved to Northern Virginia with her husband and two children. She offered a column to The Weekly Standard about Mitt Romney, and continued doing freelance work for two years before joining Commentary. Rubin's move to The Washington Post in November 2010 became a national news story and was discussed by the media on all sides of the political spectrum, ranging from The American Conservative and The Weekly Standard, to Salon and Slate. In welcoming remarks, The Washington Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt wrote, \\"her provocative writing has become 'must read' material for news and policy makers and avid political watchers.\\" In 2011, she was included on the list of \\"50 Most Influential American Jews\\" by The Jewish Daily Forward. Slate blogger David Weigel called Rubin \\"one of the right's most prolific online political writers\\". The Commentary editor John Podhoretz writes of Rubin, \\"She is a phenomenon, especially considering that for the first two decades of her working life, she was not a writer or a journalist but a lawyer specializing in labor issues.\\" In August 2013, former Washington Post ombudsman Patrick Pexton criticized Rubin in an open letter from his new desk at the Washington City Paper, saying that he received more complaint emails about Rubin than any other Post employee. Writing that her columns were \\"at best ... political pornography\\", he said \\"Have Fred Hiatt, your editorial page editor—who I like, admire, and respect—fire opinion blogger Jennifer Rubin. Not because she's conservative, but because she's just plain bad.\\" Fred Hiatt, editorial page editor for the Post, responded in a statement to Politico, \\"I appreciate Patrick's perspective but I think he is quite wrong about Jennifer Rubin. Regular readers of her blog know that she is an indefatigable reporter who is as hard on politicians on the right when she thinks they get things wrong as on the other side.\\"  Political views and commentaries  Rubin was a conservative, but has also stated that the term has been \\"ruined\\" by pro-Trump conservatives and that she would \\"prefer to be a 19th century liberal or a wet Tory\\". She has described herself as \\"a Pat Moynihan Democrat, a Scoop Jackson Democrat, an Andrew Cuomo Democrat. I’m not a Bernie Sanders Democrat.\\" Some conservatives (both pro- and anti-Trump) have disputed whether she can be considered a conservative, in part because of her willingness to criticize Donald Trump. The journal Democracy has described her as \\"seem[ing] to have come closest to giving up on the whole enterprise\\" of conservatism in comparison to other well-known figures who have been called anti-Trump conservatives. Charles C. W. Cooke has noted that Rubin has reversed many of her previous positions on economic, social and foreign policy during the Trump administration. Rubin has supported the Likud government in Israel, and has been a critic of Hamas and of the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership. In November 2011, Rubin retweeted an anti-Hamas blog post that Post ombudsman Patrick Pexton called \\"reprehensible\\". Rubin later told Pexton that she endorsed and shared the views in the Post that \\"expressed an understandable desire for righteous vengeance against the kidnappers and human rights abusers of Gilad Shalit\\". Pexton said, \\"in agreeing with the sentiment, and in spreading it to her 7,000 Twitter followers who know her as a Washington Post blogger, Rubin did damage to the Post and the credibility that keeps it afloat.\\" Andrew Sullivan wrote, \\"we have a blogger at the WaPo endorsing throwing Arab prisoners into the sea to meet righteous divine punishment.\\"\\"The WaPo's Israel Problem\\", Andrew Sullivan, November 14, 2011 Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt defended Rubin, saying, \\"As a general matter I think it isn't wise for me to comment on the work of the ombudsman, who is entitled to his views, and over whom I do not have editorial control. However, I will say this: I think Jennifer is an excellent journalist and a relentless reporter. I think because she has strong views, and because she is as willing to take on her home team, as it were, as the visitors, she comes under more scrutiny than many and is often the target of unjustified criticism. I think she brings enormous value to the Post.\\"\\"Hiatt defends Rubin after ombud blast\\", Dylan Byers, Politico, November 8, 2011 In 2011, Rubin wrote a blog post suggesting that the 2011 Norway attacks were carried out by Islamic jihadists. Columnist James Fallows of The Atlantic criticized the piece as \\"rushed\\" and noted the subsequent discovery that the attack was carried out by Anders Behring Breivik, a native Norwegian who was not a Muslim. Another Atlantic columnist, former Israeli soldier Jeffrey Goldberg, responded that the criticism was unwarranted, noting that other publications such as Wired and even The Atlantic itself had printed similar speculation; Goldberg concluded: \\"It is not perverse or absurd for normal people to think of al Qaeda when they hear of acts of mass terrorism. It is logical, in fact, to suspect al Qaeda.\\"Jeffrey Goldberg, \\"On Suspecting al Qaeda in the Norway Attacks\\", The Atlantic, July 23, 2011. In a follow-up column, Rubin acknowledged that early suspicions of a jihadist attack had proven to be mistaken. International Relations scholar Daniel W. Drezner has described her views on foreign policy as neoconservative.Daniel W. Drezner, Who belongs in the anti-Trump coalition?, Washington Post (December 12, 2017): \\"[Kristol] is hardly the only neoconservative to fall into this category; see, for example, Peter Wehner or Jennifer Rubin.\\"  Criticism of Donald Trump  Rubin has been one of the most vocal conservative-leaning writers to frequently criticize Donald Trump, as well as the overall behavior of the Republican Party during Trump's term in office. Rubin denounced Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement as \\"a dog whistle to the far right\\" and designed to please his \\"climate change denial, right-wing base that revels in scientific illiteracy.\\" Previously, after Barack Obama had approved the agreement, Rubin characterized it as \\"nonsense\\" and argued that it would not achieve anything. Rubin characterized Trump's 2017 decision to not implement parts of the Iran nuclear deal as the \\"emotional temper tantrum of an unhinged president.\\" She had previously said that \\"if you examine the Iran deal in any detail, you will be horrified as to what is in there.\\" Rubin had vocally supported the United States officially recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Early in his presidency, she criticized Trump for not doing so, saying that it was indicative of his tendency to \\"never keep his word.\\" She concluded that Trump \\"looks buffoonish in his hasty retreat.\\" In December 2017, after Trump announced that he would move the embassy, she characterized it as \\"a foreign policy move without purpose.\\" In a tweet referenced by CNN Media, Mike Huckabee questioned Rubin, writing \\"Jen Rubin is WAPO's excuse for conservative,\\" and adding that Rubin's \\"contempt for all things Trump exposes her and WAPO as Fake News.\\"  Domestic policy views  Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic argued that after the 2012 presidential election, Rubin criticized aspects of the Mitt Romney campaign that she had previously praised, with Friedersdorf insisting that she had acted as \\"a disingenuous mouthpiece for her favored candidate\\". In a November 21, 2013, column, Rubin called on the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) to end its campaign against same-sex marriage.  Personal life Rubin and her husband, Jonathan, have two sons. The couple moved to Oakton, Virginia from Los Angeles in 2005.

He began his military career in 1915 when he entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon as a staff cadet and graduated as a lieutenant in the Permanent Forces in late 1917. Following this, he was deployed overseas and subsequently served in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign during the First World War. During the inter war years, Hopkins undertook a variety of regimental and staff positions in Australia, India and the United Kingdom. During the Second World War, he was promoted several times, briefly commanding the 7th Division Cavalry Regiment and was deployed to the Middle East before returning to Australia to undertook further staff positions. In this role he played a key role in organising the Australian Armoured Corps before later serving as a liaison officer to American forces taking part in the New Guinea campaign. Following the war, Hopkins commanded the 34th Brigade in Japan, before finishing his career as Commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. In retirement he wrote a comprehensive history of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps before he died in 1990 at the age of 93. Early life and career Hopkins was born in Stawell, Victoria on 24 May 1897. His father, William Hopkins, was a surgeon who was later killed on active service during the Boer War in 1900. His mother was Rose Margaret Burton (née Lamond). After attending the Melbourne Church of England Grammar School, Hopkins was appointed to the Royal Military College, Duntroon as a staff cadet in 1915 where he undertook training to become an officer in the Australian Army. Upon graduation in late 1917 he was commissioned as a lieutenant and volunteered for overseas service with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), being assigned to the cavalry. In early 1918 he was posted to the 6th Light Horse Regiment and served with them in Palestine during the First World War.Hopkins 1978, back cover. He was also seconded to the headquarters of the 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades, and the Anzac Mounted Division, to serve in a staff role. Following the end of hostilities, Hopkins helped plan the return of Australian personnel from the Middle East. Throughout the interwar years, Hopkins undertook a number of regimental and staff appointments in the Permanent Forces, including a stint as an instructor at Duntroon,Dennis et al 1995, p. 296. before attending the Staff College at Quetta in India in 1927. Prior to his departure, in December 1926, having been promoted to captain earlier in the year, he married Nora Frances Reissmann, with whom he would subsequently have a son. He returned from India in 1928 and undertook staff work at brigade level and then at Army Headquarters in Melbourne, Victoria. Promotion to major came in 1936. The following year, in early 1937, he was sent to the United Kingdom on a fact finding mission to learn about developments in tanks and armoured warfare. He returned to Australia in April 1939 and was instrumental in organising the Australian Armoured Corps during the Second World War. Second World War In late 1939 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of the 7th Division Cavalry Regiment. After another promotion, this time to colonel, he served briefly in the Middle East in early 1941 before being transferred back to Australia to undertake staff work attached to the 1st Armoured Division. He was later promoted to brigadier and attached to the staff of New Guinea Force and then served as a liaison officer to the American forces participating in the New Guinea campaign throughout 1943 and 1944. For his services in these roles, in late 1943 Hopkins was invested as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for \\"distinguished service in the SW Pacific\\". The United States government also bestowed a Legion of Merit upon him. In September 1944, Hopkins was appointed the position as commander of the Australian Staff School. Located at Cabarlah, Queensland, the school subsequently became the Australian Staff College. Hopkins remained in this role until April 1946. Later life Following the war, Hopkins commanded the 34th Brigade as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Promoted to major general in May 1950, he served as Deputy Chief of the General Staff before he was appointed Commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon in February 1951.Moore 2001, p. 428.

He also wrote the Royal Australian Armoured Corps' history, titled Australian Armour: A History of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps 1927–1972, which was published in 1978. The work received considerable praise as an in-depth study of the development of armour within the Australian Army and for its analysis of the way in which the Army utilised the Corps during the fighting in the Second World War and in Vietnam. Hopkins subsequently died on 24 November 1990, leaving behind his wife of almost 64 years, Nora, and one son.

Designed by ECA2 founder, Yves Pépin,, creator of Songs of the Sea. YourSingapore , Singapore's Destination Brand Songs of the Sea started its operations on 26 March 2007, a day after the Sentosa Musical Fountain ceased operations. The fountain is a $30 million investment by Sentosa to enhance its entertainment product offerings and to attract more tourists. It was the world's only permanent show set in the sea – with pyrotechnics displays, water jets that could shoot up to 40 meters, laser show, flame bursts, a live 7-person cast, and an open-air viewing gallery which can accommodate 3,000 visitors. Songs of the Sea had its final show on 4 May 2014, and was closed to make way for a brand new multi-sensory production titled Wings of Time, which was launched on 17 June that year. History neoclassical architecture, with the iconic Merlion statue in the background. Sentosa Musical Fountain Nearly 25 years earlier, the Musical Fountain opened in 1982 and was the biggest star attraction in Sentosa Island of the time, and the biggest fountain of its kind in Asia at that time. It went through three massive renovations throughout its lifespan of 25 years: one in 1972 (the construction of the fountain itself), the second in 1992 (major upgrading project), and the third and final one in 1999 (under a major restoration and upgrading project directed by ECA2). After operating for 25 years, the Musical Fountain became an important milestone in the history of Sentosa, when its last Magical Sentosa show was staged on 25 March 2007. It was then shut down and subsequently demolished to make way for the integrated resort – Resorts World Sentosa, which now occupies the vicinity. Songs of the Sea As the 25-year-old Musical Fountain ceased operations on 26 March 2007, to make way for the development of Resorts World Sentosa, a new musical fountain was introduced in view of the closure of Magical Sentosa. The new multimedia/musical fountain was built at Siloso Beach on Sentosa Island, near Beach Station. Songs of the Sea is a multimillion-dollar sea spectacular that showcases a lively display of pyrotechnics, lasers, water jets that could shoot up to 40 meters, flame bursts, computer animation, captivating music and performance by a 'live' 7-person cast. Production and development The new multimedia/musical fountain show uses giant water-projection screens. Images are projected on these water screens to create CGI animations, that are shown during the show. The show features Oscar, a colourful Pterois miles. The iconic Merlion statue no longer plays any part during the show any more, since the Sentosa Musical Fountain, which it had played several parts in the shows that were performed there, was demolished to make way for the new integrated resort. Construction Construction work on the Songs of the Sea show began in January 2006, and completed in February 2007. The show made its debut on 26 March 2007. In the first year of its operation between 26 March 2007 and 31 December 2007, Songs of the Sea was watched by 991,723 guests, which is noted by some to be considerably more than the number of visitors who watched Magical Sentosa in the same period. This proved the show to be a huge success and favourable amongst locals and foreigners alike. A video from ECA2's website also reveals how the construction of the show progressed until the opening date. Structure and equipments Songs of the Sea Kelong. Songs of the Sea Kelong drenched in the sunset before the show. The beach and the sea are the stage for the show. A stretch of wooden houses was built across the shoreline to create a Malay Kampung, or more commonly known as a kelong. It is actually a work of art that is long, while the rest of the equipment (water jets, water screens, lasers and projectors) are being hidden at the back of the kelong. There are a total of 69 water jets capable of reaching a height of and flames leaping up to a height of .

Only the pioneer cast members have been revealed, on the credits section of the Songs of The Sea DVD. Plot Finale of Songs of the Sea in Sentosa The show starts off with Li and his friends appearing, from a shrub, waving and greeting the audience. One of Li's friends, a young, unnamed Indian girl, asks Li what should they do to entertain the audience, so they thought of singing. They played four different songs of the four different races, whilst Li sits on a rock and daydreams at the kelong. So his friends sing \\"Singapura, Sunny Island\\" making Li sing his \\"Magical Song\\", his song causes the image of Princess Ami to appear over the kelong, but she is shown to be asleep, before her image fades away. Shocked, Li and his friends panicked at the stunning vision of Princess Ami. Oscar's friends appear to see the commotion, but making up a comical argument as a result, singing the song \\"It's Me\\". Oscar appears and greets Li. Oscar, unlike the plot of Magical Sentosa, he tells Li how he knew his name. Oscar explains to Li about the vision of Princess Ami, of how she was put to sleep by the enchantment of the kelong. After learning about what has happened, Li sets out to seek for Princess Ami, but Oscar continues his monologue warning to him, \\"Who knows what strange encounters you may have along the way!\\". Along the way he meets the 3 Lords of the Elements. The first is The Lord of Fire, with the others being The Spirit of Light and the Lady of the Sea. Li sings for all three of them and helps regain their powers which they had lost after falling into a long sleep. After each successful song, there would be a spectacular show of flame bursts, laser displays and fountain displays respectively. Li believes he should give up after many attempts of trying, but then Oscar's friends encouraged Li with the song \\"You're Not in This on Your Own\\". After everyone joins in the singing, and their voices awaken Princess Ami, who is seen above the kelong smiling at the audience, and as her image fades away, the fountains come to life, dancing away in celebration. After awakening Princess Ami with his singing powers, Li is congratulated by Oscar for his deed. Oscar waves the audience, Li and his friends goodbye, and the show ends with a dazzling fireworks display. Music In late 2006, ECA2 musicians, Philippe Villar and Pascal Lengagne made their return to compose yet another soundtrack for a Sentosa musical, the original soundtrack of Songs of the Sea. There has been a lack of information given by ECA2 on the developmental process of the album, along with its track listing (which can be illegitimately found on the contents of the DVD recording). Thus, resulting in another dispute about the personnel and music studio crew. Despite this, it is possibly suggested that both Villar and Lengagne were attempting to create a pastiche of their own previous work. This can be evidenced by the heavy usage of the world music genre in most tracks, a pastiche of Grand Finale from the Magical Sentosa music album; the reprise of \\"Magical Song\\", and also a pastiche of Here Everybody Lives in Harmony too, for the tune of Li's singing with the Spirit of Light, which was a remix of Magical Song/ Because of this, it can also probably suggest that the composers are making reference to their previous involvement with Magical Sentosa. Uniquely, Songs of the Sea's own soundtrack is bundled along with the DVD recording of the show as a bonus. Which is unlike Magical Sentosa's; where the soundtrack and DVD recording were being sold separately. This resulted in both the soundtrack and the recording of the show to share the same album art. The original soundtrack listing was rather unclear to the fan cult community. A Songs of The Sea DVD owned by an Indonesian family has been found, recovering all the songs, which turned out to be in a DVD bonus section, \\"The Songs\\". The songs are all merged with the recording of the ECA2 production studio while recording the song. Note: The songs listed are actually a part of a bonus section from the DVD, \\"The Songs\\", where the soundtrack listed is recorded along with a video of the cast members recording it in the ECA2 studio. The songs listed are also from a DVD bought at 2007, so there may be differences with newer DVDs. Closure After a seven-year run, Songs of the Sea staged its last show on 4 May 2014. During its seven-year run, it was watched by more than 8.5 million viewers. The final show featured audience interaction with the cast members and a final farewell message on the central water screen, thanking viewers for its successful seven-year run. With the closure of Songs of the Sea, the entire set has upgraded for its replacement show, Wings of Time, which was launched on 17 June that year. Characters Li He is the main protagonist of the show. He is dressed in a white shirt and brown shorts. As he was singing along the beach, he was the first few to see Princess Ami who is at first shown to be asleep. Together with Oscar the Tiger Fish and his friends, he goes on a mission to awake her. The name of the cast member who portrayed Li was not revealed, since the cast members keep switching. But, based on the Songs of The Sea DVD, the pioneer cast member that portrayed Li was Firdaus Bin Abdul Rahman. His singing was voiced by Andy Chase. Oscar the Tiger Fish Oscar is a colourful Pterois miles (despite being recognised as a Tigerfish, it is actually not his species), who lives in a sleeping kingdom ruled by Princess Ami under the sea. He was inspired to be created by a first series set of 50-cent coins found in Singapore. He is self-proclaimed to be the creature \\"who knows many things\\". The cast member who portrayed Oscar has never been revealed. It is now believed that Oscar is the official mascot of Sentosa, replacing Kiki the Hyperactive Monkey of Sentosa, who was the island's official mascot until 26 March 2007. Another claimant of the mascot role is Captain Palawan; which Sentosa Development Corporation used in promoting the island's popular, Palawan beach. He was voiced by Christian Erickson. Oscar Friends Also known as the Mischievous Sea Creatures, they are the unnamed friends of Oscar. One of them is a female octopus, another a male seahorse, while the final one is a male moonfish. The female octopus was voiced by Christine Flowers, the seahorse was voiced by Christian Frickson, while the moonfish was voiced by Andy Chase. Princess Ami She was put into deep sleep for a very long time for an unknown reason. She is the ruler of an unnamed and unmentioned kingdom. She and her kingdom are at last awakened by Li and his friends' song. Her character was probably made to be a reference to Princess Pearl from Magical Sentosa, although she has no speaking or singing roles. The cast member who portrayed Princess Ami was Corinne Yam, based on the Songs of The Sea DVD. Li's Friends Li's friends followed him to the beach, where they discovered the sleeping Princess Ami. They are all unnamed. Their real names were also not revealed, but based on the Songs of The Sea DVD, the pioneer cast members portraying Li's friends were Suhaila Mohd Sanif, Adi Jamaludin, Richel Xie Shun Hang, Mohammed Zamri bin Ahmad Tony, Mohamed Farez Bin Mohamed Najid, and Cindy Ng Bee Ting. It was revealed in an interview with one of the cast members, that he was a survivor of the Cable Car Tragedy in 1983. After 24 years of fear going back to the island, he agreed to perform in \\"Songs of the Sea\\". He has been one of the longest- performing members. Lords of the Elements Lord of Fire He is the loud and rude ruler of the element of fire. The cast member who voiced him was Steve Croce. Spirit of Light She is the kind and gentle ruler of the element of light, and she is the only one of the three rulers of the elements who thanked Li for bringing her back her powers. The cast member who voiced her was Christine Flowers, and her singing voice was voiced by Sandrine Tome. The Lady of the Sea She is the wise ruler of the element of Water. The cast member who voiced her was Christine Flowers, and her singing voice was voiced by Sophie Leleu.

Anne Greene (c. 1628 - 1659) was an English domestic servant who was accused of committing infanticide in 1650. She is notable for surviving her attempted execution and being revived by physicians from Oxford University. Biography News from the Dead Greene was born around 1628 in Steeple Barton, Oxfordshire. In her early adulthood, she worked as a scullery maid in the house of Sir Thomas Read, a justice of the peace who lived in nearby Duns Tew. She later claimed that in 1650 when she was a 22-year-old servant, she was \\"often sollicited by faire promises and other amorous enticements\\" by Sir Thomas's grandson, Geoffrey Read, who was 16 or 17 years old, and that she was seduced by him. She became pregnant, though she later claimed that she was not aware of her pregnancy until she miscarried in the privy after seventeen weeks. She tried to conceal the remains of the fetus but was discovered and suspected of infanticide. Sir Thomas prosecuted Greene under the \\"Concealment of Birth of Bastards\\" Act of 1624, under which there was a legal presumption that a woman who concealed the death of her illegitimate child had murdered it. A midwife testified that the fetus was too underdeveloped to have ever been alive, and several servants who worked with Greene testified that she had \\"certain Issues for about a month before shee miscarried,\\" which began \\"after shee had violently labour'd in skreening of malt.\\" In spite of the testimony, Greene was found guilty of murder and was hanged at Oxford Castle on 14 December 1650. At her own request, several of her friends pulled at her swinging body and a soldier struck her four or five times with the butt of his musket to expedite her death and \\"dispatch her out of her paine.\\" After half an hour, everyone believed her to be dead, so she was cut down and given to Oxford University physicians William Petty and Thomas Willis for dissection. They opened her coffin the following day and discovered that Greene had a faint pulse and was weakly breathing. Petty and Willis sought the help of their Oxford colleagues Ralph Bathurst and Henry Clerke. The group of physicians tried many remedies to revive Greene, including pouring hot cordial down her throat, rubbing her limbs and extremities, bloodletting, applying a poultice to her breasts and having a \\"heating odoriferous Clyster to be cast up in her body, to give heat and warmth to her bowels.\\" The physicians then placed her in a warm bed with another woman, who rubbed her and kept her warm. Greene began to recover quickly, beginning to speak after twelve to fourteen hours of treatment and eating solid food after four days. Within one month she had fully recovered aside from amnesia surrounding the time of her execution. The authorities granted Greene a reprieve from execution while she recovered and ultimately pardoned her, believing that the hand of God had saved her, demonstrating her innocence. Furthermore, one pamphleteer notes that Sir Thomas Read died three days after Greene's execution, so there was no prosecutor to object to the pardon. However, another pamphleteer writes that her recovery \\"moved some of her enemies to wrath and indignation, insomuch that a great man amongst the rest, moved to have her again carried to the place of execution, to be hanged up by the neck, contrary to all Law, reason and justice; but some honest Souldiers then present seemed to be very much discontent thereat\\" and intervened on Greene's behalf. After her recovery, Greene went to stay with friends in the country, taking the coffin with her. She married, had three children and died in 1659.  In popular culture  The event inspired two 17th-century pamphlets. The first was by W. Burdet and was entitled A Wonder of Wonders (Oxford, 1651) in its first edition and A Declaration from Oxford, of Anne Greene in its second edition. Burdet's pamphlets portray the event in miraculous, metaphysical terms. In 1651, Richard Watkins also published a pamphlet containing a sober, medically accurate prose account of the event and poems inspired by it, entitled Newes from the Dead (Oxford: Leonard Lichfield, 1651). The poems, of which there were 25 in various languages, included a set of English verses by Christopher Wren, who was at that time a gentleman-commoner (a student who paid all fees in advance) of Wadham College. The character of Sarah Blundy in Iain Pears' 1997 historical mystery novel An Instance of the Fingerpost is roughly based on Anne Greene. Anne Greene is also the main character in Mary Hooper's 2008 young adult historical novel Newes from the Dead, inspired by the pamphlet of the same name.

In 1787 a decree in the court of chancery deprived him of the greater part of his fortune. Unable to find employment at home, he became at Easter 1790, on the recommendation of Lord Adam Gordon, land-steward to the Prince of Monaco on his estate at Torigny in Lower Normandy. From 14 October 1793 till 24 January 1795 he was imprisoned by the French revolutionary leaders, with his wife Isabella and his five children, in the castle at Torigny. The Duke of Valentinois, the son and successor of the Prince of Monaco, after being restored to his castle and such part of his estates as remained unsold, appointed Greene his land-steward in February 1796. The coup d'état of 4 September 1797 again threw him out of employment. In 1798, he went to Paris, and tried in vain to obtain passports for England. He returned to Torigny, where he was again arrested on 14 July 1798, and imprisoned in the citadel of St. Lo until December 1799. In February 1800, he was allowed to return to England. To relieve his financial distress, he published by subscription ‘A Relation of several Circumstances which occurred in the Province of Lower Normandy during the Revolution, and under the Governments of Robespierre and the Directory; commencing in 1789 down to 1800. With a detail of the Confinement and Sufferings of the Author; together with an Account of the Manners and Rural Customs of the Inhabitants of that part of the Country called the Bocage, in Lower Normandy,’ 8vo, London, 1802. Greene afterwards resided in Russia, and wrote a ‘Journal from London to St. Petersburg by way of Sweden,’ 12mo, London, 1813.

A brief excerpt from the report's introduction, p. 4: :\\"Playing the ‘Nazi card’ is a discursive act involving the use of Nazi or related terms or symbols (Nazism, Hitler, swastikas, etc.) in reference to Jews, Israel, Zionism or aspects of the Jewish experience. It manifests in words uttered in speech or in writing, or in visual representations such as artwork, drawings, caricatures, cartoons, graffiti, daubings and scratchings, or visual expressions such as a Nazi salute or the clicking of heels. In many instances, the playing of the Nazi card is unquestionably antisemitic. However, the inclusion of particular modes of criticism of Israel in definitions of antisemitism has provoked controversy. The result has been a war of words which has stagnated into an intellectual and discursive cul-de-sac of claim and counter-claim about what does and does not qualify as antisemitism…. One of the most challenging components of antisemitic discourse in general, and the discursive theme of the Nazi card in particular, concerns the problem of when the Nazi card is played against Israel and its founding movement, Zionism. In this case playing the Nazi card involves equating the Israeli state collectively, or the state embodied by its leaders or its military practices, with Nazis, Nazi Germany, and the genocidal actions of the Nazi regime….\\" The 2009 report incorporated from the 2006 report the five specific kinds of criticism of Israel that the authors believed should be considered as anti-Semitism:EISCA report, p 34 # Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour. # Applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. # Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterise Israel or Israelis. # Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis. # Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel. The report does not say all criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic: \\"Abhorrence and protest against the policies, practices, and leaders of the Israeli state can be expressed in numerous forceful and trenchant ways, as they could against any other state - none of which would be antisemitic…\\"EISCA report, p 24 and \\"Drawing attention to the consequent harms in [playing the Nazi card against Israel] should not be intended, or taken, in any way as an attempt to suppress criticism of Israel and its military practices\\" EISCA report, p 32 Antony Lerman criticized the report, and suggested that it could be used to suppress legitimate criticism of Israel, and suggests that the report's authors do not adequately address that possibility. *Lerman Should we ban ..\\": :\\"While much of the [report's] definition [of anti-Semitism relating to criticism of Israel] is unexceptionable, it cites five ways in which antisemitism could be seen to \\"manifest itself with regard to the state of Israel taking into account the overall context\\". One of these – \\"using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism... to characterise Israel or Israelis\\" – is fully justified. The other four are contentious: \\"Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination\\"; \\"Applying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation\\"; \\"Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis\\"; \\"Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel\\". None of these four are self-evidently antisemitic. But all could be used to justify labelling legitimate criticism of Israel as antisemitic. So the authors' approval of them makes their claim that \\"Drawing attention to the consequent harms in [playing the Nazi card against Israel] should not be intended, or taken, in any way as an attempt to suppress criticism of Israel and its military practices\\" both naïve and flimsy.\\" References *Igansky, Paul, and Sweiry, Abe, Understanding and Addressing the ‘Nazi Card' - Intervening Against Antisemitic Discourse, published by European Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism (EISCA), 2000, online.

It is also a registered charity. It mainly operates BBV hovercraft, which have been used to rescue people, animals and vehicles from the mudflats of the Bristol Channel, but also has two small inshore rescue boat. The construction of its boathouse on the seafront in 1994 was the subject of a television programme and took just three days. History Mud danger signs on Bridgwater Bay near the mouth of the River Parrett are necessary because fast, high-amplitude tides here have led to drownings on the extensive mud flats. Burnham-on-Sea is on the shore of the Bristol Channel and has a long sandy beach, but nearby mudflats and sandbanks have claimed several lives over the years. At low tide, large parts of the area become mudflats up to wide due to the tidal range of , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. A lifeboat had been provided in the town from 1836, but this was withdrawn in 1930 leaving coverage for the area to the lifeboat. A charity appeal was established in 1992, by members of the local sailing community, to equip the town with its own inshore rescue boat. In June 1994, the boathouse was built in the space of three days by Anneka Rice and a team of builders for the BBC TV series Challenge Anneka. The site and technical support was provided by Sedgemoor District Council. In June 2002, a five-year-old holidaymaker, Lelaina Hall, was drowned on the mudflats at Berrow, north of the town. A new appeal was launched in association with the Association of Search and Rescue Hovercraft (since renamed Hovercraft Search and Rescue UK) and with the backing of the Western Daily Press. This raised £115,000 to buy a rescue hovercraft, which could operate on mud and in shallow water that was unapproachable for the inshore rescue boat. It arrived on 22 March 2003, and during its first year of operation up to 50 people were rescued. BARB asked the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) to take over inshore rescue boat work on the coast, which it did on 23 December 2003. The RNLI operates a Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB) and a inflatable boat from Burnham-on-Sea Lifeboat Station which is a short distance from the BARB boathouse and complements their hovercraft. Boathouse The BARB boathouse The BARB headquarters, The Marine Rescue Center is a single-storey block building that matches the adjacent tourist information centre BIARS (Burnham Information And Rescue Support) and public conveniences. The boathouse is at the north end and the Coastguard have facilities at the other end of the building. Fleet Inshore rescue boat The two inshore rescue boats are Arancia inflatable boats, that can operate in calm inland waters to assist Police with searches for missing persons, usually alongside Avon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service. They are also used to help wildlife charities such as Secret World in small wildlife rescues. Their main role is use by BARB Search & rescue's Swift Water Team as part of Surf Life Saving GB. Spirit of Lelania The Spirit of Lelania is a six-seat BBV-6 hovercraft designed by Bill Baker Vehicles and built by Ivanoff Hovercraft AB, in Sweden in 2003. It is long and wide. Initially powered by a engine, it has a cruising speed of over water. In November 2010, the engine was replaced with a new unit from a MG TF sports car, donated by the manufacturer MG Motor. Light of Elizabeth The Light Of Elizabeth is a four-seat BBV craft intended for training and to reach sites on the River Parrett where the larger hovercraft cannot operate. It entered service in August 2006. A new larger Italian-designed hovercraft replaced Light Of Elizabeth in 2013. It was funded by donations from local individuals and groups and is made of kevlar rather than fibreglass to make it more resilient.

Greenwell was born in 1781, the third son of Joshua Greenwell of Kibblesworth, of the family of Greenwell of Greenwell Ford, county Durham. He entered the army by purchase as Ensign in the 45th Regiment of Foot in 1802, became Lieutenant in 1803, and Captain in 1804. In 1806, he embarked with his regiment in the secret British invasion of South America under General Craufurd, which ultimately was sent to La Plata as a reinforcement, and took part in the operations against Buenos Aires. He landed with the regiment in Portugal on 1 August 1808, and, save on two occasions when absent on account of wounds, was present with it throughout the Peninsular War from Roliça to Toulouse. He was in temporary command of the regiment during Massena's retreat from Torres Vedras, at the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro, and at the final siege and fall of Badajoz. He became regimental major after the Battle of Bussaco, and received a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy after the Battle of Salamanca; he conducted the light troops of Picton's division at Orthez, and succeeded to the command of his regiment on the fall of Colonel Forbes at the Battle of Toulouse. In the course of these campaigns he was repeatedly wounded: he was shot through the body, through the neck, and through the right arm, a bullet lodged in his left arm, and another in his right leg. In 1819 Greenwell took his regiment to Ceylon, and commanded it there for six years, but was compelled to return home through ill-health before it embarked for Burma. In 1831 he was appointed commandant at Chatham, a post he vacated on promotion to Major-general on 10 January 1837. Greenwell was a Knight Commander of both the Order of the Bath (KCB) and the Royal Guelphic Order (KCH). He had purchased all his regimental steps but one. He died in Harley Street, Cavendish Square, London, on 11 November 1844, aged 63 and was buried at Newcastle Cathedral.

Life He was the eldest son of the Rev. Thomas Greer, presbyterian minister of Dunboe, and Elizabeth Caldwell, daughter of Captain Adam Caldwell, R.N. He was born at Springvale, County Londonderry, in 1810, educated at the Belfast Academy and Glasgow University, and was called to the Irish Bar in 1833. His life was devoted to constitutional agitation for such reforms in Irish land tenure as were necessary to make the union tolerable as a permanent arrangement. It was about 1848 that Greer first began to take an active part in political life, and although never a very prominent figure in public, his influence and popularity in his native county were very great. He was one of the originators of the tenant league, formed in 1850 by himself, Sir John Gray, proprietor of the 'Freeman's Journal,' Dr. M'Knight, editor of the 'Londonderry Standard,' Frederick Lucas, and John Francis Maguire. They demanded for the Irish tenant what have since been known as the three F's —fixity of tenure, fair rents, and free sale. Greer was one of the few Ulstermen of any weight or position—William Sharman Crawford was another—who adopted these principles. He contested the representation of County Londonderry four times, and that of the City of Londonderry twice, being successful only once, when he was elected for the county at the 1857 general election. Although continually defeated, Greer was the effective creator of the liberal party in Ulster. He practically retired from politics in 1870, before the major movement in favour of Irish home rule. Most of the reforms for which Greer struggled—tenant right, vote by ballot, etc.—were conceded. He dissented from the Parnellite principle of standing aloof from the English parties. There was, therefore, nothing to prevent him from accepting the recordership of Londonderry in 1870. He held this office until 1878, when he was appointed county court judge of Cavan and Leitrim. He died in 1880.

The program aids the Hermitage with its external and internal activities and functions as an informal link between the museum staff and the public, making the knowledge of the museum's experts accessible to the general community. Volunteers also develop projects reflecting their own personal goals and interests in connection with the museum. Mission The mission statement of the Hermitage Volunteer Service is \\"Fostering a sense of responsibility for the preservation of cultural heritage.\\" The principal mission of the Volunteer Service is to acquaint young people with international culture and heritage through access to the Hermitage's extensive international collections. The volunteer program aims to help younger generations understand the value of tradition and to instill in them a feeling of responsibility for its preservation. The Volunteer Service involves young students in various cultural projects, many of which are directly linked to various museum activities. History Shortly before the celebration of the 300th anniversary of Saint Petersburg, Mikhail Kozhukhovskij approached the Hermitage Administration and proposed to create a volunteer service to help the organisation of the tricentennial activities.http://encblago.lfond.spb.ru/showObject.do?object=2814521805 At the same time, he began to search for individuals with experience in the creation of educational programs who were interested in being part of such a project. Due to his efforts, the Hermitage was able to choose from among a group of 150 individuals prepared to help. On 23 May 2003 a group of volunteers wearing red uniforms entered the Hermitage for the first time and began to assist in any way they could.The State Hermitage Museum Report for 2003, p.165 Kozhukovskij was assigned to head this new Volunteer Service. While still in its infancy, the program created many projects in collaboration with various departments of the Hermitage, which allowed volunteers to become an integral part of the museum's staff. The team The program is continually renewed through a constant flow of new volunteers of diverse background; students and workers, Russians and foreigners, young and old work together for the general improvement of the Hermitage. Currently volunteers involved with the program come from all over the world including Russia, Switzerland, the United States, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Lebanon, Brazil, Korea, Ireland, and other countries.http://www.benevole.ru/ Each volunteer devotes time to the program according to their individual schedules and skills. They include linguists, art historians, journalists, teachers, computer scientists, and individuals from other professions not necessarily linked to the cultural sphere. For instance, the volunteer service includes a bus driver, an arachnologist, and a dancer. After Hermitage volunteers leave the Service, many keep in touch with the program and its other members. In this way, the volunteer program has established an extensive international network of contacts.  Awards  On November 23, 2013, the government of Saint Petersburg's Council for Youth Politics organised a celebration in honour of the State Hermitage Museum's volunteer program in the atrium of the museum. The celebration's main goal was to promote the museum's young volunteer movement and raise awareness for the volunteer's activities and projects among the citizens, authorities and companies. Among the 150 organisations participating in the competition, the best were awarded honorary diplomas and prizes. As a competitor in the competition for “Most Effective Volunteer Program”, the State Hermitage won the award in the category “Execution of Municipal Events”. An honorary diploma and the bronze statue of the “Little Prince” were awarded to the volunteer program's coordinator Mikhail Kozhukhovskij. Activities Below are some examples of the activities in which members of the program may participate: * Reception and security: Welcoming and assisting Hermitage visitors, checking tickets and providing information * Helping with scientific projects: Typing of museum inventories, conservation-restoration, archaeological excavations, classification and management of stored artifacts * Preparing museum publications and correspondence * Developing new communication technology and creating designs for multi-media projects * Helping to organize seminars and international conferences * Translation work * Teaching foreign languages and creating conversation groups * Helping to move artifacts and exhibitions Projects WHY (World Heritage & Youth) World Heritage & Youth (WHY) is the flagship project of the Volunteer Service. Its main goal is to bring into focus the importance of tradition. This project involves volunteers in various programs and conferences concerning cultural preservation. One example of the sort of issues tackled by the WHY project is the debate regarding the construction of the Okhta Center, one of the most criticized building projects proposed in contemporary Saint Petersburg. Many volunteers have reacted negatively to its potential construction. Stressing the importance of preserving the historic center of Saint Petersburg, the program is actively involved in the discussion surrounding this controversial project. The Summer University of the State Hermitage Museum is the direct result of the WHY project. Since 2009, the Volunteer Service has organized the Summer University each July in collaboration with the Russian company Rosatom.The State Hermitage Annual Report, 2009 Students, often from remote areas of Russia, are invited to participate in a series of events and activities designed to educate them about cultural tradition. For many of them, the Summer University is the first opportunity to discover and to explore the notion of cultural heritage. The Volunteer Service organizes various activities in conjunction with this programme. Project Ropsha Project Ropsha was the first project created by the Volunteer Service. The city of Ropsha, located southwest of Saint Petersburg, is the site of a palace included in UNESCO’s World Heritage List. Hermitage volunteers took part in a campaign to stop the destruction of this monument. They started by gathering information about the location, and then created a unique archive. The project involved the creation of the Christmas Tree Museum at the site of the palace, which helps the children of the city to understand this almost universal holiday tradition. Games, quests, and contests Every year the Volunteer Service organizes games conquests and activities for school-aged children and students. For example, in one fun and interesting game, students can get acquainted with the pages of world history and culture. It is a fascinating journey through the halls of the museum in search of unusual treasures and exhibits. The aim is to present world history on a level easily understood by children. Each game focuses on a particular aspect of history, cultural heritage, or tradition. In February 2009 the Service created a game called The Day of the Scythians which helped children not only discover the ancient Scythians, but also the nomads of the rich Pazyryk culture. The Service also organizes educational contests developed through collaboration with schools as part of their academic programs. Various Hermitage departments are also involved in this kind of activity. When visiting the thematic excursions and engaging in some investigations, students can discover a wonderful world of history and culture.

This parasite belongs to the Diplodiscidae family and is a common parasite located in the urinary bladder and rectum of frogs. The primary host is frogs and the intermediate hosts of Megalodiscus temeperatus are freshwater snails in the genus Helisoma. Morphology Megalodiscus temperatus are flukes that contain a pair of posterior fluid filled pouch located in the oral sucker with a posterior sucker that is equal to the largest width of the body. The tegumental surface of this parasite contains various rows of indentations. The patterns of the indentation merge into several areas into folds with ridges that represent the posterior and genital pores. Reproduction The reproduction of Megalodiscus temperatus are displayed in the stomach and rectum of frogs and tadpoles. The snails that are diffused with miracidia releases cercariae into the water to penetrate the skin of frogs. The frogs regularly cast off the outer layers of the skin which results in their exposure to metaceriae. The metaceriae remains in the rectum of the frog and matures in the time span of four months. Tadpoles are less commonly infected, but when infected they are infected by the ingestion of cercaria. Through the process of metaphorphosis, Megalodiscus temperatus travels primarily from the anterior to the posterior of the rectum. Geographical range Megalodiscus temperatus are commonly prevalent in the high altitude regions of the United States. Life cycle *The adult worms live in the rectum of frogs or in the pyloric ceca of several species of fish including trout, sunfish and bass. *Eggs are laid fully embryonated containing miracidia that enter the first intermediate hosts. *In Megalodiscus temperatus, the hepatopancreas of snails is finally parasitized, whereas in the gills of fingernail clams are penetrated. *In both hosts miracidia transform into mother sporocysts, which give rise to 2–3 generations. *The last one produces with a pharyngeal pouch. *The ocellated cercariae escape daily from infected intermediate hosts and attach to the skin of tadpoles or frogs and enter the muscles where they encyst and grow to be infectious. Transmission M. temperatus preferentially infects snails-its first intermediate host, tadpoles, and frogs-its definitive host. Thus, environments harboring M. temperatus include streams, ponds, and bodies of water. Snails, commonly Helisoma trivolvis, H. antosum and H. campanulata, acquire infection by way of miracidia penetration. Upon embryonated egg deposition into aqueous environments from feces of adult flukes in the large intestine of tadpoles and rectum of frogs, miracidia penetrate snails and undergo three generations of rediae in the liver-the third producing and releasing an immature cercariae into the tissues of the snail host. Daily shedding of mature cercariae opportunistically encyst on the skin of tadpoles and adult frogs, particularly the dark spots of the fore and hindlegs. Tadpoles then become infected by ingestion of such encysted metacercariae or inhalation of free cercariae and attach onto the large intestine and become gravid. During the process of metamorphosis, the process at which tadpoles structurally mature into adult frogs, flukes migrate superiorly into the small intestine, as far as possible as to elude being dispensed. As the intestine shortens after metamorphosis and adolescent frogs begin development of a protein diet, the remaining flukes return to the rectum. Infection in adult frogs may also occur by ingestion of metacercariae. Diagnosis Infection by M. temperatus may be identified by examining miracidia on snails, dead cercarae or formed metacercariae on tadpoles, and/or rectal flukes in adult frogs via dissection. Treatment Based on the similar tegument integrity of M. temperatus, in comparison with other anthelmintics, Praziquantel (PZQ) may be used as treatment to combat infection. Disease control Vulnerable populations in North America susceptible to M. temperatus infection include snails-first definitive hosts, tadpoles, and frogs-definitive hosts to the parasite. Localized in the hepatopancreas of snails, large intestine of tadpoles, and rectum of adult frogs, means of disease control include: random and periodic testing of vulnerable species populations for infection, controlling both snail and frog populations, and/or controlling saturated ecosystems infected with M. temperatus via pesticides, introduction of new species to combat transmission and minimize both transmission prevalence and incidence of infection.

The Mystery of Easter (Balthasar, Hans Urs von (2000). p. 3.) is a 1969 book by the Swiss theologian and Catholic priest Hans Urs von Balthasar. It began as a monograph-sized article for the dogmatic encyclopedia Mysterium Salutis (1965-1976), which was intended as a complete treatment of the mystery of salvation in Catholic theology. Von Balthasar wrote several sections, but he was not initially asked to author this one on the paschal mystery. The editors had commissioned the article from another collaborator, and when he refused, von Balthasar stepped in to take his place. The article (197 pages in the original) was published almost simultaneously also in book form, with the title Theologie der drei Tage. It offers an account of the death and resurrection of Christ, and their significance for the Christian life. Balthasar discusses the \\"bodiliness\\" of the Resurrection from the \\"radical\\" death of Jesus, involving his descent into the place of the dead on Holy Saturday. Balthasar's willingness to assume the nature and the consequence of his sin makes him, as well as the reader, extrapolate that God can endure and conquer godlessness, abandonment, and death. His exegesis emphasizes that Jesus was not betrayed but surrendered and delivered up by himself, since the meaning of the Greek word used by the New Testament, paradidonai (παραδιδόναι, ), is unequivocally \\"handing over of self\\".Balthasar, Hans Urs von (2000), p. 77. In the 1972 \\"Preface to the Second Edition\\", Balthasar takes a cue from Revelation See occurrences on Google Books. (Vulgate: agni qui occisus est ab origine mundi, NIV: \\"the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world\\") to explore the idea that, from the \\"immanent Trinity\\" up to the \\"economic\\" One, \\"God is love\\" consists in an \\"eternal super-kenosis\\".Balthasar, Hans Urs von (2000). Preface to the Second Edition. In the words of Balthasar himself: \\"At this point, where the subject undergoing the 'hour' is the Son speaking with the Father, the controversial 'Theopaschist formula' has its proper place: 'One of the Trinity has suffered.'. DS 401 (Pope John II, letter Olim quidem addressed to the senators of Constantinople, March 534). The formula can already be found in Gregory Nazianzen: 'We needed a...crucified God'.\\" The 1969 original German edition was published by Benzinger Verlag, Einsiedeln.

During the first action on the morning of 16 March a six-man Australian Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team (OMLT) operating with Afghan National Army (ANA) troops was contacted by a numerically superior Taliban force near the village. In the ensuing battle one Australian was killed before close air support from Dutch AH-64D Apache helicopter gunships and US aircraft allowed them to withdraw after inflicting heavy casualties on the Taliban insurgents. A month later, on 12 April, an Australian platoon was attacked by a large Taliban force near Kakarak during a combined Australian and Afghan offensive known as Operation Shak Hawel. Outnumbered, the Australians were initially forced to withdraw into a nearby compound, returning fire with small-arms and grenade launchers, before cavalry in an overwatch position decisively engaged the Taliban force, allowing the Australians to regain the initiative. Australian Special Forces moved to establish a blocking position and engaged the Taliban from the rear, while close air support was called in, inflicting heavy casualties on the insurgents and forcing them to withdraw following two hours of fighting. That evening further airstrikes destroyed a compound being used by the insurgents. Although the battle witnessed some of the heaviest and most sustained fighting experienced by conventional Australian forces since the Vietnam War, they suffered no casualties. The operation significantly disrupted insurgent activities in the area. Background By early 2009 the Kakarak region, located in the West Dorafshan district of Orūzgān Province approximately north of Tarin Kowt, was one of the last Taliban outposts in the area. The Australian 1st Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force (MRTF-1)—a combined arms battle group based on the 7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment under the command Lieutenant Colonel Shane Gabriel—was part of the Dutch-led Task Force Uruzgan and was responsible for mentoring Afghan National Army (ANA) troops from the 4th Brigade, 205th Corps that were based in the area. Operating from Patrol Base Buman in the Chora Valley, east of Kakarak overlooking the Dorashan River, Combat Team Tusk from MRTF-1 was the main Australian force in the area, working with ANA troops from the 2nd Kandak, 4th Brigade. The area had previously been witnessed fighting between an Australian-mentored ANA patrol and Taliban insurgents on 4 January 2009; however, in the months that followed the town became the scene of two more significant engagements.For his actions during this contact, one of the Australians with the patrol, Sergeant John Lines, was later awarded the Medal of Gallantry. See Battle 16 March 2009 On 16 March 2009 a six-man Australian patrol from an Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team (OMLT), working together with the ANA, was engaged at 09:30 by 20 Taliban fighters near the village of Kakarak.Coulthard-Clark 2010, p. 299. Under the command of Lieutenant Jacob Kleinman the outnumbered Australian patrol fought back, but not before one of the section commanders was seriously wounded in the head by small-arms fire. The Australians subsequently secured a compound and suppressed the Taliban forces that were attempting to outflank them, while the patrol's medic moved across of open ground under heavy fire to render first aid to the injured soldier and evacuate him to area of relative safety. At 10:20 two Dutch AH-64D Apache helicopter gunships arrived on station to provide aerial fire support, allowing the Australians and Afghans to break contact, while the casualty evacuation was effected under fire by a US UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter as they withdrew. Despite receiving further emergency treatment, the injured Australian soldier subsequently died of his wounds. Meanwhile, another Australian patrol from MRTF-1 was nearby providing security for the OMLT, and they were also engaged with small-arms and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) by another Taliban force of up to 40 fighters. Dutch helicopters and US aircraft continued to provide close air support to the Australians, and following heavy fighting the Taliban were forced to withdraw after suffering heavy casualties. After marrying-up the two Australian force elements returned to their Patrol Base Buman, which was completed by 12:01. However Australian Special Forces from the Special Operations Task Group (SOTG)—then based on 2 Squadron, Special Air Service Regiment—subsequently established blocking positions to prevent the Taliban withdrawal, and they later contacted a group of ten insurgents, killing a number of them in the ensuing fighting. For his leadership Kleinman was later awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, while Lance Corporal Giancarlos Taraborrelli and Private David Cox were both awarded the Medal for Gallantry. 12 April 2009 Following the earlier Australian operations in the area, key Taliban leaders and a number of fighters were believed to have moved south along the banks of the Dorafshan River and Gabriel subsequently tasked Combat Team Tusk with clearing the East Dorafshan in preparation for further operations west of the river. Australian Special Forces from SOTG were also operating in the area, conducting disruption operations in the West Dorasfshan area. Between 3–15 April the Australians conducted Operation Shak Hawel (or Mysterious Area) in the fertile green-zone around Patrol Base Buman, in order to target the Taliban stronghold. More than 200 Australians were involved—nearly half the battle group—including a combined arms force element with infantry, cavalry and engineers, and an ANA battalion from the 2nd Kandak, 4th ANA Brigade. Throughout the offensive, Australian and Afghan troops were engaged in numerous fire-fights as they conducted intensive patrolling and cordon and search operations to restrict insurgent freedom of movement throughout the area of operations. However, during the biggest battle, dozens of Taliban fighters were killed as they attempted to ambush an Australian force operating in the fertile green belt. On the morning of 12 April, while operating in support of an Australian OMLT mentoring ANA forces, a 40-man platoon from Combat Team Tusk—2 Platoon under the command of Lieutenant Ashley Judd—was engaged by a large Taliban force after successfully surprising and engaging an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) emplacement team in a nearby compound around 06:20. Forced to withdraw into the compound after being fired on by small-arms and RPGs, the outnumbered Australians then responded aggressively, with the infantry returning fire with small-arms and 40 mm grenade launchers, while ASLAV gun cars from cavalry in an overwatch position decisively engaged the insurgents across the river with their 25 mm chain guns. Meanwhile, Australian Special Forces to the west also provided an effective blocking force, engaging the Taliban force from the rear. Having regained the initiative, 1 Platoon was subsequently pushed to the north in an attempt to the cut-off insurgent reinforcements. As the fighting subsided, 2 Platoon continued to be harassed with RPGs by insurgents occupying the dead ground. The Australians responded with air burst fire from their 84 mm Carl Gustav rocket launchers, yet this proved only partially effective. Dutch AH-64D Apaches and US aircraft were then called in to suppress the insurgents in the dead ground, as the Australians forced the Taliban to withdraw with heavy casualties after two hours of intense fighting. However, as the insurgents were believed to be preparing to mortar the compound, the Australians then withdrew back to the overwatch position, before calling in an airstrike onto another compound being used by the insurgents. The Australian Special Forces then moved back into the engagement area to conduct battlefield clearance, and under the cover of the ASLAVs, they neutralised the remaining insurgents before securing the compound that had been previously hit. A large cache of 107 mm rockets and small arms was subsequently uncovered, along with a tunnel system. A second airstrike at 23:00 completed the destruction of the compound. The following day the local civilians were observed collecting the dead insurgents in order to bury them in accordance with Islamic custom. Four insurgents were confirmed killed, while total Taliban losses during the fighting were believed to have numbered at least 20 killed and 20 wounded, including a number of key commanders. There were no Australian casualties, and despite the intensity of the fighting no civilians were believed to have been injured. The battle witnessed some of the heaviest and most sustained fighting experienced by conventional Australian forces since the Vietnam War, with as many as 60–100 insurgents thought to have been involved.For his leadership during earlier fighting in the Chora Valley on 29 December 2008 Judd was later awarded a Commendation for Distinguished Service. See Aftermath The operation ended in a decisive victory for the Australians, significantly disrupting insurgent activities in the area with the subsequent clearance of the West Dorafshan three weeks later being largely uneventful as a result, while rocket attacks against Forward Operating Base Ripley in Tarin Kowt also ceased for the next eight months. Later, the construction of a patrol base nearby further extended ANA influence over the area. Meanwhile, a senior insurgent commander, Mullah Noorullah, who was believed to have been involved in the fighting on 12 April, was killed in early May by Australian Special Forces in a joint operation after he and another insurgent were tracked moving into a tunnel system.

The highway stretches 17 km from Edapally in the Ernakulam district to Aroor in Alappuzha district , via. Palarivattom, Vyttila, Kundannoor, Madavana, Kumbalam. The Government of Kerala began the preliminary works in 1973. After a slow progress, it was partially opened for traffic in the beginning years of the 1980s. The section between Edapally and Vyttila had four lanes from the beginning. The rest of the carriageway was also upgraded to different sections of 4 lane, 5lane and 6 lanes by 2010 The idea was to bypass the truck traffic out of the city proper. However now the city has outgrown the bypass leading to a heavy suburban traffic. Today, this road has turned out to be the most important arterial road in Kochi. The spacious road is going to replace the MG Road as the state's major commercial avenue in a few years time. Space crunch has really started to take toll on the MG Road, and the NH Bypass provides answer to all the problems faced by the former. Bypass Road has enough width to make the entire stretch into 6lane with service roads and a median. This 17-km stretch of road running across the city has become the hub of business for the city. This road Edapally - Aroor bypass is expected to slowly overtake MG road as the commercial hotspot of Kochi City and also Kerala state. The S.A.Road & Kaniyampuzha Road connects the stretch with Vyttila Mobility Hub (Said to be the biggest & most important Transport Hub of Kochi and one of the largest bus terminal in India). Kochi Bypass at Thykoodam Kochi Bypass near Vytila Congested Roads According to a survey conducted in 2016, Edappally-Aroor National Highway stretch carries over 77,000 passenger car units daily. An elevated four-lane corridor is being planned on the Bypass to accommodate the ever-increasing number of vehicles. A detailed project report (DPR) is being readied on how to decongest the stretch which carries over 77,000 passenger car units (PCUs) daily. Over one lakh PCUs cross junctions on the corridor. All this calls for an eight-lane highway. Widening the existing four-lane stretch is a tough proposition since both sides of the 16-km-long stretch are heavily built up. An ideal way according to N.H.A.I to decongest the ever-busy stretch that carries inter and intra-State vehicles, which include national permit, container, tipper and tanker lorries, is to build a four-lane elevated highway. The cost per km will come to around ₹120 crore. The NHAI has proposed to take a final decision after Feedback Infra Private Limited submits its DPR shortly on developing the stretch.

Microscopic images of a moss leaf from Plagiomnium undulatum. Bright-field microscopy at the top and fluorescence microscopy at the bottom. The red fluorescence is from the chlorophyll in the chloroplasts. Chlorophyll fluorescence is light re-emitted by chlorophyll molecules during return from excited to non-excited states. It is used as an indicator of photosynthetic energy conversion in higher plants, algae and bacteria. Excited chlorophyll dissipates the absorbed light energy by driving photosynthesis (photochemical energy conversion), as heat in non-photochemical quenching or by emission as fluorescence radiation. As these processes are complementary processes, the analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence is an important tool in plant research with a wide spectrum of applications.  The Kautsky effect  Upon illumination of a dark-adapted leaf, there is a rapid rise in fluorescence from Photosystem II (PSII), followed by a slow decline. First observed by Kautsky et al., 1932, this is called the Kautsky Effect. This variable rise in chlorophyll fluorescence rise is due to photosystem II. Fluorescence from photosystem I is not variable, but constant. The increase in fluorescence is due to PSII reaction centers being in a \\"closed\\" or chemically reduced state. Reaction centers are \\"closed\\" when unable to accept further electrons. This occurs when electron acceptors downstream of PSII have not yet passed their electrons to a subsequent electron carrier, so are unable to accept another electron. Closed reaction centres reduce the overall photochemical efficiency, and so increases the level of fluorescence. Transferring a leaf from dark into light increases the proportion of closed PSII reaction centres, so fluorescence levels increase for 1–2 seconds. Subsequently, fluorescence decreases over a few minutes. This is due to; 1. more \\"photochemical quenching\\" in which electrons are transported away from PSII due to enzymes involved in carbon fixation; and 2. more \\"non- photochemical quenching\\" in which more energy is converted to heat.  Measuring fluorescence  Usually the initial measurement is the minimal level of fluorescence, \\\\,F_0. This is the fluorescence in the absence of photosynthetic light. To use measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence to analyse photosynthesis, researchers must distinguish between photochemical quenching and non-photochemical quenching (heat dissipation). This is achieved by stopping photochemistry, which allows researchers to measure fluorescence in the presence of non-photochemical quenching alone. To reduce photochemical quenching to negligible levels, a high intensity, short flash of light is applied to the leaf. This transiently closes all PSII reaction centres, which prevents energy of PSII being passed to downstream electron carriers. Non- photochemical quenching will not be affected if the flash is short. During the flash, the fluorescence reaches the level reached in the absence of any photochemical quenching, known as maximum fluorescence \\\\,F_m. The efficiency of photochemical quenching (which is a proxy of the efficiency of PSII) can be estimated by comparing \\\\,F_m to the steady yield of fluorescence in the light \\\\,F_t and the yield of fluorescence in the absence of photosynthetic light \\\\,F_0. The efficiency of non-photochemical quenching is altered by various internal and external factors. Alterations in heat dissipation mean changes in \\\\,F_m. Heat dissipation cannot be totally stopped, so the yield of chlorophyll fluorescence in the absence of non-photochemical quenching cannot be measured. Therefore, researchers use a dark-adapted point (F_m^0) with which to compare estimations of non-photochemical quenching.  Common fluorescence parameters  \\\\,F_0: Minimal fluorescence (arbitrary units). Fluorescence level of dark- adapted sample when all reaction centers of the photosystem II are open. \\\\,F_m: Maximal fluorescence (arbitrary units). Fluorescence level of dark- adapted sample when a high intensity pulse has been applied. All reaction centers of the photosystem II are closed. \\\\,{F_0}': Minimal fluorescence (arbitrary units). Fluorescence level of light-adapted sample when all reaction centers of the photosystem II are open; it is lowered with respect to \\\\,F_0 by non-photochemical quenching. \\\\,{F_m}': Maximal fluorescence (arbitrary units). Fluorescence level of light-adapted sample when a high intensity pulse has been applied. All reaction centers of the photosystem II are closed. \\\\,F_{t}: Steady-state terminal fluorescence (arbitrary units). A steady-state fluorescence level decreased (= quenched) by photochemical and non-photochemical processes. \\\\,T_{1/2}: Half rise time from \\\\,F_0 to \\\\,F_m.  Calculated parameters  \\\\,F_v is variable fluorescence. Calculated as \\\\,F_v = \\\\,F_m \\\\- \\\\,F_0. \\\\tfrac{F_v}{F_m} is the ratio of variable fluorescence to maximal fluorescence. Calculated as \\\\frac{F_m-F_0}{F_m}. This is a measure of the maximum efficiency of PSII (the efficiency if all PSII centres were open). \\\\tfrac{F_v}{F_m} can be used to estimate the potential efficiency of PSII by taking dark-adapted measurements. \\\\,\\\\Phi_{PSII} measures the efficiency of Photosystem II. Calculated as \\\\, Y_{(II)} = ,\\\\frac{{F_m}'-F_t}{{F_m}'}. This parameter measures the proportion of light absorbed by PSII that is used in photochemistry. As such, it can give a measure of the rate of linear electron transport and so indicates overall photosynthesis. \\\\,qP (photochemical quenching). Calculated as \\\\,\\\\frac{{F_m}'-F_t}{{F_m}'-{F_0}'}. This parameter approximates the proportion of PSII reaction centres that are open. Whilst \\\\,\\\\Phi_{PSII} gives an estimation of the efficiency, \\\\,qP and \\\\tfrac{F_v}{F_m} tell us which processes which have altered the efficiency. Closure of reaction centers as a result of a high intensity light will alter the value of \\\\,qP. Changes in the efficiency of non-photochemical quenching will alter the ratio \\\\tfrac{F_v}{F_m}.  Applications of the Theory   PSII yield as a measure of photosynthesis  Chlorophyll fluorescence appears to be a measure of photosynthesis, but this is an over-simplification. Fluorescence can measure the efficiency of PSII photochemistry, which can be used to estimate the rate of linear electron transport by multiplying by the light intensity. However, researchers generally mean carbon fixation when they refer to photosynthesis. Electron transport and CO2 fixation can correlate well, but may not correlate in the field due to processes such as photorespiration, nitrogen metabolism and the Mehler reaction.  Relating electron transport to carbon fixation  A powerful research technique is to simultaneously measure chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange to obtain a full picture of the response of plants to their environment. One technique is to simultaneously measure CO2 fixation and PSII photochemistry at different light intensities, in non- photorespiratory conditions. A plot of CO2 fixation and PSII photochemistry indicates the electron requirement per molecule CO2 fixed. From this estimation, the extent of photorespiration may be estimated. This has been used to explore the significance of photorespiration as a photoprotective mechanism during drought. Fluorescence analysis can also be applied to understanding the effects of low and high temperatures. * Sobrado (2008) investigated gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence responses to high intensity light, of pioneer species and forest species. Midday leaf gas exchange was measured using a photosynthesis system, which measured net photosynthetic rate, gs, and intercellular CO2 concentration (C_i). In the same leaves used for gas exchange measurements, chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters (initial, \\\\,F_0; maximum, \\\\,F_m; and variable, \\\\,F_v) were measured using a fluorometer. The results showed that despite pioneer species and forest species occupying different habitats, both showed similar vulnerability to midday photoinhibition in sun-exposed leaves.  Measuring stress and stress tolerance  Chlorophyll fluorescence can measure most types of plant stress. Chlorophyll fluorescence can be used as a proxy of plant stress because environmental stresses, e.g. extremes of temperature, light and water availability, can reduce the ability of a plant to metabolise normally. This can mean an imbalance between the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll and the use of energy in photosynthesis. * Favaretto et al. (2010) investigated adaptation to a strong light environment in pioneer and late successional species, grown under 100% and 10% light. Numerous parameters, including chlorophyll a fluorescence, were measured. A greater decline in \\\\tfrac{F_v}{F_m} under full sun light in the late-successional species than in the pioneer species was observed. Overall, their results show that pioneer species perform better under high-sun light than late- successional species, suggesting that pioneer plants have more potential tolerance to photo- oxidative damage. * Neocleous and Vasilakakis (2009) investigated the response of raspberry to boron and salt stress. An chlorophyll fluorometer was used to measure \\\\,F_0, \\\\,F_m and \\\\,F_v. The leaf chlorophyll fluorescence was not significantly affected by NaCl concentration when B concentration was low. When B was increased, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence was reduced under saline conditions. It could be concluded that the combined effect of B and NaCl on raspberries induces a toxic effect in photochemical parameters. * Lu and Zhang (1999) studied heat stress in wheat plants and found that temperature stability in the Photosystem II of water-stressed leaves correlates positively to the resistance in metabolism during photosynthesis.  Nitrogen Balance Index  Example of a portable multiparametric fluorometer that uses the ratio between chlorophyll and flavonols to detect the nitrogen deficiency of plants Because of the link between chlorophyll content and nitrogen content in leaves, chlorophyll fluorometers can be used to detect nitrogen deficiency in plants, by several methods. Based on several years of research and experimentation, polyphenols can be the indicators of nitrogen status of a plant. For instance, when a plant is under optimal conditions, it favours its primary metabolism and synthesises the proteins (nitrogen molecules) containing chlorophyll, and few flavonols (carbon-based secondary compounds). On the other hand, in case of lack of nitrogen, we will observe an increased production of flavonols by the plant. The NBI (Nitrogen Balance Index) by Force-A, allows the assessment of nitrogen conditions of a culture by calculating the ratio between Chlorophyll and Flavonols (related to Nitrogen/Carbon allocation) . Measure Chlorophyll Content Gitelson (1999) states, \\"The ratio between chlorophyll fluorescence at 735 nm and the wavelength range 700nm to 710 nm, F735/F700 was found to be linearly proportional to the chlorophyll content (with determination coefficient, r2, more than 0.95) and thus this ratio can be used as a precise indicator of chlorophyll content in plant leaves.\\"  Chlorophyll fluorometers  Fluorescence image (Ft value) of adaxial leaf surface The development of fluorometers allowed chlorophyll fluorescence analysis to become a common method in plant research. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis has been revolutionized by the invention of the Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation (PAM) technique and availability of the first commercial modulated chlorophyll fluorometer PAM-101 (Walz, Germany). By modulating the measuring light beam (microsecond-range pulses) and parallel detection of the excited fluorescence the relative fluorescence yield (Ft) can be determined in the presence of ambient light. Crucially, this means chlorophyll fluorescence can be measured in the field even in full sunlight. Today, chlorophyll fluorometers are designed for measuring many different plant mechanisms. The measuring protocols: FV/FM and OJIP measure the efficiency of Photosystem II samples at a common and known dark adapted state. These protocols are useful in measuring many types of plant stress. Bernard Genty's light adapted measuring protocol ΔF/FM’, or Y(II), is an effective and sensitive way to measure plant samples under ambient or artificial lighting conditions. However, since Y(II) values also change with light intensity, one should compare samples at the same light intensity unless light stress is the focus of the measurement. Y(II) can be more sensitive to some types of plant stress than FV/FM, such as heat stress. Other plant mechanism measuring protocols have also been developed. When a chloroplast absorbs light, some of the light energy goes to photochemistry, some goes to regulated heat dissipation, and some goes to unregulated heat dissipation. Various chlorophyll fluorescence measuring parameters exist to measure all of these events. In the lake model, qL measures photochemical quenching, Y(NYO) measures plant regulated heat dissipation, and Y(NO) measures unregulated heat dissipation. An older quenching protocol, called the puddle model, uses qP for photochemical quenching, qN for nonphotochemical quenching of both regulated and unregulated heat dissipation and NPQ for an estimate of nonphotochemical quenching. NPQ has also been resurrected to the lake model mathematically.Klughammer C., and Schreiber U. (2008) PAM Application notes 2008 1:27 -35 In addition, the parameters qE, and pNPQ have been developed to measure the photoprotective xanthophyll cycle. qT is a measure of state transitions. qM is a measure of chloroplast migration, and qI is a measure of plant photoinhibition. At lower actinic light levels NPQ = qE+qT+qI At high actinic light levels NPQ = qE+qM=qI Some fluorometers are designed to be portable and operated in one hand. Consistent further development into imaging fluorometers facilitate the visualization of spatial heterogeneities in photosynthetic activity of samples. These heterogeneities naturally occur in plant leaves for example during growths, various environmental stresses or pathogen infection. Thus knowledge about sample heterogeneities is important for correct interpretation of the photosynthetic performance of the plant sample. High performance imaging fluorometer systems provide options to analyze single cell/single chloroplast as well as sample areas covering whole leaves or plants.  Alternative approaches   LIF sensors  Techniques based on the Kautsky effect do not exhaust the variety of detection and evaluation methods based on the chlorophyll fluorescence. In particular, recent advances in the area of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) also provide an opportunity of developing sufficiently compact and efficient sensors for photophysiological status and biomass assessments. Instead of measuring the evolution of the total fluorescence flux, such sensors record the spectral density of this flux excited by strong monochromatic laser light pulses of nanoseconds duration. Requiring no 15- 20 min dark adaptation period (as is the case for the Kautsky effect methods) and being capable to excite the sample from considerable distance, the LIF sensors can provide fast and remote evaluation. * Application of the LIF technique to the assessment of drought stress in cork oak (Quercus suber) and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) on the basis of chlorophyll emission ratio I685/I740 is described in Ref. Recently the LIF sensing technique was harnessed to address the role of pPLAIIα protein in the protection of the photosynthetic metabolism during drought stress using genetically modified Arabidopsis plants. Silvestre et al. Contribution of pPLAIIα to drought tolerance using genetically modified arabidopsis plants: II. Effects on photosynthetic metabolism. Int. Meeting Prog. Plant Symposium of the SEB: Oxidative stress and cell death in plants: mechanisms and implications, Florence, Italy, 26–28 June 2013, p. 5 * In 2011, Vieira et al. applied a compact low-cost LIF sensor (built around a frequency- doubled solid-state Q-switched Nd:YAG laser and a specially modified commercial miniature fiber optic spectrometer Ocean Optics USB4000) to study intertidal microphytobenthos communities. Chlorophyll emission enabled the researchers to adequately assess the surface biomass and track migratory rhythms of epipelic benthic microalgae in muddy sediments.

Feature summary Unlike ORM frameworks, MyBatis does not map Java objects to database tables but Java methods to SQL statements. MyBatis lets you use all your database functionality like stored procedures, views, queries of any complexity and vendor proprietary features. It is often a good choice for legacy or de-normalized databases or to obtain full control of SQL execution. It simplifies coding compared to JDBC. SQL statements are executed with a single line. MyBatis provides a mapping engine that maps SQL results to object trees in a declarative way. SQL statements can be built dynamically by using a built-in language with XML-like syntax or with Apache Velocity using the Velocity integration plugin. MyBatis integrates with Spring Framework and Google Guice. This feature allows one to build business code free of dependencies. MyBatis supports declarative data caching. A statement can be marked as cacheable so any data retrieved from the database will be stored in a cache and future executions of that statement will retrieve the cached data instead hitting the database. MyBatis provides a default cache implementation based on a Java HashMap and default connectors for integrating with: OSCache, Ehcache, Hazelcast and Memcached. It provides an API to plug other cache implementations. Usage SQL statements are stored in XML files or annotations.

BlogMapper mapper = session.getMapper(BlogMapper.class); Blog blog = mapper.selectBlog(101); SQL statements and mappings can also be externalized to an XML file as follows. select * from Blog where id = #{id} Statements can also be executed using the MyBatis API. Blog blog = session.selectOne(\\"org.mybatis.example.BlogMapper.selectBlog\\", 101); For details, please refer to the User Guide available at MyBatis site. See external links. Spring integration MyBatis integrates with Spring Framework. This module allows MyBatis to participate in Spring transactions. It will also build MyBatis mappers and sessions and inject them into other beans. The following sample shows a basic XML configuration that sets up a mapper and injects it into a \\"BlogService\\" bean. Calling MyBatis is now just calling a bean: public class BlogServiceImpl implements BlogService { private BlogMapper blogMapper; public void setBlogMapper(BlogMapper blogMapper) { this.blogMapper = blogMapper; } public void doSomethingWithABlog(int blogId) { Blog blog = blogMapper.selectBlog(blogId); ... } } Velocity language The Velocity language driver lets you use Apache Velocity to generate your dynamic SQL queries on the fly. #set( $pattern = $_parameter.name + '%' ) SELECT * FROM person WHERE name LIKE @{pattern, jdbcType=VARCHAR} MyBatis Generator MyBatis provides a code generator. MyBatis Generator will introspect a database table (or many tables) and generate MyBatis artifacts needed to perform CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete). An Eclipse plugin is available. It will preserve any custom code in case of regeneration but only if you use the Eclipse plugin. MyBatis Migrations MyBatis Migrations is a Java command line tool that keeps track of database schema changes managing DDL files (known as migrations). Migrations allows to query the current status of the database, apply schema changes and also undo them. It also helps to detect and solve concurrent database schema changes made by different developers.

Left, scenes with Abraham from Genesis, ch 18; right, David The North French Hebrew Miscellany or \\"French Miscellany\\" or \\"London Miscellany\\" (British Library Add. MS 11639) is an important Hebrew illuminated manuscript from 13th-century France, created c. 1278-98.Tahan's c. 1278-98 is here preferred to BM's 1277-1286, see below. A miscellany is a manuscript containing texts of different types and by different authors, and this volume contains a wide range of Hebrew language texts, mostly religious but many secular. The manuscript is exceptional among medieval Hebrew manuscripts both for its size and the diversity of the texts and the quality and lavishness of its illuminations, which as was often the case were added by Christian specialists.Tahan, 10-11; BM This manuscript was digitized by the British Library's Hebrew Manuscripts Digitisation Project and is available online. Description The manuscript (excluding paper flyleaves) has 746 folios (so 1,492 pages), which include a quire of six illuminated pages added at the end; the page dimensions are 16 x 12 cm. The manuscript includes \\"eighty-four different groups of texts, including hundreds of poems\\". The Biblical and liturgical texts include the Pentateuch, the Haftarot prophetical readings, Tiqqun soferim, Five Scrolls, and the full annual cycle of the liturgy, as well as the Haggadah (Passover ritual) and the earliest complete Hebrew text of the Book of Tobit, which is not included in the Tanakh or canon of the Hebrew Bible.Tahan, 121; BM Other texts include the Pirkei Avot, prayers, gematria, legal texts and calendars. The poetry includes a large group of poems by Moses ibn Ezra, the great Spanish Sephardic poet of the previous century.Facsimile has the fullest list; BM The single scribe of the texts is named (in four places) as \\"Benjamin\\", who may have compiled the book for his own use; there is no \\"proper colophon\\" as might be expected in a commissioned manuscript.Tahan, 121 Another suggestion is that the unusual number of illustrations including the biblical figure of Aaron indicate a patron with this name.Facsimile Esther before Ahasuerus. The manuscript is illustrated with a total of 49 full-page miniatures, mostly of Biblical subjects, \\"which were executed by Christian illuminators attached to three major contemporary Parisian workshops\\", and probably also worked on at Amiens or another north French city,Still a matter of some discussion, see Tahan, 119 (quoted); Facsimile, which is more open to the possibility of some of the artists being Jewish;BM and reflect the latest Gothic styles, though the execution of the various artists is uneven, and one scholar complains that \\"broad, flat expanses of crudely painted, often runny pigment; angular, etiolated figures, and unusual colours place it well outside the orbit of the Parisian de luxe book, although its painters were undoubtedly influenced by the Parisian style\\".Wolinski, 280-281 The subjects include Jewish mythical beasts whose depiction draws on Christian bestiaries.Tahan, 119-122 These are mostly illustrated in roundels with a text caption beneath, while the narrative scenes from the Pentateuch are in rectangular miniatures (the scene with Noah's Ark illustrated here is an exception). There are 2 full-page diagrams in ink of the stars and planets and the signs of the zodiac (ff. 542, 542v) and \\"numerous inhabited initial-word panels, and inhabited and decorated panels in colours and gold attached to initial words and numerous decorated initial-word panels with gold letters\\".BM The relatively precise dating comes from aspects of the text including the inclusion of Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil's legal compendium the Sefer Mitzvot Katan, a text known to have been finished in 1277, mentions of Yehiel of Paris, who died in 1286, as still alive, and \\"a table of moladot (lunation-commencements) for the period 1279/80 - 1295/95 (f. 444)\\". The style of the miniatures accords with this date range. Provenance Inscriptions record various points in the manuscript's history, though many gaps remain. It perhaps left France for Germany in the persecutions of 1306. A loan of the book is noted in 1426, and in 1431 it was sold to an Abraham ben Moses of Coburg. By 1479 it was in Italy at Mestre on the coast opposite Venice, where it went next, followed by Padua in 1480 and Iesi near Ancona in 1481. The 16th century bookbinding has the arms of the Jewish Rovigo family, but in the 17th century the manuscript passed into Christian hands, including the Barberini family. It was examined by the Christian Hebraist Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi and published in his work Variae lectionis veteris testamenti (Parma, 1784). It was bought by a Paris bookseller from a Milan collection for the British Museum in 1839.Facsimile; BM See also *Jews in the French Middle Ages *Medieval Hebrew literature Notes References *\\"BM\\": British Library catalogue online, with many illustrations and bibliography *\\"Facsimile\\": Facsimile Editions webpage for the 2003 facsimile edition, with much detail, a full list of contents, and many illustrations *Tahan, Ilana, Hebrew Manuscripts: The Power of Script and Image, 2007, British Library, *Wolinski, Mary E., \\"The Compilation of the Montpellier Codex\\", Early Music History, Vol. 11, (1992), pp. 263–301, Cambridge University Press, JSTOR Further reading * Sara Offenberg, Illuminated Piety: Pietistic Texts and Images in the North French Hebrew Miscellany, Los Angeles 2013. *Gabrielle Sed-Rajna, The Paintings of the London Miscellany, Journal of Jewish Art 9 (1982). *Jeremy Schonfield, The North French Hebrew miscellany: (British Library Add.

The convoy followed the success of Operation Stoneage (16–20 November) which had raised the Siege of Malta. Four merchant ships were escorted to Malta by seven destroyers of the 12th Destroyer Flotilla, supported by three cruisers of the 15th Cruiser Squadron and three destroyers from Alexandria. The convoy was met by Force K from Malta with two cruisers and four destroyers. MW 14 was not attacked by Axis forces en route or while unloading which was complete by 9 December. Lack opposition led to the sailing of pairs of ships to Malta with ordinary western desert convoys as far as Benghazi, where they would rendezvous with escorts from Malta and be guarded by Force K against a sortie by Italian ships from Taranto. Background Malta In the Autumn of 1942, the British regained control of the central Mediterranean, through the combined effects of the survival of Malta, brought about by the success of convoy operations Pedestal (3–15 August 1942) and Stoneage (16–20 November), the Second Battle of Alamein (23 October – 11 November) in Egypt and Operation Torch (8–16 November) the Allied invasion of French North Africa. Offensive operations from Malta had been resumed with the supplies delivered by Pedestal and intensified with those of Stoneage. Axis shipping losses contributed to the chronic fuel shortage that constrained and limited it to delaying actions back to the Tunisian border. With the revival of Malta as an offensive base after the arrival of the Stoneage convoy, the short journey by Axis ships from Italy to Tunis and Tripoli became much more hazardous. Allied submarines sank 14 Italian ships in October and in November the air anti-shipping offensive had similar success, sinking 21 ships. The fast Abdiel class minelayer sailed from Alexandria on 10 November and arrived on 12 November with powdered milk, cereals and meat, leaving for Gibraltar that day to collect mines and lay them off Cape Bon. detached from a convoy bringing supplies to North Africa for Operation Torch and arrived on 18 November. Force K was re-established at Malta on 27 November with the cruisers , and of the 15th Cruiser Squadron and four ships of the 14th Destroyer Flotilla, taken from the Stoneage convoy escorts. Force Q, the 12th Cruiser Squadron with , , Dido and with four destroyers moved to Bône (now Annaba) on 30 November. North Africa As the retreated, the Axis air forces had to leapfrog backwards from airfield to airfield. The Desert Air Force swiftly took over abandoned airfields and the landing grounds at Gazala were open by 17 November and Martuba, near Derna, was operational on 19 November; the Navy began scheduled convoys to Benghazi on 26 November. Ultra intercepts of Axis Enigma machine cyphers revealed that on 24 November, the had only a few days' fuel left and on 3 December, that Italian troops were withdrawing to Buerat. By the middle of November the retreat from Alamein had reached El Agheila. The front was wide and had to be held with a military force that was a shadow of the Axis force that had been in Egypt that October. The front settled while the British built up their supplies for an attack and the Axis forces tried to get supplies to the across the Mediterranean. Prelude Axis command The Axis command structure in the Mediterranean was centralised at the top and fragmented below. Benito Mussolini had monopolised authority over the Italian armed forces since 1933 by taking the offices of Minister of War, Minister of the Navy and Minister of the Air Force. Feldmarschall Albert Kesselring of the commanded German ground forces in the theatre as Commander-in-Chief South (, OB Süd) but had no authority over Axis operations in North Africa or the organisation of convoys to Libya. Fliegerkorps II and Fliegerkorps X were subordinate to the usual chain of command. Since November 1941, Kesselring had exercised some influence over the conduct of the German naval operations in the Mediterranean as the nominal head of Naval Command Italy () but this was subordinate to the chain of command. German service rivalries obstructed co- operation and there was little unity of effort between German and the Italian forces in the Mediterranean. Kesselring had the authority only to co-ordinate plans for combined operations by German and Italian forces and some influence on the use of the for the protection of convoys to North Africa. The Italian Navy resisted all German attempts to integrate its operations; ships in different squadrons never trained together and (Italian Navy High Command) constantly over-ruled subordinate commanders. Convoy plan Convoy MW 14 consisted of the Agwimonte (6,679 gross register tons [grt]), Alcoa Prospector (6,797 grt), Suffolk (13,890 grt) and Glenartney (9,795 grt) which had a naval crew. A continuous escort was provided by seven Hunt-class destroyers of the 12th Destroyer Flotilla, comprising , , , , , and the Greek after the tanker Yoruba Linda joined from Benghazi with its two escorts. The next day, the 6-inch cruiser [] with the destroyers , and were to join from Alexandria. When south-west of Crete, the convoy was to be met by the 5.25-inch cruisers [] Dido and Euryalus, with the fleet destroyers , , , of Force K (Rear-Admiral Arthur Power) from Malta. Convoy MW 14 During the evening of 1 December, convoy MW 14 departed Port Said and on 2 December, rendezvoused with the tanker Yorba Linda and two Hunt-class destroyers. Next day, the cruiser Orion and three destroyers arrived from Alexandria and on 4 December, when south- west of Crete, the convoy was joined by Force K, comprising two cruisers and four destroyers from Malta. The convoy steamed for Malta at , receiving only a few ineffectual attacks from Axis torpedo-bombers. The convoy reached Grand Harbour early on 5 December and received the customary welcome from the populace and garrison. As the swift unloading of the ships began, congestion in the harbour was relieved by Operation MH 2, the dispatch of Convoy ME 11 on 7 December, containing Yoruba Linda from MW 14 and eight ships from Pedestal and Stoneage. By 9 December the ships were unloaded. Aftermath Analysis Stoneage and Portcullis delivered of cargo, not including fuel oils; once the Portcullis ships had unloaded, enough flour was on the island to last until May 1943, food and fodder were sufficient until March and cooking fuels until April, even after some small ration increases. The success of Portcullis led to the institution of the Quadrangle operations, regular voyages by pairs of ships accompanying ordinary west-bound convoys supplying the Eighth Army in its advance from El Agheila to Tunisia. The ships would be met off Benghazi by escorts from Malta and sail northwards to Malta, protected by the 15th Cruiser Squadron from a possible sortie by the Italian fleet at Taranto.

It was designed to be very manoevrable for use at short range in a dogfight situation. SRAAM was unusual in that it was launched from a launch tube instead of being attached to a launch rail, allowing two to be carried on single mounting point. Although initially intended to replace the AIM-9 Sidewinder, it was downgraded to a technology demonstrator program in 1974. Between 1974 and 1977, several SRAAM missiles were launched in tests. In 1980, the knowledge gained from the SRAAM project was used in the ASRAAM missile project. History Background Early infrared homing missiles had two limitations that made them difficult to use in combat situations. The first was that the seeker was relatively insensitive and required large, hot sources to reliably track a target. In practice, this meant the engine of the enemy aircraft had to remain visible to the missile through the shot. The other was that the seeker had a limited field of view (FOV), meaning it could only see the target if it was in front of the missile. This meant it was possible for the target to escape by flying at right angles to the missile, maximizing its angular velocity relative to the seeker. These limitations were made clear during the Vietnam War, when early missiles like the AIM-4 Falcon and AIM-9 Sidewinder had success rates on the order of 9 and 14%, respectively. Much of this was due to the fact that pilots had been trained to approach using radar or ground-controlled interception, which placed the enemy aircraft somewhere in front of them, but not necessarily flying in the same direction. In these situations, the seeker might see the target's engine and send the growling signal that indicated lock-on, but would fail to track when fired because the target would move out of the FOV in the time while the missile was flying off the mounting rail. Faced with these dismal results, the US Navy and then US Air Force introduced new training syllabuses that placed much more emphasis on pre-shot maneuvering, so the launch aircraft would be both behind the target and flying in the same general direction. This would maximize the chance that the target would still be visible to the missile after it was launched. Unfortunately, such maneuvering was both time consuming and potentially difficult to arrange, and in combat there were many situations where a target would cross in front of the fighter in a \\"snap shot\\". To provide some capability in these situations, autocannons were hastily added to those fighters that lacked them. Taildog Considering this problem, designers at Hawker Siddeley Dynamics, Hawker's missile division, decided that it would be better to have a missile work like the pilots wanted rather than the pilots working the way the missile wanted. They began designing a missile that would track successfully in every situation where the missile indicated lock-on. In order for this to happen, it would have to have a very wide FOV, or \\"off- boresight capability\\", so it would continue to see the target even if it was crossing rapidly. It would also have to have extremely high manoeuvrability so it could successfully track down an aircraft in these situations. The company began low-level development of such a weapon as a private venture under the name \\"Taildog\\" in 1968.\\"Missiles 1969\\", Flight, 14 November 1968, pg. 797 This goal was a short-range, low-cost missile that would fill the gap between guns and then-current missiles like Firestreak and Red Top. Hawker described it as 'a gun that fires around corners'.\\"Diamond Jubilee Salon\\", Flight, 5 June 1969, pg. 935] The initial design was 2.0 m long, had a diameter of 16.5 cm and weighed 50 kg. It was capable of engaging targets between 250 m and 2 km, as compared to perhaps 12 km under the best case for Red Top. The first photographs of mock-ups were shown in early 1970, and were displayed at a trade show in Hannover later that year. Taildog was highly manoeuvrable through the use of thrust vectoring for all flight control. Vectoring was accomplished by rotating small vanes into the rocket exhaust. Six of these vanes were arranged as segments of a circle at the tail end of the missile body, where they were protected from the rocket exhaust. Each segment was pivoted at one end, allowing it to be rotated so the other end would be moved into the exhaust. The control system would activate the segment closest to the required change in direction. External aerodynamic surfaces were reduced to vestigial surfaces near the rear of the missile, and were unmovable.Gibson 2007, p. 49 Hawker was not the only one to come up with this basic concept; around the same time, the US Navy and Air Force both began similar programs for similar reasons, ultimately combining their efforts in the AIM-95 Agile project. Taildog and Agile differed primarily in range; Taildog was intended as a short-range dogfighting weapon, while Agile was a replacement for the Sidewinder and set range requirements at least as good as that missile, producing a much larger design. SRAAM In 1970 the British Ministry of Defence came to the conclusion that a better short-range missile was needed, and drew up a request for proposals, AST 1218.Gibson 2007, p. 48 This outlined the need for better maneuverability and a wider seeker angle, in order to successfully intercept the target in the types of shots the pilots were attempting to make, as opposed to demanding they not take those shots. AST 1218 also included the requirement that the missile could be carried by aircraft that lacked the target acquisition systems of the Phantom and Lightning. Taildog became Hawker Siddeley's response to AST 1218. Hawker's proposal was received favourably, and in 1972 the Ministry of Defence awarded a development contract (Air Staff Requirement 1222). Two versions were studied, the advanced SRAAM-100 and a basic version called SRAAM-75. Both used the same airframe but different electronic fits. SRAAM was slightly longer than Taildog, with a length of . The diameter remained the same. The thrust director system was replaced with a moving dome deflector, which consists of a cone-shaped deflector placed in the exhaust which is moved to the sides to cause the thrust to change. The fins were moved to the rear and got a different shape.Gibson 2007, p. 51 SRAAM was designed to be carried in a launch tube to protect the missile. The fins on the missile were hinged and designed to extend following launch. The launcher comprised two tubes and an optional radar cueing system, enabling the missile to be carried by almost any aircraft with little modification. The missile could be fired automatically when a target came into view of the seekerGunston 1979, p. 221 (unlike e.g. Firestreak, which needed to be fed targeting information by the aircraft's radar).Gibson 2007, p. 34 SRAAM launcher at Bristol Aero Collection The contract was cancelled in 1974 due to defence cuts in favour of work on Skyflash,\\"Asraam - Europe's new dogfight missile\\", Flight, 6 June 1981, pg. 1742] but retained as a technology demonstration program. In 1977, eight test missiles were fired from the ground and from a Hawker Hunter F.6 (RAF serial XG210). The trials were successful, with one famous incident demonstrating the missile's maneuverability when it turned into the Hunter's flight path immediately after launch and almost collided with it.Gibson 2007, p. 50 In the same year, the British MOD chose the AIM-9L Sidewinder as its next short-range missile, but the SRAAM project was kept alive to provide a base for a future missile design. In 1980, the SRAAM work became the starting point for ASRAAM. Surviving artefacts include a mockup of the missile in the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford,RAF Museum website and a launcher at the Bristol Aero Collection.

The church, a fine example of Romanesque architecture in the city, was erected between the 11th and the 12th centuries. Before its construction, the site was home to two small Palaeo-Christian churches, dating to the 6th and 7th centuries. Part of the current church's pavement is in glass to allow visibility to some of the remains of the latter. Interior view The building has a rectangular plan, with a nave and two aisles, and a raised apse. The lower part of the façade has numerous blind arches and, in the middle, a statue of the Virgin Mary. At the top, dating to the reconstruction (together with the brickwork part of the annexed bell tower) after the 1690 earthquake, is a rectangular window. The master of the façade (1210) was one Master Filippo (as testified by an inscription in the lunette), while the arched portal is attributed to one Master Leonardo. Master Filippo was also responsible of the reconstruction of the Romanesque cathedral of San Leopardo and of Santa Tecla at Osimo. In the subterraneans are remains from several Palaeo-Christian churches, including some mosaics. The oldest ones belonged to an older building, perhaps destroyed during the Gothic Wars (6th century), and above which the newer and less refined ones were later added. Other remains include a pit, some traces of the ancient Greek Ancona's walls and some frescoes.

The title retained the words \\"Modern Tramway\\" for the next 60 years, but with variations. From 1962 the word \\"The\\" was dropped, and a title extension—in smaller letters and not used in abbreviations of the magazine's name—was added, changing slightly a few times over the next 30 years, as shown below. *Modern Tramway and Light Railway Review, January 1962–December 1973 *Modern Tramway and Rapid Transit Review, January 1974–December 1976 *Modern Tramway and Light Rapid Transit (), January 1977–March 1980 *Modern Tramway and Light Rail Transit (), April 1980–December 1991 The last variation survived for nearly 12 years, but a more substantial name change was made in January 1992, when Modern Tramway and Light Rail Transit became Light Rail and Modern Tramway (LR&MT;) (). This in turn was replaced by the magazine's current title, Tramways & Urban Transit (), in January 1998.\\"Modern Tramway changes\\". December 1991 issue, Modern Tramway, p. 430. This was abbreviated as \\"T&UT;\\" until mid-2007 and thereafter as \\"TAUT\\". Description While content has varied over the years, each issue typically includes two to four feature articles, describing a particular tram or light rail system, manufacturer or related topic; news sections for international, UK and museum or heritage tram news; editorial content, and a letters section. Some issues also include reviews, of books, DVDs, etc. Feature articles usually include maps. Since 1995, each issue has had 40 pages, counting the front and back covers. Although histories of existing tram systems are sometimes included, coverage of long-closed systems was moved out of Modern Tramway in 1950 with the launch of a second LRTA magazine, Tramway Review, which continues in publication today and is focused on histories of tram systems in Britain. TAUT’s current editor-in-chief is Simon Johnston, who took over the post in January 2011. The previous editor, Howard Johnston, had held the post since April 1995. His immediate predecessor, W. J. Wyse, had been the magazine's editor for 28 years, since June 1967, a longer period than any other MT or TAUT editor to date.Taplin, Michael (April 1995). \\"Jack Wyse retires as Editor after 333 issues of LR&MT;\\". Light Rail and Modern Tramway, p. 88. Apart from W. J. Wyse and Howard Johnston, the only editors-in-chief who held the post for more than five years were K. G. Mansell (July 1952–April 1960) and James Joyce (May 1960–June 1967). Format changes The January 1990 issue brought a small increase in Modern Tramway’s page size, from in x in to ISO size A5, and the first regular inclusion of colour photographs—on the front and back covers and a two-page centre spread in each issue.\\"A New Decade … and a New Image\\". Ian Allan Ltd advertisement in Modern Tramway, December 1989, unnumbered page inside back cover. Most illustrations remained black-and-white. With effect from the January 1992 issue, concurrent with the change of name to Light Rail & Modern Tramway, the magazine's page size was doubled, to A4 size. The number of pages per issue was reduced from 40 to 32 at that time, but the two changes in combination yielded a net increase of 60% in page area. The number of pages was restored to 40 from the April 1995 issue (and has remained 40 ever since). The use of colour illustrations was later expanded, as colour printing became less expensive, and since May 2002 TAUT has been fully in colour.

Origins and initial success Fred Rose re-election poster (1945) In the 1940 federal election, the Communist Party led a popular front in several constituencies in Saskatchewan and Alberta under the name Unity, United Progressive or United Reform and elected two MPs, one of whom, Dorise Nielsen, was secretly a member of the Communist Party. After the Communist Party of Canada was banned in 1940, under the wartime Defence of Canada Regulations, it established the Labor-Progressive Party (LPP) as a front organization in 1943 after the release of Communist Party leaders from internment. Nielsen declared her affiliation to the LPP when it was founded in August 1943. She was defeated in the 1945 election when she ran for re-election as an LPP candidate.Francis et al. Destinies: Canadian History Since Confederation, 5th Ed. Thomson/Nelson Canada Ltd., 2004. pg 287. Only one LPP Member of Parliament (MP) was elected to the House of Commons under that banner, Fred Rose, who was elected in a 1943 by-election in Montreal, sitting with Nielsen. Rose was re-elected in 1945. In 1947, he was charged and convicted for spying for the Soviet Union, and was expelled from the House of Commons. The leader of the party was Tim Buck. Other prominent members were Margaret Fairley, Stewart Smith, Stanley Ryerson and Sam Carr. Provincial campaigns In Ontario, two LPP members, A. A. MacLeod and J. B. Salsberg, sat in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1943 to 1951 and 1955 respectively. The LPP also jointly nominated several Liberal-Labour candidates with the Ontario Liberal Party. The Manitoba party had amongst its leading members Jacob Penner who was a popular aldermen in Winnipeg, Manitoba, as well as Bill Kardash who was a Manitoba Member of the Legislative Assembly. The party also ran candidates in Quebec general elections from 1944 to 1956 as the Parti ouvrier- progressiste. Municipal strength The LPP had strong pockets of support in working-class neighbourhoods of Montreal, Toronto and Winnipeg as well as in the Crowsnest Pass mining region of Alberta and British Columbia elected a number of its members to local city councils and school boards. In Winnipeg, Jacob Penner was a long-time member of the city council while Joe Zuken sat on the school board. In Toronto, Charles Simms and Norman Freed served as aldermen while Smith was elected to the city's powerful Board of Control. From 1944 to 1947, Helen Anderson Coulson sat on Hamilton's City Council as an Alderman (from 1944–1946) and, after the 1946 municipal election, as a member of the city's highest decision making body, the Board of Control.Controller Henderson Heads Field With Anderson Second,\\" Hamilton Spectator, Dec. 10, 1946, News.

She would unsuccessfully seek election numerous times over the next decade, most prominently opposing Mayor Lloyd Jackson in 1950.\\"Mayor Jackson Coasts To Win Over Coulson,\\" Hamilton Spectator, Dec. 7, 1950, News. Dr. Harry Paikin was elected a school trustee on the Hamilton Board of Education in 1944 and remained in office for three decades, until his death in 1985, including ten years as chair. World War II Following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the Canadian Communist Party reversed its earlier position urging Canadian neutrality in World War II and instead urged full support for the Soviet, not Canadian, war effort. The party formed the \\"Tim Buck Plebiscite Committees\\" urging support for conscription in the 1942 referendum. After the vote the committees were renamed the Dominion Communist - Labour Total War Committee and were the main public face of the Communist Party, and became the main wartime activity of the Labor-Progressive Party, helping it raise its profile and encouraging the federal government to release Communist leaders who had been detained early in the war. Cold War The LPP faced repression during the Cold War as anti-Communist sentiment increased in Canada, particularly after the revelations of Igor Gouzenko following his defection from the Soviet embassy in Ottawa. Gouzenko's revelations led to the downfall of Fred Rose. Nevertheless, the party continued to elect a handful of members to provincial legislatures, city councils and school boards across Canada well into the 1950s. 1956–1957 crisis An almost fatal blow for the party was the crisis that enveloped it following Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech to the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary, the first event shattered the faith many LPP members had in the Soviet Union and Joseph Stalin while the second caused many to doubt that the USSR had truly changed. Aggravated as well by revelations of widespread antisemitism in the Soviet Union (a serious blow to Jewish members of the LPP such as Salsberg and Robert Laxer), the party underwent a serious split with more than half of its membership including many in the leadership, including Salsberg, Stewart Smith, Harry Binder, Sam Lipshitz and other prominent LPP leaders, ultimately leaving with the remaining party being a remnant of what it once had been. The United Jewish Peoples' Order, which had been one of the largest organizations allied with the LPP, broke with the party in December 1956 as a result of Salsberg's revelations after his fact-finding mission to the USSR to investigate reports of systemic antisemitism and repression of Jewish culture.Gerald Tulchinsky, Family Quarrel: Joe Salsberg, the 'Jewish' Question, and Canadian Communism Labour/Le Travail, 56 (Fall 2005) Decline The LPP last ran a federal candidate in a December 1958 by-election and ran nine candidates in the 1959 Ontario election. Shortly thereafter, it renamed itself the Communist Party of Canada once again. The LPP had a youth wing, the National Federation of Labour Youth which had formerly been known as the Young Communist League. The NFLY was renamed the Socialist Youth League of Canada in the 1950s but became defunct later in the decade due to internal party turmoil.

The software was written by Professor Nigel Howard for General Rupert Smith in 1996. Confrontation analysis (also known as dilemma analysis) is an operational analysis technique used to structure, understand and think through multi-party interactions such as negotiations. It is the underpinning mathematical basis of drama theory. It is derived from game theory but considers that instead of resolving the game, the players often redefine the game when interacting. Emotions triggered from the potential interaction play a large part in this redefinition. So whereas game theory looks on an interaction as a single decision matrix and resolves that, confrontation analysis looks on the interaction as a sequence of linked interactions, where the decision matrix changes under the influence of precisely defined emotional dilemmas.See definition of Dilemma Derivation and use Confrontation analysis was devised by Professor Nigel Howard in the early 1990s drawing from his work on game theory and metagame analysis. It has been turned to defence,See The future of Libya political, legal, financial\\"role playing... can also be used by investors in the form of \\"confrontation analysis' such as that organised by former military analyst Mike Young's Decision Workshops\\" – Greek Dungeons and German Dragons, James Macintosh, Financial Times, 9 November 2011. and commercial See Letting agency case study applications. Much of the theoretical background to General Rupert Smith's book The Utility of Force drew its inspiration from the theory of confrontation analysis. Confrontation analysis can also be used in a decision workshop as structure to support role-playing for training, analysis and decision rehearsal.  Method  An interaction as a sequence of confrontations where the card table changes as the parties struggle to eliminate their dilemmas Confrontation analysis looks on an interaction as a sequence of confrontations. During each confrontation the parties communicate until they have made their positionsSee definition of Position clear to one another. These positions can be expressed as a card table (also known as an options boardSee definition of Options Board/Card table) of yes/no decisions. For each decision each party communicates what they would like to happen (their position) and what will happen if they cannot agree (the threatened future). These interactions produce dilemmas and the card table changes as players attempt to eliminate these. Initial Card Table: The UN threatens to use air strikes, but is not believed by the Bosnian Serbs: The UN has three dilemmas The Bosnians have none Consider the example on the right (Initial Card Table), taken from the 1995 Bosnian Conflict.This example developed from that described in Smith R, Tait A, Howard N (1999) Confrontations in War and Peace. Proceedings of the 6th international Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, 19–20 June 2001 This represents an interaction between the Bosnian Serbs and the United Nations forces over the safe areas. The Bosnian Serbs had Bosniak enclaves surrounded and were threatening to attack. Each side had a position as to what they wanted to happen: The Bosnian Serbs wanted (see 4th column): * To be able to attack the enclaves * NOT to withdraw their heavy weapons from the enclaves * For the UN NOT to use air strikes The UN wanted (See 5th column): * The Bosnian Serbs NOT to attack the enclaves * The Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons * The Bosnian Serbs NOT to take hostages. If no further changes were made then what the sides were saying would happen was (see 1st column): *The Bosnian Serbs said they would attack the enclaves *The Bosnian Serbs said they would NOT withdraw their heavy weapons *The Bosnian Serbs said they would take hostages if the UN uses air strikes *The UN said it would initiate air strikes. However the Bosnian Serbs DID NOT BELIEVE them. (Hence the question mark on the Card Table). Confrontation analysis then specifies a number of precisely defined dilemmas that occur to the parties following from the structure of the card tables. It states that motivated by the desire to eliminate these dilemmas, the parties involved will CHANGE THE CARD TABLE, to eliminate their problem. In the situation at the start the Bosnian Serbs have no dilemmas, but the UN has four. It has three persuasion dilemmasSee definition of Persuasion Dilemma in that the Bosnian Serbs are not going to do the three things they want them to (not attack the enclaves, withdraw the heavy weapons and not take hostages). It also has a rejection dilemmaSee definition of Rejection Dilemma in that the Bosnian Serbs do not believe they will actually use the air strikes, as they think the UN will submit to their position, for fear of having hostages taken. Faced with these dilemmas, the UN modified the card table to eliminate its dilemmas. It took two actions: Firstly, it withdrew its forces from the positions where they were vulnerable to being taken hostage. This action eliminated the Bosnian Serbs' option (card) of taking hostages. Second Card Table: The UN eliminated the Bosnian \\"hostage\\" card and brought in an additional, credible \\"Artillery\\" card, changing the situation in their favour: The Bosnian Serbs now have two persuasion dilemmas and two rejection dilemmas Secondly, with the addition of the Rapid Reaction Force, and in particular its artillery the UN had an additional capability to engage Bosnian Serb weapons; they added the card \\"Use artillery against Bosnian Serbs\\". Because of this, the UN's threat of air strikes became more credible. The situation changed to that of the Second Card Table: The Bosnian Serbs wanted (see 4th column): * To be able to attack the enclaves * NOT to withdraw heavy weapons from the enclaves * For the UN NOT to use air strikes * For the UN NOT to use artillery The UN wanted (See 5th column): * The Bosnian Serbs NOT to attack the enclaves * The Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons If no further changes were made then what the sides were saying would happen was (see 1st column): *The Bosnian Serbs said they would attack the enclaves, but the UN did not believe them. *The Bosnian Serbs said they would NOT withdraw their heavy weapons, but the UN did not believe them. *The UN said it would use artillery. The Bosnian Serbs believed this. *The UN said it would use air strikes. This time, however, the Bosnian Serbs believed them. Final Card Table: The final situation. The Bosnian Serbs modified their position to eliminate their dilemmas. This involved accepting their initial goals as unobtainable Faced with this new situation, the Bosnian Serbs modified their position to accept the UN proposal. The final table was an agreement as shown in the Final Card table (see thumbnail and picture). Confrontation analysis does not necessarily produce a win-win solution (although end states are more likely to remain stable if they do); however, the word confrontation should not necessarily imply that any negotiations should be carried out in an aggressive way. The card tables are isomorphic to game theory models, but are not built with the aim of finding a solution. Instead, the aim is to find the dilemmas facing characters and so help to predict how they will change the table itself. Such prediction requires not only analysis of the model and its dilemmas, but also exploration of the reality outside the model; without this it is impossible to decide which ways of changing the model in order to eliminate dilemmas might be rationalized by the characters. Sometimes analysis of the ticks and crosses can be supported by values showing the payoff to each of the parties.See understanding the tables used in confrontation analysis References  External links * Dilemmas Galore – A user discussion group.

Name Three theories are proposed for the name \\"Nori\\": *Iron was written on the chimney of the brickworks, but backwards with the I at the bottom *The letters IRON were accidentally placed backwards in the brick moulds thus spelling NORI. This is by far the most common story. *It was a deliberate decision of the owners to differentiate them from the REDAC brick works in Huncoat standing for Accrington Red.Accrington Forum Geology Fireclay is often found close to coal seams and the Accrington area had many collieries. At the end of the Ice Age, the River Calder was blocked and formed a large lake in the Accrington area. The sediment from this lake produced the fireclay seams and local coal was available to fire it. History The Nori was first produced at a brickworks adjacent to the quarry in Whinney Hill, Altham by the Accrington Brick and Tile Company Ltd. The clay there produced bricks of the highest strength and hardness. These bricks were acid resistant, so could be used for the lining of flues and chimneys. There were four brickyards, producing engineering bricks (Enfields, Whinney Hills) and specials. Specials were hand thrown into plaster of paris moulds. They could be extremely decorative. These bricks were used for specialised engineering projects such as in furnaces and for powerstations. The site had its own mineral railway connecting with the East Lancashire Line at Huncoat Station, and was close to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The brickworks once managed by Marshall Clay Products were bought out by Hanson, a subsidiary of the multi-national Heidelberg Cement group in 2005. The brickworks was closed in 2008, with the loss of 83 jobs. Hanson who said they were mothballing the factory cited the recession and standstill in new house builds. The Accrington Nori Brick works was temporarily re-opened in August 2009 only to close again that November, after a life-span of 122 years. In 2013 the works was for sale. Since 1982 the old quarries have been increasingly used for landfill of domestic waste from the north west region operated by the company SITA UK. In 2013 local residents began legal action against SITA. over claims of foul smells coming from the site.Papers served on Sita over Whinney Hill landfill smells BBC News 11 February 2013, accessed 11 February 2013 Following an upturn in new house starts Hanson reopened its Claughton Manor plant, near Lancaster, in 2014. This is the first ever example of ‘de-mothballing’ a brick works. Additional shifts were added at Kirton, Desford and Wilnecote. In May 2014 it was decided to reopen the Accrington factory. The restart is being carried out in two stages: the first phase costing £1.4 million started production in January 2015 with the second phase, which will require further investment of around £350,000, due to follow later in 2015. Hanson say the factory has the capacity to produce 45 million bricks a year and the adjoining quarry has between 30 and 40 years of clay reserves.

The youngest pro wrestler in New Zealand at the time of his debut in 1970, he was a regular on the Australian wrestling programme Big Time Wrestling and its New Zealand counterpart On the Mat as well as a two-time NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Champion. Garea is the real life brother of four-time WWWF World Tag Team Champion and WWE Road Agent Tony Garea. Career Born in Auckland, New Zealand, the son of Croatian-born Ivan Gareljich, Garea began training at the Mt. Roskill gymnasium with \\"Wild\\" Don Scott in English-style catch-as- catch-can wrestling and made his pro wrestling debut in 1970, a year before his older brother Tony Garea. At age 21, he was the youngest professional wrestler in the country. Garea's early career was spent in the South Pacific Wrestling Association for Auckland promoter Ernie Pinches and quickly became a regular on the New Zealand circuit. As Tony Garea left for the United States, Johnny Garcia made his way to Australia where he wrestled for Jim Barnett and World Championship Wrestling. Garea often appeared on WCW's wrestling programme broadcast on the Nine Network while in Australia. He was the first New Zealander to appear on Big Time Wrestling, a short-lived Australian programme aired in his home country in 1973, and joined New Zealand promoter Steve Rickard's All Star-Pro Wrestling after Barnett left for the United States the following year. In 1975, he and The Sheepherders (Butch Miller and Luke Williams) were among the first standout talent of On the Mat and started touring the country. Garea also wrestled overseas as well visiting such faraway countries as Thailand, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Japan in Asia, the South Pacific islands of Fiji and Tahiti, and in the United States. He was able to get bookings in various NWA territories and, partly due to his connections with his brother Tony, briefly wrestled for the World Wrestling Federation. Garea would continue to appear on On the Mat for nearly a decade during which time he faced off against many of the top names not only in Australasia, such as Steve Rickard, John da Silva, Robert Bruce and Al Hobman, but from around the world including former World Champion Tiger Jeet Singh, The Sheik and Mark Lewin from the National Wrestling Alliance, and Big Bad John, Rocky Johnson, Don Muraco, and Rick Martel from the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Years later, Garea claimed that his toughest opponents were André the Giant and \\"the world's strongest man\\" Paul Graham, in addition to a brutal series of cage matches with King Curtis Iaukea. By 1981, he had become a main- eventer on the show. After the cancellation of On the Mat in 1984, Garea remained with All Star-Pro Wrestling and eventually became involved in a near 5-year feud with Bruno Bekkar over the NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship during the mid-to late 1980s, winning the title twice, before losing the title back to Bekkar in 1990. Garea went into semi-retirement with All Star-Pro Wrestling closing in 1992 and eventually became a rancher with a sizable lifestyle block in Warkworth. On 24 January 2004, Garea was among the many veteran New Zealand wrestlers who attended a \\"legends reunion\\" show at Petone. In June 2008, he made a public appearance with his brother Tony, Butch Miller, and Rip Morgan ay a WWE event in New Zealand. He was also interviewed at his Warkworth ranch as part of a documentary on professional wrestling in New Zealand, A Kiwi Century on the Mat, in August 2010.

It is one of the 21 regional organisations of the Federation of Finnish Enterprises, which has the largest membership of all business-related federations in Finland. The mission of the organisation is to create a favourable enterprise climate and provide its members with information, mentoring, networking, events and educational opportunities. The Regions and Young Entrepreneurs Network The Regional Organisation of Enterprises in Helsinki is divided into 7 regions: *Helsingin Vanhankaupungin Yrittäjät *Itä- Helsingin Yrittäjät *Kanta-Helsingin Yrittäjät *Koillis-Helsingin Yrittäjät *Helsingin Yrittäjät Töölö ry *Lauttasaaren Yrittäjät and *Länsi-Helsingin Yrittäjät In addition, the organisation has its own informal network HYNY for entrepreneurs less than 35 years of age. Founded in 2006, HYNY helps young entrepreneurs to learn and grow, leading to greater business success. For its members HYNY provides training, events and networking opportunities. History The founding meeting of the Regional Organisation of Enterprises in Helsinki was held 10 January 1939. At that time the members consisted mainly of industry associations but soon more and more independent entrepreneurs became members. Due to the change in regulations in 1962, the name of the organisation was changed to Suur-Helsingin Yrittäjät ry and the organisational activities and number of members increased. Caused by the strong development of the region, several structural solutions were implemented and organisation's activities took their current form. In addition, Espoo and Vantaa founded their own regional organisations in 1979, thus the responsibilities of these strongly developing and growing regions were divided and organisational activities redefined. The original mission statement: bring entrepreneurs together, influence and safeguard the common interests, has never changed its core. The most significant change is its key function: the nature of the organisation as an information, mentoring, networking, events and educational opportunities provider for its members. In 2009 the Regional Organisation of Enterprises in Helsinki celebrated its 70th anniversary. In the same year the organisation hosted the National Entrepreneur's Day at the Helsinki Fair Centre.

It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument located in the Clashindarroch Forest. It is a low, circular bank in diameter which almost surrounds a wide platform in the centre. There is one gap in the bank at the southeast end of the henge. History In 1891, James Macdonald, thinking that this mound was a \\"round for sheep\\", excavated the mound. However, this did not bring any archaeological finds. Legend According to legend, Wormy hillock henge was the location of a buried dragon or monster. In the legend, the dragon had been attacking villages in the neighbourhood, and the villagers eventually succeeded in killing the dragon. They then half-buried its corpse and mounded dirt over it, making a mound. This legend is the source of the name of the mound: Wormy hillock henge. The site The henge is located to the south of the mound known as Wormy Hillock, on a haugh (\\"a piece of flat alluvial land by the side of a river\\", according to the Oxford English Dictionary\\"haugh, n.\\" Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 16 December 20.) in a steep valley in the Clashindarroch Forest. The henge comprises a circular bank, in diameter, enclosing an oval area long by wide. The bank itself ranges from broad and high up to thick and high. Wormy Hillock falls into the sub-category 'mini-henge' or 'hengiform' as it is less than 20m in diameter (see henge main article). The area enclosed by the bank is around , and the average for a stone circle is around . Inside the bank is a small platform in diameter surrounded by a deep ditch crossed by several causeways. The southeastern one is apparently related to the wide hole in the bank at the same angular position. This site is similar to several others in Dorchester, Oxon, England. There are two small pits on the bank, and they may be much more recent than the rest of the mound. A large boulder is lying in the ditch right below one of the pits. Currently, the site is completely overgrown by grass and heather.

It exists to lobby legislators to take measures to increase competition in online advertising, to regulate the collection of information about online users and protect the rights of authors and publishers. The Burson Marsteller public relations firm provides the secretariat for ICOMP and sends out press releases in its name. The secretariat is directed by the ICOMP council. Members of the Council are appointed by the Directors as laid down in the ICOMP bylaws. The Directors are appointed by the Trustees. Microsoft is the only trustee. Organisations which support its aims can become members of ICOMP. Structure ICOMP comprises two distinct but related bodies referred to as the Secretariat and the Council: The Secretariat is a UK-registered company which is responsible for the administration and secretariat of ICOMP, and the Council is a group of individuals which determines the policy of ICOMP. The Secretariat has been set up in a legal form which is commonly used by not-for-profit associations: a UK registered company limited by guarantee. UK companies limited by guarantee do not have a share capital, but have guarantors, also called trustees, who undertake to make a financial contribution towards the winding up of the company in the event of a shortfall upon cessation of business. The Secretariat of ICOMP has one initial trustee but provision has been made for other trustees to be admitted. One of the advantages of a company limited by guarantee is that it is relatively simple to admit new members or for existing members to leave – there being no share to transfer. The Secretariat has also appointed two directors and a company secretary to administer it. The Council appoints its own Chair (formerly Lord Alan Watson, as of March 2016 Michael Weber) and has the power to appoint one or more Vice Chairs. There are also rules for the holding of meetings and for the taking of votes at meetings, as well as for the expulsion of members. The Council also sets the level of the financial contributions made by Council Members. Changes to the by-laws approved by a two-thirds majority are automatic. Controversy The Daily Telegraph has described ICOMP as \\"a organisation whose sole purpose appears to be to attack Google\\". The Register published an article following the submission of a complaint by Foundem to the European Commission suggesting that an attempt on behalf of Google was to focus on Microsoft's membership of ICOMP to “deflect attention from its antitrust issues” ICOMP legal counsel David Wood submitted a response to these media criticisms, accusing Google of making \\"seriously misleading statements\\" about ICOMP, and of \\"Shooting the messenger to avoid having to deal with unpalatable messages\\". As of late 2016, Microsoft no longer financially supports ICOMP. \`After Microsoft withdrew its financial support, some voting members also left ICOMP. One such member, Foundem, left due to alleged internal disputes about shifting the sole purpose of ICOMP away from Google's alleged anti-competitive practices. The details of the events leading to Foundem's claims of ICOMP working against a free internet are unknown, but ICOMP has acknowledged that the organisation is \\"aligning [its] focus to evolving interests of [its] membership.\\" ICOMP members in the news Vertical search engine Foundem joined ICOMP in April 2009, after being made subject to a Google AdWords search penalty in June 2006. The company then created a site named searchneutrality.orgSearch Neutrality to share its experiences as a result of the penalty as well as making the case for what the company refers to as search neutrality – which Foundem defines as “the principle that search engines should be open and transparent about their editorial policies, or, better still, should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial, and based solely on relevance.” The Register also wrote a detailed account of Foundem's experiences. Online news aggregator OneNewsPageOneNewsPage joined ICOMP in February 2010 after Google stopped tracking its website in May 2009. It then created a campaign site called Have I been Penalized?Have I been Penalized? to highlight the challenges an online business can face when it is arbitrarily penalised as a result of search algorithm updates. ICOMP member The Premier League also attracted media attention following its legal clash with YouTube over alleged copyright infringements. Viacom also submitted a complaint to a US court, which eventually found in favour of Google. Viacom has since appealed against this decision. The current ICOMP chair as of March 2016, Michael Weber, operates hot-map.com (formerly hot-maps.de).

Biography Mikola Statkevich was born in Liadna near Slutsk into a family of school teachers. He is a descendant of the Statkiewicz noble family. Statkevich graduated from a military engineering school in Minsk and served in the Soviet antiaircraft defense in the Arctic region. In the early 1990s Statkevich was one of the leaders of the Belarusian Militarymen Association, a pro- independence union of Soviet officers from Belarus. In 1991 Statkevich has left the Communist Party of the USSR as a protest against a brutal Soviet military action against the democratic pro-independence opposition in Lithuania. In 1993 Statkevich was actively protesting against Belarus joining a collective defence treaty with Azerbaijan and Armenia that were at war at a time, in order to prevent Belarusian soldiers serving in military conflicts outside the country. For this Statkevich has been dismissed from the army shortly before the scheduled presentation of his Doctor of Science dissertation. He then became one of the leaders of the Belarusian Social Democratic Party (People's Assembly), including the party's chairman since 1995. In 2005 Statkevich was sentenced to three years of labour for organising mass protests against the 2004 referendum in Belarus that has lifted the constitutional limit on presidential terms and allowed president Aliaksandr Lukashenka to again participate in presidential elections. Amnesty International declared Mikola Statkevich a prisoner of conscience. He was then set free in 2007 following an amnesty. In 2010 Mikola Statkevich was one of many democratic candidates running in the presidential election. After the crackdown of the opposition demonstration he was arrested and put in prison. On 26 May 2011, he was sentenced to 6 years in a medium security penal colony. Amnesty International reported in July 2012 that Statkevich had been moved to a \\"punishment cell\\" after refusing to sign a confession. He was later released from imprisonment but disappeared in early 2017 after announcing a planned demonstration in central Minsk. He was again released by authorities after they violently suppressed the rally. On May 31, 2020, he was arrested on his way to a rally where signatures for Svetlana Tikhanovskaya were being gathered. He was sentenced to 15 days for participating in an unsanctioned protest. This sentence was extended two more times, and he was tried again on June 29 for organizing unrest.

C215 primarily uses stencils to produce his art. His first stencil work was put up in 2006, but he has been a graffiti artist for () over 20 years. His work consists mainly of close up portraits of people. C215's subjects are typically those such as beggars, homeless people, refugees, street kids and the elderly. The rationale behind this choice of subject is to draw attention to those that society has forgotten about. Cats are another frequent subject of his work. C215 is a prolific street artist and has practiced his art in cities all over the world. His stencils may be seen in Barcelona, Amsterdam, London, Rome, Paris, Oslo, Colombo and different cities of Morocco. In October 2014, C215 visited Valletta, Malta because of his interest in Caravaggio as well as 17th-century religious architecture. He produced various examples of street art on post boxes within the city, but MaltaPost removed the artworks after a few days. Various people have criticized MaltaPost for removing the artworks, including the mayor of Valletta Alexei Dingli. In addition to his street work, C215 also produces commercial artwork for galleries on wood and canvas. C215 has to date done a number of solo gallery shows to promote his work. C215's most recent show is entitled 'Community Service', currently running in Paris. Guémy's daughter Nina is a popular subject of his stencil art.

Typical species in the tribe have bifine hindwing venation (unlike most of the related subfamily Hypenodinae) and are smaller than those in other noctuoid moths. Micronoctua karsholti is the smallest of all species in the superfamily Noctuoidea. Taxonomic history Before the initial description of the tribe as the family Micronoctuidae in 2005, about 20 species were described in the families Arctiidae (now Arctiinae), Noctuidae, Nolidae (now Nolinae) and Pyralidae. The first species now referable to the tribe were named by Walker in 1863. Species of this tribe are rare in collections, possibly because most species are drably coloured (often a unicolorous brown, grey, or black) and are extremely small. Furthermore, lepidopterists specialising in macrolepidoptera ignore these species, thinking they belong to the microlepidoptera instead, while microlepidopterists collect them but usually classify them with unknown miscellaneous microlepidoptera. An extensive, four-part revision of the Micronoctuidae was published by Michael Fibiger from 2007 to 2011 (see References section), describing dozens of species for their first time and classifying them into subfamilies and tribes. A subsequent series of studies of the higher-level classification of the superfamily Noctuoidea showed that the phylogenetic placement of Micronoctuidae is as a clade within the subfamily Hypenodinae of the family Erebidae. This reclassification moved Micronoctuidae to the tribe Micronoctuini, its subfamilies to subtribes, and presumably its original tribes to infratribes. Distribution The Micronoctuini are only known from the Old World, mainly in the tropics and subtropics, but also in the temperate zone of eastern Asia.

The Syriac word Subara, 'Annunciation', with which the Church qualify the first five or six weeks of her liturgical year, is, in fact, an announcement and proclamation with celebration with this supreme glad news of divine condescension to the human frailty in order to raise it up to the divine sublimity. The season begins on the Sunday just before first of December and ends with the feast of Epiphany that is Feast of the Baptism of the Lord. This season is developed in the context of the mystery of incarnation completed in the fullness of time. The Church recalls during these days the announcement of the birth of John the Baptist, the predecessor of Jesus, and also the joyful event of the birth of John the Baptist. As a preparation for the celebration of the mystery of incarnation, this season also recalls creation, disobedience of our first parents and its consequences, the miserable state of the broken humanity, the promise of salvation offered by God, God’s covenant with humanity, and the prophecies about the Saviour. During this season we also meditate on the role of Mary in the history of the plan of salvation. The whole importance of Mary, and hence her veneration in the Church, depends on her relation to Jesus, the most special being His mother. Her celebration is also underlined with two very solemn festivals of her: Immaculate Conception on December 8 and Congratulation to Mary as Mother of Jesus on the last Friday of this season. Church practise abstinence from 1 to 25 December in preparation for Christmas, we call this period “25 days Lent”.

It lies on the eastern outskirts of New Milton in the New Forest district, and is two miles (3 km) inland from the sea. Its history dates back to the Domesday book of 1086, when two estates were recorded. In the 15th century much of Ashley merged with a neighbouring manor, and the estate became known as Ashley Arnewood. As a village, Ashley began to develop in the 19th century when a church and a school were built. Most of the current village was built in the 20th century, and today Ashley is effectively a suburb of New Milton. History Prehistory Stone Age hand axe found at Ashley, now on display in the Red House Museum Humans have lived in the Ashley area for thousands of years. Two Palaeolithic hand axes were found in gravel excavated from the gravel pits at Ashley, and are now in the Red House Museum in Christchurch, Dorset. A third axe was found in 1962. Early history The name Ashley means \\"ash wood/clearing\\".Old Hampshire Gazetteer In the Domesday book of 1086, two estates, Esselie and Esselei, are recorded. The first was possessed by \\"Nigel the doctor\\" from Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury; before 1066 it had been held by Saewulf. The other estate was in 1086 held by the sons of Godric Malf, who had himself held it from the king prior to 1066. Ashley was probably included in the grant of Christchurch made by Henry I to Richard de Redvers, because his successor Earl William in about 1200 granted an estate there in free marriage to Hawise the wife of William Avenel.William Page (editor), 1912, A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5 (1912), pp. 110–115 She gave it to her son Nicholas, on whose death it went to his son William Avenel. He held it as the manor of Ashley, and when he died without children in 1253 it passed to the Crown. It was granted in the following year to Thomas Waleran in recognition of the good service rendered by him in Gascony, but in 1263 it was again in the hands of the lord of Christchurch, because Baldwin de Redvers, 7th Earl of Devon, died in possession of it in that year. At the beginning of the 14th century Reginald de Bettesthorne had lands in Ashley worth 5 shillings yearly. Ashley Arnewood Ashley Arnewood Manor. An early 19th-century house with an 18th- century wing At a later date the manor of Ashley was joined with part of another manor to the east called Arnewood, the combination of the two being known as the manor of Ashley Arnewood. Katherine, the daughter of Sir Maurice Berkeley, at her death in 1494 owned the land in Arnewood together with an estate in West and East Ashley, all of which passed to her daughter Warborough, who became the wife of Sir William Compton. William Compton, whose family seat was in Compton Wynyates in Warwickshire, was Groom of the Bedchamber and favourite courtier of Henry VIII.William Page (editor), 1912, A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5 (1912), pp. 635–638 Other estates which came into his possession include the New Forest manors of Bisterne and Minstead. The manors of Arnewood and Ashley remained in the Compton family up to the 17th century, but by 1632 it was in the possession of Roger Tulse. In 1670 it belonged to George Stanley, and an estate in north-east Ashley is still called Stanleys.A. T. Lloyd, J. E. S. Brooks, (1996), The History of New Milton and its Surrounding Area, Centenary Edition, page 28 In 1803 William Ireland and his wife Betty transferred the manor of Ashley Arnewood to Richard Randell. In 1845, the politician John Arthur Roebuck purchased Ashley Arnewood, which is described as having of land attached to it.Robert Eadon Leader, (1897), Life and letters of John Arthur Roebuck, page 155 Because of his engagements in London, much of the actual farming at Ashley Arnewood was conducted by his wife until they chose to sell the estate in 1854. The estate was later purchased by the political philosopher and author Auberon Herbert in the 1870s and he lived there until his wife's death in 1886. The old manor house of Ashley Arnewood still survives on the western side of Ashley,British Listed Buildings – 32, New Milton although today it is a nursing home.Care Home Guide South East England, 2008, page 112 Ashley Manor Farm Another manor at Ashley still exists as a farm to the southwest of the village. Ashley Manor Farm, on Lymington Road, is an 18th-century farmhouse.British Listed Buildings – Ashley Manor Farmhouse, New Milton Ashley Clinton Another estate centre, dating from the 19th century, was that of Ashley Clinton, to the south of the current village, it was the residence of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Renebald Clinton.William Page (editor), 1912, A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5 (1912), pp. 124–127 The house, which still stands, dates from the early 19th century.British Listed Buildings – Ashley Clinton, New Milton The village A Baptist chapel was constructed at Ashley in 1817.A.

He would later publish his memories of growing up in Ashley: > I was born (June 1875) in a cottage in what is now Ashley Road; situated > south of the lane at the base of the hill by the brook. This spot was known > as \\"Litchford\\". As a tiny tot it had the elements of a fairyland to me. Fern > Hill woods were west of the lane, east were a narrow meadow and Ashley > Arnewood woods. In the spring these were a carpet of bluebells through which > I waded; they were shoulder high to me. We never entered Fern Hill Woods; > they were a game reserve and there were notices saying \\"Beware of Spring > Guns.\\" On the north edge of the lane from the top of the hill to Ashley > Cross Road wild daffodils grew by thousands, none to the south but primroses > and violets. . . . Mrs Corbin kept a little shop at the Cross Road, where we > bought our sweets, a parrot on the counter. This was furze or common ground > and a bog with water lilies.

A school was built at Ashley in 1879, at the west end of Hare Lane. In its final years it was used as a special school, but it was closed in 1987 and demolished soon afterwards.A. T. Lloyd, J. E. S. Brooks, (1996), The History of New Milton and its Surrounding Area, Centenary Edition, page 37 In 1939, a secondary school was built at Ashley (\\"Ashley County Secondary School\\"). The school was merged with the nearby New Milton school (\\"Arnewood\\") in 1970, and shortly afterwards Ashley school became a junior school.A. T. Lloyd, J. E. S.

On 15 July 1961, the 341st was reactivated, and a year later, in late July 1962, the first LGM-30A Minuteman I arrived and was placed at the Alpha-9 launch facility. The 10th SMS accepted its final flight on 28 February 1963. Two months later, the 12th SMS became 100 percent combat ready. In July, the 490th SMS became fully operational, giving the 341st SMW responsibility for 150 silos. A fourth squadron, the 564th, a former SM-65D Atlas unit, stood up on 1 April 1966 with the LGM-30F Minuteman II. Beginning in 1967, all Minuteman I A and B models were replaced by the Minuteman II. The upgrade was completed by June 1969. In 1975, the 564th SMS switched from the Minuteman II to the LGM-30G Minuteman III model. On 28 September 1991, President Bush ordered all Minuteman IIs off alert status. This order affected three-quarters of the 200 ICBMs stationed at Malmstrom. From 1992 to 1994, the Air Force removed 150 Minuteman II missiles from their silos to comply with the pending START I Treaty. The 10th, 12th and 490th silos were upgraded to receive Minuteman III missiles, joining the 50 Minuteman III missiles already on alert status with the 564th In 2007 the 564th SMS's 50 silos were retired to reduce operating costs. They were last upgraded in the early 1970s and were considerably different from the newer Minuteman III silos upgraded in the 1990s. With their inactivation, the United States number of ground-based ICBMs was reduced to 450. Facilities The Missile Alert Facility (MAF) consists of a buried and hardened Launch Control Center (LCC) and an above-ground Launch Control Support Building (LCSB). MAFs were formerly known as Launch Control Facilities (LCFs) but terminology was changed in 1992 with the inactivation of Strategic Air Command (SAC). In addition, a MAF has a landing pad for helicopters; a large radio tower; a large \\"top hat\\" HF antenna; a vehicle garage for security vehicles; recreational facilities, and one or two sewage lagoons. The entire site, except for the helicopter pad and sewage lagoons are secured with a fence and security personnel. About a dozen airmen and officers are assigned to a MAF. The underground Launch Control Center (LCC) contains the command and control equipment for missile operations. It is staffed by the two launch officers who have primary control and responsibility for the 10 underground and hardened Launch Facilities (LF)s within its flight which contains the operational missile. Each of the five LCCs also has the ability to command and monitor all 50 LFs within the squadron. The LF is unmanned, except when maintenance and security personnel are needed. A squadron is composed of five flights; flights are denoted by a letter of the alphabet with the facilities controlled by the flight being designated by a number, 01 through 11, with 01 being the MAF.

Hastings was accused of misconduct during his time in Calcutta particularly relating to mismanagement and personal corruption. The prosecution was led by Edmund Burke and became a wider debate about the role of the East India Company and the expanding empire in India. The trial became a debate between two radically opposed visions of empire—one represented by Hastings, based on ideas of absolute power and conquest in pursuit of the exclusive national interests of the colonizer, versus one represented by Burke, of sovereignty based on a recognition of the rights of the colonized.Mithi Mukherjee, \\"Justice, War, and the Imperium: India and Britain in Edmund Burke's Prosecutorial Speeches in the Impeachment Trial of Warren Hastings.\\" Law and History Review 23.3 (2005): 589–630 online. The trial did not sit continuously and the case dragged on for seven years. When the eventual verdict was given Hastings was overwhelmingly acquitted. It has been described as \\"probably the British Isles' most famous, certainly the longest, political trial\\". Background Appointment Born in 1732, Warren Hastings spent much of his adult life in India after first travelling out as a clerk of the East India Company in 1750. Hastings developed a reputation as an \\"Indian\\" who sought to use traditional Indian methods of governance to run British India rather than the policy of importing European- style law, government and culture favoured by many of his colleagues and representatives of other colonial powers in India. After working his way through the ranks of the Company he was appointed in 1773 as Governor General, a new position that had been created by the North government in order to improve the running of British India. The old structure of rule had come under strain as the Company's holdings had expanded in recent decades from isolated trading posts to large swathes of territory and population. The powers of the Governor General were balanced out by the establishment of a Calcutta Council which had the authority to veto his decisions. Hastings spent much of his time in office marshalling his own supporters on the Council in an effort to avoid being outvoted. Disputes and war Philip Francis Hastings soon ran into opposition on the Council. His principal enemy was the Irish-born politician Philip Francis. Francis developed a strong dislike of Hastings and was convinced that the Governor General's policies were self-serving and destructive. This was a belief shared with some other members of the Council whom he was able to influence. Francis and Hastings' personal rivalry continued for many years and led to a duel between them in 1780 in which Francis was wounded, but not killed. Francis returned to Britain in 1781 and began raising questions about Hastings' conduct. He found support from many leading opposition Whigs. In 1780 Hyder Ali, the ruler of Mysore, went to war with the company after British forces captured the French-controlled port of Mahé. Taking advantage of Britain's involvement in the American War of Independence and the support of French forces Hyder went on the offensive and enjoyed success during the opening stages of the war, inflicting a serious defeat at the Battle of Pollilur and at one point threatening Madras itself with capture. The Commander in Chief Eyre Coote went south with reinforcements and defeated Hyder's army in a series of battles which helped to steady the position in the Carnatic. Hyder was unable to secure victory and the war ended in a stalemate. It was halted by the Treaty of Mangalore in 1784 which largely restored the status quo ante bellum. Even so, the British position in India had been severely threatened. The war shook public confidence and raised questions about the supposed mismanagement by the Company's agents in India. It proved to be a catalyst for the growing campaign in London against Hastings which gathered strength during the ensuing years. First attacks The Company had already gone through scandals in the 1760s and 1770s and the wealthy nabobs who returned to Britain from India were widely unpopular. Against this backdrop the criticisms circulated by Francis and others provoked a general consensus that the 1773 India Act hadn't been sufficient to rein in the alleged excesses. The Indian question again became a contentious political issue. The Fox–North Coalition fell from power after it attempted to bring in a radical East India Bill in 1783. The following year the new government of William Pitt passed an India Act of 1784 which established a Board of Control and which finally stabilised the governance of India. Hastings was personally attacked by Charles James Fox during the presentation of his India Bill. When Pitt introduced his Bill he failed to mention Hastings at all, seen as expressing a lack of confidence, and made wide-ranging criticisms of the Company. He suggested that recent wars in India had been ruinous and unnecessary. Hastings was particularly upset by this, as he was an admirer of Pitt. By now, Hastings wished to resign and return home unless the role of Governor General was given greater freedom to exercise power—which was unlikely to be granted him. He handed over to an Acting Governor General, John MacPherson until a permanent replacement was appointed. Return to Britain The MP Edmund Burke led the prosecution of Hastings. Hastings sailed for home on 6 February and reached Britain in June 1785. During the voyage he wrote a defence of his conduct The State of Bengal and presented it to Henry Dundas. Hastings anticipated he would face attacks in Parliament and the press but expected them to be short-lived and to fall away once he was there in person to defend himself. Initially this proved to be the case as he enjoyed an audience with King George III and a unanimous vote of thanks by the directors of the East India Company. Hastings even hoped to be awarded an Irish peerage. However, in Parliament Edmund Burke announced he \\"would at a future date make a motion respecting the conduct of a gentleman just returned from India\\". In early 1786 Burke began his first move by raising questions over Hastings' role in the Maratha War. The attacks on Hastings were largely made by opposition Whigs hoping to embarrass the government of William Pitt. Pitt and other government ministers such as Dundas defended Hastings and suggested that he had saved the British Empire in Asia. Philip Francis made eleven specific charges against Hastings, and others later followed. They covered various subjects such as the Rohilla War, execution of Nanda-Kumar and Hastings' treatment of the Rajas of Benares Chait Singh. Pitt broadly defended Hastings, but declared his punishment of the Rajah had been excessive. In the wake of this an anti-Hastings motion was passed in the Commons 119–79. Encouraged by Pitt's failure to adequately support Hastings, his opponents pressed on with their campaign. The situation quickly deteriorated for Hastings. It soon became clear that he was heading towards an impeachment. Hastings recruited Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough to act in his defence. On 21 May 1787 Hastings was arrested by the Serjeant-at-Arms and taken to the House of Lords to hear the charges against him. Hastings was to be prosecuted in the House of Lords by an Impeachment Committee. Impeachment was a relatively rare process of prosecuting those in high public office. Previous figures who had faced such trials included the Duke of Buckingham, a favourite of James I, and the Earl of Strafford, whose impeachment failed (but was followed up by a legislative bill of attainder that resulted in Strafford's execution). Impeachment The trial of Warren Hastings, 1788 Opening Hastings' trial began on 13 February 1788 and took place in Westminster Hall with members of the House of Commons seated to his right and the Lords to his left and a large audience of spectators, including royalty, in the boxes and public galleries. The proceedings began with a lengthy address by Edmund Burke, who took four days to cover all the charges against Hastings.The World’s Famous Orations. Ireland (1775–1902). \\"III. At the Trial of Warren Hastings\\" Edmund Burke (1729–97) Burke took the proceedings very seriously but, we have it from Macaulay, for many spectators the trial resembled a social event. Hastings himself remarked that “for the first half hour, I looked up to the orator in a reverie of wonder, and during that time I felt myself the most culpable man on earth.” Hastings was granted bail in spite of Burke's suggestion that he might flee the country with the wealth he had allegedly stolen from India. Further speeches were made over the coming weeks by other leading Whigs such as Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Charles James Fox. In total there were nineteen members of the Impeachment Committee. Public opinion changes Lord Cornwallis, Hastings' successor as Governor General, was a major boost to his defence. In spite of the early excitement about the trial public interest in it began to wane as it dragged on over months and years. Other major events dominated the news particularly once the French Revolution began in 1789. Sheridan now complained he was \\"heartily tired of the Hastings trial\\" despite being one of its instigators.Garrard & Newell p. 138 As the trial progressed, public attitudes about Hastings also began to shift. Hastings had initially been overwhelmingly portrayed as guilty in the popular press, but doubts were increasingly raised. Increased support for Hastings may have been a result of declining perceptions of his accusers. In a cartoon James Gillray portrayed Hastings as the \\"Saviour of India\\" being assaulted by bandits resembling Burke and Fox. A major lift for the defence came with the testimony on 9 April 1794 of Lord Cornwallis who had recently returned from India, where he succeeded Hastings as Governor General. Cornwallis rejected the accusations that Hastings' actions had damaged Britain's reputation and observed that Hastings was universally popular with the inhabitants. When asked if he had \\"found any just cause to impeach the character of Mr Hastings?\\" he replied \\"never\\". A further blow for the prosecution came with the evidence of William Larkins the former Accountant General of Bengal. They had rested their hopes on his revealing widespread corruption but he denied that Hastings had amassed any illicit money and made a defence of his conduct. Various other figures came forwards as character witnesses to support Hastings. Burke's reply to the defence lasted nine days from late May to mid-June 1794.archive.org: \\"The speeches of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke on the impeachment of Warren Hastings : to which is added a selection of Burke's epistolary correspondence\\" (1890 ed. G. Bell, London) Verdict On 23 April 1795 the Lord Chancellor Lord Loughborough oversaw the delivery of the verdict. A third of the Lords who had attended the trial's opening had since died and only twenty-nine of the others had sat through enough of the evidence to be permitted to pronounce judgement. Loughborough asked each of the peers sixteen questions relating to individual charges. On most charges he was unanimously found not guilty. On three questions five or six peers gave guilty verdicts, but Hastings was still comfortably cleared by majority vote. This overwhelming verdict had been expected for some time and caused little surprise. Burke, who had invested a large amount of time and energy into the prosecution, was frustrated by the ultimate failure of the impeachment. He had warned the Lords that it would be \\"to the perpetual infamy\\" of the House if they voted to acquit and remained convinced of Hastings' guilt until his death in 1797. Aftermath Westminster Hall where the trial took place Hastings was financially ruined by the impeachment and was left with debts of £70,000. Unlike many other Indian officials he had not amassed a large fortune while in India and he had to fund his legal defence, which had cost an estimated £71,000, out of his own funds. His defence lawyer was Richard Shaw(e) who built his mansion Casino House in Herne Hill at least in part from the proceeds, employing John Nash and Humphry Repton as landscape designer (responsible for the water garden the remnants of which survive as Sunray Gardens in 2012). Meanwhile, Hastings appealed to the British government for financial assistance and was eventually compensated by the East India Company with a loan of £50,000 and a pension of £4,000 a year. Although this did not solve all his financial worries, Hastings was ultimately able to fulfill his lifelong ambition of purchasing the family's traditional estate of Daylesford in Gloucestershire which had been lost in a previous generation. Hastings held no further public office, but was regarded as an expert on Indian matters and was asked to give evidence to parliament on the subject in 1812. After he had finished giving his testimony, the members all stood up in an almost unprecedented act for anyone other than the royal family. Hastings' successors as Governor General, beginning with Lord Cornwallis, were granted the much wider powers that Hastings had sought while in Calcutta. Pitt's India Act served to move much of the supervisory role for India away from the East India Company directors and officials in Leadenhall Street to a new political Board of Control based in London. The overwhelming failure to secure a conviction, and the stream of testimony that came out of India praising him, have led commentators to ask why Hastings, who appeared to many observers to have given dedicated service to the company and to have curbed its worst excesses, ended up being prosecuted in the first place. A number of factors may have played a part, including partisan politics, although Pitt joined the opposition in supporting the Impeachment. There has been particular focus on the role played by Pitt—particularly his sudden withdrawal of outright support for Hastings in 1786 which galvanised the opposition into pursuing the case. It is possible that Pitt believed \\"he ran the very genuine risk of being accused by the opposition of shielding a notorious criminal from justice, for political reasons\\". Henry Dundas was himself later impeached in 1806 and acquitted in the final ever impeachment in Britain.

Life Maximilian was the ninth son of Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (1654–1730), and his wife, Marie Amalia (1653–1711), daughter of Jacob Kettler, Duke of Kurland. In 1720, he married Friederike Charlotte of Hesse- Darmstadt (1698–1777), a daughter of Ernest Louis, Landgrave of Hesse- Darmstadt. The marriage was meant to symbolise the new harmony between Hesse- Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt, but was complicated by the two families' annoyance over his lavish lifestyle. In 1723, his father gave Maximilian the domain of Jesberg, which included the Richerode estate. In Jesberg, Maximilian built the baroque Schloss Jesberg and in nearby woodland built the 'Prinzessingarten' for his daughters.

He was born into a peasant family in the village of Derhachi (by some accounts - cobbler familyMatushenko at the Great Soviet Encyclopedia), eight miles northwest of Kharkiv. He lived in a tiny hut (15 feet square) with his parents and five siblings.Neal Bascomb, Red Mutiny, page 22. His father Nikolai was an ex-serf, earning money on the side as a cobbler. After the famine of 1891, Nikolai became an alcoholic. Afanasy, who had learned to read at 9, had to take up cobbling when he was 12. Matushenko managed to finish a church parish school. Since his childhood he was a friend of Hnat Khotkevych.Kozulia, O. City of the Ukrainian Glory and Tragedy. \\"Personal Plius\\" weekly. July 21, 2008Kravchenko, V. Ukrainian Sevastopol. \\"Ukrainian Life in Sevastopol\\" (Library of Maria Fisher). At 15 he ran away to Kharkiv, became a railway oilman, and in 1896 he went to Odessa, and became a coalman on a steamship that took him to Vladivostok where he lived for two years as a railway machinist. In 1898, he became a docker at Rostov-on-Don, where he joined a Marxist study circle led by future Bolshevik Vladimir Petrov.Neal Bascomb, Red Mutiny, page 25-6. On his 21st birthday, Afanasy was conscripted for seven years into the navy and sent to Sevastopol for four months of training. The harsh discipline alienated him from the officers. After training, he went to Kronstadt, near St. Petersburg, where he finished a course in torpedo machinery. In 1902, he was promoted to quartermaster on the Battleship Potemkin. Here he joined Tsentralka, the sailors' revolutionary organisation. Sailors looked up to him as a protector: \\"He would go through fire for his brother sailor\\", said one.Neal Bascomb, Red Mutiny, page 33. On the morning of 10 June 1905 Tsentralka met on Malakhov hill, just outside Sebastopol. Over 100 sailors were there. In March, they had already written \\"The Resolution of the Black Sea sailors\\" calling for the end of Tsarism and a Constituent assembly. They agreed the Black Sea fleet would mutiny on 21 June, though Matushenko had wanted the mutiny to start immediately.Neal Bascomb, Red Mutiny, page 21-2. During the Potemkin mutiny Matushenko took part in the killing of Captain Golikov and Ippolit Giliarovsky. After mutinous sailors left ship in Constanza he lived in exile in Romania, Switzerland, US (June 1906 - March 1907) and France (March–June 1907). In exile he met with various socialist leaders: Vladimir Lenin, Christian Rakovsky, Vladimir Posse, Maxim Gorky, Georgy Gapon and Boris Savinkov. Matushenko was not a member of any political party and had no distinct political views. Some considered his views close to social- democrats, while other thought him closer to SRs or anarchists. In June 1907 Matushenko returned to Russia under a false name. He was arrested by police, tried by a court in Sevastopol and sentenced to death. He was executed by hanging on 2 November 1907.

With a documented record of historical occupation into the 19th century by the Passamaquoddy people (on whose tribal land it is located), and archaeological evidence spanning nearly 3000 years of habitation, the site is one of the most important in eastern Maine. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description The Governors Point site was first identified in 1986 by a state archaeological survey team, and was subjected to intense activity between 1988 and 1992 to recover artifacts and determine its scope. Materials recovered from the site include examples of virtually every type of stone projectile point seen elsewhere in Maine, fashioned from stone sourced from Pennsylvania and New York to Newfoundland. Further evidence indicates that the site was a major seasonal occupation site across the enter Ceramic/Woodland Period, extending back about 2,800 years.Spiess, Arthur (1999). NRHP nomination for Governors Point; redacted version available by request from the National Park Service Of particular significance are artifacts recovered from the site that date to the Early Contact Period. These early 17th-century artifacts are particularly rare in Maine, and include fragments of glassware, kaolin smoking pipes, trade beads, gun flints of French manufacture, and a copper artifact interpreted to be a knife. The site is also likely to be a major settlement referenced in historical documents dating to the American Revolutionary War period, and was explicitly referenced in a 1794 treaty between the state of Massachusetts (which Maine was then a part of) and the Passamaquoddy tribe. The land was sold out of tribal control in 1800 by a chief, a transaction that was ruled illegal in Massachusetts, but confirmed after Maine achieved statehood in 1820.

Marshall Ave. in Marshall, Michigan is a historic house built in 1839 with elements of Greek Revival architecture. It is also known as Governor's Mansion Museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. In 2017, the house is a museum owned and operated by the Mary Marshall Chapter of Daughters of the American Revolution. History In 1839, Marshall citizen James Wright Gordon, recently elected to the state senate, began agitating for Marshall to be designated as the state capital. In expectation, Gordon purchased land across from where the Capitol was proposed to be built and constructed this house. It has been referred to as the \\"Governor's Mansion\\" since its construction. (excerpted from \\"A History of Marshall\\") Gordon became lieutenant governor, and then acting governor of Michigan in 1841. However, Lansing was chosen as the new state capital in 1847, dashing Marshall's hopes. Gordon was later appointed to the consular service in South America by Zachary Taylor, and died there in 1853. Gordon's widow owned of the house until 1882, when it was purchased by Mrs. Flory Palmer, a local resident. She and her daughter, Bertha Palmer Brady, lived in the house for many years. In 1967, the Brady heirs donated the property to the local Mary Marshall Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The chapter converted the house into their meeting hall and as a museum. Description The \\"Governor's Mansion\\" in Marshall is a two-story white frame Greek Revival building built in a side-hall plan. It has a single-story rear addition. The main section of the house has clapboard siding on the sides and horizontal plank siding on the front. In the front is a wide Doric portico with a Greek entablature above. Under the portico are two vertically elongated sash windows, and a front entrance framed by pilasters decorated with carved acanthus leaves. A dentiled cornice runs across the main portion of the house.

The kindlin family of proteins, member of the B4.1 superfamily, comprises three conserved protein homologues, kindlin 1, 2, and 3. They each contain a bipartite FERM domain comprising four subdomains F0, F1, F2, and F3 that show homology with the FERM head (H) domain of the cytoskeletal Talin protein. Kindlins have been linked to Kindler syndrome, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, cancer and other acquired human diseases. They are essential in the organisation of focal adhesions that mediate cell-extracellular matrix junctions and are involved in other cellular compartments that control cell-cell contacts and nucleus functioning. Therefore, they are responsible for cell to cell crosstalk via cell-cell contacts and integrin mediated cell adhesion through focal adhesion proteins and as specialised adhesion structures of hematopoietic cells they are also present in podosome's F actin surrounding ring structure. Isoform 2 may act as a repressor of NF-kappa-B and apoptosis FERMT-3 protein sequence  Evolution  It has been suggested that the evolutionary source of a single ancestral Kindlin protein is the earliest metazoa, the Parazoa. Within vertebrates, these ancestral proteins were subjected to duplication processes in order to arrive at the actual Kindlin family. In comparison with other members of the B4.1 superfamily of proteins, the FERM domains in Kindlin homologues have a greater degree of conservation. The presence of an inserted pleckstrin homology domain within the FERM domain, suggests that the metazoan evolution of the FERM domain is the origination from a proto-talin protein in unicellular or proto-multicellular organisms.  Function  FERMT 3 Structure The FERMT3 protein has a key role in the regulation of hemostasis and thrombosis. This protein may also help maintain the membrane skeleton of erythrocytes. Kindlin 3 is a cytoskeletal signalling protein involved in the activation of the glycoprotein receptor, integrin. Together with the Talin protein it binds cooperatively to beta integrin’s cytoplasmic domain causing tail reorientation, thus altering the molecule’s conformation. Modification of integrin’s conformation serves to dissociate alpha and beta subunits by disrupting their interactions and helping the molecule adopt a high affinity state. FERMT3 functions as a stabilizer of the cytoskeleton and regulates its dynamics in cell and organelle motility.  Clinical significance  FERMT3 mutations can result in autosomal recessive leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome-III (LAD-III). a deficiency in beta1, beta2 and beta3 integrin activation in platelets and leukocytes that causes haemorrhaging and recurrent infections. Loss of FERMT3 expression in leukocytes compromises their adhesion to the inflamed endothelia and affects neutrophil binding and spreading while selectin mediated rolling is unaffected. It has also been found that FERMT3 lowers Natural Killer cell’s activation threshold, such that a loss of FERMT3 affects single receptor activation of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity but has no impact on multiple receptors, where the protein deficiency is overcome and target cells are killed. FERMT3 deficiency on β(2) integrin function depend on both cell type (Natural killer cell or Leukocytes) and the integrin activation stimulus. The prevention of the beta-3 activation is specifically related to LAD-3, causing Glanzmann's thrombasthenia symptoms, a condition in which patients bleed excessively. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is diagnosed clinically and by complete blood counts that reveal leukocytosis with neutrophilia. Management and treatment of this disease aim to control these recurrent infections by antibiotics and blood transfusions, with bone marrow transplantation as the only curative measure. Failure to express the FERMT3 protein disrupts the ability to form clots and coagulate by preventing integrin αIIβ3-mediated platelet aggregation.

Historical background At the INEOS's earliest stages it was implied that synthetic work in organoelement and macromolecular chemistry should be combined with the necessity of relevant theoretical and physical investigations, and therefore many laboratories at INEOS are carrying out their research at the junction of several branches in chemistry and physics. This determines “the points of growth” which lead to progress in modern science and technology as A.N. Nesmeyanov used to say. Apart from traditional, scientific disciplines (to which the organoelement chemistry itself belongs too), valuable experience accumulated during these years has given rise to a series of new scientific fields which are characterized by a unique combination of organic, organoelement, coordination, physical chemistry, and chemistry of the macromolecular and natural biologically active compounds. Thus, new branches in chemistry have appeared at the junction of organic, organometallic and coordination chemistry, namely the chemistry of the organic derivatives of the transition metals, p-complexes and clusters, asymmetric catalysis etc. The unique properties of these new compounds made it possible to develop new organometallic catalysts, to study an activation of small molecules, including molecular nitrogen, hydrocarbons, etc. Combination of organic and organoelement chemistry with the experimental and theoretical methods of physical chemistry promoted the development of relevant studies in reactivity, structural chemistry, catalysis and molecular dynamics of organoelement compounds. The interaction between organophosphorus chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology made it possible to unlock the secrets of the mechanisms responsible for the action of organophosphorus compounds upon biological structures and living organisms. Significant progress has been also achieved in the field of new tumor- selective anticancer preparations and physiologically active organofluorine compounds. The works at the junction of the organic and inorganic chemistry, studies of the processes of polymer formation as well as structure—property relations, brought about the chemistry of polymers with organoelement and inorganic molecular chains and opened the routes to novel classes of linear and network polymers. New materials with valuable thermal, catalytic, sorptional and electro-physical properties, engineering plastics, thermostable composites and adhesives, membranes and polymers for electronics and medicine have been made up on the basis of these polymers.

On Joachim Ernst's death Albert's elder brother Frederick III succeeded him in Ansbach from 1625 onwards, initially under their mother's guardianship, but he was killed without issue in the Thirty Years' War in 1634. Albert thus succeeded him, though again the early years of his rule were under his mother's guardianship, only taking up full government responsibilities when his minority ended in 1639. With much diplomatic skill, he manoeuvred Brandenburg-Ansbach through the last ten years of the war and through administrative reforms, support for the guilds and cultural life and a good credit policy he promoted the beginnings of post-war reconstruction. He offered refuge to religious refugees from Austria and in 1647 or 1662 granted them lands in Treuchtlingen and Berolzheim. Albert's main advisor on this was his former teacher Johannes Limnäus. Active in the politics of the Holy Roman Empire, he sent troops to back the war against the Ottoman Empire. A typical Baroque absolute ruler, he died at Ansbach in 1667.

She was born in Woolwich, England southeast of London. Ellen was the third daughter of General Sir Alexander Dickson. She had been physically disabled since a young age, and her chosen Latin pseudonym, Dolores, which means sorrows and bodily pains, reflects that aspect of her personal life. Ellen inherited her father’s talents for mathematics and his analytical intellect. She lived most of her life and died in Lyndhurst, England. Musical career  Dickson began making her reputation in the late 1850s, composing drawing-room ballads in a style similar to that of Maria Lindsay. She began by setting Longfellow poems in 1854. From then, Dickson published, partly under the name Dolores, a tremendous plethora of songs in renowned London music publishing companies. Approximately 65 songs have survived. These works include settings for poems by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Adelaide A. Procter, Percy Bysshe Shelly, Alfred Tennyson, and many others. Ellen Dickson achieved a high level of awareness with her song “The Bridge\\", lyrics by Longfellow, which was first published by Charles Jefferys in 1857.  Known Compositions  Dickson's songs are often characterized by unusual permutations of broken chord patterns and delicate use of grace notes. Her setting of Tennyson's 'The Brook', published in 1857, shows individuality with its delicate use of grace notes to suggest the rippling water. Dolores also tends to rely on various permutations of broken- chord patterns for her accompaniments. In her case, they are often unpredictable in shape and rhythm. Her song \\"The Land of Long Ago\\" offers a good example. She provides an example of the union of the beautiful melody and ornamental accompaniment in \\"Clear and Cool.\\" When the words call for loudness, the pitch of the accompaniment ensures balance in the composition. The morally uplifting words of the song, taken from Charles Kingsley's \\"The Water Babies,\\" are addressed to a mother and child. Dolores released a songbook called \\"Dream\\" that contained her arrangements of Anne Proctors' works. The book was published in Philadelphia in 1867. Dickson composed mainly parlor music, which, in historical context, was the main type of music socially acceptable for women composers. Her other works include: *Good night, beloved (Text: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow) *Old clock on the stairs (Text: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow) *The bridge (Text: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow) *The brook (Text: Lord Alfred Tennyson) *The open window (Text: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow) *Turn, fortune, turn (Text: Lord Alfred Tennyson) *Vivien's song (Text: Lord Alfred Tennyson) References Category:1819 births Category:1878 deaths Category:19th-century classical composers Category:Female classical composers Category:English classical composers Category:19th-century English musicians Category:19th-century British composers Category:19th-century women composers ","title":"Ellen Dickson"},{"id":"29949977","text":"The Micronoctuina are a subtribe of moths of the family Erebidae erected by Michael Fibiger in 2005.

She was the child of Jacob Kettler and Margravine Louise Charlotte of Brandenburg, eldest daughter of George William, Elector of Brandenburg.  Life  Amalia was a daughter of the Duke Jacob of Courland (1610–1681) from his marriage to Louise Charlotte (1617–1676), eldest daughter of the Elector George William of Brandenburg. She was thus a member of the Ketteler family. On 21 May 1673, she married in Kassel her first cousin Landgrave Charles I of Hesse-Kassel (1654–1730). Amalia had previously been engaged with Charles older brother, William VII, but he died during his grand tour at the young age of 19 years. The Landgravine participated in the creation of Karlsaue Park in Kassel. The marmor fountain in the park contains a medallion by the influential Roman sculptor Pierre Etienne Monnot (1657–1733) depicting Maria Amalia. She was described as modest, affable and pious. She and her son Maximilian acquired Sensenstein Castle in 1699. She died in 1711 and was buried in the Martinskirche, Kassel. The village of Mariendorf in Immenhausen district was named after her.

Their sole non-conference win came against I-AA . Part of the problem was the transition from a pass-dominated offense led by graduated wide receiver Brandon Marshall to a run-dominated offense led by sophomore running back Kevin Smith. 2006 was the final season that UCF would play at the aging Citrus Bowl. Already under construction was a new 45,000-seat on-campus stadium, which would open in time for the 2007 season. It would also be the final year that UCF would play under the \\"Golden Knights\\" nickname.

Life He grew up in an artistic family (he was the brother of Ulrika Pasch, alongside whom he was elected to the Art Academy in 1773), but his father Lorens Pasch the Elder wanted him to become a priest. He was thus sent to study in Uppsala aged 10. However, he decided on an artistic career after all and began an apprenticeship in his father's studio before going to Copenhagen, with introductions from his wealthy and influential uncle Johan Pasch. There he studied painting for three years in the studio of Carl Gustaf Pilo. Despite good offers of studio-apprenticeships and commissions from Sweden, he then set off for Paris in 1758 to complete his artistic education. There he specialised in history painting in the studios of Eustache Le Sueur and François Boucher (though for financial reasons he also continued his training in portraiture) and became friends with fellow-Swede Alexander Roslin. In 1764 he left Paris and got back to Sweden in 1766. He fully completed his training in the studio of the French painter Guillaume Taraval, who in 1735 founded the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm. Soon after his arrival back in Sweden Pasch's gained a great reputation as a portraitist, gaining favour and commissions from the royal court and gaining the esteem of Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden and his queen Louisa Ulrika - one of his most notable works is his Portrait of Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. He served as a professor at the Academy of Arts from 1773 to his death, becoming its director on Pilo's death in 1793. At the end of his life he concentrated more on training young artists and managing the Academy than on painting. He died unmarried in 1805 and due to his powerful portraits remains one of the most respected painters of the Gustavian era in Sweden.

He played at the fullback position for the University of Michigan football teams in 1894 and 1895. He was the leading scorer on the 1895 Michigan Wolverines football team that outscored opponents 266 to 14 and won the school's first Western football championship. He scored as many as 32 points in a single game. The Wolverines compiled a record of 17–2–1 in Bloomingston's two years as the starting fullback and never lost a game against a Western team. After graduating from Michigan, he became one of the best known trial lawyers in Chicago, where he practiced for more than 40 years. Early years Bloomingston was born in Chicago in 1874. He was the son of John S. Bloomingston (1843–1901) and Frances E. Drake Bloomingston. His father was an immigrant from Switzerland and the editor and proprietor of the Investigator, one of the oldest insurance papers in the west. His mother was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and a descendant of Col. Samuel Drake and William Hooker.Lineage book - National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, Volume 4, published by the Daughters of the American Revolution, p. 259. Education and athletics Bloomingston attended the Pennsylvania Military College in Chester, Pennsylvania, and subsequently enrolled at the University of Michigan. While attending Michigan, Bloomingston was one of the university's best athletes. He played fullback for the Michigan Wolverines football team and second base for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team. He received a Bachelor of Law degree from the University of Michigan in 1896. 1894 football team In 1894, Bloomingston was the starting fullback for the 1894 Michigan Wolverines football team that finished the season with a record of 9–1–1 and outscored opponents 244 to 84. On November 24, 1894, he helped Michigan defeat Cornell, 12–4, marking the first time Michigan had beaten one of the elite Eastern football teams. Five days later, Bloomingston kicked the goal from touchdown which proved to be the winning points in a 6–4 win over Chicago. 1895 baseball team In the spring of 1895, Bloomingston played second base for the Michigan baseball team. On May 30, 1895, he led Michigan to an 11–0 win over Cornell at the Detroit Athletic Club field in Detroit. A crowd of 4,000 watched, the Detroit Free Press wrote that \\"Bloomingston carried off the batting honors with two homers and a single.\\" Bloomingston's first home run came in the fifth inning and was described by the Free Press as follows: > Bloomingston came to bat with blood in his eye. He caught one of [Cornell > pitcher] Smith's twisters on the nose and the ball landed in the crowd in > the stand in left field. ... In a second the stands and the field were a > mass of yellow and blue and 'Bloomy,' as the crowd called him, got a > 'football ovation.' His second home run came in the seventh inning: \\"The crowd yelled for another home run, and he didn't do a thing but plant the ball over the carriages lined up along the fence in left field.\\" 1895 football team In the fall of 1895, Bloomingston was the leading scorer for the 1895 Michigan Wolverines football team that outscored opponents 266 to 14 and won the school's first western football championship. Although scoring records are incomplete, a newspaper account of an October 1895 game against Adelbert indicates that Bloomingston scored 32 points, as he ran for three touchdowns (four points each) and kicked 10 goals from touchdown (worth two points each). the following week, Bloomingston added 20 points (two touchdowns and seven goals from touchdown) against Lake Forest. One week later, Bloomingston added 18 points (one touchdown and seven goals from touchdown) in a 42–0 victory over Oberlin. Bloomingston's talent as a kick returner were also on display against Oberlin, as he returned a kickoff 45 yards in the second half for the longest play of the game. Bloomingston gained 50 yards in one run against Oberlin, and his field goal attempt from the 50-yard line went wide by only five feet. The sole loss of the 1895 season was a 4–0 setback against Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts. One week after the Harvard game, Bloomingston kicked two goals from touchdown to give Michigan the winning margin in a 12–10 victory over Purdue. Bloomingston finished his Michigan football career by scoring eight points (a touchdown and two goals from touchdown) in Michigan's 12–0 victory over Chicago on Thanksgiving Day. Bloomingston's running was reportedly the high point of the game. A Chicago newspaper described one run by Bloomingston as follows: > Chicago could not gain, and Neel was forced to punt again. Bloomingston > received the ball, and, dodging the tacklers, who sought to bring him to the > ground, ran back the entire length of the kick. It was a splendid > performance, and no small part of the applause the hero received came from > Chicago throats. The Detroit Free Press wrote: \\"Bloomingston played the star game of the day, easily out-punting Neel and bucking the line like a battering ram. One of his kicks was seventy yards in the air and went the whole length of the field.\\" Following the game The World of New York wrote that the Michigan players had \\"clinched their claim to the Western championship.\\" In December 1895, the Chicago Daily Inter Ocean picked Bloomingston as the fullback on its All- Western team. The newspaper wrote, \\"Every one in the West, with the possible exception of the Wisconsin men, unites in the selection of Bloomington as full back. Those who saw the sensational runs made in the game with Chicago last Thanksgiving day can possibly have no other opinion. Sure at goals, a strong punter, and a wonderful runner, he has but few rivals.\\" Disbarment In June 1896, Bloomingston was disbarred from participation in University of Michigan college athletics. The action followed an investigation of student athletes participating in professional baseball conducted by the university's board of control of athletics. Bloomingston appeared before the board and admitted that he had played professional baseball for compensation under an assumed name for \\"the Flint picked-up nine.\\" Another member of the Michigan baseball team were also disbarred, an action which \\"stirred up quite a hornet's nest in athletic circles.\\" Minor league baseball records indicate that Bloomingston also played professional baseball in 1895 for the Owosso Colts in the Michigan State League. Minor league baseball and other athletic competition During the fall of 1896, Bloomingston served as coach and quarterback for the football team of the Michigan Military Academy at Orchard Lake, Michigan. In the spring of 1897, Bloomingston returned to Chicago and was appointed the player-coach of the Bankers' Athletic Club baseball team. He also appeared in eight games for the New England Whalers of the New England League in 1897. Legal career Bloomingston returned to Chicago in 1897 and was admitted that year to the Illinois bar. He was, according to the Chicago Daily Tribune, \\"for 40 years one of Chicago's best known trial lawyers.\\" He also served as a director of the Yellow Cab Company. He maintained his office at 160 North La Salle Street. Family and death Bloomingston married Edna Fowler Bloomingston, and they had a daughter, Caryl. Their daughter married E. Cummings \\"Ted\\" Parker in 1937, and they had twin sons. Bloomingston's wife died in October 1940. In January 1942, Bloomingston died of an apparent heart attack at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel in Philadelphia, while on a business trip. At the time of his death, Bloomingston was a resident of Chicago, having his home at 210 East Pearson Street.

The Trust closed in 2012 but the website and streaming video remains active (based at Sheffield University).  History  Founded in 1995 by Nobel Laureate Sir Harry Kroto and BBC Education Producer Patrick Reams the Vega Science Trust was awarded a COPUS start-up grant from the Royal Society in 1995 and then went on in 1999 to be allocated core funding from the Office of Science and Technology (OST). Starting with recording science programmes for terrestrial television the Vega Science Trust produced a number of programmes such as recordings of Royal Institution DiscourcesRoyal Institution Discourse Recordings which were broadcast on BBC 2 and a set of Masterclasses. In 2001 Harry Kroto was awarded the Royal Society Michael Faraday Prize - the UK's premier award for science communicationThe Royal Society Michael Faraday Prize 'for his dedication to the notion of working scientists being communicators of their work and in particular for his establishment of the Vega Science Trust whose films and related activities reflect the excitement of scientific discovery to the public'. The Trust went on to co-produce with the BBC Open University a set of science discussion programmes covering hot topics such as Stem Cells, Energy, Mobile Phones, GM Food, Disease, Nanotechnology and Ageing.The Next Big Thing Recordings With the BBC/Open University the Trust also produced with sponsorship from HEFCE Widening Participation Team a set of award- winningLearning on Screen Awards career programmes featuring young scientists.Snapshots Young Scientist Career Recordings Both series were broadcast on BBC2. Very early audio-visual recordings of individual scientists are relatively rare but in the recent past some recordings were carried out by such organisations as the BBC.BBC Interviews with Scientists 1985 In 1997 the Vega Science Trust embarked on a plan to record in-depth interviews with scientists such as Rotblat, Sanger, Perutz, Cornforth, Walter Kohn and Richard ErnstFace-to-Face Interviews with Scientists which could be both viewed and preserved as an historical record for the future. More recently the British Library embarked on a similar project of recording audio-visual interviews under the National Life Stories projectBritish Library National Life Stories although at present their archive consists of oral recordings of scientists. The Vega Science Trust's in-depth interviews with scientists led onto a project recording interviews with Nobel LaureatesNobel Interviews attending the annual Nobel Laureate Meetings at Lindau in 2004/5/6. In 2006 the Vega Science Trust's website received a special mention at The International Association for Media ScienceThe International Association for Media Science Awards. In 2007 the Vega Science Trust started on-going work with Jonathan Hare BBC Rough Science on a series of short instructional filmsInstructional Mini Films by Jonathan Hare intended to show how things work. For instance a number of the films show how we can generate electricity, another shows how we can generate wind power, others the molecular structure of C60, carbon nanotubes and graphene.Article Nanowerk on Graphene modules From 2007-2010 the Trust concentrated on bringing to the public's attention the process of science research. The Nano2HybridsNano2hybrids website EU STReP project for instance was an innovative project where research scientists recorded their own progress on a research project to invent a gas sensor made using carbon nanotubes. In addition recording science in society projects such as Women in NanotechnologyWomen in Nanotechnology and DiversityDiversity Project illuminate workWomen in Nanotechnology film towards promoting women scientists into decision making positions in science research environments. The Vega Science Trust closed in March 2012 after 17 years of operation. However, the website will continue to host the existing film archive.  Governance  The Vega Science Trust was governed by a board of five Trustees who are active research scientists, media, copyright, and educational specialists. Trustees step down and/or are re-elected each year. The Vega Science Trust employed one member of staff (and for a period, a second technical member) and operated in a mixed economy of core grant-in-aid support from Florida State University, and from research grants and sponsorship. It was an independent body with its own self-contained offices, initially in the University of Sussex chemistry department, and later at the Innovation Centre, University of Sussex, Brighton.  Vision  The Vega Science Trust aimed to see science more fully integrated into our everyday culture. Vega's vision has been to do so by providing a platform from which scientists can broadcast science programmes directly to the public. Activities * Recording scientists. :Covering a wide array of research. * Making available to the public by streaming from the Vega Science Trust's website. :Videos stream in different formats. * Creating an historical archive of some of the world's most eminent scientists. :Interviewing Nobel Laureates and other eminent scientists. * Experimenting with new ways of outreaching/engaging with the public via audio-visual means. :Creating different programme formats. * Provide on-line science resources for school, university and the public via informal learning. :Creating informative videos for imparting scientific concepts.

Early years Born and baptised on 16 May 1675, Thomas Pengelly was the son of Thomas Pengelly, a prosperous London-based merchant, and his wife, Rachel Baines. By 1683, the family's home in Hereford had provided lodgings for the former Protector Richard Cromwell after the Restoration of the Monarchy. On the death of Sir Quentin in 1696, Cromwell continued to lodge with Mrs Pengelly, moving with her to her property in Cheshunt in Hertfordshire in 1700, and remaining there until his own death in 1712. This arrangement created a rumour that the younger Thomas Pengelly was his son. Legal and political career Pengelly, was apprenticed as a clerk in an Attorney at Law’s office in London in 1691 aged 16, and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1692. He was Called to the Bar on 24 November 1700, and in 1710 he was created a Serjeant-at-law. By 1720 he was regarded as one of the leading Advocates practising in Westminster Hall where he was widely known as an authority in Corporate law. By 1717 Pengelly had become the foremost legal adviser to the Duke of Somerset, and during the 1720s he was also legal adviser to the Duchess of Marlborough when she became involved in court cases concerning the Blenheim estate, which she had inherited from her father, the first Duke of Marlborough. On 1 May 1719 Pengelly was knighted and appointed Prime Serjeant to King George I. As Prime Serjeant he was involved in the trial of the Jacobite plotter Christopher Layer for high treason in early 1722. Pengelly was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Cockermouth in 1722. During his five years in Parliament he was involved in various legal matters, including pursuing the directors of the South Sea Company. In 1725 he was involved in the impeachment of the Lord Chancellor, Lord Macclesfield, who had sold positions to several Masters of Chancery and who, in an attempt to regain the high cost of the bribes required to buy their offices, had subsequently invested and lost their clients' money in the South Sea Bubble crash. In 1726 he was also involved in the expulsion from the House of Commons of John Ward, whom he had prosecuted for defrauding the Duke of Buckingham. On 16 October 1726 he was appointed as Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and thereby obliged to give up his parliamentary seat. He died unmarried and childless at Blandford in Dorset on 14 April 1730, and was buried in the Temple Church on 29 April. In his will he left £2890 for the discharge of poor prisoners on the Western Circuit and in London.

Biography His father was the decorative painter and village Elder, Danckwardt Pasch (1660-1727), who originally came from Lübeck. His brothers, Danckwardt Pasch the Younger (1690-1759) and Johan Pasch also became painters, as did his children, Lorens Pasch the Younger and Ulrika Pasch.Lorens Pasch den äldre, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon He originally studied decorative painting with his father. In 1714, he became a student of David von Krafft and, in 1721, went to London, which was then attracting many Scandinavian artists. There, he was introduced to the art community by his fellow Swedes, Michael Dahl and Hans Hysing. He was one of the last students of the German-born painter, Godfrey Kneller, who was by then a British citizen. He returned to Stockholm in 1728, after his father's death, due to disputes involving inheritance. Two years later, he married Anna Helena Beckman (1706-1756), the daughter of a local official. They settled into a home in the Norrmalm district. He soon became one of Stockholm's most reputable portrait painters. Much of his work shows the influence of William Hogarth, although he is also credited with helping to introduce the Rococo style into Sweden. In the 1740s, his reputation began to fade, styles changed, and other portraitists became more favored, so he reluctantly began to produce paintings quickly at low prices. During this time, he trained his children as artists and may have taught others as well including, possibly, Johan Stålbom and . He became ill in his final years and was nursed by his daughter until his death in 1766.

Gregory entered Gloucester Abbey, according to his own account, on 29 October 1237, and is stated to have lived there for sixty years. He wrote the annals of his monastery from the year 682 to 1290, a work which has only survived in an epitome made by Lawrence Nowell. It consists almost entirely of obituaries and of notices relating to events which concerned his own monastery or the town of Gloucester; but in the early part it includes matter which is not contained in the Historia S. Petri Gloucestriæ, printed in the Rolls Series. His compilation is thought to have been a source for Walter Froucester's later revision of the Gloucester chronicle. A Gregory of Karewent was dean of the arches in 1279; for the same year the livings of Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and Blockley, Worcestershire, are mentioned as vacant through the death of Gregory de Kerewent. A Philip de Kayrwent was prior of Gloucester in 1284, and Richard de Kayrwent was infirmarer in 1275 and 1284. Gregory has also been supposed to be the author of the Metrical Life of St. Hugh of Lincoln; but this is scarcely probable, since that poem appears to have been written before 1235. The Laudian MS., however, seems to contain a later edition, and ascribes the poem to a Gregory who had dedicated it to a bishop of Winchester, and it is therefore possible that the writer may have been the reviser of the older poem.

Biography His father was the decorative painter and village Elder, Danckwardt Pasch (1660-1727), who originally came from Lübeck. His brothers, Danckwardt Pasch the Younger (1690-1759) and Lorens Pasch the Elder also became painters.Lorens Pasch den äldre, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon Landscape with Ruins He studied with his father until 1724, then became a Journeyman painter. Over the next decade, he made numerous study trips, notably to Holland and Paris, where he was exposed to the new Rococo style. After his father's death, he took over the workshop and was certified as a Master in 1734. The following year, he was enrolled as one of the first students at the newly founded \\"Kungliga Ritareakademien\\" (now the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts), where he studied drawing with Guillaume Taraval, the school's first Director. After completing his studies, he was hired by the architect, Carl Hårleman.

In 1737, he married Anna Catharina Fristedt (1720-1778), the daughter of a stonemason. He made further visits to Paris in 1740 and 1741, while continuing to teach at the Academy and work on the decorative paintings at Stockholm Palace.

Beginning in 1755, he made an extensive study trip to Rome and Paris, financed by Queen Luisa, and accompanied by the architect, Jean Eric Rehn. They passed through Berlin and Vienna on their way; Holland and Denmark on their return. He would later create decorations for the Queen in the rooms at Svartsjö Palace. In 1757, he built an estate in what is now Bellevue Park, designed by his friend, Rehn. He died without heirs, so the estate passed to Rehn, who sold it to Baron in 1782.Vivi Horn, Roslagstull, Wahlström & Widstrand, Stockholm, 1958, pgs. 52-58.

The Montana Natural Heritage Program has identified a number of lichen species as Species of Concern.Species of Concern are native taxa that are at-risk due to declining population trends, threats to their habitats, restricted distribution, and/or other factors. Designation as a Montana Species of Concern or Potential Species of Concern is based on the Montana Status Rank, and is not a statutory or regulatory classification. Rather, these designations provide information that helps resource managers make proactive decisions regarding species conservation and data collection priorities. See the latest Species of Concern Reports for more detailed explanations and assessment criteria. The Ascomycota are a Division/Phylum of the kingdom Fungi, and subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species.Kirk et al., p. 55. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \\"ascus\\" (from Greek: ' (askos), meaning \\"sac\\" or \\"wineskin\\"), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. * Arctomiaceae ** Delicate arctomia lichen, Arctomia delicatula * Brigantiaeaceae ** Brick-spored firedot lichen, Brigantiaea praetermissa * Cladoniaceae ** Thorn cladonia lichen, Cladonia uncialis ** Wooden soldiers lichen, Cladonia botrytes * Collemataceae ** Jelly lichen, Collema curtisporum * Coniocybaceae ** Collared glass whiskers lichen, Sclerophora amabilis * Hymeneliaceae ** Vagrant aspicilia lichen, Aspicilia fruticulosa * Lecanoraceae ** Wanderlust lichen, Rhizoplaca haydenii * Lobariaceae ** Cabbage lungwort lichen, Lobaria linita ** Gray lungwort lichen, Lobaria hallii ** Netted specklebelly lichen, Pseudocyphellaria anomala ** Textured lungwort lichen, Lobaria scrobiculata ** Thorn lichen, Dendriscocaulon umhausense * Pannariaceae ** Lead lichen, Parmeliella triptophylla * Parmeliaceae ** Camouflage lichen, Melanelia commixta ** Chestnut wrinkle-lichen, Cetraria sepincola ** Foxtail lichen, Nodobryoria subdivergens ** Frosted finger lichen, Dactylina ramulosa ** Mountain oakmoss lichen, Evernia divaricata ** Northern camouflage lichen, Melanelia septentrionalis ** Ribbon rag lichen, Platismatia stenophylla ** Ring lichen, Arctoparmelia subcentrifuga ** Shield lichen, Parmelia fraudans ** Tattered rag lichen, Platismatia herrei * Peltigeraceae ** Chocolate chip lichen, Solorina bispora ** Chocolate chip lichen, Solorina octospora ** Fringed chocolate chip lichen, Solorina spongiosa ** Fringed pelt lichen, Peltigera pacifica ** Waterfan lichen, Peltigera hydrothyria * Pertusariaceae ** Wart lichen, Pertusaria diluta * Physciaceae ** Shadow lichen, Phaeophyscia kairamoi * Psoraceae ** Scale lichen, Psora rubiformis * Ramalinaceae ** Hooded ramalina lichen, Ramalina obtusata ** Powdery twig lichen, Ramalina pollinaria ** Slit-rimmed ramalina lichen, Ramalina subleptocarpha * Sphaerophoraceae ** Coral lichen, Sphaerophorus tuckermanii * Stereocaulaceae ** Easter lichen, Stereocaulon paschale * Umbilicariaceae ** Rock tripe lichen, Umbilicaria havaasii ** Rock tripe lichen, Umbilicaria hirsuta * Verrucariaceae ** Elf-ear lichen, Normandina pulchella ** Speck lichen, Verrucaria kootenaica Further reading   See also *Ethnolichenology *Lichenometry *Lichenology * Coniferous plants of Montana * Monocotyledons of Montana Notes Montana Lichen Lichens ","title":"List of lichen species of Montana"},{"id":"29950444","title":"Stars &amp; Stripes Forever (album)"},{"id":"29950468","text":"Mason Foster (born March 1, 1989) is an American football linebacker who is a free agent.

The population in 2011 was 1,268,Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of 150.54 km². It is part of, and the namesake of, the larger Comporta Coast region. History During the time of the Companhia das Lezírias, Comporta was a small agglomeration of 65 impoverished cabanas around a principal estate.Serpa Pimental et al. (1850), p.46-47 Until 1989, Comporta was a part of the parish of Santa Maria do Castelo. Geography The rice fields in Comporta: the cultivation of rice has been an integral part of the economy Located along the peninsula of Tróia on the southern margin of the Sado River, the region is characterized by the number or rice fields under cultivation. In addition, its vicinity within the Sado estuary makes the region a focus of many species of terrestrial and marine birds, including the grey herons, storks and flamingos. While Comporta is the administrative centre of the parish, there are several small population concentrations throughout (localities, places or villages); they include: Brejo da Carregueira, Brejo da Carregueira de Cima, Cambado, Comporta, Figueiral Moitinha, Murta, Possanco, Torre, Torroal and Carrasqueira. Economy The principal economic activities in the area include fishing, agriculture, small industry associated with rice harvesting for local and migrant workers, in addition to many tertiary services (hotels, bakeries, civil construction, sawmilling, carpentry and small commercial shops). Tourism has become an increasingly important part of this mix, with new investments into the area: the main village of Comporta has developed into an upmarket holiday destination, due to its tourist-friendly beaches and the number of restaurants and boutiques. Commercial rice cultivation was an important part of the economy since 1925, providing employment to many factories, although over the years these facilities have been closed and the management of the lands transferred to Lisbon or Ribatejo. The \\"Comporta\\" brand, promoted by the Herdade da Comporta since 1925, gave way to new packaging under the Alcacer do Sal or Coruche brands. The rice industry has become less an integral part of the community, and only the Arroz Ceifeira brand, managed by João Duarte Correia (an ex-miller in the Torrinha factory) continues to sell/promote the local industry. Architecture The historical dock in Carrasqueira, used for many years by local fishermen Civic * Residence of Estorno (), this type of home was divided into two spaces (a kitchen-dining area and bedroom) with dirt floors (the bedroom covered in wood-floors) and kiln in brick. * Fountain of Abóbada () * Port of Carrasqueira (), located within the Sado Estuary Nature Reserve () the artesnal fishing port, the Port of Carrasqueira is known for the wooden dock, built on stilts (a municipal heritage due to its method of construction, extension and important contribution to the local landscape), along with the Concheiros do Paleolítico. Religious * Church of São Pedro () * Chapel of São Pedro () Culture Portuguese handicrafts, particularly miniatures boats of wood, quilts, needlework and embroidery are common in many of the villages. Although the patron saint is Saint Peter, the residents of Comporta continue to celebrate other religious festivals associated with the popular saints, in addition to the Festival do Arroz (Rice Festival), which celebrates the founding of the parish. Every two years the village of Carrasqueira is the site of the Festival da Batata Doce (Sweet Potato Festival), as well as being the annual meeting-place for motorcyclists. On the second Friday of each month, there is a traditional market, in which the inhabitants sell handicrafts, food and other goods. The major associations in the parish are the Clube Recreativo da Herdade da Comporta (Recreational Club of the Herdade da Comporta), the Grupo Desportivo da Carrasqueira (Sport Group of Carrasqueira), the Grupo Motard Rateres do Sado (Motorcycle Club of the Sado) and the Associação de Moradores dos Brejos (Residents Association of Brejos) . In addition to the popular bolinhos de arroz (rice balls), the traditional culinary plate in Comporta is beans with rice and linguiça, in addition to the popular bacon and chouriço and coriander cooked in an earthen pot over woodfire, or the arroz de bacalhau (rice cod), ensopado de enguias (eel soup/stew) and massa de peixe (fish pasta).

From 1925 to 1940 it was the cathedral of the Diocese of Viipuri. It was also called the New Cathedral in order to separate it from the medieval Old Viipuri Cathedral. In 1881 Viipuri's Finnish parish was divided between the city and the surrounding rural municipality. The old church of the parish was left to the rural parish. The city parish needed a new church, which was built by Carl Eduard Dippell between 1889–1893 in gothic revival style. Viipuri was heavily bombarded during the Winter War. The altar side of the cathedral was hit by a bomb on 3 February 1940. Finland lost the city to the Soviet Union in the Moscow Peace Treaty, but conquered it back during the Continuation War in 1941. The cathedral had been partly dismantled by the Russians and the Finns didn't start to repair it during the war. In 1944 Viipuri was again lost to the Soviet Union and the cathedral was fully torn apart after the war.

Sir Henry Churchill Maxwell Lyte (or Maxwell- Lyte) (29 May 1848 – 28 October 1940) was an English historian and archivist. He served as Deputy Keeper of the Public Records from 1886 to 1926, and was the author of numerous books including a history of Eton College. Family Maxwell Lyte was born on 29 May 1848 in London, to John Walker and Emily Jeanette Maxwell-Lyte. He was the grandson of Henry Francis Lyte. He was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, taking an Honours degree(s) in Law and History, and becoming an M.A. He married Frances Fownes Somerville on 3 January 1871 in Wells, Somerset. Their children were Agnes (22 October 1871); Edith (30 October 1872); Margaret (27 March 1874); John (15 June 1875); Walter (4 March 1877); and Arthur (10 April 1881), who went on, after education at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford, to be assistant secretary of the Board of Education in 1936. Early career Maxwell Lyte published his first book, History of Eton College, in 1875. In 1880 and 1881 he wrote a series of papers on Dunster and its Lords for the Archaeological Journal, which were later reprinted as a book. In 1886, he published History of the University of Oxford from the earliest times to the year 1530. For several years Maxwell Lyte was an inspector of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. In 1886, he was appointed Deputy Keeper of the Public Record Office (PRO) in succession to William Hardy. As a newcomer, he was initially resented by the staff of the office, but quickly asserted his authority. He reformed the clerks' pay structure, began plans for a permanent museum, organised a project to celebrate 800 years since production of the Domesday Book and in 1889 introduced a lift and electric lights in the building. Despite public opposition, he demolished the Rolls Chapel to make room for an extension along Chancery Lane, incorporating the chancel arch, stained glass and monuments in the museum. In 1890 Maxwell Lyte went to Rome and drew up the rules for formation of a Calendar of Papal Registers, starting with those of Pope Innocent III. Reviewers later criticised the omission of these rules from the Calendar, which reduced its value to researchers. The PRO had been publishing the Rolls Series, critically edited versions of selected texts in the Record Office. Although many were of great value, there were failures and a sense of amateurishness in some of the publications. Maxwell Lyte was influential in the decision to transfer editors and funding from work on the series to the more valuable work of publishing public records. In 1892 he introduced the Lists and Indexes series. By terminating the Rolls Series in 1894 and concentrating on making guides and calendars to the records, which professional historians could now access directly, Maxwell Lyte transformed the Record Office into a centre of scholarship. He was instrumental in the passage of an Act of Parliament in 1898 that allowed for destruction of records of little apparent value back to 1660. Later career In 1908, Maxwell Lyte arranged for a new Guide to the contents of the PRO. In 1910 he became engaged in a struggle to prevent records on Wales being transferred there, refusing to co-operate with a commission set up for this purpose. In 1914, as Deputy Keeper of the Public Records, he opposed reduction of controls over access to the public records. Although personally in favour of giving the public access to documents up to 1860, for later records he recommended that each case be subject to an inquiry about the purpose and extent of the research. His concern was that the researcher might publish distorted and damaging work based on a biased selection, and could even be in the pay of foreign powers. During the planning of the National War Museum in 1917, as keeper of the Public Record Office he decided against giving custody of War Records to the museum. In 1924 he was appointed chairman of a committee established by the British Academy to prepare a dictionary of Medieval Latin based on British sources dating between 1066 and 1600. Maxwell Lyte was made a Companion of the Bath in January 1889 and a Knight Companion of the Bath in 1897. He retired from the PRO in 1926, and was succeeded by A. E. Stamp. He died on 28 October 1940 in Dinder House, Dinder, Somerset.

It is probably the most important Argentine horror film of the last 30 years, since it was the first Argentine horror film in two decades to be supported by INCAA (National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts) and therefore the first Argentine horror film to premiere in the country in 20 years, which opened the doors to directors and producers of the genre which up to that time were condemned to an under circuit. Plot A 20 years old Ariel Lambert, after a suicide attempt, is sent with her mother to a small summer town in the state of Buenos Aires. Ariel arrives in winter, a time of the year in which the village is almost deserted. From his room and with the help of a telescope, Ariel witness a man taking children into his house, children that will not ever come out again. Ariel tries to call the police, but given his precarious mental state, they will not take him seriously. Determined to prove what he saw is true, he set forth in search for the evidence required to prove that what he saw is not only part of his imagination but a horrible truth.

Critical reception Ryan Doom (The Joble Movie Network) Winter Visitor is an effective, intelligent, and superbly written movie that deserves viewership worldwide. It’s a good kick in the ass for horror, showing you don’t have to drop the intelligence in order to create something scary. (www.joblo.com) Catalina Adlugi Channel 13 (Argentina) (National Television) A great idea and a great achievement. A valuable film. Esteban Castromán from Haciendo Cine (Film Magazine) (4 Starts ****) ¨Somebody's Watching¨ (1988) directed by Horacio Maldonado and Gustavo Cova, was the last Argentine horror film released in theaters in Argentina. Winter Visitor break this streak of 20 years and is probably responsible for attracting public attention. And Winter Visitor does through a careful reading of the best horror film from North American. (www.haciendocine.com) Diego Trerotola from El Amante (FIlm Magazine) said: Winter Visitor weaves between moody thriller and Gore, between suspense and graphic violence. The film does not delights with any of these topics. Moving skillfully between the two, the film manages to concentrate an essence of horror is worth developing. We hope that this is the beginning of horror genre in Argentina. (www.elamantecine.com) Hugo Zapata (Cinesargentinos) I can write a long list mentioning Hollywood horror films and compare to Winter Visitor, the Argentine film wins. Enrique Martínez Terrorifilo (Uruguay)) said: \\"Winter Visitor\\" is a horror film made in Argentina that caused a great impression on the author of these lines. The reasons for such a good concept is due to the suspense and tension masterfully created and also the sensitivity the director takes in developing the characters.

The history of regulating doctors in the UK dates back around 600 years. The earliest licensing procedures were administered by the Church, with professional associations and universities also playing a role. Modern regulation of doctors is carried out by the General Medical Council. Early licensing The earliest reference to medical regulation in the UK dates from 1421, when physicians petitioned parliament to ask that nobody without appropriate qualifications be allowed to practise medicine. The doctors said that unqualified practitioners caused \\"great harm and slaughter of many men\\". Despite agreement in principle from parliament, little more appeared to happen until 1511, when a statute placed regulation of the medical profession in the hands of the bishops. John Raach wrote that \\"the Church was apparently considered the one institution whose influence was extensive and potent enough to be effective in suppressing quacks and licensing the members of the medical profession\\". Raach further suggested that as a learned profession, medicine \\"could not be relegated to regulation by the average county official\\". Clerics, often the most highly educated members of society, were better suited to the task. Medicine and religion were also closely entwined: healing had long been associated with the supernatural, while the events of birth and death involved both medics and clerics. The purpose of the 1511 statute was to eliminate unqualified practitioners, and to that end it provided for a financial reward for those who reported them. In 1518, the College of Physicians was founded and took over licensing of doctors in London. The college was founded by physicians themselves, meaning that in London the licensing of medicine was in the hands of the profession, rather than the bishop. Various disputes arose between the college, universities, and bishops over their authority to license and recognise each other's qualifications. As doctors often covered large areas, crossing diocesan boundaries, they often required licenses from several bishops. At some point – it is unclear precisely when – archbishops were empowered to issue licenses for multiple dioceses. In the early seventeenth century, nearly a quarter of doctors received their licenses from archbishops. Apothecaries Act 1815 The Apothecaries Act introduced compulsory apprenticeship and formal qualifications for apothecaries, in modern terms general practitioners, under the license of the Society of Apothecaries. General Medical Council The Medical Act 1858 marks the start of the modern period of medical regulation in the UK. The purpose of the Act was to create the body now known as the General Medical Council – then known as The General Council of Medical Education and Registration of the United Kingdom. Explaining its purpose, the Act says \\"it is expedient that Persons requiring Medical Aid should be enabled to distinguish qualified from unqualified Practitioners\\". The Act created the position of Registrar of the General Medical Council – an office still in existence today – whose duty is to keep up-to-date records of those registered to practise medicine and to make them publicly available. The 1950 Medical Act introduced disciplinary boards and a right of appeal to the General Medical Council. It formally renamed the council to the name that had informally been used for some time: the General Medical Council.Hansard, HL, 18 April 1950 It also introduced a compulsory year of training for doctors after their university qualification, a training position which has developed into the current Foundation House Officer role. Summing up the Act, the British Medical Journal wrote, \\"In future, the GMC will be possessed of wider powers, improved machinery, and a better status, all serving to ensure the continued and enhanced confidence of the profession and the public alike.\\" The Medical Act 1983 provides the current statutory basis for the General Medical Council's functions. The council is also bound by laws that implement a European directive on mutual recognition of professional qualifications from European Economic Area countries.

Opened in 1886, it forms part of the Chivasso–Ivrea–Aosta railway, and is also a junction station for a branch line to nearby Pré-Saint-Didier, in the Valdigne, on the way towards Courmayeur. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services to and from the station are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Aosta railway station is situated in the southern part of the city, a few hundred metres (yards) from the central Émile Chanoux square (town hall square), to which it is linked by Avenue Conseil des Commis. Features The station has recently been renovated. It is composed of a single building with ticketing, waiting rooms, a cafe bar, a bistro restaurant and a tobacconist. A minor building, adjacent to the main one, is the headquarters of the railway police. The station yard has eight tracks, of which five are dedicated to passenger trains, and faced by platforms equipped with steel canopies. Recently, Centrostazioni fitted the platforms and the subway to Via Paravera with illuminated signs indicating destinations and schedules. There is no goods shed at the station. In recent years, the only goods traffic passing through the station has been consignments of slate, widely used for roofing in the Aosta Valley, and cargoes of waste, particularly of scrap metal, from Cogne Aciers spéciaux (CAS), a steelworks located near the station. The scrap metal was destined for foundries, and was transported several days a week by goods trains hauled by two D345 class diesel locomotives (one at each end of the train) or the new D242 class diesel locomotives. Until 2001-2002, the station was managed in collaboration with military railway engineers (who were involved in the management of the Chivasso–Aosta railway). Train services The station is served by the following services: *Regional services (Treno regionale) Pré-Saint-Didier - Aosta *Regional services (Treno regionale) Aosta - Ivrea Passenger and train movements The station has about one million passenger movements each year. It is used mainly by students attending colleges in the Aosta Valley, by commuters and by tourists. The main destinations for passengers are Turin, Chivasso, Ivrea and Pré-Saint-Didier. Interchange Innocent Manzetti square, in front of the station, is the terminus for the majority of Aosta's urban and suburban bus lines. Near the square is the Georges Carrel parking station, and Aosta bus station, the terminus of the bus lines of the SAVDA company.

The Counts of Freiburg were the descendants of Count Egino of Urach (d. 1236/7). They ruled over the city of Freiburg and the Breisgau (within the Margraviate of Baden) between approximately 1245 and 1368.  History  The Margraviate of Baden had detached itself from the Duchy of Swabia in the 12th century under the House of Zähringen. The Zähringer were extinct in 1218, with the death of Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen, to the benefit of the House of Baden, represented by Herman V, Margrave of Baden-Baden (r. 1190-1243). The Counts of Freiburg were the descendants of Count Egino of Urach (1168-1237) who was the son of Agnes of Zähringen and a potential heir to the Zähringer estates and fortunes. His son was Konrad I (1236-1272), under whose reign a division of the estate with the princely house of Fürstenberg took place, sometime before 1245. In 1272 a son of Egino II's, Heinrich, received the southern territories, which included Badenweiler. By 1303, the counts from Heinrich's line had died out without leaving any male descendants. Their territory became the property of the Counts of Straßberg, who had married into their line. In 1385, under the rule of Konrad III, the property was given back to the descendants of the Counts of Freiburg. In 1368, the town Freiburg came under the dominion of the House of Habsburg. Until 1368, this family of counts reigned over Freiburg, though their reign was never undisputed. In 1368, the city councillors of Freiburg ransomed themselves. The city of Freiburg, being the Habsburg territorial city in the Austrian Forelands, then acquired territory itself. It acquired the monastery St. Märgen in the Black Forest with its bailiwick, as well as the appertaining village principalities and properties. After 1368, the Counts of Freiburg only reigned over their estates around Castle Neuenstein in Badenweiler located south of Freiburg. Johann, the last Count of Freiburg, bequeathed his estate, Badenweiler, to the sons of his nephew, the Margrave Wilhelm of Hachberg-Sausenberg, in 1444. His sons, Rudolf and Hugo, united the baronies, Rötteln, Sausenberg, and Badenweiler to form the Markgräflerland.  List of the Counts of Freiburg  List shows reign, not lifespan. * Egino I.

Additionally, the company produces four publications, Competitor magazine; Triathlete magazine; VeloNews; and Women's Running that have a collective circulation of over 700,000. They also own VeloPress, the company's book publishing division. The company was bought by a private equity firm, Calera Capital in 2012 and then sold to the Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group in 2017. History Competitor Group was formed by Falconhead Capital at the end of 2007 when the firm acquired Elite Racing, an operator of running events in the United States, as well as La Jolla Holding Group, LLC (Triathlete magazine) and Competitor Publishing. In 2008, Falconhead Capital acquired Inside Communications, Inc., owners of VeloNews, Inside Triathlon, adding them to the CGI business portfolio. In November 2012, CGI was sold to the private equity firm Calera Capital. With the acquisition of Elite Racing, CGI rapidly expanded its event production with the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon Series. In addition to the races already produced under Elite Racing, CGI has purchased under-performing marathon and half-marathon races as well as starting new races around the United States, sometimes receiving large tax breaks in the process. In January 2014, Competitor Group announced that it would cease publication of Inside Triathlon. Originally called Triathlon Today, the magazine was purchased by Inside Communication in 1993 and was a competitor to La Jolla Holding Group's Triathlete magazine. With both magazine now under one ownership the emphasis of CGI was placed on Triathlete. Later, in July 2014, CGI announced their desire to focus on the running portion of their product portfolio. As a result, they plan to explore opportunities to sell their Velo, VeloPress and TriRock brands, but plan to retain Triathlete magazine. In September 2014, Competitor Group was sued in federal court for violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, claiming that it should pay a minimum wage to those it classified as volunteers in a for-profit race.

Gregory was born about 1615, the son of Henry Gregory, rector of, and benefactor to, Sherrington, Wiltshire. He entered Trinity College, Oxford, in 1632, and proceeded B.A. on 5 May 1636. He wrote: An Historical Anatomy of Christian Melancholy, sympathetically set forth, in a threefold state of the soul. With a concluding Meditation on the Fourth Verse of the Ninth Chapter of St. John, London, 1646. To this work is prefixed a portrait of the author in his thirty-first year, engraved by W. Marshall. As he is not depicted in the habit of a clergyman of the church of England, Wood is probably wrong in his conjecture that he was episcopally ordained.

He's the father of the Cuban painter Marcelo Pogolotti and grandfather of Cuban intellectual Graciela Pogolotti. Early life Dino Pogolotti was born in 1879 in Giaveno, a small town near Turin in Piedmont, Italy, son of bakers. At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, it's estimated that about 10 million Italians emigrated abroad in search of work. In 1895, Pogolotti left his home country for New York, USA, first working as a waiter and a porter then improvising as a French language teacher. One of his pupils, Grace Joyce, a middle-class American girl, would become his wife. Thanks to Grace's family connections, he managed to become the secretary of the American consul in Cuba. Havana and the Barrio Dino Pogolotti arrived in Cuba during a very particular time for the island: after the 1895 war of independence from Spain, after the yellow fever epidemic and the Valeriano Weyler's dreadful reconcentrados policy. Thousands of farmers had been moved away from their homes, infrastructures and food sources, and the land was very devalued. Taking advantage of the situation, Pogolotti invested his wife's money in large land plots in the area of Marianao, west of the capital, and started to convert them into urban areas. In 1910, a law was introduced with the aim to create a community to resolve the serious housing problem rising from migration to the city. Pogolotti's project based on the European social housing model was selected among two others, and so was started the new development in Marianao. On the 24th of February 1912, the new barrio was inaugurated and houses assigned through a raffle. There were 950 houses, an aqueduct, a school, a cinema and a food shop that still stands today. Death and legacy In his early forties, Dino Pogolotti was a very rich and famous man, but hopelessly ill. He then decided to return to his hometown where he died in 1923. Barrio Pogolotti is historically very important to Cubans. It is the first working-class neighborhood built in Havana. In one of the houses of the Barrio, on avenida 61, the remains of Antonio Guiteras, founder of Joven Cuba, and Carlos Aponte were hidden. Carlos J. Finlay, the Cuban physician who first theorized that a mosquito was the carrier of the yellow fever virus, had his laboratory on avenida 90. In 2010, a movie was produced with the title \\"Mi Pogolotti Querido\\" by Italian director Enrica Viola. It is the result of two years of research by the director into the saga of Dino Pogolotti and his family.

Despite the impending end of the war, the battle was characterized by very firm German resistance and the presence of various Nazi Party auxiliaries among the regular German troops. Following days of house-to-house combat, troops of the U.S. 100th Infantry Division captured Heilbronn and the U.S. VI Corps continued its march to the southeast. The German situation The presence of the German First Armys only remaining battleworthy division, the 17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division, plus imposing river obstacles, gave real substance to the new German line along the Jagst-Neckar crescent. In addition, the First Army commander General Hermann Foertsch had managed to accumulate a sizable conglomeration of other troops, two battalions of an engineer school, several regular engineer battalions, replacement artillery and antiaircraft units, Volkssturm, a few tanks and assault guns, and a miscellany, including several hundred Hitler Youth, belonging to the combat commander of Heilbronn. These troops and remnants of four divisions, plus the panzer grenadiers, were all subordinated to General Bork'sGeneralleutnant Max Hermann Ferdinand Bork, 1 January 1899 – 4 July 1973, served in various staff positions before commanding the 47. Volksgrenadierdivision in September 1944, and finally the XIII. Armeekorps on 31 March 1945. Captured near Salzburg and remained a POW until 1 May 1948. XIII Corps. Loose ends of two other divisions, including the 2nd Mountain Division, were positioned on the north wing of General Franz Beyer's LXXX Corps and thus might be used to help defend Heilbronn. U.S. attack U.S. Engineers at Heilbronn, April 1945 Heilbronn, April 1945 Before daylight on 4 April, the third battalion of the 100th Division's 398th Infantry Regiment slipped silently across the Neckar in assault boats a mile or so north of Heilbronn, starting from the suburb of Neckargartach.americainwwii.com, p. 30 As the men turned south toward the city after daybreak, a German battalion, using, in some cases, tunnels to emerge in the rear of the U.S. troops, counterattacked sharply. The ensuing fight forced the American infantrymen back to within a few hundred feet of the river. There they held, but not until another battalion of the 398th crossed under fire in late afternoon were they able to resume their advance. Even then they could penetrate no deeper than , scarcely enough to rid the crossing site of small arms fire. Until the bridgehead could be expanded, engineers had no hope of building a bridge. Later on 4 April, General Burress of the 100th Division had the 397th Infantry Regiment cross the Neckar just south of the 398th's position. Although three of the 100th Division's battalions eventually crossed into the little bridgehead north of the city to push south into a collection of factories on the northern outskirts, the going always was slow. Since the crossing site remained under German fire, engineers still had no hope of putting in a bridge. Without close fire support, the infantrymen depended upon artillery on the west bank of the Neckar, but fire was difficult to adjust in the confined factory district. Protected from shelling by sturdy buildings, the Germans seldom surrendered except at the point of a rifle, though many of the Hitler Youth had had enough after only a brief flurry of fanatic resistance. At one point, in response to intense mortar fire, a platoon of Hitler Youth soldiers ran screaming into American lines to surrender while their officers shot at them to make them stop. During the night of 5 April, a battalion of the 397th Infantry crossed the Neckar south of Heilbronn and found resistance at that point just as determined. There engineers had nearly completed a bridge during the afternoon of the 7th when German artillery, controlled by observers in the hills on the east edge of Heilbronn, found the range. Although the engineers at last succeeded early the next morning, less than a company of tanks and two platoons from the 824th Tank Destroyer Battalion had crossed before German shells again knocked out the bridge. Two days later much the same thing happened to a heavy pontoon ferry after it had transported only a few more tanks and tank destroyers across. On 8 April, the U.S. 399th Infantry Regiment crossed the Neckar to the south of Heilbronn, moving into southern industrial suburbs and the village of Sontheim. Most of Heilbronn was under U.S. control by 9 April,americainwwii.com p. 35 but not until 12 April was the rubble of Heilbronn cleared of Germans and a bridge built across the Neckar. On that day, the 397th Infantry took two hill summits to the east of the city, nicknamed \\"Tower Hill\\" and \\"Cloverleaf Hill\\". These actions, coupled with the general advance of all three U.S. regiments, signaled the end of organized German resistance in Heilbronn. In nine days of fighting, the 100th Division lost 85 men killed and probably three times that number wounded. In the process, men of the 100th captured 1,500 Germans. The U.S. 63rd Division, aided in later stages by tanks of the 10th Armored Division, had in the meantime kept up constant pressure against the enemy's line along the Jagst River, driving southwestward from the vicinity of the Jagst-Tauber land bridge in hope of trapping the 17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division near the confluence of the Jagst and the Neckar. Although a contingent of armor at last established contact with the 100th Division near Heilbronn on 14 April, the panzer grenadiers had left. Assessment General Foertsch's hasty but surprisingly strong position along the Jagst-Neckar crescent had required eleven days of often heavy fighting to reduce. Despite the determined resistance, American casualties were relatively light, a daily average for the VI Corps of approximately 230. Yet that number was almost double the number of casualties the corps suffered in the pursuit up to the two rivers.Much material in this article copied from The Last Offensive, pp. 415-418, a U.S. Government work in the public domain. While the German defense had delayed the advance of part of the U.S. VI Corps for almost two weeks, it did not materially impede the advance of the U.S. Army into southern Germany. Heilbronn itself had been heavily damaged by air raids before the nine-day battle that resulted in the city's capture by U.S. forces, but the urban nature of the battle undoubtedly resulted in even more damage to the city.

The stated purpose of the operation was to \\"root out and expose\\" investment scams within the U.S. and to educate the public. It was announced that the operation involved 343 criminal cases with damages of $8.3 billion and 189 civil cases with damages of $2.1 billion; more than 120,000 victims were affected. Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force The inter-agency task force was set up by President Barack Obama in November 2009 to supersede President George W Bush's Corporate Fraud Task Force. At the December 6, 2010, press conference, participating agencies were represented by Attorney General Eric Holder for the United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Executive Assistant Director Shawn Henry, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Director of Enforcement Robert Khuzami, U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Chief Postal Inspector Guy Cottrell, Deputy Chief Rick Raven of the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS- CI), and Acting Director of Enforcement Vince McGonagle of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Other participating agencies included the U.S. Secret Service and the National Association of Attorneys General. Scope of the investigation On December 6, 2010, the Task Force went public announcing that it had examined scams targeting individual investors, not complex corporate fraud issues. In each case individual investors entrusted their money to individuals who presented \\"investment opportunities\\" promising superior returns. These investments were either fictitious or different from those claimed, and often involved Ponzi schemes. Affinity fraud was directed at the savings of trusting but often uninformed people. Scams included fraud in commodities, real estate, foreign exchanges, business opportunities, and market manipulation (such as pump and dump). Khuzami explained that \\"fraud by well-known companies or high-profile executives gets the biggest headlines, but other scams are equally devastating to hard working families and retirees\\", and stressed that law enforcement will \\"pursue fraud in whatever form.\\" Operation Broken Trust included cases that were investigated already during the Bush administration or before the formation of the task force, and many were well on the way to completion before the sweep began. Also, the mixing of criminal cases and civil cases led to overlap and double counting in the number of defendants, victims, and losses. Reaction Reactions to Holder's announcement about Operation Broken Trust were framed by the apparent lack of governmental efforts of prosecuting individuals who may bear responsibility for the 2008 financial crisis, specifically since nobody at Lehman, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs (other than Fabrice Tourre) has been charged criminally. Thus it was criticized as allocating resources to the wrong arena, described as a \\"sideshow\\", and going for the \\"little fish\\". It was opined that rather than focusing on small-time operators, the government should prosecute individuals for their role in the 2008 financial crisis even if guilty verdicts were not assured; court proceedings would allow for transparency, serve as a deterrent, and provide lessons on how to prevent future grand scale fraud. Results At the time of the announcement on December 6, 2012 eighty-seven defendants had received prison sentences that in some cases exceeded 20 years. Particular prosecutions include Palm Polo Holdings Ltd, which was found not guilty after being charged with violations of the Clean Water Act A former army captain was convicted of Honest Services fraud for taking bribes in Iraq.

It is sometimes referred to as the Herefordshire Redstreak or Old Redstreak to distinguish it from later-developed varieties, such as the Somerset Redstreak, with a similar name. History The variety is traditionally said to have first appeared in the early 17th century; John Evelyn recorded that it was originally named the \\"Scudamore Crab\\", having first been intensively planted by the diplomat and politician John Scudamore, 1st Viscount Scudamore.Hogg, R. British pomology; or, The history, description, classification, and synonymes, of the fruits and fruit trees of Great Britain. Vo.1: the apple, 1851, p.165 Scudamore's efforts in improving and raising fruit trees on his estate at Holme Lacy were an attempt to match the superior French cider available at the time.Juniper & Madderly, The story of the apple, Timber Press, 2006, p.166 Scudamore had been ambassador to France, and supposedly raised this apple from a pip brought back from there. During the 17th century, the Redstreak (as the apple was later to become known) became celebrated as the finest cider apple variety in England, and was the source of Herefordshire's reputation as the premier cider-producing region in the country.Mac, F. Ciderlore: cider in the three counties, Logaston, 2003, p.2 Scudamore himself assisted in popularising the drink, having tall, elegant glasses for it engraved with his and the royal arms, and setting up large-scale production at Holme Lacy, where the cider was bottled and kept in water-cooled cellars.Atherton, I. Ambition and failure in Stuart England: the career of John, first Viscount Scudamore, Manchester UP, 1999, p.55 For a time cider made from Redstreak apples changed hands at extraordinarily high prices - as high as the best imported wine - but by the late 18th century the variety was already in decline. By the 19th century the Redstreak was reported to be almost extinct, much like the Styre, another formerly well-known cider apple variety that had suffered from an apparent decline in quality and productiveness. Thomas Knight's Pomona Herefordiensis (1811), noted that \\"trees of the Red-streak can now no longer be propagated; and the fruit, like the trees, is affected by the debilitated old age of the variety, and has in a very considerable degree, survived those qualities to which it was owing its former fame\\". This decline may have occurred in older apple cultivars as viruses gradually built up in their tissues over time and were transferred during propagation, with increasing negative effects on productiveness, vigour and even flavour.Martell, C. Native Apples of Gloucestershire , p.130 \\"Herefordshire Redstreak\\" apples are currently available from some nurseries, but it is unclear whether these are related to the original variety, which may now be extinct. Characteristics William Marshall, in his late 18th-century Observations on the Management of Orchards and Fruit Liquor in Herefordshire, noted that only a \\"few old trees\\" of the Old Redstreak remained, and that the fruit was \\"small, roundish, of a pale yellow ground, with numerous faint red streaks; the flesh firm, full of juice, and when ripe, finely flavoured\\". The tree's habit was described as \\"singularly awkward [...] ragged and unsightly\\". The Redstreak was classed as a \\"bittersweet\\" cider apple variety, and indeed was the first of the bittersweet varieties to appear in England: the second generation of bittersweet (or \\"French\\") varieties, such as Dymock Red, were produced from it.Martell, C.

CHRA's main objectives include: * Keeping homes affordablePeter Simpson, \\"New-home buyers need tax relief now\\". Vancouver Sun, November 19, 2011 * Ending homelessness * Renewing communities and * Creating a sustainable-housing profession CHRA aims to achieve these goals through its activities, including: * Federal-level advocacy * An annual congress * Creating opportunities for members to share ideas and workable solutions * Providing online and in-person learning opportunities * Disseminating housing- and homelessness-related information to members and to the broader housing and homelessness sectors  History  During the mid-1960s, a group of concerned urban renewal professionals in Toronto became members of the Upper New York State Chapter of the National Association of Housing Renewal Officials (NAHRO). From this nucleus, the Canadian Association of Housing & Renewal Officials (CAHRO) was formed in 1967. The original members of CAHRO were concerned with urban renewal; however, this changed with the development of a national membership and the introduction of the Neighbourhood Improvement Program (NIP). As stated in the CAHRO constitution at the time, the objectives of the association were: :\\"to promote understanding of housing, community renewal, housing development, programs and policies, and rehabilitation and property standards affecting the urban environment at the municipal level, and to promote this understanding through dissemination of information on legislation and techniques.\\" During the early 1970s, the membership was limited to several hundred. The annual conference was the only regular meeting, and correspondence consisted of a mailing before the annual meeting. This changed in 1977, when a newsletter (Communiqué) was sent to members at irregular intervals in response to new federal policy in housing. This newsletter (and other activities) were limited by resources derived from membership dues and a small profit from the annual conference. In early 1977, the president of CAHRO approached the then-Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) requesting funding to establish a small national office with an executive director. CAHRO felt that unless the association had its own office, it could not become an effective municipal voice in housing. Initial meetings between the two agencies centred on this proposal; however, experience with similar operations led CMHC to suggest funding for a product-oriented agreement. In late summer 1977, CAHRO submitted a proposal to CMHC for funding of a national housing magazine. The proposal was formally agreed on in summer 1978. In the agreement, CMHC agreed to fund CAHRO for two purposes: *To produce a periodical on housing and neighbourhood revitalization and related activities *Generating revenue to recover some of the costs of the publication, by promoting CAHRO membership and activities Further specifications concerning the periodical were made. It was to be bilingual, national and published six times per year. In 1978, there were to be two issues. Furthermore, :\\"it will contain practical and technical information to address program delivery problems and improve skills; illustrations, analyses, news and comments related to the wide range of housing and rehabilitation issues and activities. It will review current resources material and provide an inquiry service to its readers who will primarily include the various public and private groups and individuals involved in the delivery of NIP and RRAP, and other related housing and rehabilitation activity.\\" Staffing interviews for the magazine were held in August 1978; by early September, three people were set up in the CAHRO national office in Fredericton, New Brunswick working on the first issue of Impact. During its six-year history, Impact communicated CAHRO's responses to government housing policies and positions, voiced housing-related issues and policies emerging at the municipal level, and published articles and opinions from across the country. In 1984, CAHRO moved to a national office in Ottawa and hired Heather Lang-Runtz as executive director and editor. With this move came the decision to create a national housing magazine that would not only disseminate information to members, but would also help increase the organization's capacity to attract new members and become a stronger advocate for improved housing in Canada. In the fall of 1984, the first issue of Canadian Housing was published. In late 1988, stemming from a decision to broaden the scope of the organization from that of a program-specific lobby group toward a more broadly-based national housing organization focusing on housing affordability for Canadians, the name of the organization was changed to the Canadian Housing and Renewal Association (CHRA).  CHRA today  From the beginning of the CHRA/CMHC funding agreement in 1978 through the early 2000s, CHRA sustained itself primarily by way of this funding. In 2009, in the midst of federal spending cuts it became clear that CMHCs funding for CHRA would be cut. The annual funding provided by CMHC to CHRA ended in December 2010. As of 2011, CHRA aims to replace its CMHC funding through budget- cutting, increased membership and revenue generation through its services.

The explosion occurred at Sheetla Ghat, adjacent to the main Dashashwamedh Ghat, where the sunset aarti, the evening prayer ritual to the holy river, Ganges had commenced, on these stone steps leading to it, where thousands of worshipers and tourists had gathered. It killed a two-year-old girl, sitting on her mother's lap, the mother was one of three critically injured, more than 38 other people were injured. In the ensuing panic after the blast, a railing broke causing a stampede leading to an increase in the number of injuries. The bomb was hidden inside a milk container on the Sheetla Ghat. The blast occurred a day after the anniversary of the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition, in which a mosque was demolished at Ayodhya leading to nationwide religious riots killing over 2,000 people. Subsequently, the Islamist militant group, Indian Mujahideen, claimed responsibility of the blast, via email to Indian media. This is also the second terrorism-related incident in the city which was rocked by the serial blasts of 2006, in which 28 people were killed, it included an explosion at the Sankatmochan Temple, some two kilometres away.2010 Varanasi bomb blast CNN, 7 December 2010.

After the incident 20 injured were admitted to BHU Hospital, 13 in Kabir Chaura Hospital, while 4 were sent to Heritage Hospital in the city. Six foreigners tourist were also injured including an Italian, Alessandro Mantelli, who was later said to be out of danger, French national Rachael, Ki Taro from Japan, South Korean Wan Sen Kim, Italian Livio DiMajo and a German citizen, Ozel. The death of the Italian tourist was wrongly reported in some media agencies, while he was recuperating in a city hospital. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group, Indian Mujahideen, via email.Pakistan-based Indian Mujahideen behind Varanasi attack: India Sify.com, 9 December 2010.Child killed, 20 injured in Varanasi blast: IM claims responsibility Central Chronicle, 7 December 2010. In an email, dated 6 December, which was traced to WiFi connections in the Vashi suburb in Navi Mumbai by the Mumbai Police, the Indian Mujahideen claimed that had carried out the blast as a revenge for the supposedly \\"biased\\" Babri Masjid verdict of 30 September 2010. The bomb blast occurred at one of the steps of the Sitala ghat leading to the famous Sheetla Devi temple, which was surrounded by devotees and foreign tourists. After the incident the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Mayawati and Union Minister of Home Affairs P. Chidambaram visited the site, and appealed for peace. A national security alert was sounded and police intensified patrols in major cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore. Elsewhere in Hyderabad and Cyberabad the intelligence alerted local police on possible attacks on Dutch nationals in the city, after intercepting SMSs opposing the anti-Islam Dutch film Fitna (Devilry) by Dutch politician Geert Wilders. On 11 December, a 50-year-old woman, visiting the town to watch the Ganga Aarti on the Dasashwamedh Ghat, succumbed to her injuries at a local hospital. Investigations The following day, Mumbai Police investigations showed that Pakistan-based Bhatkal brothers, Riyaz and Iqbal, the chiefs of the Indian Mujahideen (IM) being the brains behind the explosion, which was carried out by Dr Shahnawaz presently based both in Dubai and Pakistan. He is the brother of IM foot soldier Mohammed Saif, who was arrested in the Batla House encounter on 19 September 2008 in which IM commander Atiq Amin was killed, while Dr Shahnawaz along with Khalid, Abu Rashid and Bada Sajid or Mohammed Sajid had fled to Nepal and now hold Nepalese passports. On 8 December, three people, two amongst them identified as Shahnawaz and Assadullah (arrested by NIA August 2010 in Indo-Nepal Border), were arrested by the Uttar Pradesh state Anti Terror squad (ATS), and as per ATS sources they are linked to the 2008 Delhi serial blasts and also the Batla House encounter, which also occurred in 2008. The arrests suggested the revival of the Indian Mujahiddin terror outfit, which was dormant after the last encounter in 2008, a fact that is worrisome both for the state as well as the central government. The group however was previously suspected to be involved in the September 2010 Jama Masjid attack, in which two tourists were wounded in a machine gun attack, just before the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. In the subsequent investigations at the site, which was cordoned off soon after the incident and screened by the investigating agencies, improvised explosive device (IED) was recovered from a metal dustbin, though no residue of the explosives, remains of any circuit or detonator were found, the device did not have shrapnel in it, thus there were no burn or shrapnel injuries, and all the injured were hit by pieces of wall that broke following the explosion, all suggesting the use of plastique explosive, PETN, TNT or C4. Early results revealed used of Semtex, a general-purpose plastic explosive containing RDX and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN); however, the final report of the Forensic Science Institute, Gujarat is awaited. A writer for The Diplomat suggested that the blast not having occurred on the anniversary of Babri Mosque destruction on 6 December, and the shoddy design of the attack, were indicative of the weakening of the Indian Mujahideen due to police action.

Early life Born in Hanley, Stoke- on-Trent, Harry Gallagher, the third of nine children of Henry and Elizabeth Gallagher, was educated at Sacred Heart RC School. Finding himself unemployed in the depressed conditions of the city in the 1930s he joined the Gloucesters at the age of 18. During a career that spanned a quarter of a century he saw active duty in North Africa and then, at the start of the Second World War, as part of the British troops defending the Maginot Line in France. He was subsequently taken prisoner by the Germans whilst covering the retreat of the armed forces at Dunkirk. He was held captive at the Stalag 20A camp in Thorn Podgorz (Toruń), Poland, and, despite two escape attempts, was held prisoner for four years. Details Harry Gallagher was with the Gloucesters in A Company in the Korean action and is mentioned by Battalion Headquarters Adjutant, Sir General Anthony Farrar-Hockley in his book The Edge of Sword, which covers the Battle of the Imjin River, Korea and the subsequent hardship in the prisoner-of-war camps. For his part in the action that took place on the night 22/23 April 1951 he was awarded the DCM, and the citation by Battalion Headquarters Commanding Officer, Lt. Col. J.P. Carne, VC, DSO reads: :5182071 CSM WO2 Harry Gallagher, A Company, 1 Glosters :On the night 22/23 Apr 51, A Company, 1 GLOSTERS were the left forward company of that Battalion and were in occupation of a feature commanding a main crossing of the IMJIN river, known generally as CASTLE HILL. :During the early part of the night, strong CHINESE Forces crossed the river at this and other crossings and attacked A Company with great ferocity: a major engagement developed and, as the night wore on, heavy CHINESE reinforcements were committed against A Company, and the Company on its immediate right flank, D Company. :The fanatical, heavy assaults did not decrease with daylight on 23 Apr; indeed, such was the anxiety of the enemy to capture their objective before full light – and the consequent danger of air attack – that they redoubled their efforts just before dawn. Eventually, by sheer weight of numbers, they captured the highest point of A Company’s position. Already, one platoon officer had been killed and, in an effort to regain the lost ground, yet a second platoon commander met his death. Serjeant-Major GALLAGHER now went forward to restore a dangerous situation developing as the result of this and, by stabilising the position of one of the now decimated forward platoons, temporarily halted the CHINESE advance. This task was accomplished only through complete disregard for his personal safety from the heavy machine-gun and mortar fire that swept the entire area in which he directed the establishment of fresh positions. That he was not killed was a miracle, especially considering that much of the time he moved across open ground, only taking cover when all others had obtained sheltered fire positions from which to reply. :Having thus restored temporarily the forward defences, he now returned to his Company HQ where the Company Commander had been occupied in preparation of a counter-attack. This area was also under intense fire and, as Serjeant-Major GALLAGHER reached it, his Company Commander was killed. :In this moment, but for Serjeant-Major GALLAGHER’s coolness, skill, and bravery, the entire position might well have been lost. However, owing to his action, the forward elements of the Company continued to withstand the enemy’s assaults and to hold their ground until, at length, the third platoon commander of the company was able to reach Company HQ and take command. :Twice in that morning, Serjeant-Major GALLAGHER displayed the highest qualities of leadership and gallantry to such an extent that his personal actions averted disaster. His endeavours at this time demand only the highest praise. After the Glosters’ position had been over-run, the survivors had to endure a fortnight of night marches under the oppression of the Chinese Army. Harry Gallagher was held captive for two years in the appalling conditions of PoW Camp No 2 on the Yalu River, before he was released in 1953. Later life Harry Gallagher retired from the army as WO1 in 1955, and later emigrated on medical advice to Australia with his wife Winnifred and his sons Tony and Christopher. He died in 1988 and was buried with military honours at Perth, West Australia. References *Citation by Lt. Col. J.P. Carne, VC, DSO *The Imjin Roll (Colonel E.D. Harding DSO ) *The Edge of the Sword.

Shootout Williams, a multiple-felon, who had previously been convicted twice for bank robbery, was stopped after a CHP officer purportedly observed him weaving at excessive speed on the 580 west bound. Williams yielded near the Harrison Street on ramp. After being approached by the officer, Williams or the officer began firing with a handgun. Williams, who purportedly received a gunshot wound to the back of his head, fired three rounds with his 9mm handgun. As additional CHP officers arrived on scene, more gunfire ensued. Williams then started firing an M1A .308 rifle at the officers. He reloaded the rifle once, firing a total of seven .308 rounds. He was wearing a bulletproof vest which was not impacted during the entire exchange, although the CHP fired a collective 198 rounds from pistols, shotguns, and .223 rifles.

It is a late composition, written in 1930, the result of an invitation to write a test piece for the National Brass Band Championship. It was dedicated to his friend, the author and critic George Bernard Shaw.Moore, p.784: \\"When the Severn Suite was finished, [Elgar] dedicated the new work to Bernard Shaw.\\" There are five movements, which follow each other without breaks: # Introduction (Worcester Castle) - Pomposo # Toccata (Tournament) - Allegro molto # Fugue (The Cathedral) - Andante # Minuet (Commandery) - Moderato # Coda - Lento - Pomposo The Severn of the title is the name of the river which runs through the centre of the city of Worcester where Elgar spent his childhood and lived later. The subtitles refer to historic places in the city. These subtitles were not devised by Elgar himself but were later added to the Military Band arrangement published in 1931. Of the five movements, the Fugue is a reworking of a recent but unpublished piano piece, Fugue in C minor (1923). The Minuet is based on wind chamber works written in the 1870s. Many reference books assert that The Severn Suite was entirely based on \\"old sketches\\" See e.g. Kennedy p.259. but the remaining three movements are, so far as is known, original compositions.  History  The work was commissioned by Herbert Whiteley of the National Brass Band Championship committee and head of the brass band publishers R. Smith & Company. Although it is likely that Elgar originally expected only to supply a \\"short score\\"A score containing all the music but written on two staves only : used as a reference source by an orchestrator. to be orchestrated by a brass band expert, in fact Elgar ultimately performed all the orchestration himself. Henry Geehl, a brass band composer and employee of R.Smith, later claimed to have orchestrated the piece, giving a highly circumstantial account of his involvement to several newspapers. However, in 1995 the original manuscript, entirely in Elgar's hand,Kay (2013) p.15 : the MS contains a few minor suggestions by Geehl for improvements in texture and scoring resurfaced at auction — its emergence demonstrates that Geehl's longstanding claim to have orchestrated the work was in fact fraudulent.See Kay (2013) pp. 15-18 for a detailed refutation of Geehl's claims. The manuscript was subsequently acquired by the Elgar Birthplace Museum, where it now resides. The first performance was at the National Brass Band Championship at the Crystal Palace on 27 September 1930, which was won by the Foden's Motor Works Band. They then recorded excerpts from the work.McVeagh, p.193: \\"Crystal Palace for the Severn Suite on 27 September ... the winners, Foden's Motor Works Band .. who then recorded an abridged version of the Suite.\\" It was published by R. Smith & Co. that year.Kennedy, p.350 Following an invitation to record the work, the composer arranged it for symphony orchestra in 1931, and this had its first performance on 14 April 1932 with the composer conducting the London Symphony Orchestra. The full score of this version, first published by Acuta Music in 1991, was based on a handwritten publisher’s fair copy. This publication was subsequently revised following the reappearance of the composer”s original orchestral MS in 2010.Editorial commentary in Acuta 2015 score Elgar's friend Ivor Atkins suggested that the Suite should be transcribed for organ. Elgar asked Atkins to work with him on the arrangement. The resulting work was completed in 1932 and published as Elgar's 'Second Organ Sonata'.Performance by Andrew Dewar, 3 August 2011 In 2019 Professor Stephen Arthur Allen (Rider University) prepared a new 90th Anniversary Critical Edition of the brass band score correcting all errors made by Geehl when preparing the original published version of 1930.

Ball-and-pillow structures, Merry Beach, (Snapper Point Formation), South Coast of NSW Development and preservation Ball-and-pillow deformations are a result of a physical shock that has been applied to unconsolidated sediment. This shock causes rupturing to occur in the sedimentary rock layer, which induces instability. Individual lobes caused by this unstable state break off and move downward, settling into the underlying layers. There may also be a repeated lobe detachment, causing a greater downward movement into the sediments below.P. Van Rensbergen, R. R. Hillis, A. J. Maltman, and C. K. Morley.

Both Kuenen (1958) and Owen (1996) have duplicated ball-and-pillow structures in the laboratory, which was done by applying a shock to multilayered strata. These experiments further conclude that earthquakes, erupting volcanoes, or meteoric impacts can create these formations. History The first record of these structures was in 1916, when Smith wrote a paper called \\"Ball or Pillow-form Structures in Sandstones.\\" Here he referred to these deformations as pillow-forms or ball structures.

The Scarboro Fair was an annual agricultural show that took place in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada—now part of Toronto—during the latter half of the 19th century and early 20th century.  Background  During the years the fair was active, Scarborough (then spelled Scarboro) was a small agricultural community. As of 1900, its population was just over 3,700. History The fair was hosted by the Scarborough Agricultural Society, founded on . The first fair was held on on the grounds of Joshua Sisley's Hotel, at Danforth Road and Eglinton Avenue. Sisley, apparently an agriculturalist himself, continued to host the fair in October in the years following; it later moved to taverns and hotels nearby. The last fair was held in 1936, likely in Agincourt. The fair was evidently a rather substantial concern by the late 19th century. The 1895 fair, held in Woburn, distributed prizes totalling $1,110—over $ today. A teenage commentator in the Farmer's Advocate, a London-based magazine that published until the mid-20th century, had this rather dismissive assessment of the 1911 fair: > It is only a small country fair, but it was largely attended this year, and > there were nearly eight hundred people there.

Blackstone emphasised the advantages of a civilian legal education over the training for a call to the Bar, arguing for the inherent dignity of study at a University.Sheppard (2007) p.612 He was particularly alarmed by the growing practice of sending a potential lawyer to work in an attorney's office, saying that: In Continental Europe and Scotland, the academic study of the law was regarded as a required part of a gentleman's training, but it was not in England; the aristocracy \\"have been more remarkably deficient than those of all Europe\\".Lucas (1962) p.458 This was because the \\"stylistic barbarisms and crafty practitioners\\" were seen as below the aristocracy, and not conforming to gentleman-like sensibilities.Lucas (1962) p.459 Blackstone also emphasised the need for gentlemen to study not only the law, but English law, to secure the continuation of the British tradition of civil liberties, arguing that \\"[W]e must not carry our veneration [of the civil law] so far as to sacrifice our Alfred and Edward to the manes of Theodosius and Justinian, we must not prefer the edict of the praetor, or the rescript of the roman emperor, to our own immemorial customs, or the sanctions of an english parliament; unless we can also prefer the despotic monarchy of Rome and Byzantium, for whose meridians the former were calculated, to the free constitution of Britain, which the latter are adapted to perpetuate\\". Described as a \\"sensible, spirited and manly exhortation to the study of the law\\", the initial print run of the Discourse sold out, necessitating the publication of another 1,000 copies. Later versions of his An Analysis of the Laws of England and the first volume of his Commentaries on the Laws of England were prefaced with copies.Prest (2008) p.151 Paul Lucas, writing in the English Historical Review, notes that unlike his other works, Blackstone's Discourse survived its various editions with no modifications whatsoever, showing that he considered it \\"a key statement of his opinions\\".

He was arrested in 1969 and later charged under the Sedition Act for publishing, as editor of DAP's The Rocket, a speech by Dr. Ooi Kee Saik, then Penang DAP Chairman. He was eventually convicted for sedition in 1975. Fan was then disqualified from Parliament and denied all MP privileges, including his pension. He kept his parliamentary seat until 1977, when the Privy Council upheld the decision of the High Court. Fan left DAP over differences in 1978 to join Social Democratic Party (SDP). He rejoined the DAP in 1998, during the transformative period of Reformasi in Malaysia. Early life and education Fan graduated from Brinsford Lodge teacher training college in the UK. He held a master's degree in education from the University of Sussex, and was a Parvin Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Policy and International Affairs at Princeton University. In the late 1960s, he was appointed as the editor of the NUTP’s (National Union of the Teaching Profession) organ 'The Educator', where he launched staunch and often sharp criticism against the government, particularly against the then Education Minister. He was the co-organiser of the 1967 nationwide teachers' strike, which helped to bring about equal pay for women, as well as pension, housing and health benefits for all teachers. Due to his leadership in the NUTP he was sent off from Kuala Lumpur to schools in rural areas like in Kuala Lipis and Temerloh, Pahang and Tanah Merah, Kelantan. Political career He contested and won on a DAP ticket in Kampar, Perak in the 1969 general election. In the 1974 general election, he daringly took on PPP founding president S. P. Seenivasagam in Menglembu parliamentary seat as well as unionist and former MTUC secretary-general V. David in the Petaling Jaya state seat. Fan won both seats and came to be known as a 'giant slayer'. Fan was also famed for his firebrand oratory style. Fan's political career was marred by many trials and tribulations, including his infamous conviction under the Sedition Act in 1975 and subsequent disqualification from the Menglembu parliamentary seat. Fan was disqualified after he was fined RM2,000 in default six months’ jail for publishing a seditious speech by the then Penang DAP chairman Dr Ooi Kee Siak the in party organ The Rocket. A two- term MP and a sterling leader of society, he was denied even his basic right to an MP pension. To make ends meet, Fan became a freelance writer and would occasionally conduct lectures for students. Published works Throughout his life, he continued to write prolifically on political and social issues and campaign for human rights and the cause of justice. His books include 'If We Love This Country' (1988), 'Oppressors and Apologists' (1988), 'The UMNO Drama: Power Struggles in Malaysia' (1989), 'The Rape of Law' (1990), and 'Anwar Saga: Malaysia on Trial' (1999). He also co-authored, with A. Rajaguru, 'The Neverending Quest: The teachers' struggle for dignity and excellence' (1994). Personal Life and Death He lived in the city of Ipoh, Malaysia. Fan lived out the final days of his life close to his wife, Dr. Noeleen Heyzer and twin daughters in Bangkok.

He was the elder brother of Christopher Grene. After studying humanities in the college of the English Jesuits at St. Omer, he was admitted to the society in 1638. In 1642 he was a professor in the college at Liege, and he held important offices in other establishments belonging to the English Jesuits on the continent. In 1653 he was stationed in Oxfordshire. He was solemnly professed of the four vows on 3 December 1654. After passing twelve years on the mission he was recalled to Watten, near Saint-Omer, to take charge of the novices. He died there on 2 October 1667, leaving behind him the reputation of an eminent classic, historian, philosopher, and divine. His works are: *‘An Answer to the Provincial Letters published by the Jansenists, under the name of Lewis Montalt, against the Doctrine of the Jesuits and School Divines,’ Paris, 1659, 8vo.

Shiri is one example of a Korean blockbuster film.  Meaning  The meaning of \\"blockbuster\\" is originally from the Second World War. The term arose during World War II as a large bomb, so powerful that it was capable of destroying an entire city block of buildings. After the war ended, \\"blockbuster\\" was adopted by the advertising industry including film industry in the 1950s and added it to their arsenal of superlatives alongside \\"astounding,\\" \\"incredible\\" and \\"revolutionary.\\" Thus, the term is used to represent big impact that a film brings to film industry. In Hollywood, blockbuster films first came out in 1950s, supported by enormous amount of money. Starting from Jaws and followed by Star Wars, blockbuster films in Hollywood became very influential. With better equipment, techniques and famous actors, films attracted many people and brought a big financial success.  History  In 1985, South Korea made the fifth amendment to Cinema Law. It switched the industry from an approval system to a registration system. At the time there were very few groups producing and creating films but then newer companies began to rise with the introduction to this amendment. Even with the amendment and more domestic movies being produced, Hollywood movies still dominated Korean Cinema. Then as a reaction to improve domestic film’s success in 1993 a domestic quota started to become enforced which ensured that domestic films would be screened for at least 146 days a year. But domestic films continued to have a lower market share compared to foreign films. In 1999, Shiri marked a change in the Korean film industry when it defeated Titanic creating change for a rise in the appeal of domestic films. A Korean film scholar even describes the box office competition as a war between South Korea and the US. After the success, there was a rise in national sentiment in choosing domestic films over foreign ones. Shiri was also one of the first budget films whose budget was taken care of by Samsung. Kang Je Gyu mentioned in an interview that after Shiri, people saw filmmaking as a business and the value towards it. Chaebol companies like Samsung began to join in on the film industry around 1992 and with the success of Shiri, were willing to invest more. Chaebols then became involved in the entire processes of the film industry especially helping the distribution. It also helped that with a new leadership in government there was more interest in making films a cultural product to be shared overseas who provided incentives to create and invest in films. The distribution of domestic films became higher because Chaebols wanted more people to watch the movies that they invested in which caused them to create multiplex cinemas. Shiri featured shootouts on urban streets, exploding buildings, car chases, ticking bombs, and other narrative and visual clichés of big-budget action films from Hollywood. At the same time, it incorporated a melodramatic love story, which was very common and popular theme in Korean films and dramas. The film borrowed liberally from the model of the Hollywood blockbusters, but in addressing Korean themes it sought to be recognized and accepted as a local work. It offered big budget spectacle, special effects, star power, and a politically resonant theme. These factors turned the film into something more special than imported Hollywood blockbuster films, and the film became one of the most popular films in Korea and was successful financially. Shiri’s most lasting effect may have been to impart to the industry a sense of expanding possibilities and self-confidence because it opened a door for Korean blockbuster films. After the release of Shiri, it allowed for more blockbusters to come out and continued because of interest and a future of possible investments. Blockbuster production halted after a few losses but then saw another rise in 2004 with the release of Taegukgi and Silmido. With the confidence that Korean films can compete against Hollywood films, other blockbuster films started to come out. The second blockbuster film that had a big impact and success was JSA. JSA featured a well-known cast, a large budget, and a politically timely theme centered on North-South relations. If Shiri more obviously utilized Hollywood conventions to stage and explore Korea-specific themes, JSA displays a wider range of influences in presenting its complex story. One of important milestones that JSA achieved was that it used the unique theme, which could not be found in Hollywood films. JSA differentiated itself from Hollywood blockbuster films and established its own genre. It was with Shiri and JSA, both of which staked early claims to blockbuster status in their pre-releasing marketing that the concept of the Korean blockbuster began to take shape.  Rise of a new generation  During the Korean blockbuster era, the members of the 386 generation emerged as leading directors of blockbuster movies. The directors of 386 Generation specifically filled this role as they had film education backgrounds and even some were educated abroad. Because of changing governments they also did not have to worry about censorship. They also helped influence the common themes that were present in blockbuster movies. Due to them growing up in a more political tumultuous time in Korea, they were allowed to explore themes that could have not happened before with censorship. Another aspect is this generation also tried to incorporate their own culture into their movies. They have been known to use their culture and history for their own commercial gain. Kang Je Gyu and Park Chan Wook who directed some important Korean blockbuster movies like Shiri and Joint Security Area are part of this generation. Other notable names are Bong Joon Ho, Kim Sung Su and Kwak Kyu Taek who were also directors of early blockbuster films.  Common themes  In the time of Korean blockbusters, anti-Americanism and national division are popular themes used by the directors. These themes differ from other cinemas and appeal to the history and current issues of the Korean people.  National division  Joint Security Area, Shiri and Taegukgi, Welcome to Dongmakgol are notable blockbuster films that touch upon the division of Korea. They all deal with the North Korea and South Korea's relationship with each other. JSA, Shiri, Taegukgi and Welcome to Dongmakgol have a common theme of brotherhood. Characters can be brothers, co-workers, soldiers but all develop or already share a strong relationship. With the rise of blockbuster movies, the directors choose to view their post-war life as a tragedy and choose to humanize the North Koreans. Most characters as well do not have a happy ending. The broken relationships between bonds of the characters is supposedly an allegory to the division between two countries that once were one.  Anti-Americanism  A prime example of this theme is The Host by director Bong Joon Ho. His blockbuster movie was inspired by a real life case where a mortician employed by the US Air Force ordered to dump toxic embalming fluid down the drain. This drain led to the Han River which caused a controversy. Cho Jin Hee explains that in the film The Host, there are inferences and allusions to the US presence in South Korea. The film even begins with a scene similar to the actual case. However, Nikki Lee points out that although it uses a real-life incident, the Host is not overtly political or nationalistic and does not take a particular stance. Bong Joon Ho himself however even admits that the anti-American element was not a focus of the film but he feels that the South Korean audiences and few critics enjoyed it.

He was the oldest among Wang Jian's 120 adoptive sons and considered himself a potential successor to Wang Jian. In 908, Wang Jian, angry over his arrogance, had him put to death.  Background  It is not known when Wang Zongji was born. He was said to be from Hong Prefecture (洪州, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) and had the surname of Gan. When Wang Jian was still a soldier at Zhongwu Circuit (忠武, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), he captured Wang Zongji; he then adopted and raised Wang Zongji as his own son.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (十國春秋), vol. 39.  Service under Wang Jian during Tang Dynasty  Later, during Wang Jian's campaigns that eventually allowed him to gain control of the modern Sichuan and Chongqing region, Wang Zongji served under him with distinction. As a result, in 899, when, under Wang Jian's request, five prefectures were carved out of Dongchuan Circuit (東川, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), which Wang Jian had just conquered by defeating Gu Yanhui, to establish a new Wuxin Circuit (武信, headquartered in modern Suining, Sichuan), Wang Zongji was made its military governor (Jiedushi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. In 901, after the powerful eunuch Han Quanhui forced then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong of Tang to leave Chang'an to go to the territory of Han's ally Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), whom Emperor Zhaozong's chancellor Cui Yin had just summoned in order to carry out Cui's plot of slaughtering the eunuchs (and whose plot Han was reacting to), attacked Fengxiang to try to recapture the emperor. Both Li and Zhu sought aid from Wang Jian. Wang Jian tried to play both sides by outwardly agreeing with Zhu and rebuking Li, but sent secret messengers to Fengxiang to encourage Li to hold out — while sending Wang Zongji and another adoptive son, Wang Zongdi, north to attack Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), which Li possessed at the time.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. In 902, Li's adoptive son Li Jimi () the military governor of Shannan West surrendered it, allowing Wang Jian to take it under possession. Wang Jian initially commissioned Wang Zongdi as the military governor of Shannan West, but Wang Zongji and several other generals, jealous of Wang Zongdi, submitted false accusations against Wang Zongdi, eventually leading to Wang Jian's recalling Wang Zongdi to his capital Chengdu and putting Wang Zongdi to death.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. Wang Zongji's activities for the next few years are lost to history, although at some point he must have served as the military governor of Dongchuan, as that was later referred to as a former office he held.  During Wang Jian's reign  In 907, after Zhu Quanzhong forced Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai to yield the throne to him, ending Tang Dynasty and establishing Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu, Wang Jian, after initially declaring that he, along with several other military governors who refused to recognize the Later Liang emperor's authority (Li Keyong, Li Maozhen, and Yang Wo) would jointly attack Zhu to reestablish Tang, decided to declare himself emperor as well. Late that year, he declared a new state of Shu (known to later historians as Former Shu) as its emperor. He made Wang Zongji a chancellor with the title of Zhongshu Ling (). (Initially, Wang Zongji was the only fully titled chancellor, as Wei Zhuang, also made a chancellor, was not given a full chancellor title). He also created Wang Zongji the Duke of Jin. Soon, however, Wang Zongji and a close associate of Wang Jian's, Tang Daoxi, who was made the director of palace communications, became rivals, as Wang Zongji was said to be arrogant and rude on account of his accomplishments and his status as Wang Jian's oldest adoptive son, offending Tang by addressing Tang by name rather than by his proper titles. Wang Jian also became apprehensive of Wang Zongji, as Wang Zongji was creating a group of followers around himself. In spring 908, Wang Jian removed him from his chancellor post while giving him the titularly greater title of Taishi (). Resentful of his removal, Wang Zongji was said to continue to foster his group of followers and consider a coup. Further, challenging Wang Jian's initial failure to name an heir — as Wang Jian created his second son Wang Zongyi the Prince of Sui but did not create him crown prince (Wang Jian's oldest biological son Wang Zongren () was disabled and therefore considered by Wang Jian to be unfit to serve as heir), Wang Zongji submitted an irreverent petition to Wang Jian: Wang Jian was incensed, but did not initially publicly express displeasure. When he discussed the matter with Tang, Tang, in order to inflame him more, stated, \\"Zongji's reputation is so grand such that both people inside and outside the palace fear him. He would be a suitable commander.\\" This caused Wang Jian to be further suspicious of Wang Zongji. Soon thereafter, on an occasion Wang Zongji was in the palace to greet Wang Jian, Wang Zongji spoke arrogantly. When Wang Jian rebuked him, he refused to yield. Wang Jian, in anger, ordered the guards to batter him to death. He also exiled Wang Zongji's associates Zheng Qian () and Li Gang (), and further ordered them to commit suicide on their journey to exile.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 63.

He began his violent activity at the age of 15 as a member of the street violence groups known as kale borroka. He was arrested several times between 2001 and 2002, and joined ETA in 2005. Along with Jurdan Martitegi, Goikoetxea led the most active cell of the organisation after the end of the 2006 ceasefire. He is accused of participating in several attacks in the province of Biscay between 2007 and 2008, and was arrested in July 2008, when the whole cell was dismantled. He has been imprisoned since then. Militancy Goikoetxea was born in the town of Getxo, Biscay, although some sources state he was born in Barakaldo. His brother Zigor has been arrested several times for street violence attacks and was jailed in 2008 for death threats against a People's Party councillor in Getxo. He was released in 2009. Goikoetxea's parents' home in Getxo was attacked and set on fire on July 17, 2009. Spanish nationalist organisation Falange y Tradición claimed responsibility for the attack, which left no injuries. Kale borroka Goikoetxea started his kale borroka activity in 1995, and Ertzaintza police officers raided his home in connection with these attacks on May 3, 1998. He was not arrested and five days later he presented himself at the Spanish National High Court in Madrid, and was set free. On April 1, 2000 he suffered hand amputation while preparing an explosive device, and was admitted to hospital under arrest and later released. He was arrested by the National Police Corps on March 20, 2001, being accused of setting fire to a post office in Berango in 1997. He was released as he was still a minor when the attack occurred. He was once again arrested twice in late 2002, for participating in bomb attacks against Civil Guard barracks in Algorta and Galdakao. In 2004, he went on trial and was acquitted of taking part in a molotov cocktail attack in Amorebieta in 1998. Goikoetxea was also accused of participating in a molotov cocktail attack against two Ertzaintza officers in Portugalete on August 5, 2001 and failed to show up in court on May 5, 2005. He fled to France and became a member of ETA. ETA activity Goikoetxea started his activities in ETA in 2005. Two years later, Txeroki ordered him and Jurdan Martitegi to form a new cell in Biscay. The cell, named Askatasun Haizea, was created in February 2007, when ETA was still officially on a ceasefire. The first attack in which Goikoetxea participated was a car bomb attack against a Civil Guard barracks in Durango on August 24, which left two police officers injured. This was ETA's first attack after the end of the ceasefire in June. In late 2007 and early 2008, Goikoetxea and the Biscay cell, carried out several attacks around the Basque Country, targeting courthouses or political offices. In 2008, Goikoetxea placed three car bombs: in Calahorra, La Rioja on March 21, in Legutiano, Álava, which killed a Civil Guard on May 14 and in Getxo on May 19. He was at first believed to be the killer of Isaías Carrasco. Arrest and trials On July 22, 2008, Civil Guard members arrested Goikoetxea in his home in Bilbao. Most of the cell members were also arrested, and the cell was dismantled. The operation was led by Judge Baltasar Garzón. On the following days, Goikoetxea led Civil Guards officers to an ETA arm cache with of explosive devices in Santo Domingo de la Calzada, La Rioja. On December 4, 2008 Goikoetxea appeared on the National High Court for the 2001 Portugalete attack, and on February 2, he was charged with attempt to kill two officers and was sentenced to 22 years of jail. On November 23, 2010 the trial for the Leguatiano attack was held, with Goikoetxea facing 534 years and six months of jail for \\"terrorist assassination, 26 attempts of assassination, terrorist ravages and car stealing\\".

The resolution was drafted by France. Observations In the preamble of the resolution, the Council welcomed co-operation between the expert group established to monitor the implementation of the arms embargo and regional governments including the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It remained concerned at the destabilizing presence of armed groups in the east of the country. The Council demanded that armed groups including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) lay down their arms, expressing concern that such armed groups were receiving support from international networks. The Council condemned the illegal flow of weapons into and within the Democratic Republic of the Congo in violation of resolutions 1533 (2004), 1807, 1857 and 1896 and intended to closely monitor their implementation. It recognised that the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the country was fuelling conflicts in the Great Lakes region. Furthermore, human rights violations, killings, the use of child soldiers and sexual violence remained a major concern. Acts Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council extended the arms embargo concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo for a year, along with travel, financial and transport sanctions, further calling on all states to implement the restrictions. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was requested to extend the mandate of the group of experts, with the addition of a sixth expert to look at the issue of natural resources, for a year. The group was asked to focus on areas affected by armed groups and the networks that supported them, criminal networks and human rights violations. The Security Council also asked Member States to promote awareness and implementation of a set of guidelines recommended by the expert group regarding the exercise of due diligence by the importers, processing industries and consumers of mineral products from the DRC, so as to exclude armed groups from minerals supply chains. The resolution also asked countries in the region to ensure that no support reached the armed groups in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country itself was asked to take action against criminal networks and to address prevailing impunity. Finally, all countries were instructed to cooperate with the investigations of the expert group and to regularly publish statistics regarding the import and export of Congolese resources.

There are several paintings by Lippi of this same name. This piece is about six feet by six feet. There is little known information about the painting's origin, although it is likely that it was originally commissioned for use in its current location. The dating (c. 1440) is based on the style and the presence of St. Nicholas in the predella panels. The patron for this piece was notably Niccolò Martelli, a rich Florentine citizen who supported the reconstruction of the basilica and other parts of town. The painting is considered the first known example of a squared altarpiece, without any traditional gothic decoration like pinnacles or cusps, in order to better match the simple architecture of the church, by Brunelleschi. The panel is divided in two by a central column. It uses a geometrical perspective to show a complex architecture including several edifices and an open loggia. There are several elements suggesting the influence of Flemish painting, by which Lippi was influenced during his stay in Padua. These include the glass ampulla in the foreground, symbolizing the Holy Spirit.  Visual analysis  In this piece there are three angels with wings who have come to meet with Mary. Gabriel is in front of two other angels kneeling while they stand. He is holding a lily which is symbol of purity. The dove flying above is a symbol of holy spirit. The other two angels are looking off into the distance and not at Mary. The one closest to the audience is looking directly at us, as if acknowledging our presence. They wear woven red socks which are a similar color to their outer garments. Under this red drape they wear light grey outfits tied around their waists by a rope. Mary is wearing a darker grey garment with gold outlining and a light-colored headwear. She is looking down at Gabriel and motioning her hand toward him. She might be reaching her hand out to receive the branch from him, though he doesn't appear to be extending it out to her. There is an object to the right of her which appears to be a placeholder for books or other text. They all have golden halos above their heads with teardrop-like patterns inside. These don't seem to be floating, but rather just placed on their heads somehow, without obeying laws of gravity. Their robes are all shown with very exaggerated drapery and wrinkles, which gives this piece depth and adds movement to the figures. This is a style of painting clothing that was popular during this era of the Renaissance. The architecture painted displays a very classic Italian Renaissance style. There are two arches on either side of the subjects, and we look in through the arches to see the scene. Behind the figures there seems to be a garden of small trees and one which is almost as tall as the buildings surrounding it. This tree is positioned in line with Gabriel, who is standing directly in front of it. This may have been used to signify his importance and to make him a main subject, separating him from the other angels. The whole courtyard exhibits symmetry in the rows of trees and buildings that are on either side. The cityscape continues on in the background with churches and tall buildings poking above the skyline. The churches can be noticed by their pointed tower tops which stand taller than the other buildings. A white bird flying behind the angels is wearing a golden halo as well. It appears to be emitting golden rays from its beak towards Gabriel and Mary. By Mary's feet is a cutout in the flooring just big enough for a vase of water to fit in it. The position of this vase creates a straight vertical line with the palm of Mary's hand. This brings the viewer's attention back to Mary. The buildings and architecture have a great level of realism in this painting, but the figures' faces aren’t extremely realistic. Their bodies show contrapposto, however, which makes their stance more natural. The three scenes in the predella are similar to those in the Barbadori Altarpiece, from 1438.  Theories   Carmelite influence  When Lippi was a member of the Order of Carmelites, it is told by Vasari that he was captured by barbarian pirates during his travels. Some did not believe this story, but when he returned to Florence, his paintings were famous. He was getting many commissions from the church and they would often lock him in dimly lit rooms to complete them. He eventually escaped, though he always owed a debt to the Carmelite Order. These feelings of having his freedom stripped by the church by locking him away may be portrayed in this paintings by having Gabriel not hand the branch, which according to Old Testament references symbolizes freedom, to Mary, despite her reaching out for it.

His work has been referred to as Neo-Dada, pop art, minimalism and hard-edge painting. His constructions, built with a variety of materials and objects, deal with the exploration off visual language derived from geometry—geometry as symbol and sign. Ortman was represented by Greenspon in New York. Background and education Ortman was born in Oakland, California. His father was an electrician who learned his trade from his father, George Earl Ortman, who worked with Thomas Edison in Chicago in the late nineteenth century. His mother, born Anna Katherine Noll, was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. She came to the United States in 1914 to work as governess for the mayor of San Rafael, California. After completing high school, Ortman enlisted in the United States Naval Air Corps V-5 program. Upon his discharge in 1946, he studied at the California College of Arts and Crafts (now the California College of the Arts) (1947–1948). After several years, he moved to New York City, where he studied at the Atelier 17, a printmaking school founded by the English painter and printmaker Stanley William Hayter (1949). Later that year, he left for Paris where he studied at the Atelier André Lhote (1949–50). Upon his return to New York City he studied at the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Arts (1950–51).  Career  Ortman first exhibited in the Salon de Mai in Paris in 1950. Upon his return to New York City he was invited to join the Artist' Club, a meeting place for artists whose members included early proponents of Action painting and Color Field painting. In 1953 he had his first solo exhibition at the Tanager Gallery, one of the Tenth Street a co-operative galleries that together formed an avant- garde alternative to the more conservative 57th Street and Madison Avenue galleries. In 1954, he and actress Julie Bovasso founded the Tempo Playhouse to perform contemporary European playwrights, including the first American showings of Jean Genet, Eugène Ionesco, and Michel de Ghelderode. In 1954 and 1960, he showed simplified geometric constructions at the Stable Gallery. This work was viewed by Donald Judd as a precursor to Minimalism.Roberta Smith, The New York Times, Art Review: George Ortman, December 8, 2006 In July 1960 he married the artist, Conni Whidden. In 1965 Ortman was appointed artist in residence at Princeton University, and was honored with a retrospective at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. In 1970 Ortman assumed the position of Head of the Painting Department at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills. His wife of 30 years died in 1991. The following year Ortman left Cranbrook. Returning to the East Coast, he moved to Castine, Maine, where he lives and works. In a catalogue essay for an exhibition of Ortman's work at Princeton University in 1967, American poet, Stanley Kunitz, wrote: \\"Ortman's work could not have been produced except for an artist of bold analytical intelligence, with a sense of the usable past and an inexhaustible curiosity about the way the thing is made, the \\"sacred mystery.\\" In Arts Yearbook 7 (1964), Donald Judd wrote: \\"Some of George Ortman's reliefs are three-dimensional enough to be objects. They seem to be games or models for some activity and suggest chance … They suggest probability theory. They are one of the few instances of completely unnaturalist art. They are concerned with a new area of experience, one which is relevant philosophically as well as emotionally.\\" Ortman died on December 16, 2015 at the age of 89.George Ortman, Artist Whose Works Presaged Minimalism, Dies at 89  Awards  * 2014 : Indiana University Thomas Hart Benton Medallion * 2008 : Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation Grant * 2003 : Lee Krasner Award for Lifetime Achievement (Pollock-Krasner Foundation) * 1965 : Guggenheim Fellowship  Selected museum collections  * The Museum of Modern Art, New York City, NY * The Solomon R.

History Gherardo di Bartolomeo Barbadori, who died childless in 1429, left his heritage to the Captains of Orsanmichele for the realization, in the church of Santo Spirito, of a chapel dedicated to Saint Fridianus. The chapel was built in the old sacristy of the church and in 1433 it was decided to place an altarpiece there. The work was commissioned to Filippo Lippi around 1437, and a letter from Piero de' Medici to Domenico Veneziano, dated 1 April 1438, mentions the altarpiece as having not been finished yet. The painting remained in Santo Spirito until 1810, when it was disassembled and brought to France by the Napoleonic troops. After the 1815 restoration it was not given back. Description The panel follows the traditional polyptych pattern of the time only in the upper part, which has arcades and columns. Also differently from previous works, Lippi painted the Virgin as standing, and made her the central point of the composition. The angel on the left pulling up his garment is inspired by Nanni di Banco's group of the \\"Quattro Coronati\\", a sculpture in a niche of Orsanmichele. Another element of innovation (introduced at the same time by Fra Angelico) was the lack of a gilded background, replaced by an architectural space with a window opening to hilly landscape, inspired to Flemish contemporary works. The shell- shaped niche in the background, a typical element of 15th century Florentine painting, and of Lippi in particular, is inspired by a niche in the Tribunale of the Mercanzie in Orsanmichele, designed by Donatello. The kneeling saints are St. Augustine on the right and St. Fridianus on the left. On the far left is a self-portrait of Lippi, identified as the young monk behind the balustrade. The work was originally accompanied by a predella, which was returned to Florence after the fall of Napoleon and is now housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. It includes three panels depicting St. Fridianus Changing the Course of the Serchio, An Angel Foretells the Virgin Mary's Death to Her, with the Arrival of the Apostles and St Augustine's Vision of the Holy Spirit. 200px 333px 200px Predella of the Barbadori Altarpiece References Sources * External links *Page about the painting Category:1438 paintings category:Filippo Lippi Madonnas Category:Paintings of the Louvre by Italian artists Category:Altarpieces category:Paintings of Augustine of Hippo ","title":"Barbadori Altarpiece"},{"id":"29953926","text":"Ulysses Grant Denman (November 26, 1866 – October 30, 1962) was a Republican politician from the state of Ohio.

He is a co-founder of Soundcraft, a manufacturer which Blyth helped form into a world leader in sound reinforcement and recording mixers, establishing the \\"British sound\\". After succeeding in electrical engineering he became a professional organist, performing on pipe organs around the world. Blyth is a Fellow of both the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) and the Audio Engineering Society (AES). In 2012 he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree in science from the University of Hertfordshire. Early life Blyth was born 22 March 1948 in Chessington; his father was an architect and his mother a teacher and painter. He was schooled from an early age in Epsom, Surrey, England. He began studying the piano at the age of four years, and in his teens worked to gain a scholarship to Trinity College of Music in London. There, he learned the play the organ, then transferred to the University of Bristol in 1966 to study electronic engineering, a decision made easier because he was \\"hopelessly infatuated with an astonishingly pretty girl from my social group at home who'd gone up the year before.\\" At Bristol, Blyth founded the Student Music Society, and studied orchestra conducting; as a senior he conducted a performance of Bach's complex masterpiece St Matthew Passion. After college, he obtained a position with the Compton Organ Company in their research department where he met Bill Kelsey, his early mentor, who showed him how to lay out circuits on printed circuit boards. Compton was \\"on its last legs\\", according to Blyth, and he left to join Graseby Instruments where he designed electronic filters for underwater weapons to satisfy Admiralty contracts. Blyth spent evenings at Kelsey's Notting Hill flat helping him assemble a large mixing desk, one used by Emerson, Lake & Palmer at the \\"legendary\\" Isle of Wight Festival 1970. With this success, Kelsey left Compton to form with a business partner the professional audio equipment company Kelsey & Morris. Audio engineering In early 1971, Blyth formally joined Kelsey & Morris where he assisted in designing and fabricating mixing consoles and loudspeakers for bands such as T. Rex, Ten Years After and King Crimson. After learning the basics of mixing console electronics, he joined Paul Dobson and Phil Dudderidge who had formed Rotary Speaker Developments (RSD), a company that built custom public address systems for bands such as Roy Wood's Wizzard, and Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel. RSD made their own mixing consoles derived from a design by Bill Kelsey.Fred Goodman, \\"Keeping It All in Focus,\\" Pro Sound News, Nov 2010, p. 74 In September 1973, Dudderidge and Blyth formed Soundcraft Electronics, Ltd., based at Fender Soundhouse on Tottenham Court Road in London, \\"right in the middle of everything.\\" Soundcraft was the first company to build a mixing console into a road case: the Series 1S which was built by Blyth and the musicians in the band Rinky Dink and the Crystal Set, who brought Blyth into the band as keyboardist. The mixer debuted in 1974 and soon became a \\"hit\\" with UK bands, establishing the \\"British sound\\" of audio equipment. In 2004 Dudderidge described Blyth as being focused on customer needs through the 1970s and '80s, interested in designing mixing consoles to fit: \\"I vividly remember lunch meetings with Albert Leccese of Audio Analysts where Graham would start designing stuff with Albert on cocktail napkins; there was a terrific synergy between them ... and the things we worked on with Tom Schlum and Mick Whelan of Electrotec prior to that were just as exciting. We produced a custom board (in a light blue frame with shiny aluminium end cheeks!) for them that eventually went on to join our inventory as the Series 4.\\" Beginning in 1972, Blyth and Dudderidge teamed with Roger Lindsay to form Europa Concert Systems, a live sound company that catered to American bands touring Europe. In 1991, Soundcraft debuted the Europa mixing console, a large-format desk for concert halls and tours. Blyth's leadership was significant in the design of a wide variety of Soundcraft mixers which established the British EQ sound, including the Series 1S and the 1624 which became the 2400 in 1982, one of Blyth's favourite projects. In 1988, Soundcraft was sold to Harman International Industries. Dudderidge left within the year, but Blyth stayed to serve Harman as product designer and was responsible in 1991 for creating the \\"affordable\\" Spirit-by- Soundcraft line of mixers which sold more than 120,000 units by 1995. An estimated six million of Blyth's microphone preamplifier circuits were produced by Soundcraft from 1973 to 1997. At Soundcraft, Blyth lead the design of the original Series 4 mixing console, the S8000, the MH4 and MH2, the Series Two, and the GB series (named for Blyth's initials, not \\"Great Britain\\") which carries his signature on the optional meter bridge. He designed the Soundcraft Notepad, \\"a bit of a cult product\\" which is a small and \\"elegant\\" mixer. The Soundcraft GB30 microphone preamplifier circuit is a successful Blyth design used on many of Soundcraft's mixers, including the FX model lines which include digital reverberation effects by Lexicon, a sister company within Harman. As early as 1982 when the Compact Disc was being introduced, Blyth researched the possibilities of creating a digital mixing console. He told Billboard magazine that Soundcraft would not be \\"leaping into digital in the way that Neve has done. I think they have gone too far, too quickly. ... We are looking at the digital control of analog functions as the first step in that direction.\\" Picking up the pace in the 2000s, Blyth, together with Product Manager Andy Brown, created the Soundcraft Vi6, a digital mixer intended for sound reinforcement applications, released mid-2006. Its interface was a development of Vistonics, a broadcast and studio mixing concept from Harman-owned Studer combined with a digital effects package from Lexicon. Regarding digital audio equipment, Blyth is of the opinion that \\"companies that take great care over their analog stages, use the best internal digital format and write the best DSP code end up with the best sounding product.\\" He said that he has \\"strong views on the whole subject of digital consoles, which could fill an article with mostly purple prose\\", but he notes that \\"best-in-class analog product these days is truly excellent, but so is digital.\\" Blyth continues today as technical director at Soundcraft Studer's design offices at Potters Bar, north of London. In 2006, Blyth became a Fellow in the RSA. In October 2007, Blyth was named a Fellow of the AES. Blyth reported that he was \\"surprised and delighted\\" upon learning that he was to be so honoured, especially considering that he had \\"never presented any papers on my subject\\". He said his success in designing mixing consoles stemmed more from \\"having green fingers and a very inquiring mind than any structured research process\\". In November 2012, Blyth was honoured with a Doctor of Science degree from University of Hertfordshire, in recognition of his audio engineering innovations which advanced the field of mixing console design. Organist Blyth worked off-hours as a keyboardist in the early 1970s. While with Kelsey, he played pipe organ during a break in a Quintessence Christmas show at the Royal Albert Hall. Also a rock musician, he played electronic keyboards with Rinky Dink and the Crystal Set, a band signed to EMI Harvest Records in 1973. With its synthesizer- and drum machine-based texture, the band was recorded by John Leckie at Abbey Road Studios in 1975, releasing an LP record (Cameo Roles) and a 45 rpm single (\\"Can't Get Used To Losing You\\"), but they did not sell well. Focusing on his career as an electrical engineer and company founder, Blyth set public performing aside. At age 38, Blyth revived his interest in keyboard performance, returning to school to pick up performance diplomas from the Royal College of Music, and his former alma mater, Trinity College of Music. He performed a piano recital at Whitfield Street Studios in 1988 for his 40th birthday. He joined the Royal College of Organists, an organisation for the promotion of organ and choral music. Since his pipe organ concert given for AES convention-goers in New York City in 1993 at St. Thomas Church, Blyth has played regularly for the AES. He has played at the Brick Presbyterian Church, the Church of Saint Mary the Virgin and St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, the Église de la Madeleine in Paris, the Jesuit Church, Vienna, the Dom zu unserer lieben Frau in Munich, the Temple Church in London, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles, and at Grace Cathedral and the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption in San Francisco. Blyth consults for organ builders such as Saville Organ Company and helps tune organ installations. In the 2000s he picked up an interest in \\"classical\\" digital electronic organs, using the Musicom system. He is president and tonal director of the Veritas Organ Company.

With a population of 414,069, Sanandaj is the twenty third largest city in Iran and the second largest Kurdish city. Sanandaj's founding is fairly recent, (about 250 years ago), yet under its short existence it has grown to become a center of Kurdish culture.Geoffrey Khan, The Jewish Neo-Aramaic Dialect of Sanandaj, Piscataway NJ: Gorgias Press, p. 1.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/521720/Sanandaj Sanandaj Encyclopædia Britannica, retrieved 16 July 2014. Name The city of Sanandaj was originally called Saneh, and because it was located near an important castle it was later called Sanehdaj, meaning castle at the foot of a mountain. This presumably turned into Sanandaj over time.حدیدی، عبدالعلی. «سنندج». در دانشنامه جهان اسلام. 21/10/1387. بازبینی‌شده در 2012-07-20.  People  The population of Sanandaj is mainly Kurdish. The city also had an Armenian minority who gradually emigrated from the city. Until the Iranian Revolution (1979), the city had a small Aramaic-speaking Jewish community of about 4,000 people. The city boasted a sizable Assyrian community that spoke a unique dialect of Aramaic called Senaya. The economy of Sanandaj is based upon the production of carpets, processed hides and skins, milled rice, refined sugar, woodworking, cotton weaving, metalware and cutlery. Most of the people of Sanandaj follow the Shafi‘i branch of Sunni Islam.https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2017/11/intelligence-ministry-invites- rouhani-campaign-manager-to-stop-advocating-for-sunni-muslim-rights/ The Ardalani dialect of Kurdish is spoken in Sanandaj and its surroundings. Ardalani dialect is distinct to Kurdistan province and is spoken in Sanandaj and other cities of Kurdistan province. The other important dialect of Sorani Kurdish is Mokriani which is spoken in Mokrian region in Piranshahr & Mahabad in West Azerbaijan province.

Northern Student Movement Hootenanny The Northern Student Movement (NSM) was an American civil rights organization that drew inspiration from sit-ins and lunch counter protests led by students in the south. NSM was founded at Yale University in 1961 by Peter J. Countryman, which grew out of the work of a committee formed by the New England Student Christian Movement,Nina Mjagkij (ed.), Organizing Black America: An Encyclopedia of African American Associations, New York: Garland Publishing, Inc., 2001, pp. 462-463. In 1967, the New England Student Christian Movement changed its name to the University Christian Movement in New England. and was affiliated with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Countryman began NSM's work by collecting books for a predominantly African-American college and raising funds for SNCC. He then turned to organizing tutoring programs for inner city youth in northeastern cities. By 1963, NSM was reported to be helping as many as 3,500 children using 2,200 student volunteers from 50 colleges and universities.\\"Education: Down-to-Earth Idealism,\\" Time, May 17, 1963. NSM also encouraged direct-action protests, sending volunteers to sit- ins in the South and organizing rent strikes in the North.Mandi Issacs Jackson, \\"Harlem's Rent Strike and Rat War: Representation, Housing Access and Tenant Resistance in New York, 1958-1964,\\" American Studies, University of Kansas, v. 47, no. 1, (2006) pp. 53-79. In the early 60's, NSM's work was divided into three areas which were each headed by an executive committee: \\"the campus, the community, and the south.\\"Northern Student Movement Records, 1961-1966, New York Public Library. Work of the NSM The organization started some tutoring and community programs in the most segregated and poverty- stricken urban areas up past the Mason-Dixon line. “In the Roxbury-South End area of Boston, NSM led a voter registration drive, preschool programs, and a Black history workshop.” In Philadelphia, a Northern Student Movement freedom library was started to “have books by and about black people.” The NSM had 50 fulltime employees with different sources reporting of somewhere between 2200-2500 college student volunteers. These college students focused on helping the communities like tutoring and establishing the North End Community Action Project “that organized protests against discriminatory hiring practices.” “The Northern Student Movement: Connecticut History: a CTHumanities Project.” Connecticut History a CTHumanities Project, connecticuthistory.org/the-northern-student-movement/.  Organizational History Peter J. Countryman, a white Yale student, helped assemble the NSM in the fall of 1961 from “existing networks of the Student Christian Movement of New England.” The mission of the NSM was to \\"support the work of the SNCC and to \\"challenge discrimmination in the North\\". The Northern Student Movement soon began organizing projects in the communities of the North to fight against injustice in Black communities. Countryman stepped down as NSM's executive director in 1963 and was replaced by William L. Strickland.  Work of the NSM  The organization started some tutoring and community programs in the most segregated and poverty-stricken urban areas up past the Mason-Dixon line. “In the Roxbury-South End area of Boston, NSM led a voter registration drive, preschool programs, and a Black history workshop.” In Philadelphia, a Northern Student Movement freedom library was started to “have books by and about black people.” The NSM had 50 fulltime employees with different sources reporting of somewhere between 2,200-2,500 college student volunteers. These college students focused on helping the communities like tutoring and establishing the North End Community Action Project “that organized protests against discriminatory hiring practices.” Also, the Northern Student Movement focused more on organizing locally. However, while advocates of Black Power acknowledged the achievements and dedication of the hard working white NSM members, and a dramatic shift taken place of creating an all-Black organization because many felt that blacks really needed to be the ones determining what their communities needed. Bill Strickland, the second executive director of the NSM, was the leadman in “rent strikes, school boycotts, and neighborhood-initiated community projects”.  Impact  After a shooting that wounded NSM volunteer, Bruce Payne, who was with a group of fellow volunteers in Mississippi to oppose the voter registration campaign, sparked a visit by Dr. Martin Luther King to where it NSM all started, Yale University. He wrote a letter to the Universities chaplain, an advocate of the NSM, which he writes that he was “really heartened by the movement in the right direction I sense at Yale.” In Boston, a city that had a major influence by the NSM, other movements emerged as the NSM died later in the decade by boycotting students who protested and negotiated for the successful temporary removal of police from campuses, amnesty for striking students, and the creation of Black studies courses like the ones the NSM started provided in other cities.

It aired on December 6, 2010. The episode hints at future events, which are elaborated in the Season 7 episode \\"Now We're Even\\". Plot Ted tells the group Zoey has invited them to an art gala, though only Ted expresses interest. Lily cautions Ted on hanging out alone with a married woman. Ted dismisses Lily's concerns but when out with Zoey she tells her husband, The Captain, that she is “out with friends” instead of specifically mentioning Ted causing him to become concerned. In an attempt to straighten things out Ted agrees to spend an evening with the Captain and Zoey on their boat, but on arrival Zoey is ill requiring Ted to spend the evening alone with the Captain. Ted suspects the Captain knows he has been hanging out with Zoey and fears he will be murdered. When Ted prepares to escape the boat hits a bump and Ted falls in the water. After being brought back on the boat Ted admits his fears, the Captain tells him he is glad Zoey has found a new friend and they agree to be friends. Ted and Zoey meet up later and both agree that they should stop hanging out if either begins to develop feelings for the other. During these events Marshall and Robin have dinner together having realised that they have never really spent much time alone. The dinner is initially awkward until Marshall reveals that the reason he does not spend much time alone with Robin is due to Barney's \\"Mermaid Theory\\", that the longer you spend with someone the more likely you will want to sleep with them. Barney claimed the theory comes from the fact that sailors used to picture manatees as mermaids due to long periods without female contact. Marshall and Robin both get drunk and enjoy the evening though when they return to the apartment, Marshall begins seeing Robin as a mermaid. When she throws up all over the floor, however, Marshall once again sees her as a manatee, much to his relief. Throughout the episode Future Ted struggles to remember the details of an argument between Barney and Lily after Lily rebuffs Barney's offer to hang out with her. The argument continues at the bar with several plot holes, including motorcycles coming in out of nowhere and Barney's and Lily's mismatched personalities. Eventually Ted remembers that this relates to events much later than the rest of the episode when Lily is pregnant. Lily is offended when Barney tells her he views her as a manatee now that she is pregnant. The argument is resolved when Barney tells Lily that she can become a mermaid again when she begins breastfeeding. They reconcile, after which Ted walks in wearing a green dress proclaiming \\"now we're even!\\", which Future Ted states is the ending of a \\"totally different story\\".  Critical response  Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a rating of 8 out of 10.

The lyrics were written by Chevalier, with music composed by his brother Auguste under the name Charles Ingle. Described as one of Chevalier's most popular works, the song was possibly written as a tribute to Chevalier's wife Florrie.  Background  The song's title refers to an 1880s colloquialism for a partner or friend. The phrase has a number of etymologies; two Cockney rhyming slang explanations identify the phrase as coming from \\"dutch plate\\" (\\"mate\\") or \\"Duchess of Fife\\" (\\"wife\\").\\"Dutch house\\" (\\"spouse\\"). Chevalier, however, claimed that his wife's face reminded him of the clock face of a Dutch clock. As with many music hall songs, the lyrics dealt with poverty and gender differences. When introducing the song, Chevalier would enter dressed as an elderly Cockney man with his elderly partner. They would head towards a workhouse, whereupon the porter would separate them under the sexual segregation rules. Chevalier's character would cry out in refusal, \\"you can't do this to us; we've been together for forty years!\\" The porter and woman then exited the stage, and Chevalier would begin the song.  Reception  Henry Chance Newton described the song as a \\"famous domestic monologue\\". Laura Ormiston Chant commented that the song outlined \\"the finest sentiments of the human heart [...] in a language understood by the people\\". Lewis Carroll said that the song influenced public taste \\"towards refinement and purity\\".  Lyrics  :I've got a pal, :A reg'lar out an' outer, :She's a dear good old gal, :I'll tell yer all about 'er. :It's many years since fust we met, :'Er 'air was then as black as jet, :It's whiter now, but she don't fret, :Not my old gall :We've been together now for forty years, :An' it don't seem a day too much, :There ain't a lady livin' in the land :As I'd swop for my dear old Dutch. :I calls 'er Sal, :'Er proper name is Sairer, :An' yer may find a gal :As you'd consider fairer. :She ain't a angel — she can start :A-jawin' till it makes yer smart, :She's just a woman, bless 'er eart, :Is my old gal! :We've been together now for forty years, :An' it don't seem a day too much, :There ain't a lady livin' in the land :As I'd swop for my dear old Dutch. :Sweet fine old gal, :For worlds I wouldn't lose 'er, :She's a dear good old gal, :An' that's what made me choose 'er. :She's stuck to me through thick and thin, :When luck was out, when luck was in, :Ah wot a wife to me she's been, :An' wot a pal! :We've been together now for forty years, :An' it don't seem a day too much, :There ain't a lady livin' in the land :As I'd swop for my dear old Dutch. :I sees yer Sal — :Yer pretty ribbons sportin' :Many years now, old gal, :Since them young days of courtin'. :I ain't a coward, still I trust :When we've to part, as part we must, :That Death may come and take me fust :To wait... my pal! :We've been together now for forty years, :An' it don't seem a day too much, :There ain't a lady livin' in the land :As I'd swop for my dear old Dutch.  Legacy  In his later career, Chevalier performed a dramatised version of the song. In 1915, a film version was produced which starred Chevalier and Florence Turner. In 1926, a remake of the film was directed by Universal's Laurence Trimble. Turner made a screen test, but the lead role was given to May McAvoy. A third film based on the song was released in 1934, which was written by Arthur Shirley and directed by Sinclair Hill. In a segment of Beatles Anthology concerning the Beatles receiving the Order of the British Empire, Ringo Starr claims that during their audience with Queen Elizabeth she asked how long the group had been together, he and Paul McCartney spontaneously sang We've been together now for forty years in jest, to the Queen's bemusement.

His most celebrated work is the three volume Historical Collections of Ohio. Life Howe in 1846 Henry Howe was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of a publisher and printer, whose bookstore was one of the most famous in the country.Smith : 314 He learned the printing trade, and wrote for local newspapers. He went to New York to work in his uncle's bank.Smith : 316 A copy of Historical Collections of Connecticut by John Warner Barber came into the senior Howe's bookstore in 1838. Barber had traveled across the state making sketches and collecting material. This book impressed Henry Howe, who wrote later \\"Although born in an atmosphere of books, this impressed me more than any book I had ever seen, and I felt that I would like of all things to dedicate my life to traveling and making such books. ... Two years had passed; in the interim my father had died. ... The spring of 1840 had arrived, when one day I walked into Mr. Barber's office and inquired if he had thought of making a book on New York State.\\" Thus began a partnership, where each would travel about the state, taking notes and drawing pictures.Smith : 317-318 The Historical Collections of New York came out in 1841, and was profitable at sale of 10,000. By 1842, Howe was crossing New Jersey, and the Historical Collections of New Jersey came out that year. After this point, Mr. Barber acted only as engraver for Mr. Howe. In 1845, Howe started his Virginia project. It came out in 1845, had good sales, but was not profitable.Smith : 319-322 The Ohio effort began January 1846 in Marietta, Ohio, and Howe intended to walk across the state, but bought a broken-down horse after 100 miles. Howe always gave credit for the source of his information. With Ohio settled for only a half century, many of the original history makers were still around to interview. Howe returned to New Haven in February 1847, and published Historical Collections of Ohio in September. More than 18,000 copies were sold of this first edition, the best seller of histories in Ohio for the 19th century, besting even Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs.Smith :326 Howe was married September 1848, and moved to Cincinnati, where he wrote The Great West, Achievement of Americans, Life and Death on the Ocean and Travels and Adventures of Celebrated Travelers. In 1856, he began his epic work, a series called Our Whole Country. It was not issued until the month Fort Sumter fell, marking the beginning of the Civil War, and people were living history, not reading it. The book was a financial disaster. His Times of the Rebellion in the West, published shortly after the war, was very profitable. In the 1870s he reprinted his older works, and was often asked by influential Ohioans to update his Collections.Smith : 328 In 1885, Howe did not have the money necessary to begin a tour of Ohio, so he was the first American to try the concept of advanced paying subscriptions, selling copies for $10, four years in advance of publication. He began a tour at President Hayes' home in Fremont November 21, 1885,Collections of Ohio volume 3 : 208 and finished March 1887. It took two years before the first volume was issued, which was highly acclaimed, but sold poorly. He applied to the Ohio Legislature for assistance, and they bought 1200 copies for $12,000, allowing him to complete the three volume set, instead of the two originally planned, in 1891. Sales lagged, because everyone expected the State to give copies to schools and libraries. Howe was deeply in debt from the project when he died in October 1893. The State, in the 71st General Assembly, agreed to buy the copyright and printing plates for $20,000, due to a petition from Senators Sherman, Brice, and Thurman, Governors Cox, Foster, Foraker, and McKinley, and many others, relieving Howe's widow of debt. The state re- printed the books for a number of years.Smith : 330-334 Publications (dates not necessarily first editions)      * Notes References * External links  Category:1816 births Category:1893 deaths Category:Writers from Cincinnati Category:Writers from New Haven, Connecticut Category:19th-century American historians Category:Historians of the United States Category:Burials at Green Lawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio ","title":"Henry Howe"},{"id":"29954357","text":"Historic Plaque at the Governor's Inn thumb Governor's Inn is a historic inn at Maumee, Ohio, United States.

Originally, Smith, Organ, and Near (1983) first proposed two dimensions: altruism and general compliance. Later, Organ (1988) deconstructed the dimension of general compliance and added additional dimensions of OCB. This resulted in a five-factor model consisting of altruism, courtesy, conscientiousness, sportsmanship, and civic virtue. Construct definition Civic virtue is characterized by behaviors that indicate an employee's deep concerns and active interest in the life of the organization (Law, Wong, & Chen, 2005). In general, this OCB dimension represents a macro-level interest in the organization as evidenced by positive involvement in the concerns of the organization. Civic virtue represents an employee's feeling of being part of the organizational whole in the same way a citizen feels a part of his or her country. An employee displaying civic virtue behaviors embraces the responsibilities of being a ‘citizen’ of the organization (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Paine, & Bachrach, 2000). Employees exhibiting civic virtue behaviors are responsible members of the organization who actively engage in constructive involvement in the policies and governance of the organization (Organ, Podsakoff, & MacKenzie, 2006). Similar citizenship dimensions Since Smith et al.’s original 1983 definition of organizational citizenship behavior, there has been a lack of consensus regarding the dimensionality of OCB. Although the five-factor model Organ outlined in 1988 is generally accepted, inconsistencies still remain. Within the Industrial and Organization Psychology literature, there are two main alternative dimensions with close ties to the civic virtue dimension of OCB: organizational participation and protecting the organization. Organizational participation Graham, in an essay on OCBs, outlines a politically centered approach to understanding OCBs (Graham, 1991). She proposes that by specifying the responsibilities of citizens in a geopolitical setting, researchers and practitioners can better understand OCBs in an organizational setting. Specifically, Graham outlines three categories of citizenship responsibilities (citizenship behaviors) that citizens (employees) have with one another and their community (organization): obedience, loyalty, and participation. It is within the participation component that researchers and practitioners find concepts similar to civic virtue. Graham provides a definition of organizational participation: “interest in organizational affairs guided by ideal standards of virtue, validated by keeping informed, and expressed through full and responsible involvement in organizational governance” (Graham, 1991, p. 255). Examples of this citizenship responsibility dimension include attending non-required meetings, sharing opinions and new ideas with others in the organization, and a willingness to deliver bad news or support and unpopular view to combat groupthink (Graham, 1991). This citizenship responsibility dimension closely resembles the civic virtue dimension of OCB. Protecting the organization George and Jones (1997) provide another conceptually similar behavioral dimension: protecting the organization. In their research, George and Jones present a construct similar to OCB: organizational spontaneity. Within this construct, they propose that there are five forms of organizational spontaneity: helping coworkers, protecting the organization, making constructive suggestions, developing oneself, and spreading goodwill. It is within the protecting the organization factor that researchers and practitioners find similarities to civic virtue. Protecting the organization is defined by George and Jones as “voluntary acts organizational members engage in to protect or save life and property ranging from reporting hazards, securely locking doors, and reporting suspicious or dangerous activities, to taking the initiative to halt a production process when there is the potential for human injury” (George & Jones, 1997, p. 155). They also include safeguarding organizational resources in this organizational spontaneity dimension (George & Jones, 1997). Again, this alternative dimension shares many similarities with the civic virtue dimension of OCB. Categorization of civic virtue behaviors The construct of civic virtue has been operationalized in varying forms. On one side of the spectrum are mundane behaviors such as attending optional meetings, reading and answering work related emails, and participating in the traditions and rituals of the organization. The other side of the spectrum includes more extraordinary and rare forms of the construct such as voicing critiques of or objections to policies to higher-level members of the organization. This type of civic virtue can also be demonstrated on a larger scale by defending the organization's policies and practices when they are challenged by an outside source. This more challenging type of civic virtue has received the most empirical support. However, it has also been noted that this type of civic virtue might be less appreciated by managers, compared to other forms of OCB, as it causes disruption of the status quo (Organ et al., 2006). Organ (1988) remarked that although some in high positions may not value this form of OCB, it should not be disqualified. Civic virtue has been even more granularly defined by dividing the behaviors into two distinct categories. The first, civic virtue-information, includes participating in meetings, reading documents containing information regarding the organization, and remaining on the lookout for incoming news. The second, civic virtue-influence, involves being proactive and making suggestions for change. Results from a paper by Graham and Van Dyne demonstrate empirical differences between civic-virtue informational and civic-virtue influence, which indicates the value of examining these categories separately (Graham & Van Dyne, 2006). Civic virtue and Individually and organizationally focused OCB A different way of organizing the OCB construct was proposed by Williams and Anderson (1991). They divided up the construct into two different types of organizational citizenship behaviors based on whom the behaviors were directed towards. Organizational citizenship behavior–individuals (OCBI) are behaviors that are aimed at other individuals in the work place, while organizational citizenship behavior-organizational (OCBO) are behaviors directed at the organization as a whole. The concept of civic virtue falls squarely within the OCBO definition (Williams & Anderson, 1991). Civic virtue and gender Civic virtue has also been categorized along gender lines. Research has shown the OCB dimensions of altruism and courtesy to be considered more in role behavior for females, while civic virtue and sportsmanship are regarded as more in role for men. The dimension of conscientiousness, which includes attention to detail and adherence to organizational rules, is excluded, as this dimension does not seem to adhere to any particular gender norms (Kidder & Parks, 2001). Antecedents Empirical research in the area of OCBs has focused on four major categories of OCB antecedents: individual characteristics, task characteristics, organizational characteristics, and leadership behaviors (Podsakoff et al., 2000). The various antecedents of civic virtue specifically are listed below with their contributing empirical support. Individual characteristic antecedents Individual characteristic antecedents that have been studied regarding OCBs include employee attitudes, dispositional variables, employee role perceptions, demographic variables, and employee abilities and individual differences. Empirical evidence has linked civic virtue with employee attitudes, employee abilities, and individual differences. Specifically, empirical research has found that satisfaction and organizational commitment have positive and significant relationships with civic virtue (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Bommer, 1996a). Research also indicates a negative and significant relationship between indifference to rewards and civic virtue (Podsakoff et al., 1996a). Task characteristic antecedents Task characteristic antecedents that have been empirically studied include task feedback, task routinization, and intrinsically satisfying tasks. Research indicates that all three of these task characteristics have significant relationships with civic virtue (Podsakoff et al., 1996a). Research supports positive relationships between both task feedback and intrinsically satisfying tasks and civic virtue. Research conversely demonstrates a negative relationship between task routinization and civic virtue (Podsakoff et al., 1996a). Organizational characteristic antecedents Organizational characteristic antecedents that have been empirically studied regarding OCBs include organizational formalization, organizational inflexibility, advisory/staff support, cohesiveness of a group, rewards outside a leader's control, spatial distance from the leader, and perceived organizational support. In their 1996 meta-analysis, Podsakoff et al. found a positive and significant relationship between group cohesiveness and civic virtue. Organ and colleagues (2006) reanalyzed data in the above meta-analysis and found a negative and significant relationship between organizational formalization and civic virtue. Leadership behavior antecedents Leadership behaviors studied empirically regarding OCBs can be broken into transformational leadership behaviors, transactional leadership behaviors, behaviors consistent with path–goal theory, and behaviors consistent with leader–member exchange theory. Transformational leadership behaviors include “core” transformational leadership behaviors, articulating a vision, providing an appropriate model, fostering the acceptance of group goals, maintaining high performance expectations, and fostering intellectual stimulation. Empirical evidence indicates positive and significant relationships between articulating a vision, providing an appropriate model, and encouraging the acceptance of group goals and civic virtue (Podsakoff et al., 2000). Transactional leadership behaviors include contingent and noncontingent reward behaviors and contingent and noncontingent punishment behaviors. A positive and significant relationship has been found between contingent reward behavior and civic virtue (Podsakoff et al., 1996a). Behaviors consistent with the path–goal theory of leadership include leader role clarification, leader specification of procedures, and supportive leader behaviors. Empirical evidence indicates a positive and significant relationship between supportive leader behaviors and civic virtue (Podsakoff et al., 2000). Consequences Empirical research regarding the consequences of OCBs has focused on two main areas: managerial evaluations of performance and organizational performance and success. Podsakoff and colleagues (2000) found, in a summary of empirical evidence regarding managerial performance evaluations and OCBs, that civic virtue was significantly related to performance evaluations in six out of the eight studies it was included in. These researchers also reported, in a summary of empirical evidence regarding both organizational performance and success in relationship to OCBs, that civic virtue was significantly related to quality of performance regarding sales samples and the reduction of customer complaints in a restaurant sample (Podsakoff et al., 2000). Measures Measures of OCBs typically consist of a rating scale of items that have been empirically validated as being OCBs. Ratings can be performed at the supervisor, peer, or self levels. In 1990, Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, and Fetter conducted an important study using the five dimensions of OCB: altruism, conscientiousness, sportsmanship, courtesy, and civic virtue. This prevalent study was one of the first where civic virtue was analyzed independently of other OCBs and where the construct was given its own scale items. Civic virtue was specifically defined as “behavior on the part of an individual that indicates that he/she responsibly participates in, is involved in, or is concerned about the life of the company” (Podsakoff et al., 1990, p. 115). These researchers developed a 24-item scale by having 10 of their colleagues sort generated scale items into one of the five OCB dimensions or an “other” category if they felt the item did not fit any of the five defined conceptual definitions. The final version of the scale included only items for which at least 80% of the judges agreed on the items categorization. The four civic virtue items outlined in Podsakoff and colleagues’ (1990) scale include: * Attends meeting that are not mandatory, but are considered important. * Attends functions that are not required, but help the company image. * Keeps abreast of changes in the organization. * Reads and keeps up with organization announcements, memos, and so on. This five-factor OCB structure has served as the building block for a substantial amount of OCB research and has been validated repeatedly.  References  George, J. M., & Jones, G. R. (1997).

Broad St., built in 1904. Also known as the Ohio Archives Building or as the Charles H. Lindenberg Home, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and is also part of the register's East Broad Street Historic District. It was designed in Colonial Revival and/or Neo-Georgian eclectic style by architect Frank Packard. The listing is for six acres including three contributing buildings. It was built for Charles H. Lindenberg, president of the Lilley Regalia Company. It was later home of ten governors of Ohio and their families, during a 36-year period. In 2008, the foundation demolished the Joseph Firestone house, neighboring the organization's headquarters and built c. 1900. The house had been vacant for years, and the foundation considered saving it, but the structure was deemed too impractical and expensive to be converted for further use.

There is evidence of it having been constructed as a one-storey building in 1717, and it was later converted to become an early three-storey building. History and Ownership It is likely the oldest existing three-story structure in Marblehead, and shows signs that it was raised from one to three stories. It is currently an inn located in the historic district of Marblehead in the old water front area. According to historical research done by Robert Booth, a noted area historian and Harvard graduate, the original structure was built by George Slocumb sometime prior to 1717.Essex Institutional Historical Collection,33.84 No record of the construction itself has been found; however, the building and land was mortgaged October 30, 1717, to John Bowdoin, a merchant in Boston. This is the earliest known documentation of the structure. On March 15, 1720, Slocumb remortgaged to Bowdoin for 164 li (pounds).Essex Institutional Historical Collection,57.95. Slocumb was a “shoreman” (one involved in the curing, salting, drying and storage of fish) and a “joiner” (carpenter) by trade. On June 24, 1728, he sold the house to Bowdoin for 400 li.Essex Institutional Historical Collection,102.271. On September 8, 1756, Bowdoin’s heirs sold the premises for 70 li to Capt. Samuel Glover,Essex Institutional Historical Collection,92.381. the brother of John Glover, who later became the famous General John Glover who, with his Marblehead men, ferried George Washington across the Delaware River to attack the Hessians during the revolutionary war. Samuel Glover was also a “cordwainer” (shoemaker), as were a lot of men in Marblehead. He served as a captain in the French and Indian War but was referred to as captain locally due to his position on ship. He was also licensed to sell liquor which was reserved for only those of good standing and reputation. He apparently acquired some degree of wealth between his shoe making, commanding ships, and selling rum.Robert Booth, History of 27 Front St. Marblehead, Massachusetts, August 5, 1978. At the time of Glover’s death in 1762, “his mansion house, warehouse and land, under and adjoining, situated in Marblehead” was valued at 400 li above his personal possessions.Probate Court Appraisal date January 22, 1763, Essex Institutional Historical Collection, #11044. Around 1757 Glover had a three-story house constructed on the property, “his mansion house”, mentioned above. While Booth assumes Slocomb’s house was probably dilapidated by then, which it may have been, there is a good deal of physical evidence that the third floor of the current structure was built several years earlier than the first two floors and raised to its current location. Booth makes the following comment in his historical research of the property: “Between making shoes, commanding vessels, and selling Rum, Capt. Glover achieved a fair degree of affluence, and in 1756 he decided to buy the old Slocumb house and land, undoubtedly with the intention of raising a fine new house for himself and his family. Perhaps it was completed in time for the birth of Samuel and Mary’s fifth child, Edmond, in the fall of 1757. At the time it was one of the largest and most modish houses in town, which then had very few three-story homes.” Architecture and construction  There is evidence that the existing third story of the house was the original one-story structure on the property, built around 1717. Forty years earlier than the existing first and second stories of the house were constructed underneath it as it was lifted (raised) from the ground. View from a 1914 postcard Like many other of houses built in the area at the time, the roofs on this colonial post-and-beam was much more complex than modern roofs made with trusses, plywood and asphalt shingles. It was made with a superstructure of large, hand-hewed timbers joined together with long wooden spikes, purlins connected to the timbers, boards nailed on top of the purlins, and a covering of hundreds or thousands of handmade wooden shake shingles. This was a lengthy, difficult process which required a great deal of materials. Another reason it was preferable to raise the structure may have been that the posts in the existing structure could not be trusted to bear the weight of a second story built on top of it, especially if two new stories were to be added, as they appear to have been in this case, at what was once known as the “Samuel Glover Mansion”, now the “Marblehead Summer House”, at 27 Front Street, Marblehead, Massachusetts.:  References   External links  * Marblehead Summer House Category:Houses in Marblehead, Massachusetts ","title":"Marblehead Colonial Raised House"},{"id":"29954652","text":"\\"My Old Dutch\\" may refer to: *\\"My Old Dutch\\" (song), an 1892 song by Albert Chevalier *My Old Dutch (1915 film), a film starring Albert Chevalier and Florence Turner *My Old Dutch (1926 film), a film starring May McAvoy and Pat O'Malley *My Old Dutch (1934 film), a film starring Betty Balfour and Gordon Harker ","title":"My Old Dutch"},{"id":"29954665","text":"Pazo de Meirás in Sada (19th century) A Pazo is a type of Galician traditional house. Similar to a manor house, pazos are usually located in the countryside, as former residences of important people in the community (formerly of kings and nobility). They were of crucial importance in the 17th to 19th centuries, related to rural and monastic architecture and the system of feudal organization, and they constituted a type of local management unit around which the life of the villagers revolved. Over time they become the social symbol and refuge of the noble class, which Otero Pedrayo portrayed in his novels in early 20th century. The pazo, as a traditional civil architectural structure, had associated a social network: the servants of the nobleman and the tributaries of the domain, who themselves came to live on the grounds of the pazo (mostly the former). A pazo usually consists of a main building surrounded by gardens, a dovecote and often include outbuildings such as small chapels for religious celebrations. An example being the pazo de Cadro in Marin, the seat of the House of Romay, which had a chapel dedicated to Santa Barbara. The word pazo is a cognate of stately palace, and comes from the Latin palatiu(m). As a curiosity, the Portuguese word, close to the Galician language, to say palace is paço (instead of palácio). In this regard, the Paço Imperial in Rio de Janeiro, built in the 18th century, is an example of the Portuguese counterpart of this type of building.

The museum focuses on serving the Long Island community by preserving and displaying its extensive collection of art, historical artifacts, and carriages; providing robust educational and public programming; and collaborating with a variety of other arts and cultural organizations. Mission statement Its mission is to inspire people of all ages with an understanding and enjoyment of American art, history, and carriages as expressed through the heritage of Long Island and its diverse communities. The museum has been accredited by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) since 1973 for excellence in exhibitions, programs, and collection care. In 2006, the museum joined a small group of institutions nationwide as a Smithsonian Affiliate. History The Long Island Museum was founded in 1939 as the Suffolk Museum by local philanthropist Ward Melville, who was an active community and corporate leader. Melville established the museum with the help of his wife, Dorothy Bigelow Melville; prominent naturalist Robert Cushman Murphy; a well-regarded local doctor Winifred Curtis; and insurance broker O.C. Lempfert.The Long Island's Visitor Center, external view. The concept for a museum in Stony Brook originated when O.C. Lempfert, avid hunter and taxidermist, displayed his hunting trophies and specimens at friend Archie Rayner's home. He called his collection Suffolk County Museum of Natural History. In 1935, Dr. Winifred Curtis began bringing the neighborhood children to see Mr. Lempfert's collection. When the Rayner home was sold in 1939, Dr. Curtis appealed for help from Mrs. Ward Melville to find a new location for the collection. Persuaded by Mrs. Melville, the collection was moved to an empty building known as the Stone Jug, owned by local pharmacist Charles J. Zimmerlein. The Little Museum in the Jug as it came to be called, was formally incorporated as the Suffolk Museum on December 28, 1939. In 1948, Ward Melville purchased the Stony Brook Hotel and its surrounding property. This allowed for the expansion of the museum and its growing collections that correlated with his goals of renovating Stony Brook into a more historic-looking village. The purchase and subsequent renovations allowed the \\"Little Museum in the Jug\\" to move to a more sustainable, viable space. The expanded space also accommodated Ward Melville's interest in horses and pleasure driving with the construction of the Carriage House. Containing eighty vehicles and related artwork, the Carriage House opened to visitors on July 7, 1951. During the 1950s a number of period buildings were moved to the museum's grounds including the late nineteenth-century Samuel H. West Blacksmith Shop located in Setauket, Long Island. The shop was owned by Samuel H. West (1853–1938) and was fully operational until his death in 1938. Nassakeag Schoolhouse, built in 1877, LIM Grounds In 1956, the one room Nassakeag Schoolhouse was acquired and relocated to the museum grounds. The schoolhouse was built by Frederick A. Smith in 1877 and was actively used until 1910. Also in 1956, the Ploch-Williamson Barn was donated and moved to the museum's grounds. Built in 1794 by Jedidiah Williamson, the Ploch- Williamson Barn is a significant structure to local and agricultural history. It originally stood on 30 acres of farmland in Stony Brook. The barn was donated and moved to the museum in 1956. Like the Nassakeag Schoolhouse and the Samuel H. West Blacksmith Shop, museum educators conduct programs throughout the school year for students within and around the barn. After receiving its accreditation by American Alliance of Museums in May 1973, the Board of Trustees approved a new name and concept for the Suffolk Museum. The Museums at Stony Brook was adopted as the new name for the museum which had grown to be recognized by its three distinct collections – art, history, and carriages. Art Museum, built in 1973The 1970s also brought an expansion of collection housing and exhibition space, with the original space now too small to accommodate the ever-growing collection and needs of the museum. In 1973, this desire led to the completion of the Art Museum, which was designed by Becker & Arelt to be located on the east end of the grounds. Becker & Arelt also designed the renovations of the old D. T. Bayles Lumber Mill across Route 25A as the new facility for the history collection. The renovations would be completed in 1977 thus establishing the History Museum. The 1980s saw a demand for an increase in exhibition/storage space for the growing carriage collection with the Carriage House no longer fit to accommodate the museum's needs. It was demolished in 1985, with the exception of a wing converted to administrative offices and educational space. The new Carriage Museum opened in 1987 and provided much needed storage and exhibition space. In 2000, the Museums at Stony Brook officially re-branded itself the Long Island Museum of American Art, History, and Carriages. Today, the museum grounds are spread across both the north and south sides of Route 25A. The complex is home to seven buildings, which include the Art Museum, the History Museum/Visitors Center, the Carriage Museum, multiple storage sheds, and administrative offices. The grounds also feature outdoor sculpture (both permanent and temporary), a cemetery, gardens, outhouse, and a Beaux Arts horse fountain that once resided at the intersection of Madison Avenue and 23rd Street in New York City.

The Long Island Museum Collection.The Long Island Museum serves its purposes through the acquisition and preservation of objects relevant to its collecting interests through exhibition, research, publication, and other educational programs related to its collections. LIM's collection of more than 50,000 artifacts is subdivided into three categories – art and archives, history, and carriage. Art and archives collection The museum's art collection, which consists of nearly 450 paintings, 2,000 works on paper, and 40 sculptural works, continues to grow through acquisitions and donations. Nationally known New York artists in the collection include William Sidney Mount, William Merritt Chase, Louis Comfort Tiffany, Charles Henry Miller, George Constant, Fairfield Porter, Jane Wilson, and Lumen Martin Winter. The museum's extensive archives, housed in the Kate Strong Historical Library, contain letters, diaries/journals, ledgers, and other assorted paper artifacts that tell the history of the region and the people that lived and worked in it. Informational resources are readily available to support the work of its staff and meet the research needs of scholars and the general public.

The Long Island Museum Collection. LIM holds the largest collection of William Sidney Mount (1807–1868) artwork, consisting of oil paintings, oil studies, watercolors, drawings, and an extensive archive, including personal and family papers and artifacts. The Mount Collection also consists of artwork from other gifted family members including his brother Shepard Alonzo Mount (1804–1868) and niece Evelina Mount (1837–1920). William Sidney Mount was one of the most popular and sought-after artists in America during his lifetime and was one of the first American artists to have his work widely distributed abroad. Today, Mount is still considered one of the most important American artists of the nineteenth century. Dance of the Haymakers (1845), Farmers Nooning (1836), and The Banjo Player (1855) are just three of the more notable Mount paintings in the museum's extensive collection. Shells, David Burlick History collection The museum's history collection contains a variety of artifacts that represent nineteenth through late-twentieth century material culture, emphasizing Long Island history. Its holdings include over 2,500 household artifacts, nearly 1,200 decorative and applied art including ceramics and glass, late 18th to late 19th century Long Island indigenous furniture, locally-made bird decoys, and an array of textiles/costumes from the 1700s to the present.

The focus is largely on East Coast American-made apparel with many notable New York merchants, dressmakers, tailors, and designers as well as representation for prominent European designers, such as Emilio Pucci and Jean Patou. Designers of this collection include Rudolph \\"Rudi\\" Gernreich, Bonnie Cashin, and Philip Hulitar. The collection includes undergarments, sleepwear, lounge wear, formal wear, military/work uniforms, and accessories such as hats, scarves, gloves, purses, and shoes. The largest concentration of textiles is in women's apparel, which contains numerous dinner gowns, outerwear, tops, bottoms, bathing suits, dusters, day/evening dresses, suits, work uniforms, jerseys, etc. Along with the costume collection, LIM has a small collection of quilts, coverlets, and samplers. Decoy collection Since its early beginnings, visitors have flocked to LIM for its impressive Long Island decoy collection. The collection holds over 210 folk art wildfowl decoys made by Long Island craftsmen and other noted eastern carvers. Carriage collection thumb|right|alt=Parade Horse Carriage.|Parade Horse Carriage, Ramsey Manufacturing Company, Seneca Falls, New York, 1875 Museum purchaseThe Carriage Collection is internationally renowned. The collection comprises nearly 200 horse-drawn vehicles, the majority of which are in original condition; over 25,000 non-vehicular artifacts, including the contents of the only known example of a fully equipped nineteenth-century American carriage manufacturer to have survived in its entirety; carriage and harness making tools; harnesses; and other related accouterments. The collection also is composed of over 225 carriage-related clothing items including hunting, leisure, and competition attire. The vehicles, which Ward Melville began collecting in the early 1940s, ranges from phaetons to sleighs to fire-fighting vehicles. The collection includes not only vehicles that originated in America, but European-style vehicles as well. The European gallery showcases carriages from parts of Bavaria, Italy, France, and England. Highlights The Tally-ho Road Coach (1875) was given to the museum by the Museum of the City of New York in 2008. Made by Holland & Holland, of London, the carriage was purchased and brought to the United States by Col. Delancey Astor Kane (1844–1915), a wealthy founder of the New York Coaching Club. A canary yellow and beautifully-proportioned road coach, the Tally-Ho was driven four-in-hand style from Manhattan to Pelham, NY (and later, New Rochelle, NY) by Kane, beginning in 1876 and periodically each season into the early 1880s. The vehicle became nationally famous, providing excursions to New Yorkers of all backgrounds and was covered widely by prominent publications of the day. Grace Darling, omnibus, Concord Carriage Builders, New Hampshire, c. 1880, Gift of St. Paul's School, Concord, New HampshireThe Grace Darling Omnibus (c. 1880) was gifted to the museum in 1952 by St. Paul's School located in Concord, New Hampshire. This type of large omnibus, sometimes called a \\"barge\\" was used primarily in New England for excursions. Many of these vehicles were named for famous people or locations; this particular omnibus is named after Grace Darling, a popular maritime heroine who was responsible for the dramatic rescue of survivors from a shipwreck off the coast of England in 1838. This omnibus was operated by the Huntress family who owned a livery business in South Berwick, Maine from the 1860s to 1904 before being acquired by the St. Paul's school to transport athletic teams to sporting events. The Gypsy Wagon (1860–1885) was accessioned into the collection in 1955. Gypsy wagons, sometimes called vardos, were used for traveling, for fortune-telling, and as residences. This particular vardo (Romani wagon) belonged to Ms. Phoebe Stanley, sometimes known as the Gypsy Queen Phoebe, a resident of East Natick, Massachusetts. This partially restored vehicle is intricately decorated with landscapes and figurative paintings, half-spindles, beaded molding, painted gold four-leaf clovers, etched frosted glass, painted scroll work and much more. The Wells Fargo Wagon (c. 1870) was gifted to the museum by the Railroad Express Agency in 1959. The Wells Fargo Overland Express Company figured prominently in America's westward expansion by providing coach transportation for passengers and mail and operated banking offices throughout the West. This particular heavy type of mud wagon was manufactured by Abbot-Downing Company and painted in the Wells Fargo standard red and yellow while being devoid of any decoration and luxury components. State Coach, M. Staubwasser, Munich, Germany, c. 1850, Gift of Dieter HolterboschFour Bavarian State Coaches (c. 1850) from the Nymphenburg Palace in Munich, Germany were gifted to the museum by Dieter Holterbosch in 1967. The state coach was a formal vehicle used by royalty or high officials in processions on state business. These four stage coaches belonged to Prince Albert of Bavaria (1818–1875), the youngest son of King Ludwig I of Wittlsbasch Dynasty. The Dr. Charles W. Gerstenberg Carriage Reference Library, which is located in the Carriage Museum, is a rich resource of historic prints, photographs, and rare books on every subject relating to the carriage era. The 700-square-foot library is open by appointment to researchers. Exhibitions  Hooked@LIM Project, installed in 2015Along with a number of permanent exhibitions, the museum offers an active schedule of changing exhibitions usually hosting six to seven temporary exhibitions a year. Many of the temporary exhibitions contain both objects found in the collection as well as objects on loan from various lenders. Each exhibition focuses primarily on history or art or a blend of both. LIM also has a long tradition of hosting exhibitions in collaboration with local artists. Amateur and professional artists are invited to enter the annual Juried Art exhibition. Artists belonging to LIMarts: A Collaborative Arts Group (an LIM membership initiative) is featured in an annual member's exhibition. Colors of Long Island is an annual exhibition that affords opportunities for hundreds of students across Long Island to display their artwork in a museum setting. The LIM has hosted an annual sculpture and public art exhibition since 2014. Hooked@LIM: The Crocheted Tree Project, a community art installation by Carol Hummel, is currently on view. The project involved wrapping five trees on LIM grounds with thousands of colorful circles crocheted by over 200 volunteers. Education A cornerstone of the museum's mission is education. In addition to the LIM's permanent and changing exhibitions, a range of educational programs provide life-long learning opportunities including workshops, family festivals, and lectures. School programs School programs serve 12,000 students annually, drawing from schools throughout Suffolk and Nassau Counties, many from underserved districts. The LIM: Rides for Kids program has been bringing students from underserved school districts to the museum since 2013. The program offers subsidized support for both field trip and bus transportation. Most of the LIM's exhibitions and programming are based on the vast resources of the museum's diversified collections. Interactive programs help educators teach through visual literacy, which enables students to \\"read\\" artifacts and artwork in order to understand the past. Students examine documents, artwork, vehicles, costumes and related objects to learn about the past and the people who created and used these items. Programs teach critical thinking and inquiry skills that can be translated into other academic situations. The list of school programs that are available can be found on the museum's website: http://longislandmuseum.org/ The museum also offers monthly Hands-On History/Art programs for students in grades Pre-K through 4, as well as vacation programs and summer art workshops which target children and families. Public programs In conjunction with the school programs, the Education Department offers a number of public programming geared towards community members of all ages. Public programs include informative lectures, musical programs, and workshops throughout the year that tie in with our current exhibitions. In the Moment is a program of art engagement for people with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of memory loss. The Education Department collaborates with facilities that work with this population in an interactive exhibition experience that sparks imagination and encourages participation. Senior Tuesday runs one Tuesday each month, when the museum is normally closed to the public, where seniors 62 and older are invited to enjoy a free, self-guided tour of one exhibition. Music@LIM is a music performance series which presents on-site concerts featuring diverse musical offerings through existing and new community collaborations, such as North Shore Pro Musica, the Greater Port Jefferson-Northern Brookhaven Arts Council and WUSB- FM Sunday Street Concert Series, Bluegrass Club of Long Island, and the annual LIM concert featuring high-profile artists.

The sister ships were assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion and remained there for their entire careers. Aside from several accidental collisions and one grounding, their careers were uneventful. They were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads in 1892 before they became training ships in 1900. The Admiral Spiridovs were stricken from the Navy List in 1907; one ship became a stationary target and the other a coal-storage barge. Their ultimate fates are unknown. Design and description Line drawing from Brassey's Naval Annual, 1888 By late 1863, the Russian Admiralty Board had begun planning for the second generation of ironclads to succeed those ships then under construction. They ordered eight ships, two fully rigged seagoing types and six coastal defense ships, in March 1864. The British shipbuilder Charles Mitchell submitted four different designs for the coastal defense vessels, two broadside ironclads and two turret ships. The Shipbuilding Technical Committee decided in August that the broadside designs would be based on the hull shape of the earlier for better seaworthiness, but they would be armed with fewer, but more powerful guns, than the numerous smoothbore guns of the older ships. Two variants were worked out that differed in the fineness of the hull and draft.McLaughlin, p. 112 In November the committee decided to revise the designs to use three gun turrets, each armed with a pair of massive American-designed Rodman guns, although the armament was changed to rifled muzzle-loading guns two months later. On 4 June 1865, Admiral Spiridov and Admiral Chichagov were ordered to the shallower- draft version of the two designs. Construction of the ships was repeatedly delayed by design changes and delayed deliveries of components. Both of the most significant design changes were related to the armor protection. Shortly after they were ordered the Admiralty Board realized that the specified armor would be outclassed by the latest rifled gun and decided that the existing armor would be reinforced by an additional armor plate and additional wooden backing inside the existing armor. The additional weight was offset by increasing the height of the hull by which also deepened the ships' draft. The second change occurred after new rifled guns were able to penetrate a replica of the armor scheme in June 1866. The Admiralty Board decided to significantly thicken the armor of the two ships and removed one gun turret to compensate for the weight of the extra armor in November. Numerous other changes flowed from this decision as the engine and boilers had to be moved forward about to maintain the ships' trim and two transverse bulkheads also had to be moved. This major change added over 270,000 rubles to the cost of the ships and added more delays as Russian ironworks had problems rolling the thicker armor plates.McLaughlin, pp. 113–14 The Admiral Spiridov-class monitors were significantly larger than their predecessors, the , and were long at the waterline. They had a beam of and a maximum draft of . The ships were designed to displace , but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced . They were fitted with a plough-shaped ram. The Admiral Spiridovs had a double bottom and their hulls were subdivided by six main watertight bulkheads. Their crew consisted of 280 officers and crewmen.McLaughlin, pp. 115–16 Propulsion The Admiral Spiridov class had a single two-cylinder horizontal direct-acting steam engine. It had a bore of and a stroke of and drove a single three-bladed propeller. Steam was provided by four rectangular fire-tube boilers at a pressure of . The engine was designed to produce a total of which gave the ships speeds between when they ran their initial sea trials in 1869. The monitors also had a donkey boiler for the small steam engine that powered the ventilation fans and pumps. The Admiral Spiridov class carried of coal which gave them a range of about at a speed of 10 knots. They were fitted with a light fore-and-aft sailing rig with three pole masts and a bowsprit. It had an area of and its primary purpose was to steady the ships and assist in turning.McLaughlin, pp. 116, 122–23 Armament The monitors were ultimately designed to be armed with four Obukhov 9-inch rifled guns, a pair in each Coles-type turret. An armored bulkhead separated the guns inside each turret. In 1874–75 the guns were replaced by a single gun in each turret, based on a Krupp design. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 a 9-inch mortar was fitted to attack the thin deck armor of enemy ships, but accuracy was poor and they were later removed, probably in the early 1880s. An improved, more powerful, 11-inch gun was installed aboard Admiral Chichagov during the 1880s, although Admiral Spiridov retained her original guns until 1902, if not for the rest of her career.McLaughlin, pp. 118–19 Light guns for use against torpedo boats were added to the Admiral Spiridov-class ships during the Russo-Turkish War when a pair of 4-pounder guns were mounted on the roofs of each gun turret. Other guns known have been fitted included Baranov quick-firing (QF) guns, QF Hotchkiss guns, and QF Hotchkiss five-barreled revolving cannon. The ships could also carry 12-15 mines intended to be used to create a secure anchorage.McLaughlin, pp. 119–20 Armor The hull of the Admiral Spiridov-class monitors was completely covered by three strakes of wrought iron armor, the upper two were about high and the lower one, below the waterline, was high. The middle strake was thick for a length of amidships and the other strakes were generally thick (the upper strake was thick abreast the turrets). The armor thinned to aft and forward of the main belt. This outermost layer of armor was backed by 9 inches of teak reinforced with angle irons and then came the 1-inch inner armor plates, backed in its turn by another 9 inches of teak.McLaughlin, pp. 121–122 The turrets had 6 inches of armor, except around the gun ports, where it thickened to 6.5 inches, reinforced by 12 inches of teak. The conning tower was thick. The deck armor was in two layers with a total thickness of 1 inch that were separated by a layer of cloth or felt to better deflect the glancing hits expected. The upper layer was thick and the lower was .McLaughlin, p. 122 Ships {|class=wikitable ! Name ! Namesake ! BuilderMcLaughlin, p. 113 ! Ordered ! Laid down ! Launched !

This added more delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently fit out the ships. Both ships were assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion. They were not fully equipped until around 1872 and their trials continued until 1873. Admiral Spiridov accidentally rammed the monitor in Kronstadt harbor in 1871, and her sister collided with the monitor four years later; neither ship was seriously damaged. Several days after the collision, Admiral Chichagov struck a sandbank at full speed. While not damaged in the incident, she was very firmly stuck and early attempts to pull her off failed, during which one seaman was killed and an officer badly wounded. The monitor had to be unloaded as much as possible and her forward guns were removed before she was freed from the sandbank, five days after running aground.McLaughlin, pp. 114, 124–26 The ships received electric dynamos and searchlights were installed in the late 1870s. Admiral Chichagov served as the flagship for Captain 1st Rank Stepan Makarov during the 1885 naval maneuvers in the approaches to the Gulf of Riga and her boilers were replaced in two years later. Steam-powered steering gear was installed in the sisters in 1887 and they were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads on 13 February 1892. By this time, their role in Russian war plans was to defend the Gulf of Riga against an anticipated German amphibious landing.McLaughlin, pp. 123–24 In 1900 they were transferred to the Kronstadt Engineering School as training ships before they were transferred to the Port of Kronstadt on 31 March 1907 for disposal. The sisters were stricken on 14 August and Admiral Spiridov became a stationary coal-storage barge while Admiral Chichagov was grounded near Reval and used as a target.

Bayātī (Arabic بياتي), also known as Bayat and Uşşâk (Ushaq), is the name of a maqam (musical mode) in Arabic, Turkish, and related systems of music. Bayati is similar to a natural minor scale, with the primary exception of a half-flat second degree. The maqam is immensely popular in the Arab world, particularly in the Levant. In secular settings, it is favored in dabke and pop music. Bayati is also used very often in religious liturgies of the Middle East. It is the favored maqam of use for the adhan in Medina, Saudi Arabia. Syrian Jews have an abundance of pizmonim in this maqam and usually apply it to all Bar Mitzvahs and to Saturday Night services. According to the Assyrian Church of the East, this mode is called Qadmoyo (first). Related maqamat are Husseini and Bayati Shuri. Nucleus The central tones of a maqam are created from two different intervals. The eleven central tones of the maqam used in the phase sequence example above may be reduced to three which make up the \\"nucleus\\" of the maqam: Example maqam nucleus :Touma, Habib Hassan (1996).

Howe had spent more than a year traveling across the state of Ohio making sketches, interviewing people, and collecting data. The first edition sold more than 18,000 copies.Smith :326 In the 1870s, many influential Ohioans asked Howe to update his work with another tour.Smith :328 In 1885, Howe did not have the money necessary to begin a tour of Ohio, so he was the first American to try the concept of advanced paying subscriptions, selling copies for $10, four years in advance of publication.Smith : 329-330 Howe began a tour at President Hayes' home in Fremont Nov 21, 1885,Collections of Ohio volume 3 : 208 and finished March 1887. It took two years before the first volume was issued, which was highly acclaimed, but sold poorly. He applied to the Ohio Legislature for assistance, and they bought 1200 copies for $12,000, allowing him to complete the three volume set, instead of the two originally planned, in 1891. Sales lagged, because everyone expected the State to give copies to schools and libraries. Howe was deeply in debt from the project when he died in October, 1893. The State, in the 71st General Assembly, agreed to buy the copyright and printing plates for $20,000, due to a petition from Senators Sherman, Brice, and Thurman, Governors Cox, Foster, Foraker, and McKinley, and many others, relieving Howe's widow of debt.

Life Greswell was born at Denton, Lancashire, on 22 July 1800, the fourth son of the Rev. William Parr Greswell. He was educated first by his father, and then at Worcester College, Oxford, on the foundation of which college he was placed on 1 June 1818. In 1822, having gained a double-first, he was appointed assistant tutor of Worcester, and in the next year full tutor, a post he retained for thirty years. He became fellow in June 1824. He graduated B.A. in 1822, M.A. in 1825, and B.D. in 1836. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1830. As a tutor Greswell was learned and skilful, and his lectures were considered models in their way. For many years he devoted the proceeds of his tutorship to public and charitable objects, his personal expenses being defrayed from a modest fortune brought by his wife, Joana Julia Armitriding, whom he married in 1836. In 1843 he opened a subscription on behalf of national education, with a donation of £1,000, and ultimately raised £250,000 for the funds of the National Society. He was largely instrumental in establishing the new museum at Oxford, and was one of the founders of the Ashmolean Society. From 1847 to 1865 Greswell acted as chairman of Gladstone's election committee at Oxford. He was a benefactor to his father's parish of Denton, and by his efforts a new church, called Christ Church, was built and provided with parsonage, schools, and endowment (1853). Many kindly and beneficent acts are related of Greswell, whose 'chief characteristics were great and varied learning, boundless benevolence, and a childlike simplicity'. Greswell died at Oxford on 22 July 1881, aged exactly 81 years. His daughter, Joana Julia Greswell, published at Oxford in 1873 a 'Grammatical Analysis of the Hebrew Psalter.' Works Greswell's publications were a paper On Education and the Principles of Art, 1843, and a Memorial on the Proposed Oxford University Lecture-rooms, Library, Museums, &c.;, 1853.

History  Krueger's was founded 1858; however, its roots go further back. In 1851 Louis Adam and J. Braun met to form a new brewery, but Braun died, so Adam partnered with John Liable to form Liable & Adam. In 1851, Liable invited his nephew from Germany, Gottfried Krueger, then 16, to assist in the brewery. In 1858, Adam took over the brewery and Liable invested in Krueger, until 1865, when Krueger partnered with Gottlieb Hill to purchase Louis Adam's brewery under the Hill & Krueger banner. The brewery went from 4,000 to 25,000 within 10 years. When Hill passed in 1875 Kruger became sole owner and changed the brand to G. Kruger Brewing Company.\\"Beer, Its History and Its Economic Value as a National Beverage\\" by Frederick William Salem 1882 began a period of huge success for Krueger. He joined a syndicate with Peter Hauck and Anton Hupfel to become the United States Brewing Company. Kruger then purchased a large stake in Lyons & Sons Brewery, The Home Brewing Co., Eagle Brewery, and Union Brewery. In 1908 United States Brewing bought Trefz Brewery (most known for the \\"River of Beer\\" incident in 1889) and Albany Brewery and produced more than 500,000 barrels a year. In 1914 Gottfried was visiting Germany when World War I broke out and was forced to stay until the war ended. Prohibition forced the closure of the brewery and Gottfried died in 1926. \\"North Jersey Beer\\" by Chris Morris Post Prohibition During Prohibition, Krueger Brewing made an honest living selling near beer and soda. This gave them a distinct advantage when Prohibition ended, so the brewery was able to produce beer at 3.2% Alcohol By Weight the morning of April 7th, 1934 - right into cups. According to one source, it took two days for the line in the front of the brewery to return to order. \\"Jersey Brew: The Story of Beer in New Jersey\\" by Michael Pellegrino . In 1933, Krueger was the first company to produce beer in cans, thanks to a partnership with American Can Company. This was a big risk, so American Can offered to install the equipment for free and Krueger would only pay for it if the plan was successful. A initial test run of 2,000 cans labeled \\"Krueger's Special Beer\\" was made that November. The cans were initially shipped to Richmond, Virginia, the farthest point of Kreuger's distribution area, in case the experiment failed.

Unfortunately, the 1950s saw consolidation in the brewing industry, and breweries like Anheuser-Busch and Miller squeezed out market share.

It is found in much of Asia and Australasia. At one time, this species was misidentified as G. africana and thought to have a widespread distribution in both Africa and Asia, but in the 1980s, G. orientalis was recognised as a separate species.Mole Cricket Knowledgebase It is a polyphagous pest, damaging crops by gnawing their roots.AgroAtlas Morphology and biology This mole cricket is plump, yellowish-brown, and paler beneath, and about 20 mm long. It has short filiform antennae, fore legs designed for digging, and a large, oblong pronotum. The wings project slightly from beneath the fore wings. After mating underground, the female builds a nesting chamber deep in the soil and lays about 200 oval eggs that hatch after 10 days. The nymphs remain in their nest for the first 2-3 weeks, guarded by the female. A newly hatched nymph has a blueish-white prothorax and legs. Later instars are grayish-black with white markings, and the last nymphal stage is similar to the adult and exhibits short wing pads. The whole lifecycle lasts for 1-3 years depending on the climatic conditions. The adults and late-instar nymphs spend the winter underground at a depth around 1 m. Distribution The oriental mole cricket is found in Russia and other parts of the former USSR, China, Japan, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Hawaii, where it seems to have arrived from Asia before 1896. Ecology The oriental mole cricket lives underground in damp soil, digging a network of passages. Its natural habitat include damp, rich soils such as flood plains and the banks of streams and ponds, as well as arable land and gardens. The burrow has vertical and horizontal passages and may be complex in structure, with different parts being used for different purposes.The underground life of the oriental mole cricket: an analysis of burrow morphology. The mole cricket feeds on the roots, tubers, and rhizomes of plants, and also on insects, earthworms, and other invertebrates. It comes to the surface and undertakes flight in the evenings and at night, and is attracted to light sources. A mass emergence after wintering may take place when the temperature rises to 12-15°C. Besides birds and insectivorous mammals, its natural enemies include ants, which feed on the eggs, beetles, which eat the larvae, nematodes, and mites. Fungal diseases may be devastating during winters with sudden rises of temperature and thaws. Economic significance In Hawaii, sugarcane crops have been attacked by this cricket, and its tunneling activities have caused damage to the banks of irrigation ditches. In Asia, the cricket gnaws roots and tubers and causes damage to wheat, barley, oats, rice, maize, beans, vegetable crops, potatoes, and sugar beets. Measures to control the pest include deep ploughing, trapping, soil fumigation, poison baits, and the application of insecticides. In Australia, damage is sometimes done to rice crops in raised nursery beds or in upland conditions. In wetland rice, the crickets can be seen swimming between plants. Biological control in Hawaii Larra is a genus of wasps in the family Crabronidae, the members of which are parasitoids of mole crickets. After several unsuccessful attempts to introduce these wasps to Hawaii, in 1925, Larra polita from the Philippines was successfully introduced and succeeded in establishing itself. Little comment has been given since 1930 on the damage being done by the oriental mole cricket in Hawaii, and this may be due to the presence of these wasps.

The chairman and CEO was Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha until his death in October 2018. He was succeeded as chairman by his son, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha. King Power's \\"...cash cow is the proprietary concession of Thailand's duty-free business.\\" The company is the largest duty- free retailer in Thailand. Its duty free shopping mall in Bangkok's central business district covers over and it has branches at Suvarnabhumi Airport and Thailand's other major airports. In 2015, King Power launched an online site selling duty-free and duty-paid items. History A King Power duty free shop at Macau International Airport. King Power began in 1989, with a license granted for Thailand's first downtown duty free shop at Mahatun Plaza. In 1995, King Power won the sole concession to operate duty-free shops at Don Mueang Airport, then Bangkok's main airport. In 1997, the government of Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh granted the company the sole right to manage duty-free business at the World Trade Centre in downtown Bangkok for 10 years. The business had previously been managed by the Tourism Authority of Thailand. Some questioned whether it was contrary to Prime Minister's Office regulations regarding partnership with private business. In 2004, the government of Thaksin Shinawatra granted King Power the right to operate duty-free shops at Suvarnabhumi, Bangkok's new main airport, for 10 years. Shortly thereafter, the company won the concession to operate duty-free shops at four major provincial airports until 2015. There was no bidding for the concessions. King Power operated branches at Suvarnabhumi, Don Mueang, Phuket, Chiang Mai, and Hat Yai airports. Its contract at Suvarnabhumi expires in 2020 and at Don Mueang in 2022. King Power's monopoly status stands in sharp contrast to the practice at other comparable international airports. For example, Incheon International Airport has twelve duty-free concessions competing for trade. King Power received the royal warrant from the King of Thailand in December 2009. The garuda statue in front of its headquarters symbolizes that privilege. King Power founder Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha In August 2010, following agreement on a three-year shirt sponsorship deal with King Power, Milan Mandarić sold the English football club Leicester City F.C. to a Thai- led consortium called Asian Football Investments (AFI), owned by King Power Group's Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. On 16 May 2017, Belgian First Division B team Oud-Heverlee Leuven announced that they had accepted an offer from King Power to buy the club. In June 2016 King Power purchased a US$226 million stake in Thai AirAsia, the country's largest budget airline. The purchase of 39 percent of holding company Asia Aviation makes King Power the second largest shareholder in Thai AirAsia. On 27 October 2018, the chairman and CEO of King Power, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha died in a helicopter crash, shortly after leaving King Power Stadium, home of Leicester City FC. The cause of the crash is currently unknown, and is under investigation by the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch.  Stores  The King Power MahaNakhon skyscraper in Bangkok King Power has outlets at nine Thai airports and stores in major tourist venues.  Allegation of wrongdoing In 2017, King Power was accused of failing to pay the Thai state 14 billion baht (£327 million) from the operation of their airport duty-free shop monopoly. The original agreement, signed in 2006, requires that 15 percent of duty-free shop income be paid to the Thai government. The lawsuit alleges that King Power colluded with airport employees to pay the government only a three percent slice of duty free takings. The lawsuit was filed by a deputy chairman of a government anti- corruption subcommittee. Two other King Power group companies owned by the Srivaddhanaprabha family were also accused of corruption in the legal action, along with a senior King Power executive. Fourteen officials working for Airports of Thailand PCL (AOT) have also been named in the suit. King Power immediately dismissed allegations of corruption relating to its contract with state-owned AOT. The allegations were described as \\"absolutely untrue\\" by Dr. Nitinai Sirismatthakarn, President of AoT, who explained the allegations were based on a misunderstanding of contract modifications negotiated by AoT. In effect, fee percentage was effectively reduced, but there is a lack of understanding of this modification in the contracts as rate does not apply to the same calculation structure. Instead of charging 15 percent of profit, AoT receives three percent of turnover, resulting in increased fees received by AoT (seven times previous fees). \\"This absolutely cannot be considered as damage to the state\\", Dr. Nitinai said. The Central Criminal Court for Corruption and Misconduct Cases in Bangkok accepted the case in November 2017, and said it would begin to hear witnesses on 12 February 2018. In August 2018, the court said it would extend a hearing into accusations of graft against AOT and King Power, delaying a decision on whether to take up the case. The court will hold another hearing on 4 September 2018, summoning the AOT president to clarify the AOT's duties, revenues, and regulations governing commercial activity. The Central Criminal Court for Corruption and Misconduct Cases dismissed the case on 18 September 2018, ruling that the plaintiff \\"was not an affected party, therefore he cannot sue in this case.\\"  Close ties to various Thai governments  King Power's \\"cash cow\\" is its duty-free business which operates as a government-sanctioned monopoly. Over the years, King Power has been very close to the Thaksin, Abhisit, and Yingluck governments. It has also been a supporter of post-coup governments of Sonthi Boonyaratglin and more recently, Prayut Chan-o-cha. In January 2019, it was revealed that King Power was among the donors at the pro-junta Phalang Pracharat Party's 600 million baht dinner fundraiser.  Philanthropy   Football in Thailand   2017-2022  ;100 football pitch & 1 million footballs King Power’s aims to promote Thai youth’s football potentiality in a comprehensive manner ranging from donate 1 million footballs to youth across Thailand, to installing an international-standard artificial grass football pitch for 100 schools and communities across Thailand within 5 years. The country’s leading duty-free retailer has launched a countrywide campaign called “Sport Power” that aims to develop football skills of the children. ;Fox Hunt project King Power has been continuously contributing to Thai football with the Fox Hunt project, which gives scholarships to talented youngsters who are trained at the Leicester Football Academy in England. Other King Power football programmes include Leicester City Football Clinic and King Power Cup. ;Muak Lek National training centre In November 2019, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha have agreed to fund a new training centre for The Football Association of Thailand.

The Rest on the Flight into Egypt was a popular subject in art. History The painting, once attributed to Federico Barocci,Giuliano Ercoli, Arte e fortuna del Correggio, Modena 1982, p. 114. is now unanimously assigned to Correggio. It has been linked to the testament of jurist Francesco Munari who, in 1520, left money to the church of San Francesco in the town of Correggio for the decoration of the Immaculate Conception Chapel, where he wanted to be buried. The work remained in the church until 1638, when duke Francesco I d'Este moved his collections to Modena and replaced it with a copy by Jean Boulanger. In 1649 it was acquired by Ferdinando II de' Medici, in exchange for the Sacrifice of Isaac by Andrea del Sarto, and was thenceforth located at the Uffizi. Description The painting is inspired to an episode of Jesus' childhood narrated in the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew. During their flight from Egypt, the Holy Family stopped to rest under a palm tree. The latter bent itself to offer them its fruit and water appeared from its roots. Mary is portrayed in the middle, with the child on her knees. Joseph, on the left, is giving fruits to Jesus. On the right is Saint Francis of Assisi, present in the scene as a homage to the donor (who was eponymous of the saint), or the church.

Singleton House, his impressive townhouse in Drogheda, no longer exists. Career He was born in Drogheda, one of eleven children of Edward Singleton, Member of Parliament for Drogheda town and his wife Catherine Newton. He went to school in Drogheda Grammar School, graduated from the University of Dublin and was called to the Bar in 1707. Like his father he sat in the Irish House of Commons as MP for Drogheda and narrowly missed becoming Speaker of the House; he was also Recorder of Drogheda and became Prime Serjeant-at-law in 1726. He evidently found the office of Serjeant an onerous one, judging by his later pleas to be appointed to \\"a place of greater ease\\". It is interesting that he assumed that the workload of a High Court judge would be lighter than that of Serjeant. In 1739, when the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland fell vacant, Singleton lobbied hard for it, arguing that his \\"fifteen years of faithful service to the Crown\\" surely entitled him to \\"a place of more ease, though less profit, than his present situation\\".Hart, A. R. History of the King's Serjeants-at-law in Ireland Dublin Four Courts Press 2000 There was however a traditional reluctance on the part of the English Crown to appoint any Irish-born judge as Lord Chancellor,Philip Tisdall, Henry's nephew by marriage, was later passed over for the Chancellorship solely on this ground. and he was passed over in favour of Robert Jocelyn, 1st Viscount Jocelyn.Who as Attorney General for Ireland since 1730 clearly had at least an equally strong claim to it, apart from being English by birth- see Hart Serjeants-at-law Singleton was finally raised to the Bench as Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas in 1740.Hart Serjeants-at-law Within a few years his health began to fail, although he made frequent visits to Bath and Spa in the hope of a cure. Despite pressure from William Yorke, his colleague in the Common Pleas and nephew by marriage, who was anxious to succeed him, he was reluctant to step down. Eventually in 1753 he resigned as Chief Justice; the following year he became Master of the Rolls in Ireland (which was then largely a sinecure rather than the senior judicial office which it became later). He held the Mastership until he died, unmarried, in 1759. Heirs Mary Singleton Tisdall, \\"la belle Marie\\", Singleton's niece and heiress, painted by Angelica Kauffmann His will contains a long list of bequests to his surviving sisters, and to his numerous nephews and nieces. The principal beneficiary was his niece Mary, daughter of his brother the Rev. Rowland Singleton, vicar of Termonfeckin, and his wife Elizabeth Graham, and sister of Charity Singleton Cope (1707-1779) , who married Sir William Yorke as her second husband. Mary married Philip Tisdall, Attorney General for Ireland from 1760 to 1777, who was a dominant figure in the Irish Government for many years. Mary (\\"la belle Marie\\") was a noted beauty: she and Philip were both painted by the celebrated Swiss painter Angelica Kauffman.Registry of Deeds Dublin Abstracts of Wills Vol. 2 Philipp Tisdall, the leading Irish statesman who married Singleton's niece and heiress Mary Singleton Residence In 1731 he built an impressive residence named Singleton House at Laurence Street, Drogheda.\\"Houses of Yesteryear in Mell\\" Drogheda Independent 21/01/2005 It has been described as a three story mansion of red brick, with seven bay windows and magnificent oak-panelled interiors.

Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London ,1926 William Yorke, his successor as Chief Justice, and husband of his niece Charity, even while nudging him towards retirement, had nothing but praise for Singleton both as a man and a judge. The best tribute to his character is his noble behaviour during the Great Famine of 1740-41 when he donated much of his personal fortune to the relief of the poor of Drogheda, one of the towns worst affected by the famine, and adjourned the Court of Common Pleas, so that he could return home and supervise the relief works.

It was centred on three proposed subway lines: the Downtown Relief Line, Eglinton West Line, and the Sheppard Line. Eventually only a portion of the Sheppard Line was built, while construction on the Eglinton line was started and then abandoned. The plan The 1970s had seen the end of new expressway construction in Toronto, and the preservation of the Downtown streetcar system. In 1972, while construction was underway on the Spadina Subway line, the provincial government of Bill Davis introduced the GO-Urban transit plan for the Toronto region. Rather than build either subways or light rail, the plan would build a network of innovative maglevs to ring Metro Toronto. The maglev project failed, and the province switched to supporting UTDC's Intermediate Capacity Transit System. An initial line was built, the Scarborough RT, but it went greatly over budget and no further lines were attempted. Network 2011 was designed to meet the needs of a rapidly growing city where building new expressways was politically impossible. There was also strong resistance to further intensification of the downtown core. The same spirit of activism that had stopped the Spadina Expressway and saved the streetcars also blocked residential redevelopment projects such as the plans for Trefann Court and Kensington Market. Community activists also opposed more downtown office towers, and as a result the city plan called for the creation of three suburban \\"subcentres\\" that would become central business districts independent of the core: North York City Centre, Scarborough City Centre, and Etobicoke City Centre. Improving transit to these areas was a central focus of the plan.Robin Harvey. \\"Shaping tomorrow's suburbs.\\" Toronto Star. April 7, 1984. pg. A22 The GO-Urban and ICTS experiments being failures, the TTC was unwilling to again risk anything experimental, and the plan called for future transit expansion to use subways of the same design as the existing lines. The plan did not consider using the CLRV and ALRV streetcars which were being delivered at the time to run on the downtown tracks. Under the lead of planner Jiri Pill, the TTC delivered a plan to Metro Toronto in May 1985 calling for a near doubling of Toronto's rapid transit lines. The Network 2011 plan had five elements to be built over the next 28 years and would cost an estimated $2.7 billion: *Sheppard Subway Line from Yonge to Victoria Park, the top priority with work hoped to begin almost immediately. Estimated cost of $500 million *Downtown Relief Line running from Union Station to Donlands Station to relieve pressure on the Yonge-Bloor Station. Estimated to cost $565 million and open in 1998. *Temporary busway on Eglinton West to be completed by 2003 and would cost $365 million *Sheppard Phase 2, extension of the Sheppard Line east from Victoria Park to Scarborough Town Centre and west to Dufferin. Opening in 2009 at an estimated cost of $740 million *Replacement of the Eglinton busway with either light rail or a full subway. Construction to begin in 2011 and cost of $425 million. *Also attached to the plan, but not an official part, were the Harbourfront and Spadina LRT lines that were already underway when the plan was announced.Michael Smith. \\"$2.7 Billion Metro transit plan called affordable.\\" Toronto Star. May 29, 1985. pg. A1 Debates The plan was well received by most in Toronto, and was approved by Metro Council in June 1986. Most of the debate was over which sections should be built first. The mayors of York and Etobicoke wanted the Eglinton Line moved up in priority, while North York and Scarborough pushed for the Sheppard Line to be built first, and for the entire line to be built at once rather than in two sections.Michael Smith. \\"Plans for future top priority after banner TTC year.\\" Toronto Star. December 21, 1985. pg. A6 The Eglinton line had been discussed since 1975, and the need for a Downtown Relief Line has also previously been discussed. The call for a subway along suburban Sheppard was unexpected.Michael Smith. \\"A subway surprise: The Sheppard line.\\" Toronto Star. February 8, 1986. pg. B6 Sheppard was prioritized because the bus lines were overloaded, and putting it first could win support from suburban councillors who were less enthused to invest in transit.Michael Smith. \\"$2.7 Billion Metro transit plan called affordable.\\" Toronto Star. May 29, 1985. pg. A1 The creation of the Sheppard Line would add enough passengers onto the Yonge Line to overload Yonge-Bloor Station, requiring the Downtown Relief Line to be the next built. This angered councillors from York and Etobicoke, who wanted the Eglinton Line to have higher priority. The governments of Mississauga and Peel also wanted the Eglinton Line built sooner, and put pressure on the province, who was paying 75% of the cost, to have its schedule advanced.Michael Smith. \\"Eglinton transit line gets top billing in 2011.\\" Toronto Star. June 3, 1986. pg. WE6 One critic of the plan was Steve Munro, of Streetcars for Toronto, the group that had saved the Toronto streetcar system in the 1970s. He argued that the TTC planners were too focused on subways, and this made the programme too expensive and less likely to be built. He argued that options such as underground LRT were not considered by the TTC, and would have met requirements with a lower price.Michael Smith. \\"A subway surprise: The Sheppard line.\\" Toronto Star. February 8, 1986. pg. B6 The opposition to the plan was led by the Better Transportation Coalition, under the leadership of Gord Perks. Perks argued that a streetcar in a separate right-of-way along Sheppard would easily address the needed ridership, at a fraction of the cost.Royson James. \\"Transit advocates fight transit expansion.\\" Toronto Star. Nov 13, 1993. Sec. C. pg. B.4 There were also concerns over the Downtown Relief Line. Munro noted that a line running from Danforth to downtown would serve mostly as a transfer for passengers coming from further east and would have little benefit to the local community, and should instead extend further north, additionally serving Don Mills. Local councillor Dale Martin agreed that the line mainly served the interests of developers looking for intensification rather than local residents.Michael Smith. \\"Network 2001: The Battle over who gets what.\\" Toronto Star. February 8, 1986. pg. B6 Jack Layton emerged as the leader of the councillors opposed to the DRL, concerned it would lead to further intensification downtown. Layton and his allies were strong followers of Jane Jacobs, and believed in preserving downtown neighbourhoods as they were and redirecting office developments to the suburbs. The new developments in the suburbs would allow true urban communities to develop there, and create a multi-directional traffic that would make far better use of existing downtown infrastructure.Alfred Holden. \\"Rail lands spark classic city hall fight.\\" Toronto Star. June 18, 1986. pg. A22 Provincial revisions and cancellations The complaints from Peel region were also matched by demands from York Region that the province fund Highway 407. The provincial government of David Peterson delayed approving the Network 2011 projects until a study analyzing transit needs across the entire Greater Toronto Area was completed.Michael Smith. \\"Province considering new subways TTC says.\\" Toronto Star. April 5, 1987. pg. A3 In April 1990 the Peterson government announced their \\"Let's Move\\" program of $6.2 billion in transportation spending across the GTA over the next ten years. Let's Move added several components to the Network 2011 plan: a northern connection along Finch between the Yonge and Spadina Lines, extension of the Bloor Subway to Sherway Gardens, SRT extension to Sheppard, building an LRT along Eglinton into Mississauga. Missing from the plan was the Downtown Relief Line. It also deprioritized Sheppard, offering to fund it only if the private sector contributed a significant amount.Jim Byers. \\"Metro-aera transit plan could cost $4 billion.\\" Toronto Star. April 5, 1990. pg. A1 Peterson's Liberals lost the 1990 provincial election to the New Democrats under Bob Rae. In 1993 the Rae government released its own transit plan, the Rapid Transit Expansion Program. It retained the Sheppard Line, but only to Don Mills; upgraded Eglinton to a full subway, but only to York City Centre; kept the Scarborough RT extension from the Let's Move proposal, and added an extension of the Spadina Line to York University.Royson James. \\"Deciding which train to take.\\" Toronto Star. March 8, 1994. pg. A15 The Eglinton and Sheppard Lines were the initial priorities, and work began almost immediately. In 1995 the Progressive Conservatives under Mike Harris were elected, and they immediately launched a program of sharp cost cutting. Despite already being under construction the Eglinton Line was cancelled. Sheppard did go ahead, but any plans to go further east than Don Mills were shelved. The new Sheppard Line opened in 2002 at a cost of about $1 billion. As of 2010, the only parts of the Network 2011 plan completed are the Sheppard line between Yonge and Don Mills, and the Spadina line extension to Downsview Station. In 2007, mayor David Miller unveiled the Transit City expansion plan, which proposed light rail lines along two of the Network 2011 corridors, Eglinton and Sheppard East. This plan was accepted, and partially funded by the provincial government's \\"Big Move\\" transit plan. In the 2010 municipal election, Rob Ford was elected mayor.

The private commercial structure was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on December 31, 1979. The building is significant for the extensive features of the front facade as compared to the other \\"Main Street\\" buildings in New Ulm and surrounding communities.Dennis Gimmestad, Minnesota Historic Properties Inventory Form, January 1979; copy accessed from Boesch-Hummel-Maltzahn Block file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. Structure The eastern (rear) of the building, which once had wooden stairways and covered walkways for upstairs apartments. The Boesch, Hummel, and Maltzahn Block is a two-story structure located on the north side of New Ulm's main commercial thoroughfare, consisting of 6, 8, 10 and 12 Minnesota Street North. The street level facade has been remodeled several times over the years, but still maintains the cut stone dividing members. The second story facade features relief-laid brick and four, large copper-roofed bay windows. Cut stone is also used as decoration on the second level as well as for a railed balcony over the stairway entrance on the northern section of the facade. Panels carrying the names of the persons first associated with the structure, as well as its completion year, are incorporated into an elaborate metal cornice. The rear of the building, which once had wooden stairways and two levels of covered walkways, now has metal stairways for building access. History William Hummel was born on October 22, 1832 in Neuffen, Württemberg, then a part of the German Confederation. He was reared by his paternal grandparents His grandfather was a tanner by trade. From age seven to twelve, he attended school and in 1844, his parents immigrated to the United States, taking him along. The voyage was difficult, with various problems leading to spending 138 days on a ship. Of the more than 300 German immigrants in their group, 28 died on the trip and seven babies were born. They arrived in New Orleans in early March 1845, and soon his family moved to Cincinnati where they began work at an uncle's vineyard. After the harvest, the family returned to New Orleans where they began trade in food stuffs. After a year of success, Hummel's father died of yellow fever. This caused serious financial hardship for his mother and four siblings. As the oldest, Hummel began working at a drug store, receiving at the time $8.00 per month and board. After a time he was sent back to Cincinnati to learn a trade where his uncle taught him to be a harness maker. Soon after there was a cholera outbreak, shutting down businesses and causing Hummel to look for new work. Finding employment as an apprentice trunk-maker, he was able to earn a stable living. In 1850 he joined the Cincinnati Turner Society, reemerging himself in German customs and language. The Turner Society appealed to Hummel, particularly because of its advocacy of intellectual freedom. He began working on the steamers on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, earning more money and seeing more parts of the country. In 1852, he arrived in St. Louis, Missouri, where he found maternal relatives who convinced him to stay and find work. Six months later, he moved to Chicago and continued his involvement in the local Turner Society.Historic Downtown New Ulm , City of New Ulm, Accessed December 7, 2010. The Boesch, Hummel, and Maltzahn Block in its early years; note the original storefronts. Hummel moved to New Ulm in 1856, soon after its founding, and helped form its own Turner Society and taught gymnastics in the new hall. He tried making a living in several areas including farming, operating a drug store and running a saloon, before co-founding the New Ulm Creamery Company in 1880 and finding success. With the profits he opened a general store on Minnesota Street in downtown New Ulm. By 1890 he was one of the most successful businessmen in the city, he joined Werner Boesch and Edward Maltzahn to open a new business block. They hired architect Carl F. Struck of Minneapolis, who had previously designed the Brown County Courthouse. When the structure was built in 1890, the structure was part of the second generation of masonry blocks built to house retail establishments in New Ulm and the surrounding area; it is considered to be the most visually striking of that generation. Hummel continued running the store until 1903. Significance The Boesch, Hummel, and Maltzahn Block is noted for being the most elaborately detailed Main Street commercial building in the area. Similar buildings are commonly stripped of features such as cornices and projecting bay windows over time and various renovations. The wide, four-storefront facade, resulting in repetition add to the structure's impact on the local streetscape. The building was originally designed to house commercial storefronts on the first level with apartments on the second; the building continued to be used in this way at the time it was listed on the NRHP.

The prize was created in response to a proposal by businessman Liu Zhiqin that criticized the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. The chairman of the committee said that the award existed to \\"promote world peace from an Eastern perspective\\", and Confucian peace specifically. The original cash prize given to the winner in 2010 was ¥100,000 RMB (US$15,000). Despite an attempt by China's Ministry of Culture to ban the prize in September 2011, the original organizers re-established in Hong Kong as the \\"China International Peace Research Center\\", awarding the prize to Vladimir Putin in November 2011, to Kofi Annan and Yuan Longping in 2012, to Fidel Castro in 2014, to Robert Mugabe in 2015, and Hun Sen in 2017. The Chinese government has denied having any connections with the prize.中國否認頒「孔子和平獎」 台灣《聯合報》 The Prize Committee has been disbanded since 2018. Origins and first award The Confucius Peace Prize originated as a response to the announcement that Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo had won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize; the awarding of the prize to Liu was viewed negatively in China, with some in the government arguing that Liu did not promote \\"international friendship, disarmament, and peace meetings\\", the stated goals of the Nobel Peace Prize. Competing groups staked claims to its founding, and some have links to the Ministry of Culture. According to The New York Times, Liu Zhiqin, a prominent Chinese scholar and banker, was the first to propose the prize, in a commentary in the Global Times. Liu's commentary stated, \\"The Nobel Peace Prize Committee won Liu Xiaobo while losing the trust of 1.3 billion Chinese people. They support a criminal while creating 1.3 billion 'dissidents' that are dissatisfied with the Nobel Committee, which is definitely a bad decision. ... China's civil society should consider setting up a 'Confucius Peace Prize', launching the evaluation and selection and finding the real Peace Prize winners from all over the world. This is the best opportunity for the Chinese to declare China's view in peace and human rights to the world.\\" The Association of Chinese Indigenous Arts, which is registered with the Chinese Cultural Ministry, awarded the first prize to Taiwanese politician Lien Chan in December 2010, for his contribution to developing positive ties between Taiwan and mainland China. Lien never claimed the prize. China's Minister of Culture talked to the United Daily News in Taipei and stated they had never heard of this prize for Lien Chan until there was newspaper coverage. The Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao reported that the letter issued by the committee to Lien Chan did not have the Ministry of Culture's official seal. The award, consisting of a small sculpture and a bundle of banknotes, was collected by a young girl in front of an audience of some 100 journalists. In the jostling, one group tried to create the \\"Confucius World Peace Prize\\" to rival the \\"Confucius Peace Prize\\". Purported cancellation and second award In September 2011, the Ministry of Culture stated that it would be disbanding the organizers of Confucius Peace Prize and cancelling the prize. The Ministry stated in a news conference on September 17 that there was improper uses of the Ministry's name. The Association of Chinese Indigenous Arts was quick to blame a \\"rogue department\\" for the debacle surrounding the award. Despite the cancellation, on November 15, 2011, The Guardian reported that the original organizers had formed a new committee, the China International Peace Studies Center, in Hong Kong, where they awarded the second Confucius Peace Prize to Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin. Other contenders were Angela Merkel, Bill Gates, Jacob Zuma, Kofi Annan, Yuan Longping, Gyaincain Norbu (one of the Panchen Lamas), and Soong Chu-yu. Putin won for his opposition to NATO involvement in the Libyan Civil War as well as his decision to go to war in Chechnya in 1999. According to the committee, Putin's \\"Iron hand and toughness revealed in this war impressed the Russians a lot, and he was regarded to be capable of bringing safety and stability to Russia.\\" Putin was also praised for fulfilling his childhood dream of joining the KGB. The 2011 award, a gilded statuette of Confucius was given out on December 9 along with a certificate, although the committee did not mention a cash prize. The award ceremony featured a speech by Kong Qingdong. Kong claimed that the award accurately reflects Confucius's original vision of peace. The award and recipients The prize initially carried a financial reward of CNY100,000, and has been awarded at the same time as the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2012, the China International Peace Studies Centre boasted that the new reward of $1.5 million – mostly derived from sales of works of the committee chairman's, Qiao Damo – was \\"more than the US$1.2 million that the recipient of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, will receive\\". However, The Guardian reported in 2015 that the cash prize was worth CNY500,000 (£51,000).  2012  The shortlist for the 2012 award consisted of previous nominees Kofi Annan, Bill Gates, agricultural scientist Yuan Longping, and Gyancain Norbu, as well as Ban Ki-moon, Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, Chinese philosopher Tang Yijie, and Wang Dingguo, the last surviving female participant in Mao Zedong's Long March. Due to a tie in the voting, the committee announced that Annan and Yuan would share the award.  2013  Zen master Yicheng was awarded the 2013 prize for his work as chairman of the Buddhist Association of China and his contribution for Chinese Buddhism. As an addition to the Peace Prize in 2013 the first Confucius Art Prize was awarded. A gold medal was for calligrapher Ouyang Zhongshi and silver medals for Yang Lin and Hou Mingming.  2014  The Global Times reported that nominees included former Cuban president, Fidel Castro, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The 2014 recipient of the prize was Castro, who when leader of Cuba, \\"never used any violence or force when faced with problems and conflicts in international relations, especially in Cuba's relationship with the United States.\\" Castro's prize was received by a Cuban student in China.  2015  Nominated for the award in 2015 were the Chinese Taoist Association, Ban Ki-moon, former Japanese prime ministers Yasuo Fukuda and Tomiichi Murayama, Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev, Bill Gates, Chinese-American politician Anna Chennault, South Korean president Park Geun-hye, Hsing Yun of the Fo Guang Shan Buddhist movement in Taiwan, and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Mugabe was eventually declared the winner for \\"working tirelessly to build the political and economic stability of his country, bringing peace to the people of Zimbabwe, strongly supporting pan-Africanism and African independence, and making unparalleled contributions for the renaissance of African civilisation.\\" One of the committee's 76 members disclosed that only 36 voted for Mugabe over concerns for his record, saying that \\"Mugabe has been in power for such a long time that he could be easily be labelled a dictator, tyrant or despot.\\" Mugabe, who made a speech to the United Nations that day in which he declared that \\"we are not gays\\", did not collect his prize. The award drew out critics of Mugabe and his human rights record. An unofficial spokesman said that the Chinese government had notified Zimbabwe that it was not associated with the conferring organisation. Mugabe repudiated the award, a spokesman saying that he \\"receives many prizes without even knowing, approving or receiving them. What is dramatic in this case is that oppositional interests drew a revolver at the mentioning of an honour or prize to Robert Mugabe. That is what Hitler did when someone mentioned ‘culture’ to him\\". 2016 The prize for 2016 was awarded posthumously to three Chinese peacekeepers who were killed while serving on United Nations peacekeeping missions in Mali and South Sudan. Shen Liangliang was killed while serving on the mission in Mali on May 31, 2016 while Yang Shupeng and Li Lei were killed while serving on the mission in South Sudan on July 10, 2016. 2017 Candidates for the 2017 prize were Hun Sen, Gyaincain Norbu, Rodrigo Duterte, Bashar al-Assad, Angela Merkel, Hsing Yun, the Chinese Taoist Association, Xuecheng, Pope Francis, and Yancan. The Prime Minister of Cambodia Hun Sen was announced to be the winner.  Responses  Most organizations have not treated the prize seriously. The Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China denied any cooperation with the Association of Chinese Indigenous Arts to present the prize, stating that prior to foreign press reports, the Ministry \\"had never even heard of the name\\". The ministry added that \\"the government is very careful\\" and \\"if the government genuinely intended to establish a 'Confucius Peace prize', it would not have been implemented so sloppily.\\" Mainland media did not widely report about the prize in 2010, with journalists claiming that they had come across neither the organization nor the prize, believing it to be \\"闹剧\\" (a farce). Netizens in Mainland China responded to the Prize with widespread humour as well as derision, referring to the prize organizers as \\"bullheaded dreaming idiots\\", \\"jokes\\", and \\"embarrassments to Chinese\\",《京報籲設「孔子和平獎」惹恥笑》 - 蘋果日報 - 6-12-2010 as well as suspicion that the prize was a practical joke. The Confucius Peace Prize's first winner, Lien Chan, claimed he had not officially heard that he had won; an aide said that they had only received \\"secondhand information from journalists\\". This contradicted a statement in the Global Times by the chairman of the Confucius Peace Prize Committee, Tan Liuchang, that Lien had been contacted by the committee. Tsai Chi-chang, a spokesperson for the opposition Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan, said the award should not be taken seriously. Officials from the Taiwanese government are reported to have found the award of the Confucius Peace Prize to Lien Chan \\"amusing\\". When asked by a reporter about the prize, a spokesman for Vladimir Putin said that he had heard about the award through the press, but that \\"we do not know much about the prize.\\" Western media was more split: some reacted to the prize with mockery, but others treated it more seriously. The Economist compared the substitute award to the reaction by Nazi Germany and the creation of the German National Prize for Art and Science after Carl von Ossietzky was prohibited from accepting his Nobel Prize in 1935, as well as the Soviet Union preventing Andrei Sakharov from accepting his Nobel Peace Prize in 1975. National Review likewise compared the prize to Hitler's and Stalin's responses to the Nobel Peace Prize. Slate has described the prize as \\"[s]omething of a trolling exercise\\". The Global Times reported that the five 2011 nominees were selected based on their being the winners of an online poll. However, when asked about the details of the online vote, the organizer said they failed to carry it out because of \\"technical problems\\", The South China Morning Post reported.

It tells the story of the fifteen-year- old Boy, his companion, Willow, and his new master, Kepler, in the aftermath of the death of Valerian, Boy's previous master.http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/s/marcus-sedgwick/dark-flight- down.htmhttp://www.bewilderingstories.com/issue170/books.html Plot introduction Boy has survived the terrors of life with the magician Valerian, dark magic and deadly chases through gloomy catacombs, but he is still on the run. Now, as the City lies frozen in the icy claws of winter, he is captured and incarcerated in the Emperor Frederick's palace. Boy is transported to a world of gilded finery, splendour and wealth beyond his wildest imagining. But beneath its golden veneer, this world is just as full of madness and cruelty, of desperation, closely guarded secrets and terrifying revelations.http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/s/marcus-sedgwick/dark-flight- down.htm Synopsis Five days after New Year's Eve and Valerian's death, Boy and Willow have been separated by Kepler, who needs Boy further, and is determined not to let Willow get in his way. The two set off for the funeral of Korp, the director of Valerian's old theatre. To Kepler's chagrin, Willow is also there, having snuck out from the previous job that Kepler got for her at a local orphanage. The theatre violinist, Georg, insists on dragging Boy and Kepler off to a local tavern. Willow follows, and, despite Kepler's attempts to leave, he is dragged into a game of Snapdragon, which he finds he is not very good at. Meanwhile, Boy and Willow, finally reunited, discuss the possibility of abandoning Kepler and eloping together. Discovering Kepler is unconscious after drinking too much absinthe, Boy decides to return him home, and is offered help by Wilfred, the strongman. Before leaving, Boy and Willow make plans to meet at the St. Valentine's fountain, and share their first kiss. The next day, Boy seeks out the mysterious Book that Valerian had sought, and Kepler had taken, in the hope he will find out whether or not Valerian really was his father, and what is real name is. However, a hungover Kepler arrives and orders Boy to return to Valerian's house to collect the Camera, which Valerian had spent money having built in order to determine when Fate was coming. At the house, Boy finds the Camera, but before he can retrieve it, he is apprehended by some members of the City Watch, who suspect him of looting. Boy is dragged off to the Palace, where the ancient Emperor Frederick lives. At the St. Valentine Fountain, Willow grows angry at Boy's no-show, and storms off to Kepler's to confront him. There, she discovers that Boy has not returned, and they set off to look for him at the Yellow House. Upon arrival, they find signs of a struggle, and find the Camera, which Kepler had sent Boy to find. Knowing where Boy is, Kepler insists on rescuing Boy alone. Willow, however, heads to the Palace and tries to find a way in. Unable to, she runs into Kepler, who decides to help. At the Imperial Palace Court, Boy is presented to the Emperor Frederick by his shaven-headed servant, Maxim. Frederick, an elderly and hypochondriac who is obsessed with his health, living an extravagant lifestyle and finding immortality, is uninterested in the findings and orders Boy be thrown into the river. Before the City Watchmen can do so, however, Maxim intervenes and instead has Boy dragged down to the castle dungeon. Boy soon picks the lock of his cell and tries to get out, but is unable to. In his wait, he is troubled by dreams of a dark flight of stairs, leading to where he believes the Phantom, a savage murdering creature from the previous book, is kept. Eventually, a blinded jailer brings him some food, and is carrying a second one for another prisoner, whom Boy is unable to see. Maxim questions Boy about the Book, believing Valerian had it. When Boy is unable to answer, Maxim grows frustrated and leaves. It emerges that Maxim is seeking the Book because Frederick, determined not to die, as he has no heir to the throne, and is the last in line for his family, is attempting to find a way to become immortal, and is relying on astrologers, alchemists and necromancers to help him, and if a person does not impress him, he has them killed. Maxim hopes that the Book will provide the answer. Boy further investigates the dungeon and, further away from his cell, he meets an elderly man, who lives in a gilded, well-furnished cell within the dungeon. The man, whose memory has left him, introduces himself as Bedrich, and reveals that he is Frederick's former doctor. He is now meant to take care of the Phantom, which resides within the Palace. The next time a meal is brought, Bedrich is brought with it. He is told he may be released. Sensing an opportunity to get help, he asks Bedrich to send a message to Willow, telling her to steal the Book (from Kepler, though this is not verbally mentioned) and return. Bedrich starts to tell Boy that he knows about this \\"Book,\\" and upstairs, Frederick questions Maxim about Boy. Having forgotten he had ordered Boy's death, he demands that Boy be cleaned up and brought to him. Back downstairs, Bedrich reveals that the Book is not only full of knowledge, but also very dangerous. It was brought to Frederick by the Beebe family (the grave of Gad Beebe having been the one Boy and Valerian had attempted to retrieve in the previous book). Before he can go on, two guard arrive and take boy away, leaving Bedrich in the cell, and it is revealed that their interaction was actually being spied on. Boy is taken to some luxurious quarters, where he is given a bath, some food and clothing and a bed by another blinded servant. The next morning, he is interrogated again by Maxim, who seems to know exactly what has been said, and about Willow. Boy realises he was spying on the meeting, and feels awful at having betrayed Willow's name. He is taken down to the Court, where Frederick is holding a meeting of applicants for a Royal Position. Boy immediately impresses Frederick when he exposes a secret that an alchemist is using to try to prove his alchemy, leading to the man's death. The next demonstrators turn out to be Kepler and Willow, who introduce themselves as Arbronsius and Mina. They show Frederick the apparatus that Boy had been sent to collect. The demonstration of the trick is enough to win them Frederick's favour, and he appoints them to Royal positions. That night, Boy manages to work out where Willow and Kepler are staying, and, after escaping from his room, goes out to find Willow. As he is crossing the snowy courtyard, he runs right into The Phantom, which is even scarier than he had expected. The next day, Maxim storms into his room, angry, because Willow was not at the orphanage. He eventually explains to Boy that he hopes the Book will provide the answer to immortality. Boy scoffs at this idea, mentioning that \\"How's he going to know any different unless he dies.\\" Maxim has an idea, and drags Boy down to the Court. There, Boy manages to talk to Willow and Kepler. Maxim lies to Frederick and says that he does have the Book, and Frederick decides he does not wish to see it, as it might evoke bad memories, and believes Maxim. Boy arranges to meet with Willow that midnight. That night, as Maxim is planning his next move, Boy meets up with Willow in the throne room. Boy discovers that Kepler was indeed lying about Valerian being his father, as the mention of the woman Valerian had loved, Helene, was enough to persuade Valerian that Boy was his son. He discovers that Kepler has the book with him, and refuses to leave until he reads it. The two make a plan to try to retrieve the book before Frederick becomes immortal, and share a brief kiss before departing. The next day, Maxim calls a meeting of the Court, planning to use Frederick's immortality to advance his own power. To his dismay, Boy, whom the Emperor has drawn a favourable eye towards, is made to attend. Maxim goes through an elaborate ceremony, and gets the Emperor to drink a potion behind some screens. Frederick falls asleep for a few minutes, before waking, believing himself to be immortal. Boy realises, however, that it is a trick. Before the guards can kill the astrologers, Boy immediately steps forward and shouts that it is a trick, mentioning the very fact that Frederick cannot conclusively prove he is immortal unless he dies, as he himself had said. Frederick chooses to listen to Boy and demands the Book. Trapped, Maxim confesses that he was lying and, after many years of being pushed around, finally explodes at the Emperor, who orders that he be killed. Before the guards can get him, Maxim escapes through a secret door, and Frederick orders the guards to search for him. Boy and Willow take advantage of the confusion to try to flee from Kepler. Willow escapes, but Boy is caught by Kepler. At that moment, Maxim returns - with The Phantom on a chain. He reveals that Frederick does have a son - that fifteen years before, one of Maxim's consorts, Sophia Beebe, fell into a relationship with the Emperor. The son that she produced was, in fact, The Phantom, who is, technically his heir. Frederick orders his guards on Maxim, but the Phantom escapes, as does Boy. Boy escapes to Willow's quarters, where he finds her reading the Book. Boy demands to know what she has read, so he can finally know his name and his history. Willow, however, begs him not to read it, saying that it is not in his interests to, but he insists on knowing. Before doing so, Willow finally tells Boy that she loves him. She then informs Boy that his father is none other than the Emperor Frederick. She reveals that Sophia Beebe, The Phantom's mother, had given birth to two sons - Boy was the second one, while the Phantom is, in fact, his disfigured brother. When Frederick had locked away the disfigured one, Sophia had fled with Boy, her healthy child, faking his death. In response, Frederick stripped the Beebes of their favour and titles, all the while searching for Sophia. After proclaiming that he loves Willow back, Boy confesses that he does not care about his finding. Willow reveals that Kepler knows his secret, and Boy realises that Kepler had wanted Boy to curry favour from the Emperor by revealing his healthy son, and heir to the throne. Boy does not want to be heir, however. At that moment, The Phantom arrives at the balcony, but does not attack them. Instead, it approaches Boy, and the two share some brotherly affection. Suddenly, Kepler arrives and attacks The Phantom. The two fight, and fall over the balcony to their deaths. With both The Phantom and Kepler dead, Boy and Willow prepare to leave. Boy, however, throws the book into a fire. It is eventually ablaze, and burns, taking its evil and magic with it. The two leave the Palace, by jumping off the Palace walls. They spend the night at Kepler's. The next morning, Boy and Willow take the now-deceased Kepler's money, clothing, blankets and valuables. They plan to leave the City and, as two young lovers, set up their own future. Before leaving, though, Willow makes one final revelation - that \\"Boy\\" was, in fact, Boy's real name, as it was what Sophia had actually called him while the two were on the run. In a final scene, the Emperor Frederick, now suffering completely from dementia, calls for Maxim, whom he has had locked in the very cell that he imprisoned the Phantom in. Characters * Boy returns as the main character of the novel. Having moved on from living in squalor with Valerian, still not knowing about his past or even his own name, and with only his love for Willow to drive him on, he is being kept by Kepler for unknown reasons. With only the Book to give him his answers, and imprisoned inside the Emperor's palace, he has to find a way to locate the Book, so that he may flee with Willow, with whom he has developed a romance. * Willow, a young orphan and Boy's companion, returns. She is separated from Boy by Kepler and given a job in the local orphanage. Despite this, she hopes to elope with Boy so that they may share a future together. This is motivated mostly by her need for a companion, and her love for him. However, their plans go wrong when Boy is captured and imprisoned in the Imperial Palace. Willow conspires with Kepler to try to rescue Boy, even though the two have very different intentions plans for him. * Kepler, a former friend of Valerian, who saved Boy from the clutches of Fate, returns. Knowing the truth about Boy's past, he hopes to use Boy as a means of advancing his status and becoming a favourite of the Emperor Frederick. When Boy is captured, he conspires with Willow to rescue him, even though his plans for Boy are very different from Willow's. At the very end, he believes The Phantom is about to kill Boy, and attacks it. The two collapse off a balcony and fall to their deaths. * The Emperor Frederick, an elderly and small man, the last in line of his family, and the long-forgotten Emperor of a great Empire, is a main character in the novel. He is comically obsessed with his health, declaring that everyone is \\"trying to kill me\\" and is something of a hypochondriac. This is because he wants everyone to believe he has no heir to the throne, and, when he dies, the Empire will collapse. He has a vast collection of servants catering to his every whim (of which he has many) and relies on astrologers, alchemists and many other Court favourites to try to help him unlock the secret of immortality, believing this is the only way to retain his family monarchy. He also suffers from dementia, often forgetting orders he gave or offering conflicting orders, to the frustration of his servants, especially Maxim. * Maxim is the Emperor Frederick's chief servant. He is described as being tall, with a shaven head. Maxim is forced to cater to the Emperor's many whims, all the while seeking the Book which will help him unlock the Emperor's immortality, so that he can get rid of the astrologers who may turn on him when the Emperor dies. He is very violent and often abuses others, including Boy. After attempting a trick Boy gave him and failing, he finally snaps and drags the Phantom up to the throne room, to prove that the Emperor does have an heir. However, Frederick's guards are still loyal to the Emperor, The Phantom escapes, and Maxim is quickly locked up in the Phantom's old prison. * The Phantom is a disfigured and ghastly creature that was responsible for many murders in the previous novel. This is because the beast is cannibalistic in nature. The Phantom is, in fact, a human being, and turns out to be Boy's disfigured twin brother. Many who fall from Frederick's favour are sent to the Phantom to be killed. He is tended to by an elderly, imprisoned doctor named Bedrich. He is briefly reunited with his twin brother, and the two share some brotherly affection before Kepler attacks the Phantom, sending the two hurtling off a balcony to their deaths.

The G2-M checkpoint occurs between the G2 and M phases. G2-M arrest The G2-M DNA damage checkpoint is an important cell cycle checkpoint in eukaryotic organisms that ensures that cells don't initiate mitosis until damaged or incompletely replicated DNA is sufficiently repaired. Cells which have a defective G2-M checkpoint, if they enter M phase before repairing their DNA, it leads to apoptosis or death after cell division. The defining biochemical feature of this checkpoint is the activation of M-phase cyclin-CDK complexes, which phosphorylate proteins that promote spindle assembly and bring the cell to metaphase. Cyclin B-CDK 1 Activity CyclinB- Cdk1 Hysteresis Graph The cell cycle is driven by proteins called cyclin dependent kinases that associate with cyclin regulatory proteins at different checkpoints of the cell cycle. Different phases of the cell cycle experience activation and/or deactivation of specific cyclin-CDK complexes. CyclinB-CDK1 activity is specific to the G2/M checkpoint. Accumulation of cyclin B increases the activity of the cyclin dependent kinase Cdk1 human homolog Cdc2 as cells prepare to enter mitosis. Cdc2 activity is further regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of its corresponding activators and inhibitors. Through a positive feedback loop, CyclinB-Cdc2 activates the phosphatase Cdc25 which in turn deactivates the CyclinB-Cdc2 inhibitors, Wee1 and Myt1. Cdc25 activates the complex through the removal of phosphates from the active site while Wee1 inactivates the complex through the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, specifically tyrosine-15. This loop is further amplified indirectly through the coordinated interaction of the Aurora A kinase and the Bora cofactor. During the G2 phase, Bora accumulates and forms an activation complex with Aurora A. This complex then regulates the activation of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1). Plk1 phosphorylates Wee1, targeting it for degradation through the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex (SCF complex), and activates Cdc25 through phosphorylation with combined action activating Cdc2. The combined activity and complex of Cdc2, Cdc25, and Plk1 with the accumulation of cyclin B activates the CyclinB-Cdc2 complex, promoting entry into mitosis. Many proteins involved in this positive feedback loop drive the activation of the CyclinB-Cdc2 complex because entry into mitosis requires an all-or-none response. The Novak-Tyson model is a mathematical model used to explain such regulatory loop that predicted the irreversible transition into mitosis driven by hysteresis. Through experiments in Xenopus laevis cell-free egg extracts, such model was confirmed as the basis for entry into mitosis. Once cyclin concentration reaches a certain minimum activation threshold, Cdc2 is rapidly activated. It remains in this state until activity falls below a separate inactivation threshold at which it is abruptly inactivated through tyrosine phosphorylation by Wee1 and Myt1. In the case of unreplicated DNA, the cyclin concentration threshold for Cdc2 activation is further increased. Through this mechanism, there exists two separate steady-state conditions separated by an unstable steady state. The bistable and hysteretic nature of CyclinB-Cdc2 ensures a highly regulated nature of the G2/M checkpoint. Pathway Response to DNA Damage Proteins that localize to sites of DNA damage in the G2 phase initiate a signaling cascade that regulates important components of the pathway, as described above, therefore controlling mitotic entry via CyclinB- Cdc2 activity. Negative regulation of CyclinB-Cdc2 activity results in a delay in mitotic entry, which is important for cells to repair any DNA damage that may have accumulated after S phase and necessary before cell division can continue. Proteins that function in the G2-M checkpoint were originally identified in yeast screens that looked for mutants which show enhanced sensitivity to radiation, termed \\"rad\\" mutants. Inefficient repair of DNA damaged by ionizing radiation or chemical agents in these mutants revealed proteins essential in this pathway. Early signaling proteins in the checkpoint pathway are members of a family of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, rad3 in yeast and ATR in vertebrates, that are believed to localize to sites of DNA damage. Rad3 phosphorylates rad26 which is required to initiate, but not maintain the checkpoint. Rad3 also phosphorylates a number of other proteins whose absence abolishes checkpoint DNA repair, including rad1, rad9, hus1 and rad17. It has been hypothesized that rad9, hus1 and rad17 are similar to proteins involved in forming the clamp that increases the processivity of DNA polymerase during DNA replication. In agreement with this idea, rad17 is similar to proteins involved in loading the clamp onto DNA. This supports a model where phosphorylation by rad3 causes recruitment of these proteins to sites of DNA damage where they mediate the activity of DNA polymerases involved in DNA repair. The main rad3 effector is the kinase Chk1, which is required for the G2-M arrest in response to DNA-damaging agents. Chk1 is an effector protein kinase that maintains mitotic cyclin in an inactive state and is phosphorylated by rad3 between S phase and mitosis, implicating its specific role in G2 arrest. Its upregulation through overexpression can induce arrest independent of DNA damage. In addition, overexpression of Chk1 rescues the radiation sensitivity of rad mutants, presumably by allowing DNA repair to take place before entry into mitosis. The presence of DNA damage triggers the ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) or ATR (Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 related) pathways which activate the Chk2 and Chk1 kinases, respectively. These kinases act upstream of Cdc25 and Wee1, the direct regulators of the CyclinB-Cdc2 complex. Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylate Cdc25, inhibiting its phosphorylating activity and marking it for ubiquitinated degradation. These pathways also stimulate the tumor suppressor p53. p53 regulates the function of the Cdk2 inhibitor p21 and the 14-3-3 proteins that phosphorylate (and thereby inactivate) and sequester Cdc25 in the cytoplasm, respectively. Recent studies have also suggested that Cdk1 and 14-3-3 positively regulate Wee1 in a similar manner. The hyperphosphorylation of Wee1 by Cdk1 allows for the binding of 14-3-3, sequestering Wee1 to the nucleus and enhancing its ability to phosphorylate Cdc2. The phosphorylation of both Wee1 and Cdc25 prevents Cdc2 activation. The ATM/ATR pathway also results in the negative regulation of Plk1 that contributes to the stability of Wee1. The stabilization of Wee1 and Myt1 ensures the cells arrest in G2 and allows for DNA repair. Multiple pathways are involved in the checkpoint response and thus, the targeting of Cdc25 is not the sole mechanism underlying cell cycle delay, as some models have proposed. The cooperativity between the positive regulation of Wee1 and the negative regulation of Cdc25 by Chk1 in response to unreplicated or damaged DNA results in a strong G2 arrest. The increase in the amount of Wee1 and the decrease in the amount of Cdc25 contributes to the increase in the cyclin B concentration threshold in the hysteresis loop needed to drive the cell into mitosis. Maintaining the Checkpoint Rad3 is required for activation of Chk1 and initiation of G2 arrest, but different proteins are believed to maintain G2 arrest so that sufficient DNA repair can occur. One such protein is rad18 that is required for G2 arrest even when Chk1 is phosphorylated and active. Thus, rad18 is required for G2/M checkpoint maintenance while Chk1 is required for checkpoint initiation. This is further supported by its additional function in DNA repair, specifically in the maintenance of chromosomal structures. Its necessity is demonstrated by the fact that in the absence of rad18, DNA is unable to be repaired even when G2 arrest is prolonged by other means. The maintenance of such arrest in the G2 phase is further sustained by p53 and p21. In the absence of p53 or p21, it was demonstrated that radiated cells progressed into mitosis. The absence of p21 or 14-3-3 cannot sufficiently inhibit the CyclinB-Cdc2 complex, thus exhibiting the regulatory control of p53 and p21 in the G2 checkpoint in response to DNA damage. p53 mutations can result in a significant checkpoint deficit, which has important implications in the treatment of cancer. Checkpoint Inactivation Inactivation of both Wee1 and Cdc25 abolishes the G2-M DNA damage checkpoint. Absence of Wee1 or removal of the tyrosine-15 site removes negative regulation of Cdc2 activity and causes cells to enter mitosis without completing repair, which effectively abolishes the G2-M checkpoint. Absence of Cdc25 arrests cells in G2, but still allows activation of the G2-M checkpoint, implicating that both the activation of Wee1 and deactivation of Cdc25 as important regulatory steps in the checkpoint. Inactivation of Chk1 is sufficient to surpass the checkpoint and promote entry into mitosis, regardless if DNA damage is repaired. Yet, little is still known about the exact mechanism regarding checkpoint termination with possible mechanisms including protein phosphatases reversing activating phosphorylations, targeted ubiquitin degradation of activating proteins, and checkpoint antagonists promoting mitosis through independent pathways. Cancer Many cell cycle regulators like Cdks, cyclins, and p53 have been found to have abnormal expression in cancer. More specifically, they have been implicated in being involved in the G2/M transition by localizing to the centrosome, which thus leads to studies in manipulating such proteins in order to improve cancer’s sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy. Chk1 has important implications in drug targeting for cancer as its function acts in response to DNA damage. The cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy are currently being studied in the modulation of the G2/M transition, concerning both checkpoint abrogation or checkpoint arrest. Many therapies focus on inactivating the checkpoint in order to force cells with excess DNA damage to proceed through mitosis and induce cell death.

On July 7, 2011, less than 24 hours after an article on Reds.com said there would be no transaction, the Reds optioned Janish and recalled Cozart.

Cozart covered second and had to reach into the line of the runner, Nate McLouth, to field the throw. McLouth slid into Cozart's arm, hyperextending the latter's elbow. Replays showed that McLouth would likely have been safe anyway. On August 12, Cozart had Tommy John surgery to repair the torn ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow, ending his season.

He held leadership posts in international and Hungarian communist organizations until his disappearance in 1921. Biography Early years Rudnyánszky was born in 1885 in Hungary. Rudnyánszky became a lawyer and was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War. Serving as a cavalry officer, he was taken prisoner and by 1917 had embraced Bolshevism.Branko Lazitch with Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pg. 407. Political career In Russia, he participated in the formation of the Hungarian Group within the Bolsheviks' Federation of Foreign Groups. He succeeded Béla Kun as chairman of the federation when the latter returned to Hungary in late 1918. Rudnyánszky signed the call for the creation of a Third International in January 1919 and in March was the only Hungarian at the founding congress of the Comintern. When the Hungarian Soviet Republic was established (also in March 1919), Rudnyánszky became that government's representative in Moscow. In 1920, at the Second World Congress of the Comintern, he was elected to the organization's executive committee (ECCI) and served on its five-member presidium. Disappearance and legacy While still holding these positions, Endre Rudnyánszky failed to appear at the organization's Third Congress in June 1921, disappearing while in possession of significant Comintern funds. His disappearance was never explained and, according to Béla Kun, he was expelled in absentia from the party. However, according to Pierre Broué he had returned to Russia five years later and was imprisoned for fifteen years, allegedly remaining in Russia until he was last seen in 1943.

She and her husband ran a boys' school in India. She strongly advocated a national system of education for the country. Family Julia Barrett was born on 21 October 1808, probably in Richmond, Surrey, as the eldest of the five children of Henry Barrett (1756–1843) and his wife, Charlotte, née Francis (1786–1870), the niece of Fanny Burney (Madame D'Arblay), who first, rather drastically, edited her journals and letters.Fanny Burney. Diary and Letters. 7 vols (London: Henry Colburn, 1842–46). Julia was a favourite with the elderly Fanny, who remarked on her \\"very good sense, & a truly blyth juvenile love of humour\\".Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney. Vol. 11, ed. Joyce Hemlow, et al. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984), p. 429. She and her sister Hetty (died 1833) suffered from tuberculosis and their mother took them to France and then Italy, where they came in touch with Fanny's sister Sarah Burney. Sarah Burney wrote of them in her correspondence and regularly described Julia as a beauty.The Letters of Sarah Harriet Burney, ed. Lorna J. Clark. (Athens, GA, and London: University of Georgia Press, 1997), passim. Julia made a full recovery in 1834. Julia Barrett's many admirers included Fanny Burney's parson son Alexander d'Arblay, but she chose instead to marry a widower with children, James Thomas (died 1840) on 2 August 1836, to the disappointment of her family. Thomas took her to India, where he was a judge in the Madras Presidency. They moved to Rajahmundry in 1837, where they kept a boys' school. Her son James Cambridge Thomas was born on 3 February 1839. The ill-health of her daughter Henrietta Anne Thomas (born 1837) obliged her to return to England in December 1839. After her husband's death in 1840, Julia Thomas was remarried to Charles Maitland (1815–1866), a writer and Anglican curate of Lyndhurst, Hampshire, in the New Forest, on 5 November 1842. They had a daughter Julia Caroline (1843–1890). Maitland died of tuberculosis at the home of her son-in-law, Rev. David Wauchope, at Stower Provost, Dorset, on 29 January 1864. Writings and beliefs Julia Maitland's first publication of note was her Letters from Madras, During the Years 1836–1839, by a Lady, which was published anonymously in 1843.This was reprinted in 1846. A scholarly edition edited by Alyson Price has appeared (Otley: Woodstock Books, 2003). . The school she and her husband ran in Rajahmundry accepted boys of different castes and taught in both English and the local language (\\"Gentoo\\"). Controversially, it was strongly Christian. She also set up a multilingual reading room and assisted in starting other schools nearby. The book ends with a plea for a national system of education in India, as the route to modernization: \\"If every civilian up the country were to have a poor little school like ours, it would do something in time.\\"Letters from Madras, 1843, p. 254. Quoted in Wang (2004). She also made strong efforts to learn local languages, helped with famine relief, and investigated and condemned the South Indian slave trade. Later, Maitland wrote three books for children, all of them popular in their day: Historical Acting Charades (1847); The Doll and Her Friends, or Memoirs of the Lady Seraphina, illustrated by Hablot Knight Browne (1852); and Cat and Dog, or Memoirs of Puss and the Captain, illus. Harrison Weir (1854). These were both humorous and didactic, promoting politeness, benevolence and generosity. She commented at the end of Cat and Dog, \\"I would propose Puss and Captain as an example of a new and better method of 'Living Like Cat and Dog'.\\"Cat and Dog, 1854, p. 99. Quoted in Wang (2004).

Concept and creation Oerba Yun Fang is voiced by Rachel Robinson in English, and Mabuki Andou in Japanese. She was originally intended to be male. When they changed her to be female, they decided to give her sex appeal, while removing it from Lightning in order to differentiate them. One aspect of Fang is her desire to protect Oerba Dia Vanille at whatever cost in Final Fantasy XIII, though she has feelings of resignation in Lightning Returns. Director Motomu Toriyama described this as the dark side of her heart. The Japanese version of the game use an Okinawan dialect for both Fang and Vanille, while her voice in the English version was done with an Australian accent. This decision was made by the localization team to make them seem foreign from the rest of the cast. They had the voice direction team look into Australian and New Zealand accents for this. Appearances Oerba Yun Fang first appears in Final Fantasy XIII. She also appears in its sequels, Final Fantasy XIII-2 and Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII. She also appears in various spin-off titles, including World of Final Fantasy and Theatrhythm Final Fantasy. Reception Initial reception for Oerba Yun Fang was positive. Writer Mattie Brice called her \\"Women of the Year 2010.\\" Complex writers Peter Rubin and Ryan Woo praised voice actress Rachel Robinson for her performance of Fang. GameSpot writers Garrett Martin and Maddy Myers included the relationship between Vanille and Fang in their list of the best love stories in video games, regardless of whether it is romantic or platonic. They say it may be \\"the only glimpse of human warmth in this otherwise ice-cold adventure.\\" Writer Kevin VanOrd noted his excitement to see Fang in Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII and that he wishes he could play a video game starring her. Writer Joe Juba was disappointed that Fang, one of XIIIs best characters, is in a background role in XIII-2. However, Vice writer Aoife Wilson found her and Vanille's role in the ending to be one of the greatest Final Fantasy moments. They attributed this to the relationship between the two characters, which they note is implied to be romantic. Video Game Music Online praised her theme music, though felt that it did not fit her character. Fang and Vanille's relationship has received generally positive reception. The relationship is a physically intimate one, causing fans to interpret it as a romantic relationship. Screen Rant writer Scott Baird speculated that Fang's original status as a male character may have influenced the current relationship between Fang and Vanille, while RPGFan writer Chris Winkler speculated that this resulted in Fang being described as stronger than other male characters. Writer Adam Beck noted that the characters Oerba Dia Vanille and Oerba Yun Fang had opposite personalities, which helps their characterization during cutscenes. Gameological authors discuss the two characters' relationship, noting them as two of the only good characters in the game due to their \\"human, affecting relationship.\\" IGN writer Kat Bailey praised the two characters' chemistry. Writer Tim Turi expressed disappointment that she was central to the ending of Final Fantasy XIII rather than protagonist Lightning. Her Australian accent has received mixed reception. Writer Sammy Barker felt that it was ill-suited to her and found her irritating. Mattie Brice discusses how her and Vanille having Australian accents alongside their \\"tribal inspired clothing and the uncultivated depiction of their home world\\" helps to distinguish them from the rest of the cast, who speak with American accents.

The warrant enables the company to advertise the royal approval of distinction with the display of the royal Garuda (Phra Khrut), thus lending prestige to the company. The warrant is typically advertised on company hoardings, letter-heads and products by displaying the Garuda as appropriate.

It features the American rapper Eminem, who wrote the song alongside Skylar Grey and the producer Alex da Kid. It is the sequel to the 2010 hit single \\"Love the Way You Lie\\", which appears on Eminem's seventh studio album Recovery. It received positive reviews from critics and was performed for at the American Music Awards of 2010 on November 21, 2010, as part of a medley with \\"What's My Name?\\" and \\"Only Girl (In the World)\\". Background Following the release and commercial success of \\"Love the Way You Lie\\" in 2010, Eminem wanted to record an alternative version with Rihanna as the lead vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: \\"When I first heard the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. I just felt like you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's no way you can outdo that, so why compete with it?\\". She said when she first heard the original demo of the song in the studio with Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey, her reservations about recording it went away. While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem. \\"Love the Way You Lie\\" and \\"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\\" were based on a demo written and recorded in late 2009 by Grey. Grey said \\"I wrote the demo initially for myself because I thought, ‘Oh, I have this big song, and now I have a little bit of a launching pad to put out my own stuff.\\" Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying \\"As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna's album, too.\\" The demo track by Grey, titled \\"Love the Way You Lie (Part III)\\", is on her extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey, which was released on January 17, 2012. Composition The piano and drums version, which features Eminem, appears as the final song on the standard edition of Loud, while the piano version, which excludes Eminem's part in the song, appears as a bonus track on the iTunes edition of Loud. \\"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\\" is a mid-tempo song, which incorporates the musical genres of hip hop and R&B.; According to sheet music published at Musicnotes, the song is written in common time with a moderate tempo of 83 beats per minute and is written in the key of G minor. Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of D5. Emily Mackay of NME commented about the vocals provided by Rihanna and Eminem in the song, stating that \\"There’s great contrast in Part II of ‘Love The Way You Lie’. With the balance of vocals neatly flipped and extra cavernous beats ramping up the drama, it wallows ever-deeper in the tortured relationship sketched out in Part I. Eminem at points is practically screaming with rage, and sounding, frankly, mental. The contrast with Rihanna's smoothly pitched pain (“Maybe I’m a masochist/Try to run but I don’t wanna never leave”) is delicious.\\" Critical reception Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that “Loud works the pop gizmos as neatly as any album this year, maintaining the Rihanna brand. But the album has a hermetic, cool calculation until it gets to 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' her take on the tortured hit she shared with Eminem. 'It's sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied,' she sings. A lone piano humanizes her first vocals, and she rides the ascending power ballad to a pained resolve; then Eminem delivers new verses in a spiraling rage. It's purely theatrical, but it's also, for a moment, raw. Christopher Richards of The Washington Post said that \\"With 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' the maniac-mouthed rapper is limited to just one verse, giving Rihanna the space to take ownership of the proceedings. Will the real Rihanna please stand up? She does -- and she sounds as remote as ever.\\" James Skinner of BBC Online viewed 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)' as being even better than the original. He said, \\"Eminem’s verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited about him in the first place. But it is Rihanna’s vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself, elevating it from a hit-and-miss collection into something oddly arresting.\\" Steve Jones of USA Today gave a mixed review of the collaboration, commenting, \\"Eminem puts in a cameo on 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)', which extends, but doesn't really add, to their earlier hit about a tortured relationship from his Recovery album.\\" Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner gave a negative review of the song, stating, \\"She collaborated with Eminem this summer on the controversial 'Love the Way You Lie', a song and hotly debated video conflating wild passion with crazed assault. She returns to this on Loud with \\"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\\", an extension of the melody and the arson metaphor, in which Eminem reappears with more histrionic rapping about hating her, loving her, hitting her and hugging her. It's an unnecessary sequel that further muddies the issue: Is this a social statement, or merely an artistic expression about some truly troubled and confused people.\\"  Chart performance  Both the original and the piano version of \\"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\\" were not made available to purchase individually in the majority of iTunes stores, and could only be bought along with the iTunes edition of the album. However, the song may be purchased separately as part of the album INdependent omen Volume II. It debuted on Canadian Hot 100 for the week of December 4, 2010, at number 19 and stayed on the chart for eight weeks. In South Korea, it peaked at number four on the International Chart. The song also debuted and peaked at number 160 on the UK Singles Chart due to strong digital sales upon the release of Loud. Live performances Rihanna performing \\"Love the Way You Lie Pt. II on the Loud Tour (2011) in Birmingham, England Rihanna performed a shortened version of the song as part of a medley with \\"What's My Name?\\" and \\"Only Girl (In the World)\\" at the American Music Awards of 2010 on November 21, 2010. Rihanna opened the performance singing an acappella version of \\"Love The Way You Lie (Part II)\\". She was sitting on a stylized tree hovering above a field of sable-colored blades of grass. Once she had finished the first frame of the song, she plummeted from the tree to the ground. Rihanna and Eminem performed the song together for the first time at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards on February 13, 2011 as part of a medley with \\"I Need a Doctor\\" performed by Eminem, Dr. Dre, Skylar Grey and Adam Levine from Maroon 5, who provided background vocals. The performance started with Rihanna singing on a B-stage in the middle of the audience, accompanied by Adam Levine on the keys. Eminem then appeared on the main stage to perform his part of the song, whilst Rihanna made her way from the B-stage to join him. The song then transitioned into \\"I Need a Doctor\\", where Dr. Dre emerged to join up with Skylar Grey for her debut performance. The song is also included in the encore section of Rihanna's Loud Tour, along with \\"Umbrella\\". Rihanna performed \\"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\\" at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend on May 24, 2012, as the eighth song on the set list.

After orchestrating a foiled attempt to capture Thessaloniki for Kuber, Mauros remained in the city and joined the ranks of the Byzantine aristocracy. He was bestowed the noble title of patrikios and was deeply involved in the power struggle between Justinian II and Philippikos Bardanes in the beginning of the 8th century. Mauros is the earliest attested leader, styled archon, to be placed by the Byzantine government in charge of a dependent people, in this case the Bulgars and Sermesianoi who had fled to Byzantium. Bulgar plot to capture Thessaloniki Mauros first appears in the sources in relation to Kuber's plot to conquer Thessaloniki in c. 686–687. From the testaments of contemporaneous historians, it is apparent that Mauros was a well-respected figure among the population ruled by Kuber, which consisted of Bulgars and Sermesianoi (Byzantine refugees from Sirmium on the Sava)Curta, p. 106 who had settled in Macedonia. Bulgarian historian Plamen Pavlov conjectures that Mauros may have been the kavhan (first minister) or ichirgu-boil (general of the highest rank) of Kuber.Андреев, p. 246 Regardless of whether he had an official title at all, Mauros was certainly among Kuber's most trusted associates.Бакалов, p. 75 Prior to his mission in Byzantium, Mauros was polygamous and a . Due to the increasing flight of Kuber's Byzantine subjects to Thessaloniki, he and Mauros hatched a plan to seize the city and use it as a base for future expansion. Mauros was seen as the ideal candidate to carry out the mission not only due to Kuber's trust in him, but also because Mauros was fluent in Slavic and Greek.Ziemann, p. 137 In line with the plan, Mauros was sent by Kuber to Thessaloniki pretending to be a refugee in charge of a group of people fleeing from Kuber. Mauros was not only welcomed inside the city, but also put in charge of all Bulgar and Sermesianoi refugees and given the title of hypatos by Byzantine Emperor Justinian II (r. 685–695, 705–711). Mauros appears to have commanded his own military force, consisting of former subjects of Kuber who were nominally part of the Byzantine army. While many of Thessaloniki's notables were suspicious of Mauros, his significant power enabled him to effectively deal with anyone who was close to uncovering his plot. Mauros intended to organize an uprising in Thessaloniki on Easter Saturday, the night before Easter, relying on the lack of preparedness among the city's defenders.Андреев, pp. 246–247Ziemann, pp. 137–138 However, his plan had perhaps been revealed to the Byzantines: the Byzantine navy and its chief admiral Sisinnios arrived in the city, preventing Mauros from undertaking any military activity. When the navy anchored in Thessaloniki, Mauros appeared to fall ill and spent a long time in bed under the surveillance of Sisinnios. While the allegations against Mauros were never proven, he was nonetheless dispatched outside the city along with Sisinnios' men, hoping to attract new refugees from Kuber and the local Slavs. Byzantine patrikios Seal of Mauros, one of Kuber's chief associates, from 684-685 AD. The inscription says: \\"Of Mauros, patrikios and archon of the Sermesianoi and Bulgaroi\\". Though Mauros did not sever his ties with Kuber, at the same time he continued his rise in the Byzantine hierarchy. Three preserved seals, the earliest from the late 7th century,Петров, pp. 300–301 testify to Mauros' elevation to the status of \\"patrikios and archon of the Sermesianoi and the Bulgaroi\\".Андреев, p. 247Oikonomidès, p. 38Ziemann, p. 140 In fact, Mauros appears to have been the first attested case in a long Byzantine tradition of granting rulers of unassimilated but pro-imperial populations the title of archon.Cameron, p. 149 Some researchers assert the identification of Kuber's associate with Mauros of the seals;Mango, p. 203 others do not exclude the possibility that the Mauros of the seals was the former's son. Historian Daniel Ziemann even suggests that Mauros the Bulgar may or may not be a different person from Mauros the patrikios.Ziemann, pp. 140, 199 Even as a member of the Byzantine nobility, Mauros made one more attempt to assist Kuber in an anti-Byzantine plot, this time threatening the life of the emperor. However, he was once again unsuccessful. The conspiracy was uncovered by his own son from a Byzantine woman, Mauros was imprisoned in a Constantinople suburb and stripped of his noble titles.Ziemann, p. 138Петров, p. 299 Despite this episode, the next reference to Mauros describes him once again as a patrikios in service of Justinian towards the end of that emperor's second reign in 705–711. In 711, he was involved in Justinian's attempt to quell a rebellion in Chersonesos, the main Byzantine city in Crimea. Mauros and another patrikios, Stephen, were dispatched to Chersonesos supported by the navy, where on the orders of the emperor they installed the spatharios Elias as governor. Even though their arrival was met with no apparent resistance, it was supervened by repressions and the torture of local leaders.Turtledove, pp. 74–75 On the way back from Chersonesos, the navy was hit by a horrible storm which claimed thousands of victims, but Mauros survived. Not long after the first expedition, he had to return to Chersonesos because sedition in the city had begun anew, and the newly installed Elias had joined the insurgents. Prior to Mauros' arrival, a naval expedition had failed to crush the uprising and its leaders had been murdered. Assessing the size of the rebellion, Justinian dispatched Mauros in charge of a large force complete with siege engines. Mauros had some success with the siege of the city early on, but the arrival of Khazar support for the insurgents caused Mauros to abandon Justinian and he too joined the ranks of his opponents, led by Philippikos Bardanes.Андреев, p. 248Mango, p. 111Turtledove, p. 76 Justinian apparently sought to intercept the ships of the insurgents at Sinope, on the Black Sea coast of Asia Minor, since he moved to that city. However, he arrived only to see the rebel navy pass Sinope en route to the capital Constantinople, where Philippikos (r. 711–713) was proclaimed emperor. As a close ally of the new ruler, Mauros was tasked with the arrest of Justinian's son Tiberios who had sought refuge inside the Church of St Mary of Blachernae.Mango, p. 113 Mauros and Ioannes, another associate of Philippikos, seized him and Tiberios was promptly executed.Turtledove, pp. 76–77 This is the last mention of Mauros in the sources, and his subsequent fate is unknown.

It stars a submissive named Jill, who has a boot fetish and is forced to climb up a tower after her Queen kicks her down it as punishment. Jill does this by jumping and slowly descending over obstacles. Jill can be defeated in one hit by these obstacles, but will return to the last check point. The game serves as an homage to the 1984 arcade game Bomb Jack and its console and computer sequel, Mighty Bomb Jack. It had follow-ups, such as Mighty Jill Off - Jill Off Harder Edition and Jill Off With One Hand. Jill made a cameo appearance in the 2010 video game Super Meat Boy as a playable character. The game's BDSM and lesbian themes were implemented by Anthropy, a BDSM practitioner, for the purpose of providing legitimate \\"dykes\\" in video games. She also made the game difficult, to fit in with its BDSM theme. James Harvey attempted to make this game appealing for the BDSM community. Mighty Jill Off has received praise for its BDSM themes from critics of websites such as Rock, Paper, Shotgun and Game Set Watch. It was also praised for its high level of difficulty by editors of GamesRadar and Bitmob. 1UP.com included it in its list of favourite free PC games of 2009. Gameplay and scenario In Mighty Jill Off, Jill can be defeated in one hit by several obstacles, including spikes as shown here. She is able to slow her descent mid-air to hover over spikes, which allows her to get through tight, spiked passageways. Mighty Jill Off incorporates several BDSM themes. It stars a submissive lesbian named Jill who has a boot fetish. She is kicked to the bottom of her Queen's tower for acting like a \\"greedy slut\\". Jill attempts to climb back up the tower and return to her Queen; once there, she is given affection, constricted and gagged, and made to do it again. Some of Mighty Jill Offs gameplay is borrowed from the 1986 arcade game Mighty Bomb Jack as a tribute. Players control Jill in only three ways: moving, jumping, and slowly descending. In the air, players may cause Jill to slowly descend by rapidly pushing the jump button while pointing in the direction that they want her to go. Players can switch direction while they do this. There are three types of obstacles: spikes, fire, and spiders; the latter can move to attack Jill when she comes close. Coming into contact with these obstacles kills Jill instantly, forcing her to start at the most recent checkpoint—typically located at a change in room. There is only one level in the game, but with several rooms in it. The screen scrolls vertically with Jill as she ascends up the tower. Each room transition is demonstrated by a change in the room's background colour. Jill has infinite lives, allowing players to play as long as they like without having to start the game over. Development Mighty Jill Off was designed and developed by American video game designer and critic Anna Anthropy, also known as Auntie Pixelante, in 2008. James Harvey provided the artwork for the game, while Andrew Toups created the music. Anthropy designed Mighty Jill Off to feature \\"dykes and perverts\\" to make up for \\"the distinct lack of real dyke characters and dyke desire in games\\". She argued that while \\"supposed dykes\\" are seen in commercials, these characters are \\"written and drawn by men\\". She said that \\"they don't look like us, they don't express themselves like us, they don't lust like us.\\" Anthropy compared the challenge of players who lead Jill through the game as similar to the challenges of a top who leads the bottom through a scene. Art design Concept art for Jill, drawn by James Harvey, showing the multiple concepts for Jill that he created before deciding on the final one. While the character artwork for Mighty Jill Off was created by James Harvey, Anthropy first designed Jill in sprite form. Harvey was initially wary of doing work that was BDSM-themed; he felt that it was easy for something that is both cartoony and sexual to make viewers feel uncomfortable and used the Japanese harem anime genre as an example. He added that in humorous, sexually-oriented cartoons, there is a \\"fine line\\" between \\"cute and funny\\" and \\"repulsive\\". He wanted to design the relationship between the Queen and Jill in a way that people in the BDSM community could identify with it, while also avoiding putting people off who were not into BDSM. He used European comics as a model for his art work, which he admired for the \\"permissive attitude they have to sex in cartoons\\". He also cited as inspiration specific Japanese cartoonists who he felt had successfully portrayed sex in animation such as Monkey Punch, the creator of Lupin III. Harvey designed the Queen based on a loose description by Anthropy. He wanted to make her \\"sexy and authoritative\\" and to look like a \\"fully grown human with relatively realistic proportions\\". He designed her to be an \\"amalgamation of every lesbian friend\\" he had \\"secretly been attracted to\\". He initially designed her with a veil, but felt that this was too superfluous and girly; he decided to adorn her with spikes instead. He attempted to design the title screen's background to \\"emphasise the drama of [the] situation, or to expressionistically[sic] symbolise the characters in the scene\\". However, there were some hurdles; he originally envisioned the Queen's tower to be a smooth, straight one, but felt that it would be too phallic, which would be meaningless symbolism given the game's content. Anthropy and Harvey held a contest for people to contribute fan art for the game; the five winners won hand-made Mighty Jill Off activity books, which included activities such as creating make-out partners for a group of \\"repulsive, tongue-waggling oafs\\", as well as writing a poem for the game's Queen. He scanned one of the books and posted it online, allowing others to contribute and send in their drawings. The book features several BDSM-related themes. Harvey was split between two designs for Jill. He either wanted to depict her as a \\"funny little megaman character\\" or a grown woman; however, both approaches had their own pitfalls. He felt that the former could come off as too much like Japanese lolicon-styled art, while the latter could make the story seem too serious. The Queen's more realistic design made him question whether a child-like Jill would be appropriate. He designed several versions of Jill with different proportions and sent them to Anthropy so she could pick her favourite. He compared two of the designs to Nintendo characters Mario and Link; the Mario- like design he called a \\"standard video game design\\", while the Link-like design he called \\"slightly realistic\\". The Link-like design was the most realistic design that he did because he felt that making it too realistic could make it too difficult for players to identify with, and could diminish the humorous elements of the game. He also intended to design her as \\"dumpy and podgy\\" to make her more \\"lovable\\". Anthropy told Harvey that she preferred characters with more realistic proportions; as a result, he ended up with a design that was three and a half heads tall. Due to her submissive position, he designed her to be an \\"innocent\\" who looked \\"eager-to-please\\", with \\"benign, wide eyed facial expressions\\". The evolution of her design resulted in Harvey having to redesign her appearance on the title screen. He employed different colors to demonstrate Jill's feelings for the Queen; he used a rose tint to demonstrate her \\"blissful display of affection\\" while using a grey wash to demonstrate her sadness. Harvey intended to add some red to her rubber body suit order to make her stand out from the background; however, he felt that this made the suit look more like a \\"crazy wrestler costume\\". He later thought to include grey in the design or to put her initials on her chest, but decided on using an all black design. One of the difficulties of designing the suit was to make it look shiny without resembling \\"gross lolicon manga porn\\". Follow-ups A harder version called Mighty Jill Off - Jill Off Harder Edition, was released in October 2008, 8 months after the original version. Anthropy compared it to the Nintendo game Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels which was noticeably more difficult than its predecessor, Super Mario Bros. She made it with the intention of reusing assets from the original game such as sprites and backgrounds but making sure that none of the challenges were recycled. She also made a follow-up called Jill Off with One Hand, which features \\"OneSwitch\\" gameplay, a type of gameplay which requires only one button to play. It was created over the course of Buy Nothing Day and was created with the intent of making it playable on mobile phones. The protagonist Jill was featured in the 2010 platform game Super Meat Boy along with several characters from other games. Reception and promotion Mighty Jill Off has received generally positive reception. Retronauts Jess Ragan praised Anthropy for her understanding of what made Mighty Bomb Jack good. 1UP.com Scott Sharkey listed Mighty Jill Off as one of his favourite independently-developed freeware games in 2009. Gamasutra listed it as one of their runners-up for the top five best indie games of 2008. On two separate occasions, IndieGames Tim W. listed Mighty Jill Off as \\"game picks\\"; first for the original version, and second for Mighty Jill Off - Jill Off Harder Edition. GamesRadar Nathan Meuiner listed the game as one of the \\"most ruthlessly punishing indie games\\" and wrote that the difficulty level may make players question whether the \\"pain of a million deaths is worth the pleasure awaiting\\" players. Bitmob's James DeRosa called it \\"tough-as-s***\\" and gave credit to Anthropy for coining the genre \\"masocore\\". The game has also received praise for its insight into BDSM and the dom/sub relationship. Rock, Paper, Shotgun Kieron Gillen called it an \\"interesting examination of the master/slave relationship\\". Rock Paper Shotgun Alec Meer described it as a \\"wry, subversive examination of why video game protagonists put themselves through a torturous amount of struggle to reach their objectives\\". James DeRosa praised Anthropy for her implementation of elements and ideas that most games do not cover and called it a \\"hypersexualized, bondage-themed platformer\\" with which Anthropy \\"explores the power dynamics of sexuality and disassembles essentialist male and female sex roles as portrayed in video games -- as well as the significance of difficulty and reward as a design method\\".

The Miracle of Empel (Milagro de Empel in Spanish) was an unexpected Spanish victory on 8 December 1585 near Empel, in the Netherlands, as part of the Eighty Years' War, in which a surrounded Spanish force miraculously won against an enemy who exceeded them in number. The battle After the campaign of 1585, the Governor of Spanish Netherlands and commander of the Spanish troops Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma decided to go into winter quarters on Northern Dutch territory. The troops of Karl von Mansfeld occupied the area around 's-Hertogenbosch. Some 3000-4000 men of the Spanish Tercio, including Juan del Águila, under Maestre de Campo were stationed on Bommelerwaard, which was supposed to be rich enough to support these troops through the winter. But all farmers had left the island, taking their livestock with them. To make the situation of the hungry Spanish troops even worse, Dutch commander Philip of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein arrived with a strong land force and 100 ships. The Dutch leader offered an honorable surrender to the Spaniards but the response was resolute: «Los infantes españoles prefieren la muerte a la deshonra. Ya hablaremos de capitulación después de muertos.» (English: \\"Spanish soldiers prefer death to dishonor. We will talk about surrender after death\\"). Philip of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein breached the dikes of Bommelwaard, forcing the Spanish back over the Rhine to Empel. There they were unable to reach 's-Hertogenbosch, because the terrain was flooded and guarded by the fleet of Hohenlohe. The island was attacked as well by artillery fire coming from a fort, at the other side of the river. Empel December 1585, as pictured at the end of the 16th century by Frans Hogenberg and Georg Braun. The situation for the Spanish looked desperate. A Spanish soldier who was digging a trench around the church commented \\"this is more likely to be my grave than a trench\\". As he dug, he found a painting representing Mary of the Immaculate Conception. Bobadilla interpreted the discovery as a sign from God, and had the painting put on the Spanish flag for worship. That night, a sudden further drop in temperature started to freeze the shallow waters of the flooded lands. This made possible for the Spanish troops to attack the rebels and burn their ships. Admiral Hohenlohe-Neuenstein supposedly responded by saying: \\"It seems that God is Spanish to work such a miracle for them\\". That same day, Mary of the Immaculate Conception was proclaimed patroness of the Spanish Tercios of Flanders and Italy.  In the 19th century  On 8 December 1854 Pope Pius IX defined the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1892 Maria Cristina of Austria (Maria Christina Désirée Henriette Felicitas Rainiera von Habsburg-Lothringen, und Österreich), Queen Regent of Spain, proclaimed Mary of the Immaculate Conception patroness of the entire Spanish Infantry.

The Christmas and gift- giving season starts relatively early compared to other cultures, with the Santa-like figure, or Hungarian version of Saint Nicholas, Mikulás (or Szent Miklós) traditionally visiting the homes of Hungarian children on the night of 5 December, on the eve of Saint Nicholas Feast Day, 6 December. Although the role of gift-giver on Christmas Day itself is assigned to the Christ Child, on the night before St. Nicholas Day Hungarian children traditionally place a boot on their windowsill waiting for Mikuláš to come by and fill it with treats. There is no Mrs. Mikulás in Hungary. In Hungary, Mikulás often comes with an assistant: a \\"Krampusz\\" or locally called \\"Čert\\", a Devil, who comes to scare and punish bad behaving children. Although even those, who behaved badly just get a warning in form of raw potato or charcoal instead of candy, which good behaving child gets from the other assistant - Angel - in the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Slovakia, Mikuláš has another assistant, a good Angel, who gives out presents to good children. While in the Netherlands and Belgium, he is often joined by a black-faced man called Zwarte Piet. To expatriate Hungarians and those non-natives of Hungarian lineage, the celebration is often referred to as \\"Hungarian Christmas\\". In the traditional Nicholas-walk, on 6 December, St. Nicholas comes clothed in a bishop's attire, a long red coat and a red cap on his head, holding a shepherd's crook in one hand, and carrying a sack full of gifts on his back. He cannot be seen because he arrives in the middle of the night when good little children are already fast asleep, so you'd better not try to stay up so late, otherwise he won't give you any presents, only a birch stick (virgács). Before 24 December, people decorate their houses and start to cook and bake. At Christmas, the family members come together and celebrate. On 24 December, people decorate the tree with ornaments and put the wrapped presents under it. On Christmas Eve, which is the day before Christmas Day, young children are waiting for the arrival of Jesus and especially for the presents. Gift-giving is done after the meal, and after singing carols around the tree. On Holy Night, Hungarians listen to holiday songs such as \\"Silent Night\\" and sing or attend Christmas mass. They also burn candles on the Advent wreath during the four weeks before Christmas.

When King Edward the Confessor died in January 1066 his closest relative was his great-nephew, Edgar the Ætheling, but he was young and lacked powerful supporters. Harold was the head of the most powerful family in England and Edward's brother-in- law, and he became king. In September 1066 Harold defeated and killed King Harald Hardrada of Norway at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, and Harold was himself defeated and killed the following month by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. The family is named after Harold's father, Earl Godwin, who had risen to a position of wealth and influence in the 1020s under Danish King Cnut the Great. In 1045 Godwin's daughter, Edith, married King Edward the Confessor, and by the mid-1050s Harold and his brothers had become dominant, almost monopolising the English earldoms. Godwin's origin is obscure. He was probably the son of Wulfnoth Cild, a South Saxon thegn, but Wulfnoth's ancestry is disputed. A few genealogists and historians argue that he was descended from Alfred the Great's elder brother, King Æthelred I (865–71), but almost all historians of Anglo-Saxon England reject this theory. Background Earl Godwin is probably first recorded in 1014, when Godwin, son of Wulfnoth, was left land at a place called Compton in the will of King Æthelred the Unready's son Æthelstan Ætheling. As Earl Godwin was later recorded as holding land at Compton in Sussex it is likely that he was the Godwin mentioned in Æthelstan Ætheling's will. Historians think that he was probably the son of the outlawed South Saxon thegn Wulfnoth Cild. In 1009 Wulfnoth was accused of unknown crimes at a muster of King Æthelred's fleet, and fled with twenty ships; a force sent in pursuit was destroyed in a storm. According to the twelfth-century chronicler John of Worcester, Godwin was the son of a Wulfnoth who was the son of Æthelmær, brother of Eadric Streona, both sons of an otherwise unknown Æthelric, but in the view of the historian Ann Williams this is chronologically impossible. If the relationship were true, the pedigree would result in a significant generational displacement, with two children of Æthelred the Unready marrying the son and great-great- granddaughter of Æthelric. Æthelred's daughter Eadgyth married Æthelric's son Eadric Streona, while Eadgyth's half-brother Edward the Confessor married Godwin's daughter Edith. If Godwin was Æthelric's great-grandson, then Edith was his great-great-granddaughter. David Kelley, however, argues that Edward, being a child of a later marriage, could have been almost a generation younger than his sister, and if both he and Eadric married much younger wives and if Eadric was among the youngest brothers of Æthelmær, this could close up the chronological differences. John of Worcester also stated that Wulfnoth's rebellion was provoked by unjust charges brought by Eadric Streona's brother, Brihtric. The Life of Edward the Confessor, commissioned by his widow Edith, who was Harold's sister, is silent on her family's origin. In a section designed to eulogise her family, Godwin is described as \\"blessed in his ancestral stock\\", but nothing further is said of this stock. In the view of the historian Frank Barlow: \\"There is massive evasion here.\\" Historians generally discount a later medieval tradition that he was the son of a churl or a farmer. In her Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB) article on Godwin's son, King Harold Godwinson, Robin Fleming says of Godwin: \\"The origins of this parvenu are extremely obscure.\\" He was \\"the quintessential new man\\". However, Williams says that the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle's reference to \\"Wulfnoth cild the South Saxon\\" implies a man of rank (cild means child, young man, warrior); his ability to detach twenty ships from the royal fleet suggests a man of at least local importance. Frank Barlow goes further, arguing that Godwin must have been of aristocratic origin, and that the family's massive land holdings in Sussex are indisputable evidence that the Wulfnoth who was Godwin's father was the Saxon thegn. Æthelred I theory Will of Alfred the Great, AD 873–888 (11th-century copy, British Library Stowe MS 944, ff. 29v–33r)Charter S 1507 at the Electronic Sawyer A few scholars have put forward a genealogical reconstruction making the Godwins descend from Alfred the Great's elder brother, King Æthelred I of Wessex. The theory was first proposed by the historian Alfred Anscombe in 1913, and advocated by the genealogist Lundie W. Barlow in 1957 and the Mayanist scholar and genealogist David H. Kelley in 1989. The theory depends in part on tracing the ownership of certain estates, especially Compton in West Sussex, which was probably the Compton left to Æthelred's son Æthelhelm in Alfred the Great's will. It was later in the possession of Wulfnoth, presumably confiscated after his rebellion, and left to \\"Godwin, Wulfnoth's son\\" in 1014 in Æthelstan Ætheling's will. Immediately before the bequest to Godwin is one to an \\"Ælmære\\". Calling him Ælmær, Anscombe identifies this legatee as Ealdorman Æthelmær the Stout, in his view the father of Wulfnoth Cild. He supports this relationship with two further arguments. He finds significance in the occurrence in documents of an Æthelmær with the same epithet as Wulfnoth, Cild, though another advocate of the theory, Lundie Barlow, found Anscombe's Cild argument \\"untenable\\". Anscombe likewise places value in John of Worcester's pedigree that shows Godwin's father Wulfnoth as son of Agelmær, a brother of Eadric Streona. Though the Worcester chronicler gives his Agelmær a different father from the known father of Ealdorman Æthelmær, and Anscombe points out its inherent chronological problems, he argues that, though flawed, the pedigree retains the memory of a father-son relationship between Æthelmær the Stout and Wulfnoth Cild. Æthelmær was the son of the late tenth-century chronicler and ealdorman Æthelweard, whose own writings record that he was descended from Æthelred I, although the exact nature of this descent has been debated. In his 2002 book The Godwins, Frank Barlow sympathetically examined the arguments put forward by Anscombe and Lundie Barlow. He included a family tree based on their work, showing Godwin's descent from Æthelred I, and at one point described Wulfnoth Cild as the son of Æthelmær the Stout. Elsewhere he was more cautious, describing Wulfnoth as the probable son of Æthelmær, and questioning whether a family which had used names for seven generations almost all starting with Æthel- or Ælf- would suddenly have thrown up a Wulfnoth, particularly as Æthelmær the Stout's known sons continued the tradition. He stated nevertheless that \\"This pedigree, even if mistaken, is of the right type.\\" Frank Barlow is almost alone among modern scholars in taking the theory seriously. Peter Rex, in his biography of Harold, describes Godwin as one of Cnut's new men, and dismisses claims that the family had aristocratic ancestry. Emma Mason, in her history of the Godwin family, describes Wulfnoth as a mystery man who was probably a minor figure at court in the late tenth century, and Ian Walker in his biography of Harold gives a similar description of Wulfnoth as \\"a relatively minor figure who attended court only infrequently\\". Williams in her ODNB article on Godwin, and Robin Fleming in her ODNB article on Harold, do not mention the theory when discussing Godwin's ancestry, and according to Stenton: \\"Of his origin nothing can be said with any assurance.\\" Succession to the throne Even if Harold was descended from Æthelred I, it would not have given him a hereditary claim to the throne according to the rules of royal succession in later Anglo-Saxon England. Eligibility was confined to æthelings, that is throne-worthy princes of the royal house. In earlier Anglo-Saxon times, eligibility depended on descent from the fifth- or sixth-century founder of each kingdom, but it later became more restricted. According to David Dumville: \\"The Anglo-Saxon ætheling in the period from the ninth-century Scandinavian settlements to the Norman Conquest was a prince of the royal house. He shared with the reigning king descent from a common grandfather at least\\". All known West Saxon æthelings after 900 were the sons of kings except for Harold's rival for the throne in 1066, Edgar the Ætheling, who was the grandson of King Edmund Ironside. Edgar was thus an ætheling according to Dumville's definition, but in the view of Pauline Stafford, only the son of a present or former king could be an ætheling, and when Edward the Confessor gave this designation to his great-nephew Edgar, it was a form of adoption without known recent precedent, because for the first time since the beginning of the ninth century there was no living ætheling in the strict sense of a son of a king. Danish ancestry Godwin's wife, and the mother of his children including Harold and Edith, was Gytha Thorkelsdóttir. Her father was Thorgils Sprakaleg, a Dane whose origin is unknown, although he was probably a Dane from Scania, which was then in Denmark but is now part of Sweden. Gytha was very well connected as her brother Ulf married King Cnut's sister Estrith. Cnut probably arranged the marriage between Godwin and Gytha in about 1022.

He played in the Football League for Lincoln City and international football for Montserrat. Career Club career Remy started his career at Wimbledon, before signing for non-League club Hastings United in the summer of 2002. After a successful trial, he signed for Football League club, Lincoln City at the start of the 2003–04 season. He made his debut for Lincoln on 9 August 2003, in the 1–0 Division Three home defeat to Oxford United, coming on as a substitute for Simon Weaver in the 64th minute. Three days later, Remy made his last appearance for Lincoln City, in another 1–0 home loss, to Stockport County in the Football League Cup First Round, coming on as a substitute for Rory May in the 84th minute. He was loaned out to non-League football club Kettering Town in September where he made two appearances, scoring once.

The private, commercial structure was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on March 15, 1982. The structure is considered an outstanding example of the brick buildings built in the area of Montgomery and New Prague during the late 19th century, using bricks manufactured in the Minnesota River Valley.\\"The Westerman Lumber Office and Residence\\", Minnesota Monthly, August 1996; copy accessed from Westerman Lumber Office & House file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. Structure The Westerman Lumber Office and House is located in Montgomery's principle business district on the east side of First Street. An L-shaped building, it has an intersecting gable roof which folds at a 45-degree angle over the front facade. The structure was first constructed as a small, wood-frame office building in the 1880s. In 1895, a back section was added and the entire structure was veneered in a buff colored brick. Brick pilaster strips are located at the corners of the building and between the bays of the front ell. The west (front) facade uses rectilinear windows with green wood trim featuring a stylized floral design in the wood lintels, and double-hung windows are used on the second level. The windows on the north facade use arched brick hoods and decoractive panels composed of exposed brick corners beneath the sills.Britta Bloomberg, Minnesota Historic Properties Inventory Form, August 1980; copy accessed from Westerman Lumber Office & House file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. History Henry E. Westerman settled in Le Sueur County in 1873, and moved to Montgomery to start a sawmill when the town was founded in 1877. He established the Westerman Lumber Company in 1889. The building was constructed in the 1880s as a small, wood frame office building. Westerman purchased the structure in 1891 to use as an office. He added to the back of the structure in 1895 so it could house his family, and at the time had the structure veneered in brick. Westerman's company outgrew the building and it was sold in 1915; at that time the original entrance was bricked up. By 1996 it was being used as a private residence. The building was later restored by former airline pilot John A.

Founded in 1959, the company's first General Director was Lester Freedman with conductor Joseph Hawthorne serving as Music Director. In 1960, Freedman founded the Dayton Opera and for many years he led the two organizations simultaneously - an arrangement which cut down on production costs for both companies. Mr. Freedman enjoyed a great collaboration with many Metropolitan Opera stars who came to Toledo Opera to sing. These included Placido Domingo, Lili Chookasian, Chester Ludgin, Roberta Peters, Robert Merrill, Barry Morell, James McCracken, Louise Russell, Martina Arroyo and many more including conductors Anton Coppola, Anton Guadagno, and Imre Pallo. In 1983, Freedman was forced out of his position by the Toledo Opera Board after in-fighting among the company's leadership. Several interim directors kept the company going over the next three years, including David Bamberger\\"Halt To Poorhouse: Toledo Opera Group Introduces Referrals\\", The Blade, May 7, 1984 and Johan van der Merwe. In 1986, conductor James Meena became the company's new permanent general director and successfully produced opera at the Masonic Theatre (now called the Stranahan Theatre). During Mo. Meena's tenure, many rising opera starts appeared in Toledo Opera's productions including Renee Fleming, Mark Delavan, and Marcello Giordani. In 1994, Toledo philanthropists Theodore and Lucille Gorski created a major financial boon for the company through a one million dollar challenge grant which enabled it to establish an endowment. That same year the company played a major role in supporting the renovation of the historic Valentine Theatre in Toledo; a decision which saved the theatre from demolition. The renovations of the theater took several years, and Toledo Opera could not move into its new permanent home until 1999. The company had the honor of opening the newly renovated theater for Toledo Opera's 40th Season gala night on October 22, 1999, with a production of Giacomo Puccini's Tosca, featuring Diana Soviero in the title role. In 2000, Renay Conlin succeeded Meena as the director of Toledo Opera after he left to become director of Opera Carolina. David Shengold of Opera, said that \\"Toledo's proudest legacy of its glory days of glass and automobile manufacturing is its astonishing Museum of Art, free to all and with a collection to make strong curators week.

In 2005, Conlin launched a capital campaign to increase the endowment and was able to raise $2 million. Ms. Conlin was also able to secure the company's first NEA grant. In March 2011, Conlin was fired from Toledo Opera when she took a position as CEO of the Napa Valley Museum in California behind the Opera Board's back. After Conlin's departure, a financial review found that the company had \\"serious problems with cash-flow shortages\\" and had \\"earned a reputation in the community for not paying its bills.\\". The board of directors appointed a former development director, Suzanne Rorick, as Toledo Opera's new Executive Director. Under Rorick's leadership, the company has focused on fundraising and education and has undergone an artistic re-organization that saw the return of several former Toledo Opera colleagues, including James Meena, who currently serves as guest conductor and principal artistic adviser. Ms. Rorick has brought financial stability and artistic excellence to the company with many of today's operatic stars gracing its productions including Jennifer Rowley, Kathryn Lewek, Othalie Graham, and Michael Chioldi. In 2018, Toledo Opera performed the world premiere of Douglas Tappin's I Dream, an opera chronicling the last 36 hours of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr's life. Its education programs are frequently recognized for excellence with the National Endowment for the Arts and Ohio Arts Council grants. Opera On Wheels, its resident artist education program, annually performs for 22,000 elementary and junior high students in the region and the resident artists are featured in the mainstage productions providing them with exposure and education from world-class singers, conductors, and directors.

It was officially started in 1965 when the Bethlehem Area School District, Northampton Area School District, and Saucon Valley School District combined resources to form one vocational-technical school for its students to attend. History The beginning of vocational education in the Bethlehem area began way before 1965, when in 1918 a Vocational Shop Program was started and located on East Fourth Street where the South Side Boy's Club is housed. From 1919 to 1934 a program named the Trade School was housed on Fourth Street at the Excelsior Building. There was also a Vocational Industrial Department located in Liberty High School from 1922 to 1934. In 1934 that same school housed seventh to twelfth grades; consequently, the Industrial Department was moved to Broughal and Excelsior. Between the years of 1934-1940 academic grades from ninth to twelfth were housed at Broughal along with drafting, cabinetmaking, pattern and printing shops while carpentry, electrical, electronics and machining were housed at the Excelsior. Bethlehem Technical High School was located at the Quinn Building for ninth to twelfth grades. It had 18 classrooms and 10 shops. The school even had its own graduation. In January 1956, vocational education was housed in the new annex building of Liberty High School, as a department. From 1956 to 1964 vocational education came under the supervision of the Liberty High School principal. Finally in 1965 it was finally called the Bethlehem Area Vocational-Technical School. It did not have its own building until 1970 when the new BAVTS school was built adjacent to Freedom High School for $3,000,000 in Bethlehem Township. Programs Currently BAVTS has 26 career & technical programs. *Cosmetology *Esthetician *Protective Services *Cabinetmaking *Carpentry *Building Trades *Electrical Construction *Heating Ventilation & Air-Conditioning *Masonry *Plumbing *Commercial Art *Fashion Industries *Graphic Communications *Video & Media Arts *Web Design & Development *Baking *Culinary Arts *Health Careers *Academy of Medical Sciences *Auto Collision *Auto Technician *Welding Technologies *Academy of Engineering *Electronic Engineering & Manufacturing *Precision Machining *Athletic Heath & Fitness Clubs Bethlehem Area Vocational-Technical School offers several options for club involvement. Some students are members of SkillsUSA and compete in their specific area of knowledge. Other clubs are affiliated with certain programs like Health Occupation Students of America is associated with the medical programs. Other clubs also include the National Technical Honor Society and MT6, the entrepreneurial club. Scholarships BAVTS began a scholarship program in 2001 by the Bridges Foundation. The Bridges Foundation was founded by Walter J. Dealtry and BAVTS administration to raise funds for career and technical student scholarships. BAVTS Bridges Foundation scholarship funds are available for qualified BAVTS high school seniors. Qualifying students will have their tuition waived for Continuing Education courses that offer advanced training and certification. Continuing Education BAVTS' adult education department is the second-largest adult vocational-technical school in Pennsylvania as measured by the number of students completing courses. As a non-profit entity, the Continuing Education Department also shares teaching space and some essential core administrative services with Bethlehem Area Vocational-Technical School - a very cost effective relationship.

These plant fossils are from one of those forests from about 5 million years after the CRC. However, the composition of the forests changed from a lepidodendron- dominated forest to one of predominantly tree ferns and seed ferns. The Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC) was a minor extinction event that occurred around 305 million years ago in the Carboniferous period. It altered the vast coal forests that covered the equatorial region of Euramerica (Europe and America). This event may have fragmented the forests into isolated 'islands', which in turn caused dwarfism and, shortly after, extinction of many plant and animal species. Following the event, coal-forming tropical forests continued in large areas of the Earth, but their extent and composition were changed. The event occurred at the end of the Moscovian and continued into the early Kasimovian stages of the Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous). Extinction patterns on land Ferns and tree ferns from Mount Field National Park, giving an impression of how a Carboniferous rainforest might have looked In the Carboniferous, the great tropical rainforests of Euramerica supported towering lycopodiophyta, a heterogeneous mix of vegetation, as well as a great diversity of animal life: giant dragonflies, millipedes, cockroaches, amphibians, and the first amniotes. Plants The rise of rainforests in the Carboniferous greatly altered the landscapes by eroding low-energy, organic-rich anastomosing (braided) river systems with multiple channels and stable alluvial islands. The continuing evolution of tree-like plants increased floodplain stability (less erosion and movement) by the density of floodplain forests, the production of woody debris, and an increase in complexity and diversity of root assemblages. Collapse occurred through a series of step changes. First there was a gradual rise in the frequency of opportunistic ferns in late Moscovian times. This was followed in the earliest Kasimovian by a major, abrupt extinction of the dominant lycopsids and a change to tree fern-dominated ecosystems. This is confirmed by a recent study showing that the presence of meandering and anabranching rivers, occurrences of large woody debris, and records of log jams decrease significantly at the Moscovian-Kasimovian boundary. Rainforests were fragmented, forming shrinking 'islands' further and further apart, and in latest Kasimovian time, rainforests vanished from the fossil record. Animals Before the collapse, animal species distribution was very cosmopolitan—the same species existed everywhere across tropical Pangaea—but after the collapse, each surviving rainforest 'island' developed its own unique mix of species. Many amphibian species became extinct, while the ancestors of reptiles and mammals diversified into more species after the initial crisis. These patterns are explained by the theory of insular biogeography, a concept that explains how evolution progresses when populations are restricted into isolated pockets. This theory was originally developed for oceanic islands, but it can be applied equally well to any other ecosystem that is fragmented, only existing in small patches and surrounded by another unsuitable habitat. According to this theory, the initial impact of habitat fragmentation is devastating, with most life dying out quickly from lack of resources. Then, as surviving plants and animals reestablish themselves, they adapt to their restricted environment to take advantage of the new allotment of resources, and diversify. After the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, each pocket of life evolved in its own way, resulting in a unique species mix that ecologists call \\"endemism\\". Biotic recovery and evolutionary consequences Plants The fragmentation of wetlands left a few isolated refugia in Europe. However, even these were unable to maintain the diversity of Moscovian flora. By the Asselian many families of seed ferns that characterized the Moscovian tropical wetlands had disappeared including Flemingitaceae, Diaphorodendraceae, Tedeleaceae, Urnatopteridaceae, Alethopteridaceae, Cyclopteridaceae, and Neurodontopteridaceae. Invertebrates The depletion of plant life contributed to declining concentrations of oxygen in the atmosphere. High oxygen levels had made the enormous arthropods of the time possible. Due to the decreasing oxygen, these sizes could no longer be accommodated, and thus between this and the loss of habitat, the giant arthropods were wiped out in this event, most notably the giant dragonflies (Meganeura) and millipedes (Arthropleura). Vertebrates synapsids, the predecessors of the mammal lineage, like Archaeothyris were among the groups who quickly recovered after the collapse. This sudden collapse affected several large groups. Labyrinthodont amphibians were particularly devastated, while the amniotes (the first members of the sauropsid and synapsid groups) fared better, being physiologically better adapted to the drier conditions. Amphibians can survive cold conditions by decreasing metabolic rates and resorting to overwintering strategies (i.e. spending most of the year inactive in burrows or under logs). However, this is not an effective way to deal with prolonged unfavourable conditions, especially desiccation. Amphibians must return to water to lay eggs, while amniotes have eggs that have a membrane that retains water and allows gas exchange out of water. Because amphibians had a limited capacity to adapt to the drier conditions that dominated Permian environments, many amphibian families failed to occupy new ecological niches and became extinct. Synapsids and sauropsids acquired new niches faster than amphibians, and new feeding strategies, including herbivory and carnivory, previously only having been insectivores and piscivores. Possible causes  Atmosphere and climate  Paleogeography of the Late Carboniferous with extent of the south polar icesheet There are several hypotheses about the nature and cause of the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, some of which include climate change. After a late Bashkirian interval of glaciation, high-frequency shifts in seasonality from humid to arid times began. The Carboniferous period is characterised by the formation of coal deposits which were formed within a context of the removal of atmospheric carbon. In the latest Middle Pennsylvanian (late Moscovian) a cycle of aridification began. At the time of the Carboniferous rainforest collapse, the climate became cooler and drier. This is reflected in the rock record as the Earth entered a short, intense ice age. Sea levels dropped by about , and glacial ice covered most of the southern continent of Gondwana. The climate was unfavourable to rainforests and much of the biodiversity in them. Rainforests shrank into isolated patches mostly confined to wet valleys further and further apart. Little of the original lycopsid rainforest biome survived this initial climate crisis. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere crashed to one of its all time global lows in the Pennsylvanian and early Permian. Then a succeeding period of global warming reversed the climatic trend; the remaining rainforests, unable to survive the rapidly changing conditions, were finally wiped out. As the climate aridified again through the later Paleozoic, rainforests were eventually replaced by seasonally dry biomes. Though the exact speed and nature of the collapse is not clear, it is thought to have occurred relatively quickly in geologic terms, only a few thousand years at most. Volcanism After restoring the middle of the Skagerrak-Centered Large Igneous Province (SCLIP) using a new reference frame, it has been shown that the Skagerrak plume rose from the core–mantle boundary (CMB) to its ~300 Ma position. The major eruption interval took place in very narrow time interval, of 297 Ma ± 4 Ma. The rift formation coincides with the Moskovian/Kasimovian boundary and the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse. Climate and geology A paleoclimate change of global nature occurred during the Moscovian and Kasimovian. An atmospheric drying (aridification) happened in the Middle to Late Pennsylvanian, coinciding with abrupt faunal changes in marine and terrestrial species. This change was recorded in paleosols, which reflect a period of overall decreased hydromorphy, increased free-drainage and landscape stability, and a shift in the overall regional climate to drier conditions in the Upper Pennsylvanian (Missourian). This is consistent with climate interpretations based on contemporaneous paleo-floral assemblages and geological evidence. See \\"Dinosaur Extinction\\" chapter. Fossil sites lycopsid, probably Sigillaria, from Joggins, with attached stigmarian roots Many fossil sites around the world reflect the changing conditions of the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse. * Hamilton, Kansas, US * Jarrow Tyne & Wear, UK * former Linton Mine in Saline Township, Jefferson County, Ohio, US * Nýřany, Czech Republic * Joggins, Nova Scotia, Canada The Joggins Fossil Cliffs on Nova Scotia's Bay of Fundy, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a particularly well-preserved fossil site. Fossil skeletons embedded in the crumbling sea cliffs were discovered by Sir Charles Lyell in 1852. In 1859, his colleague William Dawson discovered the oldest known reptile-ancestor, Hylonomus lyelli, and since then hundreds more skeletons have been found, including the oldest synapsid, Protoclepsydrops.

Early life Born in Ostend, Belgium, he was the youngest son of Lieutenant-Colonel James Forrest Fulton and his wife, Fanny née Jessopp. Fulton was educated at Norwich School under his uncle, the Reverend Augustus Jessopp before attending the University of London.Harries et al. (1991), p. 216 He graduated with a BA degree in 1867 and Bachelor of Laws degree in 1873. Legal career 1872–1886 Fulton was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1872. Practising on the South Eastern Circuit, he held a number of senior legal posts including treasury counsel at the Middlesex Sessions, senior counsel to the Post Office and senior counsel to the Treasury at the Central Criminal Court. Member of parliament 1886–1892 At the 1885 general election, Fulton was the Conservative Party's candidate to contest the newly created constituency of West Ham North. He was defeated by a margin of 719 votes. A further election was held in 1886, and Fulton stood at West Ham North again. He was elected to the Commons with a majority of 727 votes. He was described as having \\"made no particular mark\\" in parliament, and was unseated at the next general election in 1892, losing to the Liberal Party candidate, Archibald Grove, by 33 votes. Common Serjeant and Recorder of London 1892–1922 On leaving parliament, he was appointed a Queen's Counsel, and was briefly Recorder of Maidstone. In August 1892 Sir William Charley resigned as Common Serjeant of London and Fulton was appointed his successor. He was knighted in the same year, and made a Lieutenant of the City of London, a Commissioner of the Central Criminal Court, and a Judge of the Mayor's Court of London. While Common Serjeant he presided over the case that led to the conviction of Adolph Beck for fraud in 1896. Eight years later an enquiry established that the conviction was a miscarriage of justice, a decision that led to the establishment of the Court of Criminal Appeal. In 1900 Sir Charles Hall, Recorder of London, died. Fulton was chosen to fill the post. He was succeeded as Common Serjeant of London by Frederick Albert Bosanquet QC. As Recorder Fulton tried the case of Kitty Byron, who was charged with the murder of Arthur Reginald Baker in 1902. Fulton held the Recordership until March 1922, when he resigned due to ill health. He died at his home in Sheringham, Norfolk, in June 1925, aged 79.

History There have been three mansions on the estate. The first was built in 1560 by the Vaughan family which was later ennobled as Earls of Carbery. This was destroyed by fire and replaced in 1754 by a Neoclassical box of fine quality with a long Doric-columned portico. In 1804 the estate was bequeathed by John Vaughan, the last of the Golden Grove Vaughans, to his Oxford friend John Frederick Campbell, Lord Cawdor of Castlemartin, later 1st Earl Cawdor, who demolished the previous property and built the existing house, designed by the leading architect Sir Jeffry Wyatville to the south-west above the original: begun 1827, completed 1834. Wyatville was simultaneously occupied in the extensive remodelling of Windsor Castle for King George IV, and subsequently King William lV, as well as the building of a remarkably similar property, Lilleshall Hall in Shropshire, for Cawdor's cousin, George Leveson-Gower, nephew of the Duke of Sutherland. Correspondence exists between the two families relating to the huge costs of construction of both Golden Grove and Lilleshall, and the problems in bringing them to completion created by Wyatville's pre-occupation with the complexities and demands of his new schemes for the King. Golden Grove remained in Cawdor family occupation until 1935. During the Second World War it was occupied by the United States Air Force. Carmarthenshire County Council used it as offices, and Coleg Sir Gâr operated it as an agricultural college until 2003. Plans were made to convert the building to a hotel, to flats, and to a convalescent home, but the building remained unused and deteriorating until 2011, when the council sold the house and park to the Golden Grove Trust, formed to make the house a destination for art and cultural activities and restore the park. In 2015 it received a grant of almost £1 million from the Welsh Government. The 2017 BBC television series Decline and Fall, based on the Evelyn Waugh novel, was filmed at Golden Grove, and in 2018 the house and park were primary filming location for the film Six Minutes to Midnight. House, gardens and country park Golden Grove in August 2005 The house has Scottish Baronial features in a Tudor or Elizabethan architectural style, although it is a late Regency, Georgian, house and not a Victorian house. It is constructed of Llangyndeyrn limestone traditionally called 'black marble'. Its national importance is recognised by its Grade II* listing. Gardens immediate on the house include an arboretum, laid out in the 1860s, and deer park, both Grade II listed.

Ingle was the brother and manager of performer Albert Chevalier. Ingle was one of six children. He had two brothers, Albert and Bertram; and a sister, Adéle. The two other children died in infancy. Their father, Jean Onesime Chevalier, was born in France.  Name  Ingle assumed his pseudonym during a touring trip to Ireland, when one member of the party gave his name as Sir Charles Ingle in a \\"spirit of waggery\\". The name was then used on the prestigious guest list at their stop in Dublin and later that evening by composer Bond Andrews. Ingle later commented that Andrew's use of the name (and the fictitious \\"Lady Ingle\\") made the pseudonym pass bona fide to that evening's guests. He did, however, comment that the \\"haunting fear of untimely discovery made [him] vow never to pose as a knight again\\".  Career  Ingle composed music for many of his brother's comedic music hall songs, including \\"Wot Cher! Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road\\" (1891) and \\"My Old Dutch\\" (1892). As well as managing and composing for his brother, Ingle performed alongside Albert. On 24 January 1876, Ingle portrayed Squire O'Grady in an adaptation of Samuel Lover's Handy Andy, despite the fact that he \\"didn't know a line of the part\\". While managing Chevalier, Ingle was responsible for booking concert tours and would often book performances up to four months in advance. Chevalier would rarely play more than two shows in one town, but would tour for up to six months at a time. Chevalier began his first tour of the United States on 23 March 1896 at the Koster and Bails music hall in New York City, and continued touring the US for three years.

Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road\\" is a British music hall comedy song written in 1891 by the actor and singer Albert Chevalier. The score was by his brother and manager Charles Ingle. Chevalier developed a stage persona as the archetypal Cockney and was a celebrated variety artist, with the nickname of \\"The Singing Costermonger\\". When first performed it was known simply as \\"Wot Cher!\\" The song describes the sudden endowment of apparent wealth on a poor family. The song's verse is in a minor key, and then the chorus moves into the relative major. It was sung and danced to by Shirley Temple and Arthur Treacher in the 1939 film The Little Princess.  Meaning  A London alley contemporary with the song - Boundary Street 1890 The song is full of working class cockney rhyming slang and idiomatic phrasing. The song tells the story of a family who live in an alley, a passageway off the street usually lined with crowded tenements, near the Old Kent Road, one of the poorest districts in London. They are visited by a toff, a well-dressed man, who must have been a gentleman because he took his topper (top hat) off in the presence of the narrator's missus (wife). The man's speech however betrays that he is lower class himself when he informs the lady that her uncle Tom has 'popped off', slang for died. He must have looked odd in his appearance, because he is described as a 'geezer' which is an eccentric old man. He says this is not a 'sell' i.e. it's the truth not a story but she has been left a little donkey shay (a small, light, horse-drawn carriage). The refrain describes the reaction of the neighbours to the news of the couple's good fortune. \\"Wot cher!\\" was a Cockney greeting—a contraction of \\"What cheer\\", used as a greeting since the Middle Ages. To \\"knock em\\" is an idiomatic phrase, to knock them on the head i.e. to stun them. The song goes on to describe the initial unreliability of the moke (slang for donkey) and the way the couple use it to impress the neighbourhood by doing the \\"grand\\", behaving in a grandiose way as if they were \\"carriage folk\\", a family who could afford to own their own carriage, and who might drive a \\"four-in-'and\\", a carriage with four horses, in Rotten Row, one of the most fashionable horse rides in London. A \\"cove\\" is a low-class fellow. A \\"Dutch\\" is a wife, being cockney rhyming slang for \\"Duchess of Fife\\" which rhymes with \\"wife\\". She says \\"I 'ates a Bus because it's low!\\", in order to tease her lodger, meaning she now considers the bus to be low-class and beneath her. Lyrics Last week down our alley came a toff Nice old geezer with a nasty cough. Sees my missus, takes his topper off In a very gentlemanly way! \\"Ma'am\\" says he, \\"I 'ave some news to tell, Your rich uncle Tom of Camberwell, Popp'd off recent, which it ain't a sell, Leaving you 'is little donkey shay.\\" Refrain: :\\"Wot cher!\\" all the neighbours cried, :\\"Who yer gonna meet, Bill :Have yer bought the street, Bill?\\" :Laugh! I thought I should 'ave died :Knock'd 'em in the Old Kent Road! Some says nasty things about the moke, One cove thinks 'is leg is really broke. That's his envy cos we're carriage folk, Like the toffs as rides in Rotten Row! Straight! it woke the alley up a bit, Thought our lodger would 'ave 'ad a fit, When my missus who's a real wit Says \\"I 'ates a Bus because it's low!\\" Refrain When we starts the blessed donkey stops He won't move, so out I quickly 'ops Pals start ' 'm, when down 'e drops Someone says 'e wasn't made to go.

He wears the robes of an Irish peer and holds a tricorn hat under his left arm Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Catherlough, KB, (1702–1772), was a British Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby (1734–41, 1762–68), Castle Rising, Norfolk (1747–54) and Milborne Port, Somerset (1770–72). He became successively Baron Luxborough (1745), Viscount Barrells and Earl of Catherlough (both 1763), all titles within the peerage of Ireland. His wife, Henrietta Lady Luxborough, later became well known as a lady of letters, poet and pioneering landscape gardener. Background Luxborough House, Chigwell, Essex, built by Robert Knight, snr. before 1721. Demolished c. 1796. Inscribed: J.Prattent delt. et Sculp. Essex Record Office, 1/Mb 80/1/12 The 1st Earl was born 17 December 1702, the only son by his 1st wife, Martha Powell (1681–1718), of Robert Knight (1675–11/1744) who became notorious as the cashier of the South Sea Company partly responsible for the \\"South Sea Bubble\\", who absconded to France with a fortune and set up as a banker in Paris. He built Luxborough House in Chigwell, Essex, on the manor of Luxborough which he had purchased. His estates were seized by the South Sea Company, which sold Luxborough to Sir Joseph Eyles (d.1740), Alderman & Sheriff of the City of London & MP for Devizes (1724–5) & Southwark (1727–30). His only other child was a daughter, Margaretta (d. 1 May 1739) who married 28 February 1731 Hon. Morgan Vane, son of 2nd Baron Barnard of Barnard Castle, Durham. His funerary monument, a free- standing urn on a pedestal, can be seen in St Peter's Church, Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire. Education He was educated at Wadham College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 22 June 1719. He entered the Inner Temple in 1719. Career Henrietta, Lady Luxborough. By unknown artist He was with his father on his flight to Brabant in February 1721. On 10 June 1727, following his return to England, he married Henrietta St John (15 July 1699 – 26 March 1756), daughter of Henry St John, 1st Viscount St John, of Lydiard Park, Swindon, by his second wife Angelica Pelissary, daughter of Georges Pelissary, treasurer of the navy to King Louis XIV. Henrietta was thus half-sister of the highly influential Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, the son of her father's first marriage. In 1730 he purchased Barrells Hall, Ullenhall, Warwickshire, the ancestral home of the Knight family, from his second cousin Raleigh Knight. He entered parliament in 1734 as 2nd M.P. for the borough of Great Grimsby, and was at first identified with the Bolingbroke interest. John Page, MP for Grimsby in 1727, wrote in 1762 concerning Knight that his interest in Grimsby: > \\"… was stronger there than any man's because they have had more of his money > than anybody's and he has always been punctual to all his engagements with > them and they with him\\". On the break-up of his marriage before 1736 and following Bolingbroke's return to France, he became less partisan, but held his seat until 1741. In 1740, on the death of Sir Joseph Eyles, Robert Knight snr. had repurchased Luxborough House, to which his son succeeded in 1744. On 8 August 1745 he was created Baron Luxborough, of Shannon, in the peerage of Ireland. In 1747 he won the seat, as 1st member, of Castle Rising, Norfolk, which he retained until 1754. In 1749, he sold the estate at Luxborough to a London merchant named James Crokatt, who was in the Carolina trade. He became Agent for the Province. He was instrumental in obtaining the Royal Charter for the incorporation of the Charleston Library Society in 1755. whose heirs sold it to Sir Edward Walpole, K.B. (d.1784), younger son of the Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole. In March 1761 he obtained the position of Recorder of Grimsby. In the general election of 1761 Luxborough procured the return of his son Henry as MP for Great Grimsby, as 1st member. On the sudden death of his son in August 1762, Luxborough decided to stand himself in the resultant by-election, and was returned unopposed, holding the seat until 1768. He explained his decision to stand thus: \\"As money can be no consideration in my unhappy situation and as possibly hereafter it may be an amusement to be in Parliament\\". He gave support to the Earl of Bute, Prime Minister between 1762-63. On 14 May 1763 he was further raised in the Irish peerage by Bute's successor George Grenville, Prime Minister between 1763–65, becoming Viscount Barrells of Co. Catherlough and Earl of Catherlough. In 1770 he stood successfully as 2nd member in the by-election for Milborne Port, Somerset, which seat he held until his death on 30 March 1772, aged 69. He was created Knight of the Bath (KB) 18 May 1770. First Marriage He banished his wife Henrietta St John to Barrells Hall in 1736 as punishment for a romantic indiscretion. Horace Walpole's correspondence suggests she was caught by her husband in flagrante delicto with her doctor, whilst other sources add a further lover in the form of a young cleric named John Dalton (1709–1763). Dalton had been employed as tutor to the children of Henrietta's close friend Frances Thynne (1699–1754), known until 1748 as Lady Hertford, wife of Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset. Dalton went on to become prebendary of Worcester Cathedral and rector of St Mary-at-Hill Church, London, as his large funerary slab in the crypt of the cathedral reveals. He was also noted for his poetic works. As Henrietta, Lady Luxborough, she was one of the first to establish a ferme ornée and is credited with the invention of the word \\"shrubbery\\". She was a prominent member of the Warwickshire Coterie, a group of poet friends including the poet William Shenstone, who had developed his own ferme ornée at The Leasowes in Halesowen, Shropshire. Second Marriage After his wife Henrietta's death on 26 March 1756, Luxborough began to live at Barrells and married secondly on 18 June 1756 Lady le Quesne. She was the widow of Sir John le Quesne (d.1741), Alderman of London, née Mary Knight, from Hampshire, who provided a dowry of £20,000 to her first husband. She was probably a member of the prominent Knight family, seemingly of no relation, of Chawton House, Hampshire, which later adopted Edward Austen, the brother of Jane Austen, who became heir of the family assuming the surname Knight. The Registers of St Peter le Poer church records the marriage in April 1738, by the Bishop of Norwich, of Sir John Le Quesne, Alderman of London, with Miss Mary Knight, of Hampshire, a lady with a dowry of twenty thousand pounds. Le Quesne was a huguenot, and served from 1736 as director of the French Hospital, founded at Rochester in 1718. He was a sheriff of the City of London in 1739 and died in 1741. A Silver tea kettle was made for the 1738 marriage of Sir John Le Quesne to Mary Knight by the Huguenot silversmith Paul de Lamerie(d. 1751), now in the collection of the Courtauld Institute, London.On loan to the V&A;, no. loan Gilbert.675-2008 It displays the acorn arms of Le Quesne, which name derives from the French Chene, oak. William Randolph Hearst expressed his attraction to this object.; ; . Luxborough however became involved in an affair with Jane Davies, the daughter of his tenant at Moat Farm, Ullenhall, which resulted in several illegitimate children. He was unable to marry her because his wife, Lady Le Quesne, refused to release him. Mary died in 1795 and was buried in Hampton, Middlesex. Death and burial The Earl died on 30 March 1772, aged 69, and was buried at Ullenhall. His will dated 11 February 1772 was proved on 10 April 1772. All his peerages became extinct on his death on 30 March 1772, his son Hon. Henry Knight (1728–62), having predeceased him. Succession Legitimate Progeny Hon. Henry Knight (1728–1762).

She gave birth to their son, Josiah, shortly before her divorce came through. The younger Josiah was brought up by Lord Tylney, but died in Florence in 1774. Mrs Child then had an affair with Louis-Alexandre de Grimoard de Beauvoir, Comte de Roure and died giving birth to their son. Illegitimate Progeny *Robert Knight (1768–1855). Lord Catherlough's illegitimate son by Jane Davies took the surname of Knight and inherited his property. On the death of Robert Knight in 1855, the Reverend Henry Charles Knight (b. 1813), who claimed to be his son by Hon. Frances Dormer, daughter of Charles, 5th Baron Dormer, but who had been disowned by Robert, attempted to obtain the Barrells estate as his inheritance, against Charles Raleigh Knight, Mr Knight's nephew. The resulting legal dispute was settled by the sale and splitting up of Barrells in 1856. Henry bought parts of the estate whilst the remainder was sold to Mr William Newton, a Birmingham merchant. Most of the heirlooms however descended in the family of Mr Knight's daughter, Georgiana, wife of Edward Bolton King, of Umberslade, Warwickshire. Barrells Hall Funerary monument in Wootton Wawen Church erected by the Earl in memory of his legitimate children, who both predeceased him Barrells Hall is situated in Ullenhall, Warwickshire. The earliest mention of Barrells was a reference to a Richard Barel in 1405. In 1554 the estate was purchased by Robert Knight of Beoley, 4 miles west of Ullenhall, and remained in the Knight family until 1856. An inventory taken in 1652 shows that it was then an ordinary farmhouse, and a member of the Knight family appeared in the 1682 Heralds' Visitation of Warwick. The future 1st Earl purchased Barrells from a cousin in 1730. When Henrietta St John was banished to Barrells in 1736 it was still a relatively simple house, in very poor condition. When his son married in 1791 he commissioned the Italian architect Joseph Bonomi the Elder to build an imposing extension, which thereafter became the main house. Luxborough House Luxborough House stood about 1 mile from Chigwell church on the road south-west to Woodford. Following the death of Sir Edward Hughes, KB, in 1794, it was demolished some time after 1796 by his widow.

It was formerly known as Manor Farm, and under that name was home to George and Elizabeth Cadbury. On 30 July 2014, the building suffered extensive damage caused by a severe fire, confirmed as arson. History The property had belonged to the University of Birmingham since 1953, when it was bought from the Cadbury family. A farm house, part of the Manor of Northfield, belonging to the Jervoise family, was recorded as being on the site circa 1750.English Heritage advisors' report (PDF) In 1809 the estate was purchased by Daniel Ledsam, a London merchant. It is believed that he made alterations to the house and was responsible for the current main building. George Cadbury bought the house in 1890 and the Cadburys moved there from Woodbrooke, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in 1894. They lived there together until George's death at the house in 1922. During the Second World War Elizabeth invited the Friends' Ambulance Unit to use the grounds as a training centre. Elizabeth continued to reside there until her own death in 1951, aged 93. On acquisition by the University, the property was renamed The Manor House and converted for use from 1958 as a hall of residence by H W Hobbiss. Additional wings have since been added. Its use as a hall of residence ceased in 2007. Architecturally, it is in mock Tudor-style stone and brick, with timber-framing, projecting porch and carved bay windows probably by George Gadd who also designed some of the early Cadbury's factory buildings at Bournville. Internally the style is Jacobean with wood panelling, carving and inscriptions. It is a grade A locally listed building and has been considered for national listing; however English Heritage declined to list it. The Manor House Hall of Residence was used as a filming location for an episode of the TV crime drama 'Dalziel and Pascoe', appearing as 'Holm Coltram University' in Season 1 Episode 2, 'An Advancement of Learning', first broadcast 23 March 1996.  2014 fire  On 30 July 2014, the building suffered extensive damage caused by a severe fire. There were plans to sell the building to Banner Homes for redevelopment if the planning application for conversion to apartments before the city council were successful. A West Midlands Fire Service spokesman said up to 100 firefighters had tackled the blaze. Twenty fire engines, including specialist hydraulic platforms and a high-volume water pump, were deployed. Firefighters said the cause was arson; the second such attack on the building in two days. Much of the main grade A listed building was damaged or destroyed. Three boys, aged 12, 14 and 15, were subsequently arrested and later bailed, on suspicion of starting the fire.  2015 partial demolition In June 2015 a large part of the Manor House was torn down by demolition crews working on behalf of the University of Birmingham, who still own the site, though it was claimed only those sections of the building that were structurally unsound had been demolished. A spokeswoman for the University stated it had \\"become clear\\" that much of the property had been \\"damaged beyond repair\\", due to the fire of 2014, and was in \\"a dangerous state\\", leaving them with \\"no choice but to take down substantial parts of the structure.\\" Prominent local historian Carl Chinn was reported as urging the University to stop the demolition and to \\"consult with local people through community groups and their elected representatives over the future of this building\\", adding that the owners \\"should take a serious look at how they will restore the building, in partnership with the community.\\" In response the University's vice-principal, Adam Tickell, claimed that despite the demolition of the majority of the structure it remained the intention of the University that the building should \\"be rebuilt to mirror the external appearance of the original manor house\\", going on to say the planning application had been revived and now included \\"provision for the rebuilding of the manor house\\". Northfield Manor Farm Park Manor Farm Park Manor Farm Park was once the grounds of Northfield Manor House. It comprises a 50-acre open space with woodlands, meadows and a lake, created by damming Griffins Brook. Merritt's Brook also crosses the park. There is a wooden picnic barn built for visiting schoolchildren in 1894. The park opened to the public in 1951.

It is different from postpartum depression and a dislike of breastfeeding. Hundreds of women personally describe the condition. There has, however, been little to no research into it as of 2015.  Signs and symptoms  The lactating woman develops a brief period of dysphoria that begins just prior to the milk ejection reflex and continues for not more than several minutes. It may recur with every milk release, any single release, or only with the initial milk release at each feeding. D-MER always presents as an emotional reaction but may also produce a hollow or churning feeling in the pit of the stomach, nausea, restlessness, and/or general unease. When experiencing D-MER, mothers may report any of a spectrum of different unpleasant emotions, ranging from depression to anxiety to anger. Each of these emotions can be felt at a different level of intensity.  Diagnosis  *D-MER does not appear to be a psychological response to breastfeeding. It is possible for women to have psychological responses to breastfeeding, but D-MER gives evidence of being a physiological reflex. *D-MER is not postpartum depression or a postpartum mood disorder. A mother can have D-MER and PPD, but they are separate conditions and the common treatments for PPD do not treat D-MER. The majority of mothers with D-MER report no other mood disorders. *D-MER is not the \\"breastfeeding aversion\\" that can happen to some mothers when continuing to nurse while pregnant. Breastfeeding aversion occurs upon nipple contact when nursing whereas D-MER is triggered by the let-down reflex, even if it is several minutes after latching.  Management  There is no product that is medically approved to treat D-MER. It has been hypothesized that efforts to raise dopamine may help, and anecdotal evidence encourages a healthy diet limiting caffeine intake and adding supplements. Many nursing mothers manage their D-MER by pumping, either exclusively or only occasionally, which may reduce symptoms and certainly helps reduce associating negative feelings with the infant. Others ultimately switch to formula feeding.  Emotional support  Awareness, understanding, and education appear to be important. Many mothers with D-MER rate their D-MER much worse prior to learning what is causing their feelings. Once a mother understands that she is not alone in her condition and realizes it is a physiological condition she seems to be much less likely to wean prematurely.  History  The first documented reference to a hormonally based negative emotional reaction while breastfeeding was found online in a forum in June 2004.Strange Feeling Prior to the launch of D-MER.org the phenomenon was unknown, unnamed, misunderstood and rarely mentioned or talked about. The term dysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER) came from Alia Macrina Heise who described it in 2007. It was chosen due to the emotional reaction (dysphoria) to milk let-down (milk ejection reflex). The \\"milk ejection reflex\\" is abbreviated among lactation professionals and referred to as the M-E-R. In 2008 a team of lactation consultants, headed up by Diane Wiessinger, worked together and consulted with other medical professionals to do a preliminary investigation to better understand D-MER. Case reports and case series have been published on the topic.Cox, Suzanne. A Case of Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex, Breastfeeding Review 2010; 18 (1): 16-18 Society and culture D-MER has been mentioned in several breastfeeding texts and self- help books since 2010.Mohrbacher, N. \\"Breastfeeding Answers Made Simple: A Guide for Helping Mothers\\" Hale Publishing. 2010. * Lawrence, R.

He pitched in 80 minor league games, accruing a 20–35 record. Freeman went on to coach multiple sports at St. Augustine High School in Kalamazoo, Michigan, from 1925 to 1954, where his basketball teams won five state championship. He then worked in the lumber business. Freeman was inducted to the hall of fame of the Michigan High School Coaches Association in 1965. He was married, with two daughters and a son, and died in January 1970 in Kalamazoo.

It was built in Federal style in 1835. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. History The land on which the house stands was purchased in 1818, and passed between several owners before being purchased by Micajah Thomas. Thomas is believed to have built the house in the 1830s, although the exact date of construction is not known, and it may have been built around an earlier log structure. See also: Then-U.S. Congressman George Smith Houston moved to Athens from Lauderdale County and purchased the house in 1845. He served in Congress from 1841 until 1849, and again from 1851 until 1861. Following Reconstruction, Houston was elected Governor of Alabama, serving from 1874 until 1878. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1878, serving until his death on December 31, 1879. His widow, Ellen, lived in the house until her death in 1909. The house was later rented by the Kiwanis Club, and in 1938, the Houston family donated the house to the city to be used as a public library. Architecture The Houston House is a two-story, wooden house built in the Federal style. Four square columns support a two-story portico and second floor balcony. The balcony extended across the entire front of the house by Ellen Houston, but was truncated after her death. Side-by-side front doors open into separate rooms, a layout repeated on the upper balcony. A dining room was added on the north side of the house in the late 19th century.

Mason developed her individual approach to the Abstract Expressionist and color field painting traditions with her veils of color and spontaneous gestural mark. Mason was born and raised in New York City, where she lived and worked until her death. Early life Emily Mason was born in Greenwich Village, New York City in 1932 to Alice Trumbull Mason and Warwood Edwin Mason. Her mother was a founder of the American Abstract Artists. Her father was sea captain for American Export Lines. She attended The High School of Music & Art from 1946 to 1950. She attended Bennington College from 1950 to 1952. In 1952, Mason transferred from Bennington College to the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, where she was graduated in 1955. In 1956, Mason was awarded a Fulbright grant to study in Italy. Before moving there, she met fellow painter Wolf Kahn, who later joined her in Venice. They married on March 2, 1957 at the municipal building near the Rialto Bridge, witnessed by strangers and friends including filmmaker Tinto Brass. Her work earned her a second year of the Fulbright grant which they spent between Venice and Rome, visiting other artists Gretna Campbell, Louis Finkelstein, and Lee Bontecou among others. In late 1958 the couple returned to New York where Mason gave birth to their first daughter Cecily in 1959. In 1963 the family returned to Italy. Their daughter Melany was born in Rome in 1964. In 1968 the couple bought a farm in Brattleboro, Vermont where she would spend her summers painting. In an interview with magazine Western Art & Architecture, Mason explained, “It is important to balance city life with experiencing nature. Winter in the city is the time for the fermentation of ideas. Summer is my time to carry them out.” Career Mason's career began to flourish in the 1960s. She was awarded her first solo exhibition in 1960 at the Area Gallery in New York City.Ebony, David (2006). Emily Mason (1st ed.). New York: Brazilier. pp 119–125. In 1979 she was invited to teach painting at Hunter College by artist, Sanford Wurmfeld. She worked there for the next three decades. In The Brooklyn Rail, publisher Phong Bui describes Mason's position between abstract expressionism and color field painting, noting: \\"She was interested in neither the former's existential angst nor the latter's use of absorbed color pigments on raw canvas (she paints on primed canvases). By allowing painterly gestures to coexist with thin, poured layers in a wide range of colors in all manner of hues and saturations, Mason is able to amplify her colors—which are infused with forms that derive from both memory and free association with concrete surroundings in nature—while embracing their complex tonalities.\\"  Collections  *Bennington Museum, Bennington, VT *National Academy Museum, New York, NY *New Britain Museum of American Art, New Britain, CT *Springfield Museum, Springfield, MA *University of New Mexico Art Museum, Albuquerque, NM *Washington County Museum of Art, Hagerstown, MD *Wheaton College, Norton, MA  References  Category:1932 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Abstract painters Category:Hunter College faculty Category:American women painters Category:Artists from New York City Category:People from Greenwich Village Category:Bennington College alumni Category:Cooper Union alumni Category:Fulbright Scholars Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th-century American women artists Category:The High School of Music & Art alumni Category:21st-century American women artists ","title":"Emily Mason"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},H={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your ETH🥳")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",H,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(P,[["render",I]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/64.md","filePath":"sponsor/64.md"}'),F={name:"sponsor/64.md"},x=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,x as default};
