Early life and education Branston was born at Newark-on-Trent, the second son of George Henry Branston, of The Friary, Newark, Nottinghamshire, a wealthy maltster, and his wife Gwynedd, daughter of Adam Eyton, JP, of Plas Llanerch-y-Mor, Flintshire. On George Henry Branston's purchase of Branston, Lincolnshire, in 1897, the family attained the status of landed gentry; by 1952, Trevor Branston was the head of this family.Burke's Landed Gentry, seventeenth edition, ed. L. G. Pine, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 1952, p. 249http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/monographs/biographies1901/obituary.htm Branston attended Charterhouse School in Surrey before going up to Hertford College, Oxford.Wisden 1970, p. 1017. An all rounder, he won cricket Blues in 1904, 1905 and 1906, and played for Nottinghamshire during the summer holidays as an amateur. Cricket career Branston was one of the leading players on the all-amateur MCC tour of New Zealand in 1906‚Äì07: he scored 119, one of only two centuries by the team, against Canterbury, and in all matches took 36 first-class wickets at an average of 18.69.

He also toured with MCC to North America in 1907 and Egypt in 1909. Playing for the Gentlemen of England against Cambridge University in 1908, he took three wickets in each innings and scored 58 and 194 not out, his highest first-class score, to take Gentlemen of England to 401 for 6 and a four-wicket victory. His best first-class bowling figures were 6 for 66, which helped Oxford to a 50-run victory over Kent in 1905. Personal life In 1912, Branston married Ethel May, daughter of J. E. Anderton, MBE, MD, of New Mills, Derbyshire. They had one child, a daughter, Audrey (born 1913), who married Major Ernest Nugent Oldrey, OBE, of the Royal Artillery, and had a son, Timothy Nugent Oldrey.

The cartoon is the first produced Oswald cartoon, featuring Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a character that Disney and Ub Iwerks created for Universal Pictures and Charles B. Mintz. Oswald would later serve as the basis for Mickey Mouse. Plot Oswald has to stop storks from delivering bunny children. History In the early summer of 1927, Disney finished the cartoon Poor Papa. However, Universal was not very satisfied. They had expected a more Charlie Chaplin-like character and thought Oswald was too elderly and too fat. Disney agreed to make some changes and the cartoon was not released in theatres at the time. So Disney made a second Oswald cartoon known as Trolley Troubles, which was well received and released instead. As for Poor Papa, it was released eventually in theatres, although Universal held it back until 1928. In total, nine Oswald cartoons were released in 1927. Preservation status After its release, Poor Papa was believed to be lost for many years, until around in the 2000s, where 3 surviving copies were found in the United Kingdom.

Although he was the fourth Count of √âvreux named Amaury, he is sometimes numbered Amaury VI de Montfort, as the sixth of his lineage in the House of Montfort. Amaury IV was the son of Count Amaury III of √âvreux and his wife, Mabel, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Earl William of Gloucester. His father died on the Third Crusade between 1187 and 1193 and he inherited √âvreux, including the honour of Gravenchon. In 1193‚Äì94, √âvreux was briefly occupied by royal French troops. Amaury's mother died in 1198 and her portion of the earldom of Gloucester and a claim to the title passed to him. As of 29 September 1198, Amaury was still a minor. During his minority, √âvreux may have been governed by officials of the Duke of Normandy, Amaury's feudal overlord. In 1195, Mabel paid a fee for the right to have custody of her son and his lands. Ducal officials may only have entered √âvreux after her death. In 1198, a custodian, Richard d'Argences, was administering justice in the county and the revenues were going to the Norman exchequer. Despite Mabel's status as eldest daughter, the earldom of Gloucester was in the hands of Count John of Mortain, husband of the youngest co-heiress, Isabelle. In April 1199, John became king of England. That same month, Philip II of France invaded √âvreux. In the Treaty of Le Goulet (May 1200), John ceded √âvreux to Philip and forced Amaury to quitclaim it. As compensation, Amaury received his mother's inheritance and the earldom of Gloucester, although he only gradually took control of the lands. Most of it was still in John's hands as late as 1204. The Gloucester lands included some small fiefs in Normandy: Sainte-Scolasse, √âvrecy and Thaon. All these, as well as Gravenchon, were lost to Philip of France by 1204‚Äì05. A new Anglo-French war over Normandy broke out in 1202, and initially Amaury joined his father-in-law on the side of King John. In May 1203, perhaps disgusted by John's murder of Arthur of Brittany, the two went into revolt. Amaury may have hoped to regain √âvreux from King Philip. Whatever the motives, the rebellion was over in a few months and the principals suffered few consequences from King John. Marriage Amaury's wife was Melisende (Millicent), a daughter of Hugh III de Gournay. She brought him Sotteville-sur-Mer in Normandy and Houghton Regis in England as her dowry. Out of his Gloucester inheritance, Amaury made donations to Missenden Abbey, long patronised by the Gournays, and made a gift to a certain Richard Talbot, a relative of the Gournays. On his death, he left Melisende the manors of Petersfield and Mapledurham as a dower. By 1216, she had remarried to William II de Cantilupe (died 1251), baron of Eaton Bray in Bedfordshire. In 1255 she became custodian of the fifteen-year-old Margaret, daughter of Henry III of England and queen of Alexander III of Scotland. She died in 1260.

Written by Jennell Jaquays, it was compatible with Dungeons & Dragons. A revised edition‚Äîcompatible with Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition‚Äîwas published in 2004. Contents The Caverns of Thracia is a scenario with a Greek mythical background that describes an intricate dungeon complex and lost city. The upper levels are for low-level characters; lower levels are more difficult. This supplement represents a series of rooms and caverns which have had many previous owners. Long ago they were a religious center for lizard men, but were later taken over by humans worshipping Thanatos, the god of death. The humans used beast men (gnolls, minotaurs, dog brothers, etc.) for slaves. The slaves rebelled and the caverns changed hands again. The beast men chose an intelligent minotaur to rule them; his descendants still reign. The caverns are now in the hands of the minotaur king, except for a small part of the first level, still controlled by the worshippers of Thanatos. This dungeon is for characters of levels 2 through 6. The Caverns of Thracia is an extensive setting and the text provides a great deal of historical background which fleshes out the adventure. Publication history The Caverns of Thracia was written by Jennell Jaquays, and was published by Judges Guild in 1979 as an 80-page book. Clark Peterson of Necromancer Games ran an adventure \\"Return to the Caverns of Thracia\\" based on the old adventure, as a tournament at the 2002 Gen Con Game Fair, and Necromancer put out a revised Caverns of Thracia in 2004, updated for 3.5 edition, but that was the last of their licensed publications before their license with Judges Guild lapsed. Reception Don Turnbull reviewed The Caverns of Thracia for White Dwarf #17, and rated it an 8 out of 10. He commented that \\"There are a few errors [...] and some cumbersome elements [...] but on the whole this is a thorough piece of work.\\" Turnbull concluded his review by commenting on Judges Guild adventures in general: \\"Inevitably, there remains the comparison with the TSR Modules, and I am bound to say that none of the Judges Guild products I have met so far hang together quite as well as the TSR Modules. There is a feeling of randomness about Caverns of Thracia, Dark Tower and the others which is not present in the TSR Modules, and one gets the impression that the coherence is incomplete. The TSR productions should be regarded, not as an unattainable height, but as a target of quality which should be equaled or even surpassed. That the two designs by [Jennell] Jaquays come closest in quality to the TSR standard is reassuring, since it seems that at least [Jennell] is making the effort.\\" Steve Cook reviewed The Caverns of Thracia in The Space Gamer No. 29. Cook commented that \\"A strong point of the game is its flexibility and variety. There are monsters that any low-level character could successfully tackle, but others will make even the bravest run. The fact that there are two opposing sides in the caverns opens up the possibility of the players allying themselves with one of the sides.\\" He continues: \\"The major problem of this game is that there are too many monsters. It seems you can't go ten feet without being jumped by gnolls, minotaurs, or other nasties. Another problem is that monsters which could be surprises aren't. Skeletons, dead bodies, statues, etc., are animated nearly every time.\\" Cook concluded his review by saying, \\"Overall, the good points greatly outweigh the bad. My player's reactions have been very positive toward this dungeon. If you want an exciting adventure for D&D;, then The Caverns of Thracia is for you.\\" Since that time, The Caverns of Thracia has come to be regarded as one of the classics of the genre, particularly within the Old School Renaissance community. Within this community, creating a dungeon that matches the amount of flexibility presented to the players in terms of available exploration paths and interactive factions has become known as Jaquaying a dungeon (a term coined by Justin Alexander of The Alexandrian blog). James Maliszewski of Grognardia called it \\"a good example of why Judges Guild is remembered so fondly by so many of us who started gaming in the 70s.\\" Reviews * Different Worlds #6 (Dec 1979) References Dungeons & Dragons modules Judges Guild fantasy role-playing game adventures ","title":"The Caverns of Thracia"},{"id":"53523978","text":"Character Chronicle Cards is a supplement for fantasy role-playing games published by Judges Guild in 1978.

First we have the old hoary fireball business ‚Äì the damage handed out is divided by the number of recipients; so take that cage of white mice with you. Then we have the concept of hits being cured by bandaging, which seems a trifle odd. To open a secret door, a roll is made against the character's intelligence; I could grand this for finding it, but once you have found a secret door, the fact that you have found it and identified it as such means you already have an idea how to open it, and brute strength is probably all that is required from then on. Also, to detect nature of traps, characters roll against wisdom; surely intelligence?? Well, you don't have to adopt these 'rules'.\\" Turnbull also reviewed Of Skulls and Scrapfaggot Green along with The Dragon Crown, and concluded his review by saying, \\"Neither of these products are up to the standard of the TSR modules, either in design quality or presentation. However they are by no means of poor quality [...] At the price, they represent reasonable value for money.\\" Lawrence Schick commented in his book Heroic Worlds: \\"Sound easy?

Contents Dungeon Floor Plans is a GM's aid: sheets of dungeon floors, passages, stairs, etc., for use with 25mm miniatures. It is also suitable for use with AD&D.; It was a set of terrain tiles intended to combine together to form various locations. Dungeon Floor Plans is a package that contains twelve thick cardboard sheets, each printed (in color) to represent flagstone flooring (tan), rough stone and dirt flooring (grey), wood (brown) and stone stairways (grey). The sheets are gridded into squares, and the lines have been incorporated into the design. The squares are to scale for 25mm figures, each being just over 2 cm x 2 cm and representing an area 5' x 5'. The DM can cut the sheets to create a continuous series of rooms and corridors covering an entire table-top. Publication history Dungeon Floor Plans was published by Games Workshop in 1979 as 12 color cardstock sheets. As Games Workshop expanded its publishing arm beyond White Dwarf and reprints of American products. among their first original products were a pad of character sheets (1978), a pad of hex sheets (1978), and the Dungeon Floor Plans (1979) gaming accessory, each of which carried the Dungeons & Dragons trademark, and were some of the few licensed D&D; products ever authorized by TSR. Games Workshop later reprinted the Dungeon Floor Plans in 1982 ‚Äì no longer sporting the D&D; logo ‚Äì as the first of several gaming supplements. Games Workshop later produced a set of compatible Dungeon Mapping Sheets in 1982,https://index.rpg.net/display- entry.phtml?mainid=6406&editionid;=7160 as a grid is of 2.5mm squares. Reception Peter Darvill-Evans reviewed Dungeon Floor Plans for White Dwarf #13, and rated it a 9 out of 10. He commented that \\"From a distance, the front of the package looks like an early 1950s television made of bright orange bakelite, with a bad case of interference right across the screen! I suppose it is eyecatching. The back, on the other hand, is very informative, giving a complete description of the Dungeon Floor Plans, a clear diagram, and instructions for use.\\" Darvill-Evans continued by saying \\"These sheets are not, of course, floor plans in themselves. The idea is that the DM should cut up the sheets and use pieces to lay out sections of his dungeon for the benefit of the players to map his dungeon and/or move their character figures along. An infinite number of dungeon sections can be created, suitable for any role-playing game or small-scale combat simulation, but specifically \\"endorsed by TSR Hobbies, Inc. for use with Original, Basic or Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\\".\\" He added: \\"considering it is all in two dimensions, the effect is incredibly realistic ‚Äì the floors are cracked, the wood has a grain to it, the stairs even have shadows to indicate whether they are ascending or descending. A half-square of wood can be used as a table, or a chest, or as a door which, when placed between the corridor and room sections, automatically forms a wall-thickness of 2 ¬Ω' scale. After years of feeling very out of place on a bright green Cul-de-Sac board, and even sometimes simply roaming across a deserted table, my characters can at last look quite at home on a playing surface that looks attractive, is easy to use, adds atmosphere to the game, and, not least, speeds up and simplifies combat.\\" Darvill-Evans stated that \\"There are only two possible criticisms: firstly, that laying out a complete dungeon area might make it too easy to map, and secondly, that the wall- thickness formed by the doors have to be allowed for by the DM in his original plan to avoid distortion.\\" He commented that \\"Other companies have tried to create this type of playing aid before ‚Äì Dungeon Decor and The Endless Dungeon are two titles which come to mind, and I'm sure there are others ‚Äì but Dungeon Floor Plans are far the best designed and most usable product, and, within the limitations of the cardboard, I can't think how they can be much improved.\\" Darvill-Evans concluded his review by saying, \\"They are sure to become an essential part of every DM's equipment, and at the price are a worthwhile investment.\\" Doug Cowie reviewed Dungeon Mapping Sheets for Imagine magazine, and stated that \\"These are intended for larger scale representations than the hex sheets (plans rather than maps) and are likely to be used mainly for dungeons, castles or villages. Until now most people will have used graph paper for these tasks.\\" Doug Cowie reviewed Dungeon Floor Plans 3 for Imagine magazine, and stated that \\"this is a good accessory which, if used with more preparation and forethought than the standard floor plans, will enhance the visual appeal of many outdoor adventures.\\" References Fantasy role-playing game supplements Role-playing game mapping aids ","title":"Dungeon Floor Plans"},{"id":"53524038","text":"Dungeon Tac Cards is a supplement for fantasy role-playing games published by Judges Guild in 1976.

Plot summary Modron is a scenario describing the village of Modron and a nearby underwater adventure, each with a large map. It includes both village and underwater encounters. Modron is a water goddess whose city was somehow preserved in a battle between her worshippers and the worshippers of her rival god, Proteus. Proteus' people's homes were destroyed, but a new city was built on top of the ruins. Explorers in the city can find a myriad of wealth and adventures. Several characters are sketchily described for the players, if they choose to use them. Publication history Modron was written by Bob Bledsaw and Gary Adams, and was published by Judges Guild in 1978 as a 16-page digest-sized book with a blue cover and two large maps. Judges Guild published a second edition in 1980. A listing of cumulative sales from 1981 shows that Modron sold over 15,000 units. Reception Elisabeth Barrington reviewed Modron in The Space Gamer No. 30. Barrington commented that \\"The graphics on the maps are excellent. The ideas presented in the background are interesting and novel, to some extent. Clarity is the key word in this module. Whatever is described is organized and easy to read.\\" However, she added \\"BUT there is not much described. In each room or place the characters go, the DM must quickly invent a few things to flesh out the descriptions given in the booklet. There are people in the places, and a couple of items, and that is all that is given. No room descriptions, no special traps or interesting things that happen unless you make them up as you go along; just a person or monster and some items.

It is notable for being the first stand-alone role-playing adventure. Contents Palace of the Vampire Queen is a simple early scenario for TSR's Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game set in a five-level dungeon, with maps for both the players and the GM. The adventure is set on the isle of Baylor in the Misty Isles archipelago. Publication history Palace of the Vampire Queen was written by Pete and Judy Kerestan, with art by Brad Schenck under his pseudonym \\"Morno\\". It was published as 15 loose-leaf sheets and an outer folder. Despite being an unlicensed D&D; product, in 1976, TSR picked Wee Warriors for exclusive distribution in order to promote sales of D&D;, making Palace of the Vampire Queen one of the first four Wee Warriors products to be widely sold in this manner. Occasionally copies of the adventure would arrive at TSR missing a page; TSR staff would add a photocopy of the missing page to the package. Palace of the Vampire Queen was the first published standalone role-playing game adventure. Although TSR's adventure Temple of the Frog had been published a year prior and thus was the first published RPG adventure, it was included in the D&D; Blackmoor expansion booklet, and was not a stand-alone adventure; TSR did not publish any stand-alone adventures until 1978. Wee Warriors published a second edition in 1976 that consisted of either 17 or 24 loose- leaf sheets ‚Äî sometimes pages were printed double-sided, sometimes only single-sided. The third and fourth printings in 1976 were 13 double-sided loose-leaf pages. Wee Warriors followed up in 1977 with a second adventure set on Baylor, Dwarven Glory, which was also distributed by TSR. However, late in 1977, the rapidly growing TSR stopped distributing third-party merchandise, and the fifth printing of Palace of the Vampire Queen took the form of a pamphlet-sized 30-page center-bound book that was distributed by Wee Warriors. The sixth and final edition, also distributed by Wee Warriors, was a 28-page pamphlet-sized book with a cardstock cover. A third D&D; adventure, Misty Isles, also set in the Misty Isles archipelago, was released in 1977 and was also distributed by Wee Warriors. Wee Warriors ceased publication in 1978. In 2019, Precis Intermedia acquired the Wee Warriors product line, with a re- release of Palace of the Vampire Queen as a remastered reprint.

The pipeline will cross the Yaqui River (Rio Yaqui), the main water source for the Yaqui, an indigenous tribe. The pipeline has an approximate length of 833 km upon completion, approximately 90 km of which will go through Yaqui territory. Some of the Yaqui community strongly oppose the pipeline and have campaigned against it. Geography and description The Agua Prieta pipeline is a natural gas pipeline project by IENova (a subsidiary of the Texas-based Sempra Energy) that aims to move natural gas from the U.S. state of Arizona to the northern Mexican states of Sonora and Sinaloa.Alexander Sammon, Get Ready for the Trump Pipeline Boom: 8 oil and gas projects in the works‚Äîand the protests gathering around them, Mother Jones (March 1, 2017). The Yaqui Valley is fed by numerous tributaries which drain the eastern highlands as they flow from the escarpment of the Sierra Madre Occidental to the Gulf of California.Cynthia Radding, Peasant Resistance on the Yaqui Delta, Journal of the Southwest, Vol. 31, No. 3 (Autumn 1989). The pipeline received a permit from the Mexican government approving its construction; gas distributed through the pipeline will go to the Comisi√≥n Federal de Electricidad, the national electric utility of Mexico. 262x262px Currently, the Agua Prieta pipeline consists of a 13 km pipeline that is 20 inches in diameter, having entered into operation in 2002. Once complete, the pipeline will be approximately 833 km long.Milton Martinez, Levantan a dos l√≠deres yaquis; acusan complicidad de polic√≠a estatal Yaquis leaders accuse State Police of Complicity, Proceso (December 14, 2016). The first portion of the pipeline that is currently undergoing construction is 505 km with 36 inches in diameter, and will transport natural gas from S√°sabe to Guaymas, Sonora. The second portion of the pipeline is planned to be 330 km with 30 inches in diameter, and will transport natural gas from Guaymas to El Oro, Sinaloa.  History  On December 12, 2013, the Mexican lower house voted by a two-thirds majority to end government control of Mexico's oil, historically opening up the nation to private companies and foreign investments after decades of nationalized oil. While project managers hail this pipeline as the bringer of clean and low-cost energy, Loma de B√°cum (the Yaqui holdout community) remain skeptical.  Opposition Yaqui community gatherings Yaqui territory is protected by the Mexican constitution and law which guarantees indigenous community land rights. Mexico, along with other Latin American countries, are signatories to the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention, which guards their rights and makes an informed consultation obligatory in the case of projects that affect their territories. The Agua Prieta pipeline will cross the Yaqui River (R√≠o Yaqui), the water source for the Yaqui, an indigenous tribe residing in the Yaqui Valley in Sonora, Mexico and the Southwestern United States. According to scholar Stephen V. Lutes, \\"the Yaqui are notoriously sensitive about the issue of autonomy, even today, and have shown a will to resist the encroachments of alien colonists and authority.\\"Evers, Larry: The Holy Dividing Line: Inscription and Resistance in Yaqui Culture (1992). Many past conflicts between the Yaqui and the Mexican government have focused on control over land and water. The anti-pipeline Solidaridad Tribu Yaqui group opposes the pipeline, saying that it infringes upon the territory and autonomy of the Yaqui and is a project of government and business violence. The rollback of environmental regulations by the Trump administration has further raised fears over the pipeline. There are differences among the Yaqui over the pipeline, leading to sometimes violent confrontation. Opponents of the project say that the pipeline will cross 90 kilometers into Yaqui territory in violation of Mexican law and that \\"building the pipeline without consultations that are deemed to be fair, transparent, and inclusive for all of the Yaqui communities would be a violation of the sovereignty of Yaqui land.\\" Yaqui activist Plutarco Flores, for example, told Inter Press Service (IPS), \\"We were not asked or informed. We want to be consulted, we want our rights to be respected. We are defending our territory, our environment.\\" In one consultation in May 2015, the Yaqui voted against the pipeline. Yaqui members from Loma de B√°cum secured a moratorium temporarily blocking pipeline construction. Despite the opposition from indigenous communities, construction continued, \\"allegedly with the support of government officials and the Yaqui members from the community of Loma de Guam√∫chil.\\" In October 2016, there was a clash at Loma de B√°cum involving the use of \\"machetes, clubs, rocks, and firearms.\\" One protester was fatally shot, eight were injured, and there was \\"significant property damage\\" including the burning of cars. In December 2016, Yaqui activist and lawyer Mar√≠a Anabela Carl√≥n Flores and her husband, Isabel Lugo Molina, were kidnapped at gunpoint by unknown masked men before eventually being released.Cristina G√≥mez Lima, Secuestran a abogada de los yaquis y a su esposo [Yaquis lawyer and her husband kidnapped], La Jornada (December 14, 2016). Following the abduction, Carl√≥n Flores filed a complaint with the office of the Sonora state prosecutor (the Procuradur√≠a General de Justicia del Estado en Sonora) and the State Commission on Human Rights (the Comisi√≥n Estatal de Derechos Humanos).Activista yaqui secuestrada acusa complicidad de la polic√≠a de Sonora [Yaqui activist kidnapped accuses Sonora police], La Silla Rota (December 21, 2016). Carl√≥n Flores accuses the State Public Security Police (Polic√≠a Estatal de Seguridad P√∫blica) of being complicit in the kidnapping.

Life Johannes Rak was born in 1457 in Sommerfeld (now Lubsko, Poland). His father, Matthias Rak, died young, and Johannes' grandfather Martin Rak, a mayor of Sommerfeld, saw to his education. Johannes matriculated at the University of Krak√≥w on 19 May 1491, when he studied natural history and astronomy. In Krak√≥w, he came under the influence of Conrad Celtes. On Celtes' advice, Johannes undertook a study tour in 1499. He travelled to Vienna, Venice, Padua, Ferrara, Rome, and finally to Bologna, where he studied Greek. In Bologna he studied under Filippo Beroaldo and befriended Jakob Questenberg (1460-1527). In 1506, he took a position at the newly founded University of Frankfurt as the Professor of Poetry and Rhetoric, alongside Gregor Schmerlin. He counted Ulrich von Hutten as one of his students; they had met in Frankfurt an der Oder, and Hutten followed him to Frankfurt. He earned a doctorate in theology in Rome. In 1512 he lecture on Greek at Paris, and in 1513 he lectured at the University of Cologne. In 1514 he opened a Latin school in Cottbus and a year later in Saxon Freiburg, which was headed by Ulrich R√ºlein von Calw. Aesticampanius continued his university work and lectured on Pliny at the University of Wittenberg in the winter semester of 1517. In winter 1519, Aesticampianus fell ill and afterwards suffered from shortness of breath. He died not long after on May 31 in Wittenberg, and was buried in the Stadtkirche Wittenberg.

The longest-reigning monarch in British history, Queen Elizabeth II is the first British monarch to have a sapphire jubilee. Contrary to her Silver, Golden and Diamond Jubilees, there were no widespread public celebrations of the Sapphire Jubilee. Instead, like the February 1992 Ruby Jubilee, the Queen did not undertake any official engagements. As then, she spent the day in \\"quiet reflection\\" on the anniversary of the death of her father, George VI, and undertaking official work at Sandringham House. She attended a service at St Peter and St Paul Church in West Newton, Norfolk on Sunday 5 February, where she was greeted by crowds of well-wishers. Larger-scale celebrations took place in June 2016, to mark the Queen's 90th birthday, and any extensive celebrations would be reserved for a possible Platinum jubilee in 2022. Despite proposals for larger celebrations to mark the 65th anniversary of the Queen's accession in June 2017, including a mooted bank holiday, no such celebrations were held. The Sapphire Jubilee featured blue stamps from the Royal Mail, commemorative coins from the Royal Mint, and a reissue of an official 2014 portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by David Bailey. In this official portrait the Queen wears sapphire jewellery which she received as a wedding present from her father. In September 2017, a new community centre in Collier Row, Romford, was named the Sapphire Jubilee Community Centre in the Queen's honour. The Jubilee also involved the ringing of the bells in Westminster Abbey, a 41-gun salute by the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park, a 62-gun salute by the Honourable Artillery Company at the Tower of London and gun salutes in several other places around the United Kingdom. Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, congratulated the Queen, saying in part that the occasion was \\"another remarkable milestone for our remarkable Queen. ... I know the nation will join with me today in celebrating and giving thanks for the lifetime of service Her Majesty the Queen has given to our country and to the Commonwealth. ... She has truly been an inspiration to all of us and I am proud, on behalf of the nation, to offer our humble thanks and congratulations on celebrating this Sapphire Jubilee.\\" At a celebration of Canada's sesquicentennial in Canada House on 19 July 2017, the Sapphire Jubilee Snowflake Brooch was presented to the Queen as a gift from the Governor General of Canada.

Later that month, the station's call sign was changed to WOEZ. The station would air a soft adult contemporary format (similar to that of WDUV in Tampa, Florida, or WFEZ in Miami, Florida) to northwestern lower Michigan. The station was branded \\"Easy 106-3\\". Typical artists included Barbra Streisand, Barry Manilow, Elvis Presley, The Carpenters, Olivia Newton-John, Elton John, Celine Dion, and Kenny Rogers among others, with a small scattering of more contemporary AC hits from artists like Adele, Colbie Caillat, and Lady Antebellum. This format was also heard on WQEZ 95.5 FM of Glen Arbor, Michigan from 2013 until 2017, who separately imaged as \\"Easy 95.5\\". The two stations aired the same musical format with the same songs in the same order (with a slight delay), but were not simulcast, as station imaging, commercials, and weather forecasts were separate. 95.5 is now known as WGFE, simulcasting sister station WGFM 105.1. On March 17, 2017, the Easy format ended on 95.5 FM, as WQEZ would become a simulcast of sister station WGFM as WGFE. This left WOEZ as the standalone \\"Easy\\" outlet.

Aircraft and crew  The aircraft involved in the accident was a Tupolev Tu-104A, registered to Aeroflot. The aircraft made its first flight on 26 November 1956 and was delivered to Irkutsk in December 1957 after being used for test flights. The aircraft was originally configured to seat 70 passengers, but was later re- arranged to seat 85 passengers. At the time of the crash the aircraft had 22,069 flight hours and 10,308 pressurization cycles. The cockpit crew consisted of the following: * Ivan Nikolaevich Svistunov serving as pilot in command * Anatoly Fedorovich Grafenkov serving as copilot * Yuri Mikhailovich Krasnoyarsk serving as navigator * Vladimir Nikolaevich Dubrovsky was a navigator in training * Nikolai Yefimovich Konshin as flight engineer * German Vladimirovich Firstov served as radio operator The cabin crew consisted of four flight attendants.  Sequence of events  Despite having only 85 seats in the cabin, 104 passengers were permitted to board the aircraft. The crew was permitted to allow more passengers to board, four of them with tickets, one the adult son of the radio operator who didn't have a ticket. Two of the unseated passengers were placed in the restrooms, two in the front of the aircraft, and the radio operator's son sat in the cockpit. None of the five additional passengers were listed in the flight documents. It is not completely clear where the remaining passengers without seats stood. Flight 3739 started takeoff from Irkutsk at 8:15 AM local time at a bearing of 116¬∞. During takeoff the aircraft began to roll to the right, but with considerable effort the pilots rolled the aircraft 20¬∞ to the left in efforts to level the aircraft. The aircraft broke away from the runway at 300 km/h, when the pilots were able to temporarily level the aircraft only for the aircraft to start banking to the right again at 30 meters. Rapidly losing altitude, the aircraft crashed eight seconds after separating from the runway at a bank angle of 70¬∞, just 180 meters past the southeast end of the runway. A Chosonminhang Tupolev Tu-154, registered P-551, was damaged after being struck by the aircraft during the crash.  Investigation  Investigators initially suspected the right wing had been modified during maintenance in such a way that it resulted in an aerodynamic imbalance. To confirm this hypothesis, the remains of the right wing were sent to the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute, where engineers concluded the right wing was fully functional until impact. Investigators recreated the flight path until impact on another Tupolev Tu-104, and published their findings. Flight testing showed that the Tupolev Tu-104 was prone to banking in a side wind. In the low altitude situation, the pilot's response of adjusting the ailerons was not sufficient; the proper response would have been to sharply pull back on the throttles. They concluded that as soon as the aircraft separated from the runway, the aircraft exceeding the aircraft flight manual recommended 2-3¬∞ angle of takeoff, at times reaching a dangerous 3-4¬∞; the wind was believed to have pushed the right wing into the roll. Calculations showed the right fuel tanks held an estimated 1300-1500 kilos more fuel than the left, contributing to the roll. A Chosonminhang Tupolev Tu-154, similar to the aircraft struck by debris  Causes  The commission of the Ministry of Aviation Industry of the USSR tasked with investigating the crash concluded the causes of the accident were as follows; # The aircraft was refueled asymmetrically, calculations showed the right fuel tanks held an estimated 1300-1500 kilos more fuel than the left, causing the aircraft to roll to the right; # Inadequate pilot response to the emergency, ignoring the automatic angle of attack and overload alarm for eight seconds before responding; # Increased right bank upon separation from the runway that could not be corrected with ailerons alone.

Biography Daniel Merriman was born in Bennington, Vermont, to Addison Merriman and Prudence (Adams) Merriman. He was educated at Williams College, from which he graduated in 1863. During the Civil War, he served as a first lieutenant and as an adjutant to an Illinois regiment. At war's end, he entered Andover Theological Seminary, graduating with a Doctor of Divinity degree in 1868. Merriman's first ministry was in Norwich, Connecticut, at the Broadway Congregational Church. In 1874, he married the artist and philanthropist Helen Bigelow Merriman, and they had a son, Roger Bigelow Merriman, who became a historian. They settled in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1878, where he served for 22 years as minister at the Central Congregational Church. Merriman and his wife led the drive to construct a new building for the Congregational Church at the corner of Grove St. and Institute Rd. Designed by architect Stephen C. Earle in the Romanesque Revival style, it was completed in 1885; today the building is known as the United Congregational Church. Merriman was one of the original founders and trustees of the Worcester Art Museum, and he drafted the museum's bylaws. When it opened in 1898, he served as its first president, and he sat on various administrative committees. When he died, the trustees wrote that next to Stephen Salisbury III, \\"the Worcester Art Museum owes most to Daniel Merriman, under whose administration it has won position, prestige, and the confidence of the public\\". In 1910, Joseph DeCamp painted a portrait of Merriman that was later donated to the museum.

Commanded by General Karl von Roques, it was an area of military jurisdiction behind Wehrmacht's Army Group South. The Group South Rear Area's outward function was to provide security behind the fighting troops. It was also a site of mass murder during The Holocaust and other crimes against humanity targeting the civilian population. In the words of historian Michael Parrish, the army commander \\"presided over an empire of terror and brutality\\". Organisation The commander of the Army Group South Rear Area, General Karl von Roques, was responsible for the rear area security. Its headquarters was subordinated to Army Group South, while also reporting to the Wehrmacht's Quartermaster General Eduard Wagner, who had the overall responsibility for rear area security. Roques controlled three Security Divisions (213th, 444th, and 454th) and oversaw the units of Secret Field Police of the Wehrmacht. He operated in parallel, and in cooperation, with Friedrich Jeckeln, the Higher SS and Police Leaders appointed by the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler. Security warfare and crimes against humanity The area commanders' duties included security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combatting guerillas (partisans) in Wehrmacht's rear areas, which were the primary tasks of the security divisions. In addition, security and police formations of the SS and the SD (SS Security Service) operated in the areas, being subordinated to the respective Higher SS and Police Leaders. These units included multiple Einsatzgruppen death squad detachments, Police Regiment South and additional Order Police battalions. These units perpetrated mass murder during The Holocaust and other crimes against humanity. While under military jurisdiction, the area was the site of the massacres at Babi Yar and Kamianets-Podilskyi. The security formations, often in coordination with or under the leadership of the Wehrmacht, conducted security warfare targeting the civilian population. The so-called anti-partisan operations in \\"bandit- infested\\" areas amounted to destruction of villages, seizure of livestock, deporting of able-bodied population for slave labour to Germany and murder of those of non-working age.

He won the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) Bull of the Year title in 1996 as well as many other honors throughout his career. He bucked until he was 12 years old, considered an old age for a bull to buck, and he did it at a very high level. He bucked more than 100 times at all levels, which very few bulls manage. He retired in 2000. He is also known for the accidental death of bull rider Brent Thurman.  Background  Red Wolf was born in 1988. He was red with a white face. Red Wolf's first owner was Don Kish of Kish's Buckin' Bulls. Red Wolf went to the 1994 National Finals Rodeo (NFR) while still with Don Kish. He competed multiple times at the NFR and was a contender for the PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year in 1994 and won it in 1996, receiving that honor as well as Sierra Circuit Bucking Bull of the Year in 1996. Terry Williams bought Red Wolf from Kish at the conclusion of the 1996 NFR. He was renamed as Dodge RAM Tough. In 1999, Terry Williams sold Red Wolf and three other noteworthy bulls (Hollywood, Moody Blues, and Locomotive Breath) to the Herrington Cattle Company for $200,000. The new owners restored his name to Red Wolf.  Career  Red Wolf maintained his powerful, intense performance ability far longer than other bulls, from 1995 through his retirement in 2000. During his second year in the PBR in 1995, Red Wolf made quite an impression in Rancho Murieta, California when he bucked off Heroes & Legends Celebration: Ring of Honor inductee and Livestock Director to-be Cody Lambert in 4.09 seconds. \\"He was a big bull,\\" Lambert remembers, \\"but he felt even bigger when he was bucking.\\" The next day, Red Wolf quickly dropped Bubba Dunn on the ground with the need for five stitches on his chin. Red Wolf was 7 years old at the time. Red Wolf was as well known for his competitiveness. He was described as having the swagger of a champion boxer in the arena. Ty Murray recalls that the bull would often take a \\"high-headed\\" lap around the arena, which Lambert described as a ‚Äúvictory lap‚Äù. When someone rode him or almost rode him to the buzzer, he was dangerous; he would try to hook or trample the rider at the end of the performance, and if unable to do so, would go after any other rodeo official in the ring. Lambert commented that the bull had a ‚Äúcompetitive fire‚Äù and appeared to become angrier the longer someone stayed on. \\"He would want to hook your ass when it was over, \\" Murray said. Once in 1995 when Lambert attempted to ride Red Wolf, he felt that anger rising. Lambert purposely fell to the ground after getting bucked off to avoid being injured. The bull could also be dangerous to bystanders; Lambert described an incident in 1997: \\"while one of the judges was calculating the score Red Wolf ran him over. We had to bring in an alternate judge to finish the round.\\" Dunn rode Red Wolf in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1999. Remembering that he had gotten five stitches on an earlier ride and that Red Wolf had accidentally killed Brent Thurman at the 1994 NFR, he was nervous. Nevertheless, Dunn rode Red Wolf for 96 points on his second encounter with the bull. At this point, Red Wolf was 11 years old. Dunn said, \\"He had great days and he had good days. He never had bad days.\\" At the 2000 PBR World Finals, Red Wolf gave up two qualified rides for his final two rides in his career. In round 2, Jaron Nunnemaker rode him for 89.5 points, with a 44-point bull score. In round 4, Pete Hessman rode him for 90 points, and Red Wolf received a bull score of 45 points in his final appearance. These would be considered outstanding bull scores for a young bull, let alone a bull his age. His final buckoff had come two months earlier when he bucked off World Champion Cody Custer in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Long time bull riding champion Ty Murray commented on the length of his career and said, \\"He wasn't supposed to be able to do it for as long as he did. I always thought he was a freak of nature.\\" Red Wolf was known as an \\"eliminator bull,\\" challenging because of the lack of set pattern to his jumps. = Brent Thurman's death = Sunday, December 11, 1994, was the first time a bull riding incident resulted in the death of a bull rider at an NFR when Brent Thurman was stomped on and killed by Red Wolf. At the time, Red Wolf weighed , a very large bull. Halfway into the ride, Thurman was bucked off and became entangled in his leather rigging. The rigging pulled him underneath Red Wolf's hooves where he was stomped about his neck and head. Thurman, unconscious, was dispatched to University Medical Center with severe cranial and facial fractures. He died six days later, having never regained consciousness. Red Wolf was not considered vicious for a bull, and the death was ruled a ‚Äúfreak accident.‚Äù This happened when Red Wolf was still owned by Kish's Buckin' Best in Red Bluff, California. Bull riders Lane Frost (who died in 1989) and Brent Thurman both died at age 25 from injuries received from bulls. Thus, the PBR created the Lane Frost/Brent Thurman Award in their honor. Both men were recognized with the Heroes and Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor, which is considered the equivalent of a hall of fame honor. = PBR 20/20 = In 2013, RFD-TV listed the 1999 World Finals among its Top 20 events and featured it as an episode of their \\"PBR 20/20\\" series. The 1999 World Finals were the first time the finals were held at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. On Friday night, there were 11 scores of 90+ points. Throughout the entire event, there were 15 scores of 91 points or better. And eight of those scores (more than half of them) occurred Friday night in Round 2. And of those eight scores, five of those were 94 points or higher. Two-time PBR World Champion Chris Shivers rode PRCA Bull of the Year Trick or Treat for 96 points. Two- time PRCA World Champion Terry Don West rode PBR World Champion Bull Promise Land for 96 points as well. Nine-time PRCA World Champion holder (7 all-around and 2 bull riding) Ty Murray rode Red Wolf for 95.5 points. Jaron Nunnemaker rode PBR World Champion Bull Panhandle Slim for 94 points. PRCA World Champion Bull Rider Jim Sharp rode Jim Jam for 94 points as well. Two-time PBR World Champion Justin McBride got a qualified ride on Nitro for 91 points which means he missed the top 5. Mike White also got a qualified ride for 91 points on Skat Kat Skoal. The pair split 7th and 8th in the round and were nowhere near earning a check. = Career summary = Red Wolf bucked in the PRCA and the Bud Light Cup Series (BLC), the elite circuit of the PBR. Red Wolf had an extremely long career compared to other high level bucking bulls. He qualified for six consecutive PBR World Finals. His BLC career buckoff percentage was 58.97. In 39 outs, he gave up 16 qualified rides, including seven round wins. His average bull score at the end was 45.54 points. As of the end of 2013, Red Wolf was among the top 20 bulls in PBR history for average bull score and average ride score. Since 90 point rides are also tracked in the \\"90-point club,\\" Red Wolf was in tenth place for the number of 90+ rides produced at the time. His last out was made at the 2000 PBR World Finals. In 1996 Red Wolf was voted the Bull of the Year at the NFR, the highest honor of the PRCA for an active bull. Unlike most other Brand of Honor bulls, he never achieved the PBR World Champion Bull title. In April 2016, Cody Lambert compared Red Wolf to current active PBR bull Stanley Fatmax. \\"He really doesn‚Äôt have the talent to win it. He has as much heart as any bull that‚Äôs ever bucked. He‚Äôs been around a long time, and he‚Äôs going to end up like Red Wolf, who was so great for so long, but never quite great enough to be the PBR World Champ.\\" Fatmax has more than 100 outs at all levels and has been a bull who has bucked at a high level for a long time.  Retirement and death  Lambert was one of the judges at the 2000 Finals. According to him, \\"I never thought in any particular year he was the very best going, but for an entire career, I thought he was the best there ever was.\\" Slade Long, PBR bull statistician, and owner of Probullstats.com, has observed over 30,000 bulls as of 2013. Long remarked that approximately 12,000 of them posted more than five or more career outs. Even more infrequent was a bull who reached 100 career outs. Long also added that he is aware of only 65 bulls to reach 100 career outs, Red Wolf stood out to Long: \\"Bulls that are 12 years old just don't make 90-point rides. They are just not that good anymore. It just doesn't happen.\\" Red Wolf retired at age 12 in 2000, which is considered quite old for a bull. In 2013, the PBR awarded Red Wolf with the highest honor a bull can receive, the Heroes and Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor. This award was inaugurally awarded to Little Yellow Jacket in 2011. This award is awarded every year to an exceptional bull and is the equivalent of a hall of fame honor. The ceremony was held on October 22, 2013, at the South Point Hotel, Casino & Spa. Red Wolf's last owner, stock contractor Robbie Herrington of Herrington Cattle Company, was unable to attend the event due to the death of a close family friend. Instead, retired bull rider J.W. Hart and Cody Lambert spoke on his behalf. Red Wolf was 13 when he retired. Lambert noted that the average age of bulls competing at the Finals in 2013 was 6. And, by comparison, two bulls retiring that year were 9 years old. Red Wolf died at age 18 on December 29, 2006, at the Herrington Ranch in Mont Belvieu,Texas. Robby Herrington, the bull's owner, said that Red Wolf was treated \\"like a king\\" and was well-respected by both fans and competitors. \\"Red Wolf was like the Jerry Rice of bucking bulls,\\" said Ty Murray, PBR President. Randy Bernard, CEO of the PBR, commented on his athleticism and personality, describing his behavior at a ceremony held in his honor:  Honors  * 2013 PBR Heroes and Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor * 2000 5th place PBR Bull of the Year * Qualified for the PBR Finals 6 straight years, 1995‚Äì2000 * 1999 High Ride: Bubba Dunn 96 points in Charlotte, North Carolina * 1998 PBR Third Place PBR Bull of the Year * 1997 PBR Bull of the Finals ‚Äì Second Place * 1997 PBR Bull of the Year ‚Äì Second Place * 1996 PRCA Bull of the Year * 1996 2nd Place Bucking Bull of the NFR * 1996 Sierra Circuit Bucking Bull of the Year * 1996 Dodge Bounty Bull of the Year * 1994 2nd Place Bucking Bull of the NFR * Years selected to NFR 1993‚Äì96  References   External links  * Herrington Cattle Company web site * Brand of Honor ‚Äì Red Wolf YouTube Videos: * Red Wolf ‚Äì Bucking Bull Tribute * Ty Murray vs Red Wolf ‚Äì 99 PBR Finals (95.5 pts) * Troy Dunn vs Red Wolf ‚Äì 97 PBR Finals (95 pts) * Terry Don West vs Red Wolf ‚Äì 99 PBR Landover (94 pts) * Cody Custer vs Red Wolf ‚Äì 98 PBR Finals (95.5 pts) * Adriano Moraes vs Red Wolf ‚Äì 97 PBR St. Louis (91 pts) * Chris Shivers vs Red Wolf ‚Äì 99 PBR Columbus, OH (93.5 pts) 1988 animal births 2006 animal deaths Bucking bulls Individual bulls in sport Professional Bull Riders: Heroes and Legends ","title":"Red Wolf (bull)"},{"id":"53524734","text":"1720 √•rs skr√•ordning ('Guild Regulation of 1720') was a law reform introduced in Sweden in 1720. It replaced the 1669 √•rs allm√§nna skr√•ordning ('General Guild Regulation of 1669') and, with additional modifications, regulated the guild system and business life in Sweden until the Fabriks och Handtwerksordning and Handelsordningen of 1846. Regulation of 1720 The Guild Regulation of 1720 replaced the previous Guild Regulation of 1669, which had been the first national Guild Regulation in Sweden. There had been many suggestions to abolish the guild system, which called for a reform. The reformed Guild Regulation essentially kept the already established customary system with masters and apprentices. The reform consisted in the codification of customary regulations already in common use, as well as a simplification of the system, in order to make a guild memberships more easily attainable. The most radical reform was that concerning women's rights within the guild system. Women were already de facto active as guild members, but the Guild Regulation of 1720 explicitly secured women the right to work within the guild professions, both as apprentices and assistants in the workshop of a master, or as masters of their own workshop. Women were further more guaranteed the right to buy a permit from the city magistrates to manage a business outside of the guilds as kontingentborgare. The practice of these reforms were somewhat different. The permit for women to manage workshops themselves were often interpreted by the authorities as merely a permit for a woman to be active in a certain guild profession personally; that is, she was seldom allowed to have apprentices. It is however confirmed that there were many women professionally active as apprentices in male masters shops in 18th- century Stockholm with support of this law. The Civil Code of 1734, in which married women were placed under the guardianship of their husbands, and unmarried women under the guardianship of their closest male relative, complicated their possibility to use the rights given them in the Guild Regulation of 1720, as only widowed and divorced women were of legal majority. The procedure for unmarried women wishing to engage in business, were to have themselves declared of legal majority by royal petition, which became a common procedure for unmarried business women, but married women did not have this right, and the Civil Code therefore in fact prevented married women from using the rights afforded to women in the Guild Regulation. However, the city magistrates and the crown often granted special dispensation to women to engage in business and various professions, despite opposition from the guilds, if the woman applicant could prove that she needed to support herself; these special permits were granted also to married women whose husbands could not support them, despite married women being legal minors, and the dispensation were granted with reference to this law. Amendments of 1810 The Guild Regulation of 1720 was in place until 1846, but adjusted by several amendments. In the Riksdag of 1809-10, a number of reforms in the legal privileges of the four official classes were introduced prompted by the Coup of 1809, and this included the privileges of the burgher class, represented by the guild system. The reform of 1810 stated that any citizen had the right to practice a profession outside of the guild provided that they fulfilled their professional obligations. The Guilds interpreted obligations to be the traditional guild requirements, while the city magistrates started to issue permits to male citizens outside the guilds (women already had that opportunity since before): the conflicts was solved in 1820, when the monarch stated that the Guild Regulation of 1720 was still in use. The right of the Guilds to persecute professionals active outside of the Guilds was also abolished. This was a right which had previously often been used by the Guilds to persecute those given permits and special dispensations to be active in a profession outside of the Guilds by the city magistrates and the crown, and the right had since 1720 been a cause of conflict between the Guilds and the other authorities. With this ban, the Guilds were finally explicitly forced to respect permits and special dispensations given by other authorities that the Guilds to be active within Guild professions. However, this ban was never to be respected by the Guilds, and the court cases between the Guilds and the city authorities regarding people with special permits and dispensations continued, even after the monarch tried to enforce the law in 1820. All unmarried or widowed women applicants (as married women were under guardianship) were given permission to engage in all professions, trades and handicrafts socially acceptable for them by custom without having to fulfill any of the educational requirements which was necessary for a male applicant when applying for a permit. The reason stated was that a certain number of professions were already widely socially accepted for women, such as that of seamstress, glove maker, knitting socks, button- and ribbon maker, baker and that of selling ornaments; and that it would benefit women who was forced to support themselves that these profession were made more easily attainable. The profession of seamstress were regarded as so suitable for a woman that city magistrates regularly gave women permits to be active outside of the Guilds despite opposition from the Guild of Taylors, so much so that the Taylor's Guild were undermined to extinction; in the 1770s, they were 175 seamstresses in Stockholm, and in 1790, only 114 Guild taylors with permit to sew women's clothes remained. The Riksdag of 1809 suggested that the Taylor's Guild be abolished and the taylor profession be reserved for women: though this did not happen, the dispensations given to seamstresses to be active outside of the taylor's guild, which had grown since the mid 18th-century, became so many by the early 19th-century that the Taylor's Guild de facto left the manufacture of women's clothes to seamstresses. Amendments of 1819-1845 The period of 1819, until the final abolition of the guild system by the Fabriks och Handtwerksordning and Handelsordningen of 1846, was filled of a number of amendments undermining the guild system. In 1819, the owner of gardens in Stockholm were allowed to sell their fruits and vegetables in the city on the same terms as the members of the Garden master's Guild. Women were also explicitly awarded a number of professional rights, all with reference to their need to support themselves: in 1821, women were given the right to manufacture cut glass; in 1832 the right to make metal objects; and the years up until 1845 the right to make and sell, among others, Lacquer, pomade, perfume, soap, balsam, food, syrup, chocolate, lemonade. In 1835, women were given the right to become bakers without having to apply for a dispensation. By 1846, the amendments to the Guild Regulation of 1720 and the demands to abolish the Guild system altogether became so urgent that it was finally replaced by the Fabriks och Handtwerksordning and Handelsordningen of 1846.

Early life  Edna Rudolph was born June 16, 1909, in New York City, the daughter of the artist John and Anna (Beilenson) Rudolph. She graduated cum laude with a degree in journalism from Hunter College in 1928.\\"Edna Beilenson\\". Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale, 2007. Literature Resource Center. In 1930, Rudolph married her cousin, Peter Beilenson, who had founded the Peter Pauper Press in 1928.  Career  In 1932, Edna Beilenson joined in the business of press work at the Peter Pauper Press, learning bookkeeping and typesetting. She is credited with bringing a strong sense of graphic design and color to the press's productions, which became the hallmarks of Peter Pauper publications. The Press aimed \\"to print books as beautifully as a craftsman might, and sell them as cheaply as only a pauper could\\". Beilenson developed a keen business sense, introducing the concept of pocket-sized gift books, and edited a series of small cookbooks that sold extremely well.  The Distaff Side  Beilenson led a group of women active in the production of fine press books, from various forms of illustration to bookbinding, punch cutting, typesetting, and graphic design, possibly as a women's response to the Typophiles organization, which did not admit women. Their first formal production was a feminist work entitled Bookmaking on the Distaff Side, published in 1937. They were joined by two male luminaries of the private press world, Bruce Rogers, who wrote the introduction, and Frederic W. Goudy, who wrote a remembrance of his wife, Bertha M. Goudy, who had died in 1936. Beilenson, Jane Grabhorn, Gertrude Stein, Wanda G√°g, and others contributed essays, histories, images, and other works of satire and commentary about women's overlooked roles in the production of books; each signature of the book was printed by a different woman printer. For example, Beilenson's essay, \\"Men in Printing\\", was printed at the Peter Pauper Press, while Anne Lyon Haight's satire, \\"Are Women the Natural Enemies of Books?\\" was printed at the Powgen Press. Beilenson's introduction to a 1950 Distaff Side publication, A Children's Sampler, clearly illuminates the group's mission: :\\"The Distaff Side is a loosely-knit organization ... of women; and its membership has been enlisted from printing- offices, publishing houses, studios and other hiding-places where may be found devotees of the graphic arts.... [It] was born out of a righteous indignation that sufficient recognition had never been accorded to woman's place in the history of printing. To amend this deficiency, The Distaff Side published its first book, titled Bookmaking on the Distaff Side, which disclosed the monumental contributions which spinsters, wives, and widows have made to the graphic arts.\\" Under Beilenson's leadership, members of the same group later formed the Distaff Press which published several other titles on the subject of women's printing history.  Professional achievements and awards  Beilenson became an active member of the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) and other professional book and graphic arts organizations. She was elected AIGA's first woman president, a post she held from 1958 to 1960. She was among the first women elected to the Grolier Club, a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in London,\\"Edna Beilenson, 71, Graphic Arts Expert and Book Publisher\\". The New York Times March 4, 1981. and president and chairman of the Goudy Society. In 1968, Who's Who of American Women cited Beilenson as the year's outstanding woman in business. In 1973 she was elected to the Hunter College Alumnae Hall of Fame. In 1980, she received the Rochester Institute of Technology's Goudy Award for excellence in typography. Edna Beilenson's role in the printing and publishing business was so fully integrated with her husband's that when Peter Beilenson died suddenly in 1962, she was able to take over the business and continue the press's operations successfully until her own death on February 28, 1981. Since 1981, the Beilenson family has continued to operate the Peter Pauper Press as a family business.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. It was the first of three solar eclipses that took place that year, the next was a total eclipse on July 8, 1842 and covered almost all of the Northern Hemisphere. It was the solar saros 119 cycle of eclipses Description The eclipse was visible in much of the three southern oceans including the southeast part of the Pacific, most of the South Atlantic Ocean and its islands and small parts of the Indian Ocean surrounding Antarctica with a tiny bit probably excluded. It also included the southern tip of South America which included Patagonia and the Falkland Islands and the Cape Colony (now Southern and Northern Cape which are part of South Africa). It showed 30% obscuration at Ushuaia and the Falklands (or Malvinas), 50% around the South Georgia, South Orkney and Livingston Islands, 60% at the north of the Antarctic Peninsula and 80% in the middle part. The rim of the eclipse included southeast of Tuamotu Islands, Puerto Montt and areas south of Buenos Aires. The eclipse started at sunrise offshore from New Zealand and ended at sunset in a smaller part of southern Africa. The greatest eclipse was in midcentral Antarctica at 75.8 S and 1.4 E some kilometers from the Prime Meridian at 16:25 UTC The duration was 6 min 15 seconds and showed 91.5% obscuration of the sun.  Related eclipses  = Saros 119 = It is a part of Saros cycle 119, repeating every 18 years, 11 days, containing 71 events. The series started with partial solar eclipse on May 15, 850 AD.

The Year 2440: A Dream If Ever There Was One but usually translated into English as Memoirs of the Year Two Thousand Five Hundred or Memoirs of the Year 2500) is a 1771 novel by Louis- S√©bastien Mercier. It has been described as one of the most popular and controversial novels of the 18th century, one of the earliest works of science fiction and the first work of utopian fiction set in the near future, rather than in some far-away but contemporary place.  Plot  The work describes the adventures of an unnamed man, who, after engaging in a heated discussion with a philosopher friend about the injustices of Paris, falls asleep and finds himself in a Paris, several centuries into the future. He wonders through the changed city, eventually ending up in the ruins of the Versailles. Mercier's hero notes everything that catches his fancy in this futuristic Paris. Public space and the justice system have been reorganized. Its citizens' garb is comfortable and practical. Hospitals are effective and based on science. There are no monks, priests, prostitutes, beggars, dancing masters (i.e. teachers), pastry chefs, standing armies, slavery, arbitrary arrest, taxes, guilds, foreign trade, coffee, tea or tobacco; as such jobs, institutions or products have been judged useless and immoral, as has much of the previously-written literature, which has been willingly destroyed by the future librarians themselves, who proudly display their future library, reduced to a single room of only the most valuable works. Written on the eve of the French Revolution, the book described a futuristic, secular and pacifist France in the aftermath of a peaceful revolution by a \\"philosopher- king\\" who established a system resembling a parliamentary monarchy. The utopian, egalitarian France of the future is portrayed as having no religion and no military.  Editions and translations  Everett C. Wilkie Jr. noted that there have been many erroneous statements made about the Mercier's bibliography in general, and publication history of L'An 2440 in particular. According to Evelyn L. Forget, Mercier finished the first manuscript in 1768, through Wilkie notes that parts of the book clearly date to 1770 as they reference events of that year. Sources vary when reporting the year of the book's first edition, attributing to year 1770 or 1771. Wilkie noted that it might have been \\"pulled off the press so late in 1770 that it was dated 1771, the year it was actually sold\\", but \\"despite evidence to the contrary [as no known edition dating to 1770 has been found], scholarly practice has made the supposed 1770 edition of this novel an enduring bibliographical ghost\\". The confusion is partially the fault of the author, as Mercier himself, at different times, gave both dates as the year of the first edition's publication. Wilkie concludes that the only fact that Mercier was consistent about is that the first edition was published in Amsterdam by Van Harrevelt, and given the existing evidence, strongly leans towards choosing the year 1771, likely around the summer, as the correct time of the book's publication. Due to its highly controversial criticism of the Ancien R√©gime and portrayal of the secular future, it was not allowed to be published at first, and was published anonymously, and trafficked underground through smugglers and illicit booksellers. Despite being banned in France and Spain (including by the Holy See in 1773 and the Spanish Inquisition in 1778, earning it a place in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum; it was also supposedly burned by the Spanish king himself), the book quickly became popular in France, where it had over twenty editions during Mercier's lifetime, and hence was described as an \\"underground bestseller\\"; it also received a number of translations abroad (and a number of unauthorized - in other words, pirated and even slightly altered - editions). It has been described as \\"one of the eighteenth century most successful books\\" (and \\"one of the most controversial\\"), with an estimated over 60,000 copies in several languages printed during that time, although its reception by contemporary critics was mixed. Mercier's admitted to the book's authorship by late 1770s, and his name would finally appear in the book's 1791 edition, following the fall of the previous regime; due to the late admission, some early versions of this work have been attributed to Rousseau or Voltaire. Louis-Sebastien Mercier; L'An Deux Mille Quatre Cent Quarante. Vol.II; Paris: Lepetit Jeune et Gerard, 1802 It has been translated to English first in 1772 by William Hooper; it was the first utopia published in the United States, and Thomas Jefferson's and George Washington, among others, owned the first edition. Around the same time it was also translated to Dutch and German, and few years later into Italian. For the English edition, Hooper changed the title to Memoirs of the Year Two Thousand Five Hundred or Memoirs of the Year 2500 and added a number of footnotes (Mercier's choice of the somewhat awkward number 2440 might be related to it being his 700th birthday, whereas Hooper's title, described as \\"perplexing\\" by one scholar, is likely due to his preference for a simpler, rounded up title). Mercier published four editions (1771, 1774, 1786 and 1779), although there is some further controversy surrounding the 1774 edition, whose authorship Mercier later denied. The revised edition of 1786, now under the title L'an deux mille quatre cent quarante, Suivi de L'Homme de Fer: Songe (lit. The Year Two Thousand Four Hundred and Forty, Followed by The Iron Man: Dream, with L'Homme de Fer: Songe being a new, separate short story) was in turn partially translated to English by Harriot Augusta Freeman under another liberally changed title, Astraea's Return, or The Halcyon Days of France in the Year 2440: A Dream (according to the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, as of 2019, no official English translation of the revised 1786 version exists). Neither the Hooper nor Freeman's translations were authorized by Mercier, and both translators openly admitted they did not know who the author was (he was first attributed as the author in English in an 1802 translation of his work). Despite its popularity in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the work has been described as quickly eclipsed by others and \\"almost forgotten\\" by the second half of the 20th century.  Significance  L'An 2440 was one of the most famous, if not the most famous, work of Mercier. It has been described as an \\"important milestone in the evolution of science fiction\\", particularly of the utopian fiction variety, \\"[in its time an] exceedingly popular [work of] proto science fiction\\" and one of the first works in the genre focusing on the near future. Brian M. Stableford noted that \\"it laid the groundwork for the first theoretical discussion of the potential scope of futuristic fiction\\". Its plot structure, showing a familiar setting centuries into the future, instead of some far-away but contemporary place, has been credited with starting \\"the crucial shift of utopia from the imaginary island to future time\\" The book has also been described as \\"the first uchronia\\". However, setting the novel in the near future has been done before by earlier writers; such as Francis Cheynell, Aulicus His Dream (1644); Jacques Guttin, Epigone. Histoire du si√®cle futur (1659); Samuel Madden, The Memoirs of the Twentieth Century (1733); or the anonymous The Reign of George VI, 1900-1925 (1763). Mercier work has also been noted as having been inspired by the Enlightenment philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and older utopian fiction, such as Francis Bacon's New Atlantis (1626). Regardless of its originality, the novel has inspired many later authors, with some of the earliest works described as visibly influenced by it being Betje Wolff Holland in het jaar 2440 (1777), Vladimir Odoevsky's The Year 4338: Petersburg Letters (1835) or Mary Griffith's Three Hundred Years Hence (1836). Growing popularity of the near future as the setting of Mercier's story has been discussed as related to the likewise the growing popularity of the notion of progress. One of the themes in the book is criticism of slavery, and support for the abolitionism and even some limited decolonization - tempered, however, by Mercier's view of Western culture (which he primarily defines through the examples of French culture) as ultimately superior, and his patriotism, which sees France as the world's new, benevolent hegemon. Another theme concerns gender equality, in which Mercier again has been described to have views that are both progressive and conservative; in his future world, marriages are based on love, divorce is legal and dowries are abolished, yet ideal women are \\"free\\" to devote themselves to life at home as \\"good wives and mothers\\". The book has been described as an important analysis of the pre-Revolutionary, literary dissent in France and even a veiled call for action, something made more clear in the preface to the latter editions, where Mercier describes himself as a leader, whose work is helping to usher the soon-to-come \\"age of progress and universal happiness\\", and calls his own work prophetical (a claim that has been said to have attracted much derision). Robert Darnton writes that \\"despite its self- proclaimed character of fantasy...L'An 2440 demanded to be read as a serious guidebook to the future. It offered an astonishing new perspective: the future as a fait accompli and the present as a distant past. Who could resist the temptation to participate in such a thought experiment? And once engaged in it, who could fail to see that it exposed the rottenness of the society before his eyes, the Paris of the eighteenth century?\\" References  External links  * Full text of L'an deux mille quatre cent quarante.

It was founded in 1973 to promote the non-commercial use of video technology by providing international and educational video exchange through a public video library. Its mission has then been expanded to provide equipment rentals, artist workshops, and provide information to the public about media arts.  History  A group of artists interested in video met at the Matrix Video Conference, held at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1973. Organized by Michael Goldberg and Trish Hardman, the conference encouraged depositing a videotape and filling out a Video Exchange Directory card. Shawn Preus and Paul Wong were recruited to work on the collection, and this became the base of a video library. Shortly after the conference, The Satellite Video Exchange Society was founded (incorporated in 1973), and included a publicly accessible video library; the space later became known as the Video Inn. Its space became a sort of \\"drop-in\\" where artistic and other communities came together, and included viewing spaces and tape selves. Starting out as Intermedia, VIVO is an early Canadian example of an artist-run centre, and exhibited the characteristics of the tentative beginnings of the artist-run centre and the development of new forms of art making that such centres generated. = Intermedia = Intermedia existed between 1967-72 in Vancouver, and served as an umbrella organization for diverse interdisciplinary practices including performance, music, poetry, happenings, dance, cooking, photography, filmmaking, fashion, sculpture, music and video. A priority towards ephemeral art, much was staged outside of institutional spaces. Many were inspired and participated in Intermedia's events, including General Idea, where AA Bronson details,\\"inspired by Canada's first artist-run centre, the unbeatable, unforgettable, indescribable wonder that was Intermedia (where Jorge performed his first art performance in Vancouver in l968).\\" While Intermedia dissolved in 1972, it played a role in the denial of becoming a constrained institutional directive. Many independent organizations and spaces came out of Intermedia, most notably a direct link to what is now VIVO Media Art Centre.  Programming  VIVO Media Arts Centre facilitates various programming structures including events, exhibitions, artist and curatorial residencies, and media workshops and has hosted festivals such as Vancouver New Music Festival, and LIVE (performance) Biennale in 2015. The space has hosted artists and curators such as Noxious Sector, Paul Wong, Stacey Ho, Jayce Salloum, Hank Bull, Abbas Akhavan, Elizabeth MacKenzie and Marina Roy. = Crista Dahl Media Library & Archive = VIVO is home to the Crista Dahl Media Library & Archive (CDMLA) Canada‚Äôs most significant repositories of video by artists and independent producers.

He also worked as a writer of technical manuals in both the United States and England. Biography  Hodge was born on 15 July 1808, at St. Austell in Cornwall, south west England. He emigrated to the United States around 1836 and initially worked as a draftsman for the locomotive builder Thomas Rogers in Paterson, New Jersey. Hodge's 1841 steam fire engine of New York City Under the sponsorship of an insurance company, in 1840‚Äì1841, Hodge designed and built the first fire engine in the United States that was steam powered. It was also the first self-propelled fire engine; the engine used a dog clutch on the rear axle for movement, navigation, and steering. It could throw a jet of water of 290 tons per hour (about per second) high. The horizontal cylinders lined up with the pump cylinders and worked with a pair of driving wheels. At the front axle, ahead of the smoke-box, was an air vessel that activated a bell. In 1896 the fire engine was reported to have weighed around 7 or 8 tons, and was long. The large back wheels of the fire engine were lifted off the ground by a built-in jackscrew when pumping water for use on a fire, whereupon they served as flywheels for the engine as it pumped. Hodge's fire engine was unpopular with the Pearl Hose Company #28 of the New York City firefighters because its weight made it unwieldy to move down the streets. It was ultimately sold to another fire department and used as a stand-alone pumping engine that was not self-propelled. This was the only fire engine built by Hodge. No progress was made in that direction by anyone in the following decade. In 1847 Hodge moved back to England and became an eminent engineer there. His business address at the time was 140 Strand in London. One of his business activities was as a writer of technical manuals of steam engines.  Patents  Hodge patented some 16 inventions. These included devices for grinding wheat, regulating springs in railway cars, machinery for processing of felted cloth, machinery for brewing liquors, papermaking machinery, machinery that produced dinnerware, improvements in machinery technology for smelting of glass, metal, and porcelain. He also made improvements to machinery that made pigments for ink, gas lighting, and waterproofing of fabrics.  Works  * The Steam Engine ‚Äì including a description of a locomotive engine that he made for Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works of Paterson, New Jersey (1840). Hodge‚Äôs description of the Dunham Engine was little more than a listing of parts. He mentioned that the usual steam pressure was 50 Pounds per square inch, and that the engine had been tested pulling a 220-ton train at 14 miles per hour up a slope. This was the earliest work to contain a complete drawing of an American locomotive.

Interest among military strategists waned before a budgetary increase allowed further research during the early Vietnam War. The U.S. research culminated in the U.S. military defoliation program during the Vietnam war known as Operation Ranch Hand. World War II The use of a chemical or biological agents to destroy Japan's rice was contemplated by the Allies during World War II. In 1945 Japan's rice crop was terribly affected by rice blast disease. The outbreak as well as another in Germany's potato crop coincided with covert Allied research in these areas. The timing of these outbreaks generated persistent speculation of some connection between the events however the rumors were never proven and the outbreaks could have been naturally occurring. A U.S. War Departments report notes that \\"in addition to the results of human experimentation much data is available from the Japanese experiments on animals and food crops\\". M16M1 cluster adapter is loaded with airborne leaflet propaganda at the Far Eastern Command Printing Plant, Yokohama, Japan. November 1, 1950. Adapted from the leaflet bomb casing design, the M115 anti-crop bomb, also known as the feather bomb or the E73 bomb, was a biological cluster bomb designed to deliver wheat stem rust (Agent TX). Cold War In the mid-1950s, the Chemical Corps continued the search for anti-crop agents in order destroy the food and economic crops of enemy nations in wartime as part of the secret programs started during World War II. Several chemical and biological anti- crop agents were standardized.\\"Rocky Mountain Arsenal Summary of Major Events and Problems\\" (1958), (p.104-110) Former Professor Emeritus of Forage Crops Ecology at University of Tennessee's Department of Plant Sciences, Dr. Henry Fribourg, was an Army scientist in the mid-1950s who helped develop the most efficient dispersal techniques for anti-crop fungus spores and herbicides in labs at Ft. Detrick and in field tests in South Dakota, Texas, and Florida. Dr. Fribourg said, \\"The idea in those days was that the enemy's crops could be killed and this would be a much more humane way of winning a war than using atomic bombs.\\" However, in 1957 the Army found it had no funds to carry on the anti-crops research and the program nearly halted. Even though the anti-crop program had been phased out, the Chemical Corps continued to produce the new agent under an Industrial Preparedness Measure that permitted laboratory production of the agent to increase to limited production capability, testing the adequacy of the agent against varieties on rice found in the Orient and to determine the effectiveness of the agent by means of large scale field tests. Anti-crop herbicides It was also found certain phenoxyacetic acids were effective at reducing the yield of crops. Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation produced esters of these compounds for Fort Detrick's test program. By 1958 the Army adopted the chemical Butyl 2-Chloro-4-Fluorophenoxyacetate or Agent LNF, (also 4-Fluorophenoxyacetic acid or simply \\"KF\\") as a standard chemical agent effective against rice crops.\\"Archives Search Report Findings for Field Testing of 2,4,5-T and Other Herbicides,\\" (April 4, 2012) Section 2 - History of Fort Detrick Crops Division, Chemical Branch, (Page 7). Both Agent LNA (Agent GREEN) or 2,4-D and Agent LNB (Agent PINK) or 2,4,5-T or had also been standardized by the Army as anti-crop agents. In 1963 the two agents LNA and LNB were combined to make a new anti-crop Agent called LNX that was also known as Herbicide ORANGE. = Defoliants = During the Second World War limited test use of aerial spray delivery systems was employed only on several Japanese-controlled tropical islands to demarcate points for navigation and to kill dense island foliage. Despite the availability of the spray equipment, herbicide application with aerial chemical delivery systems were not systematically implemented in the Pacific theater during the war. In addition to work done in the anti-crop theater, the screening program for chemical defoliants was greatly accelerated in the 1960s. By FY 1962 contracts for synthesis and testing of a thousand chemical defoliants were in the process of negotiation. Approximately 1600 compounds had been examined since July 1961 with the results entered in a Remington-Rand computer system. Of these 1600 compounds, 100 showed defoliant activity and 300 exhibited herbicidal effects in the primary defoliation process.PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIRST DEFOLIATION CONFERENCE, 29-30 JULY 1963, United States Army Chemical Corps' Biological Laboratories, Fort Detrick, MD. Accession Number AD898001. Rice blast Sufficient work had been done on Pyricularia oryzae to also warrant the organism in the BW arsenal. In March 1958 Pyricularia oryzae was classified as a standard anti-crop BW agent. Pyricularia oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast, was then known as anti-crop Agent LX. During this time period, Rice Blast spores were produced under contract to Charles Pfizer and Company and shipped to Fort Detrick for classification, drying and storage. Agricultural BW doctrine was re-developed by the Air Force and Army during the early 1960s. At the outset of FY 1962 an important increase in emphasis in this field for technical advice on the conduct of the defoliation and anti-crop activities in Southeast Asia. Both field tests and process research were maintained for the agent of rice blast disease. Pyricularia oryzae is a parasitic, spindle-shaped fungus of rice causing the destructive plant disease known as rice blast. \\"Rice blast disease causes lesions to form on the plant, threatening the crop, and the fungus is estimated to destroy enough rice to feed 60 million people a year.\\" A number of strains were known to research scientists and the U.S. Army planned to use a mixture of races as the new agent. During 1960 research on anti-crop agents proceeded at the pace dictated by the limited resources available. Field tests for stem rust of wheat and rice blast disease were begun at several states in the Midwest and South U.S. and in Okinawa with partial success and the accumulation of useful data. The research gained on rice blast fungus from the field and laboratory experiments conducted in Okinawa and Florida by Fort Detrick's Crops division, Directorate of Biological Research and Biomathematics division and Directorate of Technical services increased the knowledge required to use this crop disease a strategic weapon of war and limit an enemy's food supply. The focus of this research was sources of inoculum and the minimum amount required to cause the disease, spore dispersal, meteorological and other conditions required for establishment of infection and disease buildup, spread, yield reduction, control measures, and the present ability to predict disease outbreak, buildup, and yield losses. Between 1961 and 1962 U.S. documents reveal the testing of militarized rice blast agent on Okinawa was conducted over a dozen times. Rice blast fungus was disseminated on rice paddies to determine how the agent affected rice crop production. The Okinawa project test sites included Nago and Shuri and directly was associated with similar research at the Avon Park Air Force Range near Sebring, Florida, in Texas, and Louisiana. During the biological field testing for rice blast documents reveal the U.S. Army \\"used a midget duster to release inoculum alongside fields in Okinawa and Taiwan\\", and took measurements regarding the effectiveness of the agent against the rice crop. In 1962 international research on the pathogenic races of rice blast disease was taken up as a three-year project beginning in 1963, when cooperation in scientific research was conducted in concert by the governments of the U.S. and Japan. A new investigation to find the pathogen suitable for use against the opium poppy began in the third quarter of financial year 1962. Wheat stem rust Rocky Mountain Arsenal's south plant, viewed from the east, circa 1970 Stripe rust of wheat was also under investigation, and the usual screening program for chemical anticrop agents was continued. A gradual increase in the scope of the rest of the anti-crop program accompanied this development. Large scale greenhouse experiments on stripe rust of wheat yielded considerable information on the degree of crop injury in relation to the time and number of inoculations. Rocky Mountain Arsenal, from January 1962 to October 1969, \\"grew, purified and militarized\\" the plant pathogen wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis, var. tritici) known as Agent TX for the Air Force biological anti-crop program. Agent TX-treated grain was grown at Edgewood Arsenal and from 1962‚Äì1968 in Sections 23-26 at Rocky Mountain Arsenal The unprocessed agent was transported to Beale AFB in refrigerated trucks for purification and storage and was kept refrigerated until loaded into specialized bombs adapted from the Leaflet bombs used to deliver propaganda. The M115 anti-crop bomb, also known as the feather bomb or the E73 bomb, was a U.S. biological cluster bomb designed to deliver wheat stem rust.Wheelis, Mark, et al. Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons Since 1945, (Google Books), Harvard University Press, 2006, pp. 217-18, (). The deployment of the M115 represented the United States' first, though limited, anti-crop biological warfare (BW) capability.Whitby, Simon M. Biological Warfare Against Crops, (Google Books), Macmillan, 2002, pp. 156-57, (). By the mid-1970s the Central Intelligence Agency acknowledged that it had developed and field tested methods for conducting covert attacks that could cause severe crop damage.  Rain-making component  Operation Pop Eye / Motorpool / Intermediary-Compatriot was a highly classified weather modification program in Southeast Asia during 1967‚Äì1972 that was developed from research conducted on Okinawa and other locations. A report titled Rainmaking in SEASIA outlines use of lead iodide and silver iodide deployed by aircraft in a program that was developed in California at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake and tested in Okinawa, Guam, Philippines, Texas, and Florida in a hurricane study program called Project Stormfury. The chemical weather modification program conducted from Thailand over Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam was allegedly sponsored by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and CIA without the authorization of Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird who had categorically denied to Congress that a program for modification of the weather for use as a tactical weapon even existed. The program was used to induce rain and extend the East Asian Monsoon season in support of U.S. government efforts related to the War in Southeast Asia. The use of a military weather control program was related to the destruction of enemy food crops. Whether the weather modification program was related to any of the CBW programs is not documented. However, it is certain that some of the military herbicides used in Vietnam required rainfall to be absorbed. In theory, any CBW program using mosquitoes or fungus would have also benefited from prolonged periods of rain. Rice blast sporulation on diseased leaves occurs when relative humidity approaches 100%. Laboratory measurements indicate sporulation increases with the length of time 100% relative humidity prevails.

The confrontation involved the defence of the town by the British garrison, aided by a group of Khoikhoi marksmen, from an attack by a large force of attacking Xhosa warriors. Prelude Following problems with cattle rustling in the area, the British commander Somerset ordered Xhosa chief Ngqika to speak to other Xhosa chiefs and put an end to the cattle and horse theft. But Ngqika had no real power over the other chiefs. Somerset offered military support to the Xhosa chief Ngqika in his efforts to curb the cattle theft. When Ngqika was attacked and defeated at Amalinde by rival chief Ndlambe in 1818, the British gave instruction to Lieutenant Colonel Brereton to proceed to Ngqika's assistance with a combined force of burghers and soldiers. In December 1818, Colonel Brereton crossed the Fish River, and after joining forces with Ngqika's adherents, attacked Ndlambe. Instead of retaliating, Ndlambe's warriors retreated into dense bush, which afforded them shelter. Their kraals were destroyed, and 23 000 head of cattle were seized. The British commander withdrew his army before Ndlambe was thoroughly defeated, and on reaching Grahamstown the burghers were disbanded and permitted to return to their homes. By 1819, the frontier settlement of Grahamstown had been in existence for seven years. It consisted of about 30 buildings, including a military barracks. Apart from a few hundred civilians, there were about 350 soldiers from various regiments stationed in Grahamstown under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Willshire. Ndlambe was then convinced by the prophet-warrior Makana, also known as Nxele or Links (left- handed), that the Gods would be on his side if the British at Grahamstown were attacked and that the British bullets would turn to water. He therefore gave Makana his backing for an attack and sent a message to Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Willshire, the British commander at Grahamstown, notifying him of his intentions. Makana had sent a notice of war to Willshire the day before, saying he would ‚Äòbreakfast‚Äô with him on the 22nd, to which Willshire responded by saying ‚ÄòEverything will be ready for you on your arrival,‚Äô Xhosa attack On 22 April 1819 Makana (with the backing of Ndlambe) attacked the town's 300-odd defenders in broad daylight with a force of some 10 thousand warriors armed with spears and firearms procured from European traders. The Xhosa attacked in three divisions. The left division under Makana attacked the barracks on the edge of town whilst the other two divisions, under the command of Mdushane (son of Ndlambe) and Kobe, attacked the town itself. The defenders, consisting of 48 men of the 38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot, 39 men of the Colonial Troop, 135 of the Royal African Corps, 82 Khoikhoi of the Cape Regiment and local citizens, held off the attackers with musket and artillery fire. They were reinforced during the battle by the arrival of a group of some 130 Khoikhoi natives under the command of Jan Boezak. The main battle lasted about an hour. The Xhosa lost at least a 1000 men for the loss of only three British soldiers and retreated to the Kei River. One of the legendary stories of the conflict was that of soldier's wife Elizabeth Salt who walked through the Xhosa ranks unharmed to smuggle in a keg of much-needed gunpowder. It is believed that she disguised ammunition as a child she was carrying, and the Xhosa warriors did not want to attack a woman and a child. Aftermath Elizabeth Salt Monument in High Street (Grahamstown) After the battle, Willshire hunted Makana down and four months later he surrendered. He was sent into imprisonment on Robben Island from where he escaped with others in a boat on Christmas Day, 1819, only to drown in the process when the boat capsized. Makana had such an impact that his followers who were waiting for his return created a saying \\" Ukuza kukaNxele\\" which means waiting for the impossible in isiXhosa. A public lecture called Ukuza kukaNxele /The Return of Makhanda was held by Makana's descendants celebrating his role in the supposed struggle for land, thus recasting Makana from the role of \\"cattle thief to that of \\"heroic fighter for land\\". The Grahamstown municipality is now known as Makana Local Municipality, and is dysfunctional. The town is now referred to as Makhanda. Both \\"Makhanda\\" and \\"Makana\\" both refer to the same individual, who was illiterate. Following the battle, the territory between the Great Fish River and the Keiskamma River was added to the colony in order to create a buffer zone between the farmers and the plundering Xhosa tribes. Within a year of the battle, 500 1820 Settlers had arrived from Britain in an attempt by the Cape government to boost the local English-speaking population and thus help to permanently defend the Cape's eastern frontier against the Xhosa, leading to the establishment of the enclave of Albany. The site of the battle which is located on a hill close to what is now known as Fort England Hospital has come to be called \\"Egazini\\" (\\"Place of Blood\\"). The area has also grown into a low-income township. The Egazini Memorial, erected to honour the fallen Xhosa warriors, was unveiled by the Department of Arts & Culture in 2001, and consists of a raised toposcope on the far corner of the original battle site. The battlefield site is now covered in litter, and the toposcope is now in a state of poor repair. A newer part of the Memorial was added in 2015, and is within a fenced off area to the West of the battlefield. This area houses a number of mosaic pillars by local artists, each commemorating some aspect of the history of Egazini/Battle of Grahamstown and the surrounding areas (many depict amaXhosa proverbs). There's also a mosaic toposcope pointing towards some of the key places in early Grahamstown/iRhini's history. Most of the artwork was developed by the Egazini Outreach Project. Elizabeth Salt is immortalised on a monument at the 1820 Settlers Monument in Grahamstown. Fort Willshire was erected on the Keiskamma River by the British military during the Fifth Frontier War (1818‚Äì1819) and named after Colonel T Willshire. During the 1830s it served as a marketplace for trade. It was also Sir Benjamin D‚ÄôUrban‚Äôs base of operations during the Sixth Frontier War (1834‚Äì1835).

Her work \\"is noted for negotiating the boundary between painting and sculpture, in regards to her experiments with relief and surface volume.\\"  Early life  Sherry Grauer was born in Toronto, Ontario on February 20, 1939. Grauer's mother, Shirley Woodward Grauer, was an artist \\"until the demands of six children forced her to put her painting aside.\\" Grauer's father, Dal Grauer, was the president of the B.C. Electric Company. Sherry Grauer attended private school in Vancouver and then studied art history at the Wellesley College in Massachusetts. She has lived intermittently in Vancouver since 1946. During her junior year from 1958‚Äì59, she went on an exchange to Paris, France and attended √âcole du Louvre and Atelier Ziegler. It was here that she realized that she would rather make art herself than study it. From 1959-1961 and again from 1962‚Äì1964, she continued her studies in a new direction at the San Francisco Art Institute. Her early training consisted of formal training in anatomy and visual art techniques. When she returned to Canada in 1964, her work became well known as she became featured in various exhibitions to shed light on the work of young artists.  Exhibitions  Grauer has had solo and group exhibitions across Canada and internationally at galleries including the Bau-Xi Gallery (Vancouver), the University of British Columbia Fine Arts Gallery, the Vancouver Art Gallery, the Moore Gallery (Victoria), the Hamilton Art Gallery, the National Art Gallery of Canada (Ottawa), the Norman Mackenzie Art Gallery (Regina), and the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Montr√©al.  Work  Grauer is a mixed-media artist who is known for her paintings, relief paintings, and sculptures and moves between the different mediums, \\"leaving a painting unfinished while she tackles sculpture.\\" She has worked with materials such as wire mesh, wood, plaster, and canvas. = 2nd Post card from California = This work was first shown in the New Talents exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1964. It was completed while Sherry Grauer was in art school. She deliberately chose to make it small in scale in order to contrast it with the large size works that were popular at the time. The postcard shows two people, one riding a motorcycle under an overpass and the other leaning against the structure of the overpass and watching the other ride by. There seems to be no connection between the two figures, just a fleeting moment involving them both. It was an exercise in formal compositional arrangement. The contrast between the figures, the straight lines of the overpass and the rolling Californian hills in the background is striking. = Brave Birdmen = Created in 1980, this work shows a refinement of Sherry Grauer's technique with wire-mesh. It is her most \\"ambitious achievement to date.\\" It was commissioned for the new Transport Canada Training Institute in Ontario. The work is a compilation of six unique large bird-people doing acrobatic acts on the trapeze. They are enchanting because the figures are fully engulfed by their actions. The way these figures are engrossed by what they are doing makes their actions believable, even though they strike the viewer as odd. Observing this piece urges the viewer to abandon expectations of how things should be and instead become absorbed by the situation presented by the figures. While working with wire-mesh is difficult, Grauer was able to mould the medium into shapes that show even the smallest anatomical details with expert accuracy. The piece took two years to finish. It was installed in March 1980. = The Stars are Coming Out = This work was shown as part of a solo exhibition of her work at the Bau-Xi Gallery in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1987. In The Stars are Coming Out, Grauer \\"evokes the tattered, straggling clouds in a twilight sky by looping and twisting strips of painted canvas and fastening them with metal studs.\\"d  Commissions  Grauer has made several private, public, and corporate commissions. Her commissions include Habitat Banners: Burrard Street Bridge (1976) for the City of Vancouver, Crows, Seagulls, Swallows (1978) for the Department of Public Works (Ottawa, Ontario), and Flirting Seals (2003) for North Growth Management. = Set design = In 1985, Grauer was commissioned to design a set for KniteQuest, a play by Peter Eliot Weiss and produced by Grauer's friend Pamela Hawthorn.

It now refers primarily to a modern aggregation of six tribes, collectively known by the same ethnonym kawadji which means 'people of the sandbeach' (pama malnkana). These tribes, the Umpithamu/Koko Ompindamo, Pakadji, Yintyingka, Otati, Umpila and Pontunj were the traditional owners and users of the coastal areas east of the Great Dividing Range of northeastern Cape York from Oxford Bay to Princess Charlotte Bay. Language The Night Island Kawadji spoke, according to Norman Tindale, Yankonyu, a dialect of the Umpila language spoken by the Umpila and Pontunj, to whom they were closely related. People The traditional Kawadji of Night Island were a small population and intermarried with clans of the mainland Barungguan. Economy The Night Island Kawadji were known for their skill in building and then employing double-outrigger wooden canoes (tango) in adventurous voyages to outlying reefs where they would hunt for dugong, turtles, and the eggs of both sea birds and turtles.

It contains information on synods and ecumenical councils from the first century CE up through the year 887. Contents Each chapter records the history of one single ecumenical council, and contains information digested from earlier sources such as the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius, and the work of the same name by Socrates of Constantinople. There are also myriad very specific details that do not appear in any other historical work - such as the number of bishops who attended any given council - that some scholars have suggested are inventions of the author's imagination rather than fact. Likewise, it has been suggested that some synods or councils recorded in the Synodicon Vetus did not even happen. The Synodicon Vetus is also the only ancient source that asserts the canonical books of the Bible were decided at the First Council of Nicaea. French Enlightenment writer Voltaire popularized the idea in the 18th century, and Christian radical Robert Taylor revived it in the 19th, but all instances of this assertion seem to trace back to the Synodicon Vetus. Modern scholars reject this notion, and consider the development of the Christian biblical canon to have evolved over centuries. History The Synodicon Vetus is presumed to have been written soon after its last recorded ecumenical council, at the end of the 9th or beginning of the 10th century, between 887 and 920, but most likely at the end of the 9th century.Cyril Mango, The Oxford History of Byzantium It circulated for centuries in handwritten copies, and was first printed in 1601, produced by theologian Johannes Pappus, who worked from a shortened version he obtained from the prolific scribe and bookseller Andreas Darmarios, who was said to have brought an original manuscript out of the Morea. Darmarios had somewhat of a questionable reputation that has led some scholars to blame him for the introduction of various errors and supposed fabrications to the work. It is published complete, both in Greek and Latin, in the Bibliotheca Graeca of Johann Albert Fabricius. It is also published entire in the Bibliotheca juris canon veteris of Christophe Justel and G. Voellus, and in the Conciliorum Collectio of Jean Hardouin. Giovanni Domenico Mansi, in his collection \\"Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio\\", included this work under the name Libellus Synodicus, but he separated its various parts, distributing them throughout his work under the various councils to which they pertained. There are two major versions of this work in manuscript form today, named \\"g\\" and \\"b\\", depending on which branch of the tradition they are from. Criticism The work holds a dubious reputation among scholars. Some consider it to have important information not recorded elsewhere, while others consider it to be a confused jumble of misinformation. The more charitable critics have called it \\"mediocre\\", while others describe it as \\"inaccurate, unreliable, generally untrustworthy, and teeming with errors\\". Still others, while acknowledging the factual shortcomings of the text, rate it as being a valuable document of the eastern Christian perspective on western Christianiaty. The Synodicon Vetus for example ignores western synods that occurred after the year 400 or so, and the popes are spoken of with respect and reverence.

Proctor (born 1960) is an American artist, best known for her visionary paintings, collages, and assemblages.  Early life  Mary Proctor (n√©e Cooksey) was born in 1960 to Pauline Cooksey in Lloyd, Florida. Her 11-year-old mother was unable to care for her, so she was raised by her grandparents. Her grandmother was an African-American homemaker and her grandfather a white farmer. Proctor attended public school until becoming pregnant in ninth grade. She then took on the responsibility of raising her younger siblings. = Marriage = After the death of her grandfather, and her grandmother's struggle with alcoholism, Mary met and married Tyrone Proctor. Together they moved to Tallahassee, Florida. = Early career = After working in the nursing field for ten years, Proctor opened Tender Loving Care Day Care Center and was the proprietor for five years. In search of 'something easier' Proctor began collecting items from the roadside to sell at the local flea market. Eventually, she opened her own store, \\"Noah's Ark Flea Market.\\" Collecting remains her hobby. = Career as an artist = In 1994, a house fire claimed the lives of Proctor's grandmother, aunt and uncle. Proctor claims to have had a vision immediately before the fire occurred in which she \\"...saw light going all the way up to heaven.\\" Following the fire in 1995, Proctor claims she had a vision during prayer that told her to \\"Paint\\". These visions inspired her to begin her pursuit as an artist. Her first pieces were portraits, painted on doors, of her family members who died in the fire. She set them in her front yard where they caught the attention of curator and critic Tricia Collins, who purchased them for her gallery in New York. Her pieces typically consist of button, fake-jewel and glass encrusted figures upon a canvas of windows or doors. Her works often include spiritual messages and observances. She signs most pieces with the name \\"Missionary Mary L Proctor,\\" a name she uses to represent her religious motivation. \\"The Lord spoke, and he said, \\"You are on a mission to get a great message out into the houses and hearts.\\" That's why the \\"missionary\\" name came to me, because of my mission. I'm going to get a message out to broken , a message to help and glorify them. I'm going to get a message out so men can search their hearts, learn to respect us and treat us the right way.\\" \\"Missionary\\" Mary started her art studio in her roadside junk shop in south Leon County, Florida, in 1995. In 2011, Proctor opened the American Folk Art Museum and Gallery in Tallahassee, Florida. The American Folk Art Museum and Gallery was located in the Tallahassee Mall. She had her first one-woman show at All Saints Gallery in Tallahassee, Florida, in 1995, and a year later, a one-woman show of her doors at the Tricia Collins Grand Salon in New York.

In August 1836, Eliza Small and Polly Ann Bates, two enslaved women from Baltimore who had run away, were arrested in Boston and brought before Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw. The judge ordered them freed because of a problem with the arrest warrant. When the agent for the slaveholder requested a new warrant, the spectators‚Äîmostly African-American women‚Äîrioted in the courtroom and rescued Small and Bates. The incident was one of several slave rescue efforts that took place in Boston. Controversy over the fate of George Latimer led to the passage of the 1843 Liberty Act, which prohibited the arrest of fugitive slaves in Massachusetts. Abolitionists rose to the defense of Ellen and William Craft in 1850, Shadrach Minkins in 1851, and Anthony Burns in 1854. An attempt to rescue Thomas Sims in 1852 was unsuccessful.  Background  In 1836, Boston was home to about 1,875 free African Americans, some of whom were refugees from slave states. The vast majority were committed to abolitionism; among the more outspoken activists were William Cooper Nell, Maria Stewart, and David Walker. Some, such as Lewis Hayden and John T. Hilton, devoted their lives to assisting fugitive slaves.Beshara (2009), pp. 1‚Äì2. On Saturday, July 30, Captain Henry Eldridge sailed into Boston Harbor on the Chickasaw. Among his passengers were two African-American women, Eliza Small and Polly Ann Bates, both of whom carried legal documents declaring them free women. Before the ship docked it was boarded by Matthew Turner, the agent of a wealthy Baltimore slaveholder named John B. Morris. Turner claimed that Small and Bates were fugitive slaves belonging to Morris. Eldridge agreed to detain the women on his ship until Turner returned with a warrant for their arrest.Levy (1952), pp. 85‚Äì86. As news of the incident circulated, a large group of black Bostonians gathered on the wharf. One of them sought out attorney Samuel Edmund Sewall,Levy refers to Sewall as \\"Samuel Eliot Sewall,\\" but the memoir of Samuel Edmund Sewall (1799‚Äì1888) includes a firsthand account of the incident. See Tiffany (1898), pp. 62‚Äì66. who obtained a writ of habeas corpus from Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw. The captain was forced to release the women pending a hearing on his authority to detain them. When Deputy Sheriff Huggerford served the writ, accompanied by Sewall, they found Small and Bates locked in their cabin in a state of distress. Upon being apprised of the situation, one of the women‚Äîwhom Sewall later described as \\"a very pretty and intelligent mulatto\\"‚Äîburst into tears and said she had known the Lord would not forsake her.Levy (1952), p. 86; Sewall, quoted in Tiffany (1898), p. 63.Both women were probably multiracial; in a letter to Sewall, Nathan Winslow refers to them as \\"the Yellow Girls.\\" See Tiffany (1898), p. 64. Shaw happened to be unavailable for the rest of the day. Rather than hear the case himself, Justice Wilde postponed the hearing until the following Monday, on the technical grounds that it was Shaw who had signed the writ. At 9:00 on the morning of August 1, as Chief Justice Shaw took the bench, the courtroom filled with spectators. Most were black women; a few white abolitionists joined them, including five women from the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society.Levy (1952), p. 87; Beshara (2009), p. 49.  Court hearing  The purpose of the hearing, as defined by the writ, was to determine whether Eldridge had the right to detain Small and Bates. Counsel on both sides, however, addressed the more general question of slavery itself. Attorney A. H. Fiske, representing Eldridge, read an affidavit by Turner declaring that the women were the property of his employer, and cited the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793. He then moved for a postponement of the hearing to give him time to bring evidence from Baltimore that the women were slaves. Sewall argued that Eldridge had no right to hold the women, and moreover, that all human beings were born free and had a natural right to remain so. When he finished, the audience burst into applause. Chief Justice Shaw rose to give his opinion. The question before the Court, he said, was simply: \\"Has the captain of the brig Chickasaw a right to convert his vessel into a prison?\\" Shaw determined that Eldridge had no such right and had detained the women unlawfully. He concluded by declaring that \\"the prisoners must therefore be discharged from all further detention.\\" Turner, the slaveholder's agent, rose and asked the judge if he would need a warrant to arrest the women again under the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Law. At the same time, a constable was sent to lock the door that led downstairs. It appeared to the spectators that Turner was about to detain the women a second time, despite their having just been discharged by Judge Shaw.Levy (1952), p. 88.  Riot  Before the judge could answer Turner's question, Sewall advised the women to leave at once. Someone shouted, \\"Go! Go!\\" and the crowd spontaneously erupted. People rushed over the seats and down the aisle toward Small and Bates. Outside, several hundred others pressed on the doors, trying to force their way in.Tager (2001), p. 94. Shaw protested, but the crowd ignored him, shouting, \\"Don't stop!\\" The only officer in the room, Deputy Sheriff Huggerford, was grabbed by \\"an old colored woman, of great size,\\" who threw her arms around his neck and stopped him from interfering.Tiffany (1898), p. 63. Swarming around the two women, the crowd made its way down a private passageway of the judiciary and down the courthouse stairs. Once outside, the women were hustled into a carriage, which sped out of the city at a gallop. Huggerford and several others pursued the fleeing women, but they were too late. As the carriage crossed over Mill Dam, money was thrown from the carriage to pay the toll.Levy (1952), p. 89.  Aftermath  Although Boston was an important center of the abolitionist movement, its residents were by no means unanimously opposed to slavery or the Fugitive Slave Law. On the contrary, the local press excoriated Huggerford and Sheriff C. P. Sumner (father of abolitionist Charles Sumner) for not having placed more officers at the courthouse. The riot was seen as a shocking affront to law and order. Several journalists were particularly offended by the \\"indecent conduct\\"Daily Evening Transcript (August 2, 1836), quoted in Levy (1952), p. 90. of the female abolitionists, and one called on the women's husbands to chastise them. Another accused Sewall of disgracing the legal profession and called for his censure by the bar for \\"instigating a mob of negroes to perpetrate an act at which every good member of society shudders.\\"Columbian Centinel (August 3, 1836), quoted in Levy (1952), p. 90. Even the Liberator, the anti-slavery newspaper founded by William Lloyd Garrison, expressed mild disapproval, calling the incident \\"unjustifiable\\" but \\"not unpardonable.\\"Levy (1952), pp. 89‚Äì90. Small and Bates were never recaptured; they eventually made it to Canada,Tiffany (1898), p. 64. where slavery had been abolished three years before. None of the rioters were ever brought to trial. The editor of the Columbian Centinel fulminated: > The outrage was committed by a mob of several hundreds, and after three days > search, neither the prisoners nor one of the rioters have been arrested. Is > there no person who was present who can identify one of the offenders? Could > such a scene be enacted, and the Chief Justice be assailed vi et armis in > the face of day, and in open court, and no person be able to detect one of a > hundred? The case has not its parallel in the annals of crime.Columbian > Centinel (August 5, 1836), quoted in Levy (1952), p. 89. Sewall received many threatening and abusive letters, warning him never to set foot in Baltimore and alluding to Judge Lynch.Tiffany (1898), pp. 64‚Äì65 Four weeks after the riot, a U.S. naval officer from Baltimore confronted Sewall in his office. After announcing that he was related to Morris, he insulted Sewall and struck him \\"a number of blows with the butt end of a horsewhip.\\"Daily Evening Transcript (August 29, 1836), quoted in Levy (1952), p. 92. Undeterred, Sewall volunteered his services in a number of other cases defending fugitive slaves.Levy (1952), p. 87; Tiffany (1898), pp. 66‚Äì80. Writing in the Liberator sixteen years later, William Cooper Nell recalled the rescue as a testament to \\"the prowess of a few coloured women; the memory of which deed is sacredly cherished and transmitted to posterity.\\"The Liberator (December 10, 1852).

Slade exhibited three artworks in this show, including a floor to ceiling mural in the UBC Walter C. Koerner Library. In 2016, Slade's work was exhibited in the show titled Yesterday was Once Tomorrow (or, A Brick is a Tool) at Artexte in Montreal, QC, and in 2015 at Plug In ICA in Winnipeg, MB.

He is the chairman of Lundin Mining, Denison Mines, Lucara Diamond, NGEx Resources Inc, Lundin Gold Inc, the Lundin Foundation, and Vostok Gas. He is also the owner of a $100 million superyacht, Savannah.  Early life and education  Lukas Lundin was born in 1958, the son of Adolf H. Lundin, the founder of Lundin Mining and Lundin Petroleum. He graduated from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in 1981.  Career  Lundin was in charge of International Petroleum Corporation's oil and gas operations in 1982, based in Dubai. From 1990 to 1995, he was president of International Musto Exploration Limited, where he was responsible for the acquisition of the Bajo de la Alumbrera deposit, in a $500 million takeover. Lundin is the chairman of Lundin Mining, Denison Mines, Lucara Diamond, NGEx Resources Inc, Lundin Gold Inc, the Lundin Foundation, and Vostok Gas. Together with his younger brother Ian Lundin, who chairs Lundin Petroleum, he has a net worth of at least US $2.5 billion, mostly from commodity-based companies in oil and gas, metals and mining, gold, diamonds, and cattle in Latin America. Speaking in 2016, Lundin said, \\"It's a good time to acquire right now\\", citing in particular possibilities in base metals, and that Lundin Mining should continue expand further, after acquiring the Eagle nickel and copper mine in Michigan from Rio Tinto Group in 2013, and control of the Candelaria/Ojos del Salado copper mines in Chile from Freeport-McMoRan Inc in 2014. Lundin believes zinc is the best bet on a two-five year horizon, and copper and nickel perhaps in the longer term, and that Chile, Argentina and Peru are all places where he is \\"comfortable doing business\\". Super- yacht Lundin owns the $100 million super-yacht Savannah, designed by De Voogt Naval Architects and CG Design, and which was built in 2015 at the Feadship yard in Aalsmeer, the Netherlands. The yacht uses a single diesel engine, which uses three generators to charge banks of lithium-ion batteries to drive electrically-powered screws, and producing a 30% fuel savings, as it allows a choice between diesel, electric or hybrid modes as needed. The yacht has a crew of 22, and can take 12 passengers.  Personal life  Lundin is divorced, and has four sons. Lundin was based in Vancouver, Canada, for nearly 25 years, before moving to Geneva, Switzerland in 2013, where his brother Ian already lived, and where they commute to work together from houses on the shores of Lake Geneva. He has competed in the Paris-Dakar rally four times on a motorcycle, and has twice climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. Lundin Foundation The Lundin Foundation has invested in M-kopa.

It stars Oscar Isaac, Olivia Wilde, Mandy Patinkin, Olivia Cooke, Laia Costa, Annette Bening, and Antonio Banderas, and follows multiple couples over numerous generations, and their connections to a single event. The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on September 21, 2018, by Amazon Studios. Life Itself received largely negative reviews from critics, who called it \\"simultaneously overwrought and underwhelming.\\"  Plot  ;Chapter One - The Hero (narrated by Samuel L. Jackson) Narrator Samuel L. Jackson first introduces the hero of our story, a handsome gay man, Henry (Jake Robinson), as he is talking to his therapist, Dr. Cait Morris (Annette Bening). Sam is unimpressed with Henry's story, and moves the focus to Cait. Cait is walking down the street when Will Dempsey (Oscar Isaac) tells her he is a big fan before she is hit by a bus. Sam breaks the narration and appears physically to suggest that since Cait is the hero that she will be fine... except for the blood pouring out of her head. This all turns out to be part of a script that Will is writing, and another narrator (Lorenza Izzo) continues the story. Will goes to therapy to see Cait, where he has been going since his wife Abby (Olivia Wilde) left him. Flashbacks show Will and Abby's married life. Abby was a big Bob Dylan fan, and is shown to be very pregnant before their marriage ended. Will tells Cait about Abby's history, Abby's mother and father met at work as elementary school teachers, and they die in a car accident. Abby goes to live with her Uncle Joe (Bryant Carroll), who was physically and sexually abusive toward her until she got a gun from a friend and threatened to kill him if he ever touched her again. Abby found herself in college where she met Will, and he made the bold move to ask her out. Less than a year after they begin dating, Will asks Abby to marry him. Abby has some conditions, specifically about wanting a dog before kids, but she agrees to marry him. They later meet Will's parents Irwin (Mandy Patinkin) and Linda (Jean Smart). On another occasion, Abby goes to Will to talk about her school thesis paper, and she wants to make it on the unreliable narrator, and how life is the ultimate unreliable narrator because of how tricky and surprising it can be. In the present day, Will wonders what went wrong with Abby. Cait tells Will that he was institutionalized following Abby leaving him, and asks him to tell her what happened \\"that day\\". Will and Abby had just had lunch at his parents' house. They were walking down the street when Abby told Will that they were having a girl, and that she wants to name her after Bob Dylan. Abby gets distracted by Will and is struck by a bus. Inside the bus, a little boy named Rodrigo Gonzalez (Adrian Marrero) watches. Abby died, but the baby survived. Will blames himself for what happened and kills himself in front of Cait. ;Chapter Two - Dylan Dempsey The narrator mentions Will and Abby's daughter Dylan was born of death and tragedy, and these just seemed to follow her growing up. After being taken in by Irwin and Linda, Linda dies when Dylan is age 6, and then her dog dies when she is 7. On her 21st birthday, Dylan (Olivia Cooke) is getting ready to go out. Her relationship with Irwin is a little more hostile, but she is shown to still care about him. She goes to a venue where her band gets ready to play. After the show, Dylan is making out with one of her band mates. Another girl records them, and Dylan gets up to take her phone and stomp it on the ground. The two have a small fight before Dylan leaves the venue. Dylan sits down on a bench to smoke a joint. She dreams that she watches her mother's final moment. Dylan wakes up crying with the bus in front of her. It appears that she sees Rodrigo on the bus asking her if she is okay. ;Chapter Three - The Gonzalez Family In Spain, a man named Vincent Saccione (Antonio Banderas) owns a piece of land with several men at his employment. He brings in one man, Javier Gonzalez (Sergio Peris-Mencheta), for a drink. Saccione tells Javier a story of how his father was an Italian man who did not allow any Spanish to be spoken in his home. He later impregnated Saccione's mother and essentially shunned the two of them. After he died, Saccione took advantage of the fact that his father left no will, and so he took his father's money and now owns the land. Saccione offers Javier a place to stay so that he may oversee some of the land. Javier agrees. Javier goes to see his beloved girlfriend Isabel Diaz (Laia Costa), who works as a waitress. The two build a life with each other, eventually marrying and becoming parents to Rodrigo. Saccione starts to make secret visits to the Gonzalez home whenever Javier is not there. He presents Rodrigo with a globe, and the boy takes an interest in seeing New York. Saccione tells Isabel he feels it is late in his life to find the happiness that Javier has, and he feels bad for intruding on their life, but Isabel assures Saccione that Rodrigo likes him. However, Javier disapproves of Saccione's visits and gives him the globe back. Javier then decides to take Isabel and Rodrigo to America to see New York City. Rodrigo has the time of his life, until they find themselves on the bus. Rodrigo talks to the bus driver, momentarily distracting him, causing him to hit Abby. Rodrigo watches the whole scene and becomes traumatized. Back home, Javier and Isabel struggle to take care of Rodrigo since he can not sleep. They invite Saccione to come back and help Rodrigo, and it works. Javier becomes envious of this, feeling that Isabel and Rodrigo love Saccione more than him. He confronts Saccione and asks if he loves them both, and he says yes, but he feels guilty about it. Javier makes the decision to leave, even though Isabel insists she loves the life she has with Javier. Isabel stays with Saccione, but she makes it clear she will not love him the way she loves Javier. ;Chapter Four - Rodrigo Gonzalez Rodrigo (Alex Monner) grows up to go to school in New York. He starts a relationship with a girl named Shari, a rather vain and spoiled trust fund baby from a wealthy Long Island family who Rodrigo describes as \\"loud\\". At one point, Rodrigo travels back home when Isabel gets sick with cancer. Rodrigo wants to come back and stay with his mother, but she tells him \\"Enough is enough\\", and with that, they say goodbye. The narrator takes us to what is the most important day in Rodrigo's life. Shari tells Rodrigo that she is pregnant. Rodrigo becomes worried, even as she continues going on about it casually to the point where she almost gets hit by a cab until Rodrigo pulls her out of the way, but she does not notice and keeps talking. Shari then says it was just an April Fool's prank, but Rodrigo, fed up with her shallow and immature behavior, breaks up with her right then and there. Back in Spain, Isabel knows her time is running out. Javier then arrives for the first time in years. The narrator reveals that Javier asked Saccione to write letters to him to update him on Isabel and Rodrigo. Javier spends one final moment with his wife. Rodrigo goes back to his dorm room and gets a call from Saccione that Isabel has passed away. Distraught, Rodrigo goes for a run throughout the city. That is when he comes across Dylan crying on the bench and asks her if she is okay. ;Chapter Five - Elena Dempsey- Gonzalez It is then revealed that the narrator is Elena (Lorenza Izzo), Dylan and Rodrigo's daughter. She is reading from a book she wrote, called \\"Life Itself\\" which is the story of everything that led to her life up to this point. Elena tells the listeners the last thing that Isabel told Rodrigo, and we see her saying it in English. She tells her son that although life may bring us to our knees, if we look hard enough, we will find love. Elena concludes her story by saying how one moment shaped her whole life, and that every bit of her has some of her mother, her father, and her grandparents. The last scene is a brief clip of Will admiring a pregnant Abby. Cast Production In August 2016, FilmNation Entertainment acquired the film's script, by Dan Fogelman, who also directed the film; FilmNation had bought the script after it appeared on The Black List. Marty Bowen and Wyck Godfrey served as producers on the film under their Temple Hill Entertainment banner. In November 2016, Oscar Isaac joined the cast. In January 2017, Olivia Cooke, Antonio Banderas, Samuel L. Jackson, Olivia Wilde and Laia Costa were also added, and in March 2017, Annette Bening joined as well, alongside Mandy Patinkin and Alex Monner. Principal photography began on March 13, 2017 in New York City, and continued in Spain in May. Release In December 2017, a fierce bidding war for distribution rights for the film, fought between Amazon Studios, Universal Pictures, and Paramount Pictures, concluded with Amazon Studios winning the rights with a $10 million dollar plus bid. The film premiered on September 8, 2018 at the Toronto International Film Festival, and was theatrically released on September 21, 2018 in the United States. It was released on January 4, 2019 in the United Kingdom. Reception =Box office= In the United States and Canada and China, Life Itself was released alongside The House with a Clock in Its Walls, Assassination Nation and Fahrenheit 11/9, and was projected to gross $4‚Äì6 million from 2,578 theaters during its opening weekend. It brought in $2.1 million over its first weekend, finishing 11th, behind a number of films that ranged from their second to seventh week in theaters. This was the second worst opening, since 1982, by a film that opened at over 2,500 theaters. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 14%, based on 144 reviews, with an average rating of 3.58/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A mawkish melodrama that means less the more it tries to say, Life Itself suggests writer-director Dan Fogelman's talents are best suited to television.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 21 out of 100, based on reviews from 39 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars and a 47% \\"definite recommend\\". Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a \\"D\\", saying: \\"Life Itself thinks you're stupid. Or, if not stupid, unable to understand how a movie should work. It's a movie made for people who can't be trusted to understand any storytelling unless it's not just spoon-fed but ladled on, piled high, and explained via montage and voiceover.\\" A. O. Scott, chief film critic for The New York Times, calls it an \\"inadvertently hilarious\\" film, filled with \\"parental slaughter ... (where) mothers and fathers are hit by buses, perish in car accidents, commit suicide and succumb to cancer,\\" though he praises Isaac, Wilde, Costa, and Peris- Mencheta (playing the \\"starting\\" couples in the two countries) for their acting.

She has also worked in drawing, video, installation and collaborative public art, often combining these media with her work in print to prompt questions as to the character and consequences of our existing cultural paradigms. Her artwork focuses on the evolving relationship between human culture and the ecosphere, with special consideration given to the ways in which individual and collective identity become evident through land usage. Zeigler lives and works in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Biography  Zeigler was born in London, Ontario in 1949. She received her BFA in Painting and her MFA in Printmaking from the University of Illinois. She also studied in Munich, Germany at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. She has taught at the University of Alberta, Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Queen's University, and at the University of Illinois. She is currently a Professor at the University of British Columbia, Department of Art History, Visual Art and Theory, in British Columbia, Canada, where she is also the supervisor of the UBC Print Media Research Centre.  Artwork  Barbara Zeigler's artworks and writings endeavor to expand boundaries of print practice and critical discourse and have influenced multi-disciplinary printmaking and the technology of digital imaging in Canada, where she incorporated photo-based and large-format work into intaglio and lithographic prints. She also incorporated drawn and photographic elements into print, an innovative approach in the 80s. In the 90s she pioneered the extension of print-based work in installation art. = Hidden Sites = Zeigler exhibition and work Hidden Sites focuses on overlooked places and journey's which have significant and debilitating effects, namely the five hour journey of garbage removal from the large city of Vancouver to the Cache Creek landfill, and Broughton Archipelago of central British Columbia, where migrating salmon is significantly hurt by sea lice from a multitude of nearby fish farms the salmon must cross in their journey. Exhibited at the Richmond Art Gallery in 2009, the show consisted of a series of still and time based works that reflected on the long journeys of the trucks and salmon, examining how the landscape and ecosystem are being re- shaped. The Fraser river is considered to be the greatest salmon river in the world, Robin Laurence describes the urgency of Zeigler's work in that it \\"asks, given the evidence of toxins leaching into wells and waterways from the mammoth landfill? Given the evidence, too, of fish farms, logging, pulp mills, and global warming, all wreaking destruction on the native salmon population. For how long?\\" = Earthmakers = From 1995-1998, Ziegler collaborated with artist Joan Smith on the traveling exhibition Earthmakers. The installation work conjured up the natural cycles of life and death in time, and the delicate nature of the ecosystem, by presenting what inhabits one square meter of old-growth forest soil. Further activated with multi-media elements, photo- etchings on kozo paper, a soundtrack, collage and monoprints related to the landscape, the installation also invited contributions by the general public and from materials found in the area. School programming and classes also contributed collage and monoprint works. It is noted in Paula Gustafson's review of the work, that Zeigler and Smith's career has shown a devotion to inquiring and critiquing aspects of environmental desecration and humanities complacency, the research process of the work started \\"not of deconstructing as might be expected, but of reconstruction-via drawing, photography, photocopying, computer imaging, and etching--of the unseen and virtually unknown beneath their feet.\\" Collaboration between Zeigler and Smith was an integral component to understanding the intention towards the content, as the notes accompanying the exhibition show that \\"the artists spent hundreds of preparatory hours on the project in pursuits that sought to balance 'shared works' with 'autonomous creation.' The attitude of artists to information --the scientific component (for which soil scientist Jeff Battigelli provided soil samples and expertise) attests to the fact that ideas need not be treated as property, but ought to be nurtured like flourishing organisms as they are advanced through art production.\\" The exhibition was first mounted at Edmonton Art Gallery, then Nanaimo Art Gallery, and at the Richmond Art Gallery. A selection of images of the work were reproduced in the September 1997 book \\"The Best of Printmaking\\" by Lynne Allen and Phyllis McGibbon, as well as a more thorough spread in The Capilano Review.

He became a member of Narodnaya Volya first in Bryansk, then in Oryol and Moscow, and was jailed in the early 1880s. It was in prison that he in 1881 wrote his first play Hard Life (–¢—è–∂–∫–∞—è –¥–æ–ª—è) which was followed by On the Zemstvo Fields, Ruins of the Past, Free Life, all written in Oryol. In 1887 Karpov moved to Yaroslavl where he debuted first as a stage actor and then, in 1889, as a theatre director. In 1893 his play Early Autumn (–†–∞–Ω–Ω—è—è –æ—Å–µ–Ω—å) was staged by the Alexandrinsky Theatre, featuring Maria Savina. In 1896 Karpov became the head of Alexandrinka where he directed and produced Chekhov's The Seagull (with Vera Komissarzhevskaya as Nina Zarechnaya), which was this play's Russian premiere. In 1900 Karpov left The Alexandrinsky Theatre and joined the Suvorinsky (which was in 1919 reformed into the Bolshoi Drama Theater) where he staged several plays of his own (The Coalmine 'Georgy', The 1812 Moscow Fire, The Victory Man) as well as a host of classics by Alexander Ostrovsky whose legacy he idolised. In 1916 Karpov returned to Alexandrinka to stay with this theatre for the next decade, up until his death in 1926, in Leningrad. Legacy In all, Karpov authored more than twenty plays.

She studied at the University of Ottawa (1973‚Äì75) and the University of British Columbia (1976‚Äì78) and received a BFA from the University of British Columbia (1978). Lemieux was appointed and served for eight years (2002-2010) as a part-time member of the Canadian Artist and Producers Professional Relations Tribunal (CAPPRT) a quasi-judicial tribunal in Ottawa, responsible for the interpretation and administration of the Status of the Artist Act (SAA).

Her works reflect the complex dynamics linking two important geographic markers: The Caribbean and the United States.  Education  Charlier received her BFA from Queens College in 1991 and her MFA from the School of Visual Arts in 1993. She was an artist in residence at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture (Summer 1993) and then at The Studio Museum in Harlem 1996-1997.  Cultural background  Charlier was born in Queens, New York to Haitian parents. She moved back and forth between the United States and Haiti in her childhood, attending both primary and secondary schools in Haiti and then spending her summers in New York.  Selected Works  * DESIRE, Johnny Was, 2018, FiveMyles Gallery. In the catalogue essay for the solo exhibition, Jerry Philogene quotes Audre Lorde, \\"Our visions begin with our desires.\\" In this elaborate installation, Charlier reinvents a European boudoir, a quintessential feminine space, and one of female resistance and resilience. Flora and fauna that mimic a tropical garden embellish walls of a rose-colored space, lit atmospherically and enhanced with drawings on wood that represent personal gifts to the artist. Stencils of dark leafy vegetable greens adorn the floor. An ornate dresser displays drawers that have been lined with velvet embroidered with the romantic poetry, Rumi and Langston Hughes which the viewer is invited to open. Philogene concludes the intent as existing \\"to explore the relationship between language and material, between allegory and narration, asking how do desire, yearning, want, and need operate the historical process of cultural transformation that highlights diverse African diasporic experiences.\\" * Bordering the Imaginary: Art from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and their Diasporas, a 2018 group exhibition at BRIC Gallery that visually explored issues of this specific Caribbean diaspora. Charlier's painting on wood, Soldats Marrons (Maroon Soldiers), mixes tiny 18th century soldiers with long white spears projecting into huge swarths of tropical foliage. As described in a catalogue essay by curator Abigail Lapin Dardashti, both Charlier's and Freddy Rodriguez's paintings \\"focus on the island's history of maroons - communities of runaway slaves that settled mountainous areas of the island,\\" and reflect on the loss of history and amnesia of race due to Trujillo's \\"whitening\\" campaign. In the same exhibition is a collaborated installation by Charlier and Scherezade Garcia. Memories of a Utopian Island: Also at the BRIC exhibition Charlier presented a video animation Conversation Thread in collaboration with Sherezade Garcia. Two projected silhouettes of the artists tackle contemporary issues related to their island of origin that includes both Haiti and Dominican Republic. Speaking in a mixture of French, English and Spanish and Haitian Creole the silhouettes talk back and forth about an environment of equality and collaboration rather than one of friction. On another wall Borlette (Lottery) combines the sculptural inner tubes made of rice paper beaded to resemble Voodou flags, signature elements respectively of Garcia and Chavelier's individual practices. * The Pantheon was started early in Charlier's career during a residency at the Studio Museum of Harlem. As if a cast of the Haitian laws had landed in Harlem, African American heroes/sheroes cloaked as traditional Catholic Saints invite the viewer to examine ideas about the construction of identity and the fluidity of a diasporic experience. * The Voodoo Child title is taken from Jimmy Hendrix famous song, The Voodoo child series is an extended self-portrait, in which the artist reinvents the traditional machann (peddler) to travel through history and art history. The layering of both materials and imagery in these collages, often echo the early training of the artist as an oil painter. *The Map and Requiem Portraits of prematurely deceased male relatives are enshrined as photographic sections of bodies placed in altar-like recessed niches. Beaded and sequined Voodoo flags allude to traditional craft, healing gestures and mark an embattled history. *Time Life Jungle Echoing the tourist trade of the 1960s and 70's, black and white jungle-like flora and fauna wall drawings taken from childhood encyclopedias are confronted by rows of crayons installed as votive candles. Viewers were invited to symbolically color the installation that was presented at biennial de Santo Domingo as Paradise Lost.

Zahid Hasan is an endowed chair Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Princeton University. He is known for his pioneering research on quantum matter exhibiting topological and emergent properties. He is the Principal Investigator of Laboratory for Topological Quantum Matter and Advanced Spectroscopy at Princeton University and a Visiting Faculty Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. Since 2014 he has been an EPiQS-Moore Investigator awarded by the Betty and Gordon Moore foundation in Palo Alto (California) for his research on emergent quantum phenomena in topological matter. He has been a Vanguard Fellow of the Aspen Institute (Washington DC) since 2014. Hasan is an elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Born in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Hasan completed his higher secondary schooling at Dhaka College, then studied physics and mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin. He obtained his Ph.D. in 2002 from Stanford University, working at SLAC/Stanford National Accelerator Laboratory and Brookhaven National Laboratory. He was then a Robert H. Dicke Fellow in fundamental physics at Princeton and held visiting appointments at Bell Labs (in Murray Hill, New Jersey) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and joined the faculty rank at Princeton University. While at the University of Texas at Austin his research focused on Dirac monopole field theory and quantum gravity upon completing coursework with Steven Weinberg and others at the Weinberg Theory Center in the 1990s. Later while at Stanford University he became interested in exploring quantum many-body phenomena in unconventional superconductors and in developing new spectroscopic techniques at SLAC. In 2016-2017 he joined Miller Institute of Basic Research in Science as a Visiting Miller Professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Since 2017, he holds the Eugene Higgins endowed professorship at Princeton University. According to an interview conducted by U.S. DOE (osti.gov) and other news media, he was motivated to work on emergent quantum phenomena and the Standard Model analogs in materials following scientific exchanges with his Princeton colleague Philip W. Anderson in the early 2000s. In a 2009 news release published by the U.S. National Science Foundation, Anderson commented on Hasan‚Äôs early career work : \\"As a technical achievement, or a series of physics achievements alone, it is pretty spectacular,\\" \\"For theoreticians,\\" Anderson added, \\"the observation of such quantum effect (phenomena) is both interesting and significant.\\" Continuing along the same line of research but more broadly on quantum matter he published several high-impact (highly cited) papers and in 2017 he was invited to deliver the Sir Nevill Mott (Nobel Laureate ‚Äô77) lecture series in physics, UC-Berkeley Miller Institute professorship lectures in science, the S.N. Bose seminar (endowed lecture series) in fundamental physics, Aspen public lecture, ICTP, HKUST and many other endowed or public lectures, colloquia and plenary talks around the world. He has been one of the featured scientists on the occasion of Albert Einstein Annus Mirabilis at U.S. Department of Energy (WYP'05) in connection to his work on photoelectric effect based spectroscopy of quantum states of matter. He also served on the Einstein Annus Mirabilis committee at Princeton University. Hasan's research is focused on fundamental condensed matter physics - either searching for, or in-depth exploration of novel phases of electronic matter. He is an expert in the physics of quantum matter in relation to condensed matter version of Dirac equation, Dirac monopole, quantum field theory, quantum magnetism, superconductivity, topological phenomena, and advanced spectroscopic, scattering, sub-atomic resolution imaging-microscopy techniques. In exploration of emergence in quantum systems, his research has focused on strongly correlated materials, broken symmetry, low-D antiferromagnetism, doped Mott phenomena and superconductivity, symmetry protection and breaking in Dirac matter, vortex-lattice phase transition, quantum Hall-like topological phases, Mott insulators, Kondo insulators/heavy fermions and Anderson impurity physics, quantum spin chains/liquids, cuprate spin-1/2 ladders (2D Mott insulator), exotic superconductors, quantum phase transitions, mass generation of Dirac fermions in solids, Dirac cone superconductivity, and topological quantum matter. He played a pioneering role in demonstrating momentum-tuned resonant X-ray photon scattering technique and nature of collective modes in Mott insulators and spin-1/2 quantum chains exhibiting spin-charge separation (holon) type electron fractionalization; quasiparticle quantum coherence, Mott-Hubbard physics in superconductors and related thermoelectrics, momentum-space emergent monopole, and also in the experimental discoveries of topological insulators in 3D materials, hedgehog spin-textures in magnets, space-group protected Dirac insulators and related matter, CDW-melted superconductors, demonstration of exception to Anderson theorem in unconventional superconductors, Chern magnets, Weyl magnets, topological conductors, helical superconductors, nodal-line semimetals and drumhead states, Lorentz-violating materials, signatures of Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly analogs, non-Fermi-liquid magnetic and thermoelectric metals, Majorana zero modes (MZM) in two different classes of strong spin-orbit superconductors, spin-helical states avoiding Anderson localization and topological metals, novel Weyl materials, Dirac matter on artificial topological lattice, Hopf-link metals, Berry curvature tunable magnets, topological chiral crystals, Kagome topological magnets and related new forms of quantum matter using state-of-the-art spectroscopy, scattering and microscopy techniques in combination with theories of matter.

HpCDD is the dibenzo-p-dioxin which is chlorinated at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. It is a polycyclic heterocyclic organic compound, since HpCDD contains multiple cyclic structures (two benzene rings connected by a 1,4-dioxin ring) in which two different elements (carbon and oxygen) are members of its rings.IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry - http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_13.htm (visited: 14-03-2017), PubChem, compound summary for CID 78968 (1,4-Dioxin) - https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1_4-Dioxin#section=Top (visited: 14-03-2017) HpCDD has molecular formula C12HCl7O2 and is an off-white powder, which is insoluble in water.Compound summary for CID 37270 - https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/37270#section=Experimental- Properties (visited: 14-03-2017)  History  Dioxins are mostly by-products of industrial processes such as the manufacturing of pesticides, bleaching of paper pulp or combustion processes such as waste incineration.ToxFAQs: Chemical Agent Briefing Sheets (CABS) This means that heptachlorodibenzo-p- dioxin does not have a common use. In 1998, Professor Sharon Beder argued that large companies have tried to play down the seriousness of the toxic problems of dioxin. She described her concern in her paper ‚ÄòThe Dioxin Controversy: Spilling over into Schools‚Äô.) 'The dioxin controversy: spilling over into schools', Australian Science Teachers' Journal, November 1998, pp. 28-34 Companies responded by stating that Beder‚Äôs paper was based on ‚Äòfear and emotion‚Äô and not on science.Global Spin: The Corporate Assault on Environmentalism, Scribe Publications, p. 154  Metabolism  The halflife of heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is calculated to be 3.6 years. This estimation was based on the analysis of fat tissue biopsies collected with an interval of 28 months from on 14-year-old girl who for a period of about 2‚Äì3 years had been exposed to technical pentachlorophenol. The half-live of Hexachlorodibenzo-p- dioxin and octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin where estimated to be 3.5 and 2 years, respectively.WHO; Environmental Health Criteria 88: Polychlorinated Dibenzo- para-dioxins and Dibenzofurans p.262 (1989) The effects of chlorodibenzo-p- dioxin exposure was examined in rats over a 13 wk period. Hepatic accumulation was associated with alterations of several biochemical parameters. The following alterations were discovered: Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity was elevated 40 fold over controls; total cytochrome p450 content doubled and exhibited a 2 nanometer blue shift in the Soret maximum for the reduced Hemeproteinhemoprotein -CO complex. Cytochrome p450c and cytochrome p450d were significantly increased, while cytochrome p450b levels were unaltered. Nearly all the dioxincongeners present in liver were represented by octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, with a slight amount of heptachlorinated-p- dioxin.Couture LA et al.; Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 93 (1): 31-46 (1988)  Mechanism of action  Dioxins in general are able to bind to the AH receptor. This cell protein initiates effects of most of dioxin-like chemicals. The exact function of the protein of the cell is unknown, but the protein plays a role in rhythmic functions and organ development. When a dioxin enters the cell and binds to the AH receptor, a complex is formed with another protein, ARNKT. This heterodimer (which is in fact a transcription factor) binds to the DNA. The complex can inhibit or activate unknown genes.Synopsis on dioxins and PCBs - http://www.julkari.fi/handle/10024/80313 (visited: 14-03-2017)  Toxicity  Chloracne, an acne-like eruption of blackheads, cysts, and pustules, is associated with exposure to pentachlorophenol contaminated with heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. This association was first made when individuals employed in the manufacturing of pentachlorophenol were examined. It was discovered that direct contact with the pentachlorophenol lead to significantly increased risk of cloracne.O'Malley MA et al.; Am J Ind Med (17) 4: 411-22 (1990). More human studies on the toxicity of heptachlorodibenzo-p- dioxin are not available. However, animal studies showed non-human toxicity levels: rabbit, oral > 5000 mg/kg, LD50 rat, oral > 5000 mg/kg,USEPA/Office of Pesticide Programs; Reregistration Eligibility Decision Document - Ethalfluralin. p.7-11.

The rate constant for the vapor phase reaction of heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals has been estimated to be 1.3x10‚àí12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 ¬∞C which corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of 12.3 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5x105 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm.IARC. Monographs on the Evaluation of the Carcinogenic Risk of Chemicals to Humans. Geneva: World Health Organization, International Agency for Research on Cancer, 1972-PRESENT  Adverse effects  The known adverse effects for dioxin compounds are (as previously mentioned) carcinogenicity. Furthermore, chloroacne, disturbances in tooth development and other developmental effects at high concentration are known adverse effects of HpCDD. There is a very wide range of health effects because the mechanism can have all sorts of implications on the genome (see mechanism of action). HpCDD is known to cause lung cancer and anemia in rats.K K Rozman; Delayed acute toxicity of 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HpCDD), after oral administration, Obeys Haber's rule of inhalation toxicology. Toxicol Sci 1999; 49 (1): 102-109. However, there are not many studies on humans that assess the health risk factors of HpCDD. HpCDD seems to be more potent once it is circulating the body in comparison with other PCDD‚Äôs,Van Ede KI, van Duursen MBM, van den Berg M. Evaluation of relative effect potencies (REPs) for dioxin-like compounds to derive systemic or human-specific TEFs to improve human risk assessment. making it more toxic than other PCDD‚Äôs. This probably has to do with the high substitution of chloro groups. Dioxins in general are hard to break down efficiently. This causes bioaccumulation and environmental persistence.Claes Bernes: Persistent organic pollutants. Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, Stockholm 1998. .  Effects on animals  =Immunotoxicity= HpCDD is known to suppress the antibody response of C57B1/6 mice to sheep erythrocytes, a macrophage and T-cell-dependent antigen. In vivo approaches have been applied to characterize the sensitivity of suppression of the antibody response of C57B1/6 mice by an acute oral exposure to HpCDD. Suppression of the antibody response was observed after HpCDD administration at various times prior to or following antigen challenge.Mechanisms of 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HpCDD)-induced humoral immune suppression: evidence of primary defect in T-cell regulation, Kerkvliet NI, Brauner JA, Toxicol Appl Pharmacol, 1987 Jan;89(1):148 =Carcinogenicity= HpCDD is indicated as a potent liver tumor promotor in female (and only female) rats. In primary cultures of hepatocytes of female rats, co-mitogenic actions of HpCDD and congeners are mediated by the aryl-hydrocarbon (AH) receptor. These actions are enhanced by estrogens. HpCDD alone is relatively ineffective in the promotion of tumors in female rats livers, but when DNA-synthesis is stimulated by epidermal growth factor, HpCDD acts as a co-mitogen. These effects are observed for different congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, based on their affinity with the aryl- hydrocarbon receptor.2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and ethinylestradiol as co-mitogens in cultured rat hepatocytes, Schrenk D, Karger A, Lipp HP, Bock KW, Carcinogenisis, 1992 Mar;13(3):453-6.

Also in 1890, the Baltimore & Eastern Shore Railroad Company purchased the Wicomico & Pocomoke Railroad (incorporated on February 15, 1848), consisting of approximately 30 miles of track from Salisbury to Ocean City, Maryland. The latter was chartered to operate from Salisbury to Ocean City, Md., of which the section from Salisbury to Berlin was opened for operation on May 1, 1868, and the section from Berlin to Ocean City, Md., in 1876. The B&ES; also operated a ferry from Claiborne to Annapolis, Maryland where the connection was made to Baltimore by rail.Burgess, George Heckman, and Miles Coverdale Kennedy. Centennial History of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 1846‚Äì1946. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 1949. The venture was not successful as on August 29, 1894, the B&ES; railroad was liquidated in a judicial sale and sold to the re-organizers. The reorganized company, the Baltimore Chesapeake and Atlantic railroad (BC&A;) was incorporated on August 30, 1894 with its principal office in Salisbury, Maryland. That same year, the railroad also acquired several steamboat companies; namely the Maryland, Choptank and Eastern Shore Steamboat Companies, all of Baltimore, Md. for $1.7 million in waterline property, wharves and equipment. In 1902, the Pennsylvania railroad became the majority stockholder but the BC&A; still operated under its organization. As of 1915, the railroad consisted of a single-track, standard-gage railroad, with distance of about 87 miles, with a branch line about 0.5 mile long extending from Salisbury to Fulton, Md., making a total of 87.252 miles. It also owned 15.582 miles of yard and side tracks. The new, combined operations of the BC&A; in railroad and waterlines had been profitable with $0.5 million in profit on a total investment of $4.325 million with a total revenue of $17.8 million for the period of 1894 ‚Äì 1915 and controlled by the Pennsylvania railroad as majority stockholder. Dividends were paid on $1.5 million par value of 5 per cent cumulative preferred stock but none were paid on the common stock of $1.0 million and none paid on the preferred stock after 1912. By 1921, the railroad had turned unprofitable due in part to private autos and trucks to the point where in March, 1922, it stopped making payments on its first mortgage. In 1921, the Pennsylvania railroad had to provide financial assistance in order for BC&A; to make payments due under its first mortgage. This continued intermittently until 1926 when the Pennsylvania announced it was unwilling to continue this assistance. The following year, the trustee for the first mortgage, Chatham National Bank & Trust Co. of NY filed for foreclosure. The railroad was sold on March 29, 1928 to Charles Carter, representing Pennsylvania railroad interests and reorganized as the Baltimore and Eastern railroad, entirely owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Baltimore and Eastern railroad survived up through the Penn central bankruptcy and ConRail merger but Conrail planned to abandon the B&E; lines. In 1982, the State of Maryland purchased segments of the original Baltimore and Eastern Shore, Baltimore Chesapeake and Atlantic railways and other former PRR properties in Maryland from the Penn Central corporation, successor to the Penn Central Transportation Company.Frederick County Land records, folio 1169, page 712 Claiborne Wharf with BC&A; tracks Wicomico & Pocomoke Railroad Company (1848‚Äì1890)  Wicomico & Pocomoke Railroad The railroad was incorporated on February 15, 1848 and reauthorized in 1864 was to connect Salisbury and Berlin, Maryland; 23 miles apart.Hayman, John C. Rails Along the Chesapeake: A History of Railroading on the Delmarva Peninsula, 1827‚Äì1978. Marvadel Publishers, 1979. At the time the railroad was chartered, there were no other railroads to connect with but instead the investors intended a connection with the steamboats on the Wicomico river in Salisbury, Maryland. When the road started construction in 1867, Dr. H. R. Pitts was president of the company and completed in May, 1868. One of the original investors was Col. Lemuel Showell (d. 1902),Jacob, J. E., Carter, J., & Wainwright, E. (2000). Worcester county. Charleston, SC: Arcadia. of Berlin, who later became president. The railroad started in Salisbury on the Wicomico river and then headed east crossing over the Eastern Shore railroad and then on to Walston's switch, Parsonsburg, Pittsville, Hancock, Whaleyville, St. Martins and finally Berlin. The original 20 mile line was extended in 1871, south 14 miles from Berlin to Snow Hill, Maryland on the Pocomoke river and opened in 1872. This was done under the 1853 charter, revised in 1867, of the Worcester railroad. During this same period, a Delaware railroad, the Junction and Breakwater railroad (Incorporated in 1856) with a vision of connecting the three states of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia was expanding southward. In 1874, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore (PWB) railroad obtained a majority stockholder position and that same year completed the expansion south to the Maryland state-line. In 1874, the Junction and Breakwater railroad obtained a charter from the State of Maryland to consolidate a number of railroad companies in the State including the Worcester railroad. Proceedings and Acts of the Maryland General Assembly, 1882, Volume 418, Page 371, Accessed at an information resource of the Maryland State Archives This meant purchasing the assets of the Wicomico & Pocomoke Railroad's extension to Snow Hill built under the Worcester railroad which it did in 1874. The newly consolidated railroad, inclusive of the W&P;'s Snow hill extension would operate in the State of Maryland as the Worcester railroad and would be completed to Franklin city, Virginia in 1876. The Wicomico & Pocomoke Railroad then used the funds from the 1874 sale of the Snow Hill extension to build another six mile extension in the same year, 1874, towards Hammock Point, just opposite of Ocean City. Passengers were then ferried over to the beaches. Two years later in 1876, the Wicomico & Pocomoke, operating as the Ocean City Bridge Company, built a toll bridge across Sinepuxent Bay, from Hommock Point to Ocean City, in Worcester county.Proceedings and Acts of the Maryland General Assembly, 1876, Volume 199, Page 23, Accessed at an information resource of the Maryland State Archives This remained the only bridge into the city until a new State built auto bridge was completed in 1919. The Wicomico & Pocomoke Railroad inclusive of its interests in the bridge into Ocean City, operated by its subsidiary, Ocean City Bridge Company, was sold to the newly organized Baltimore & Eastern Shore railroad in 1888.Interstate Commerce Commission Reports, Volume 31, Valuation Reports, Decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission of the United States, October, 1929-July, 1930 Baltimore & Eastern Shore Railroad Company (1886‚Äì1894)  Originally chartered in 1876 as the Baltimore & Eastern Shore Railroad Company and then reauthorized in 1886, incorporated March 2, 1886.Acts of the General Assembly of Maryland of 1886, p. 209, c. 133 The objective of the railroad was to preserve the business connection of Baltimore with the Eastern Shore country. That business has been largely diverted to Philadelphia through the control of the Eastern Shore Railroad by the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad.Railroad gazette. v.18, page 585, 1886 The railroad was organized by Easton, Maryland businessmen including Theophilus Tunis and Gen. Joseph B. Seth (1845‚Äì1927) who at the time was 69th Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates and later President of the State Senate (1906‚Äì1908),Maryland State Archives, Accessed at April 6, 2017 and others. The railroad line as located extended from a terminus on the Chesapeake Bay, across the Eastern Shore, through Easton, to Salisbury, Maryland, where a connection was made with the Wicomico & Pocomoke road at Salisbury. The length of the proposed new road from the bay shore to Salisbury will be 52 miles, and it will make a line running diagonally across the Eastern Shore to Ocean City, 82 miles in length. From the proposed terminus on the bay shore the distance across Chesapeake Bay to Bay Ridge is 12 miles, which will be covered by a ferry, and at Bay Ridge connection will be made with the new Bay Ridge Annapolis road, over which trains will run to both the Annapolis & Baltimore Short Line and the Annapolis & Elk Ridge road. At the same time, the State authorized the railroad the right to \\"the right to own land and develop resorts, to own steamboats and wharves, and to merge or lease railroads outside of the state.\\" The State authorized several municipalities to guarantee the bonds of up to $500,000 for the project. =Engineering and Construction= The B&ES; started route location between Claiborne and Salisbury and completed location of the route in July 1886. The Railroad's Chief Engineer, William H. Eichelberger estimates the construction cost for the road to be $727,000 ($=) for the Claiborne-Salisbury segment, including a train ferry for Chesapeake service. The railroad started construction in 1889, completed on December 1, 1890 as well as purchasing the Wicomico & Pocomoke Railroad The B&ES; also operated a ferry from Claiborne to Annapolis, Maryland where connection was made to Baltimore by rail. =Revenue Operations= The venture was not successful as on August 29, 1894, the B&ES; railroad was liquidated in a judicial sale and reorganized as the Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railway Company.

Baltimore and Eastern Railroad Company (1923‚Äì1982)  Train station in Hurlock, Maryland =Passenger service= Into the 1930s the Baltimore and Eastern Railroad operated passenger service from Ocean City, Maryland, to Berlin, Salisbury's Union Station, Delmar, Delaware, Hurlock, Easton, Queenstown, and finally to Love Point, a town on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay. However, passenger service was terminated by 1938. The railroad survived up through the Penn Central bankruptcy and ConRail merger but Conrail planned to abandon the B&E; lines. Maryland Department of Transportation (1982‚Äì )  In 1982, the State of Maryland purchased segments of the original Baltimore and Eastern Shore, Baltimore Chesapeake and Atlantic railways and other former PRR properties in Maryland were sold by Penn Central corporation, successor to the Penn Central Transportation Company. The former BC&A; segment was transferred to the State of Maryland for use by the Maryland Department of Transportation in 1982 is still owned by the State of Maryland. Legacy =Racial segregation and the path to civil rights= In 1910, the state of Maryland established the Maryland Public Service Commission and granted it power over common carriers. Similar in nature to the federal Interstate Commerce Commission, \\"...the primary concern of the Maryland Public Service Commission was rate regulation, but it also had power to hear complaints about service.\\" Shortly after its establishment, William Ashbie Hawkins represented several plaintiffs before the Public Service Commission protesting against the segregated conditions both in boats and trains under the Jim Crow law. *December 1911, Hawkins filed suit against the Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railway for discrimination on its Chesapeake Bay ferryboats, the Avalon and the Joppa. The steamer Avalon and Joppa After 1912, the boats saw little service and in 1929 were sold by the BC&A; to an African-American excursion company, \\"Federal Hill\\" and then scrapped in 1940. were sister ships originally built in 1888 for the Maryland Steamboat Company for the Choptank River route.Hain, John A. Side Wheel Steamers of the Chesapeake Bay, 1880‚Äì1947. Glen Burnie? Md, 1951. Print. Hawkins alleged several discrimination practices by the railroad, namely forcing blacks to use colored only cabins that were cramped and poorly ventilated, allowing blacks to eat only what food was left after all the whites had eaten and on one trip forcing \\"...ministers of the African Methodist Episcopal church and their wives who had taken a steamboat to Cambridge for a meeting were forced to sit in a salon all night because there were not enough staterooms available to them.\\" *Hawkins again sued BC&A; over discrimination. In the case, Thomas Turner, a Baltimore school teacher complained that \\"...the only compartments in which African Americans could ride were a vestibule to or a partition in the smoking area for white men.\\" Though Hawkins' various complaints were dismissed, the Public Service Commission did recommend changes such as ordering the BC&A; to provide seating (with partitions) in nonsmoking as well as smoking cars to assure greater equality in the future. It would be another four decades until another Marylander, Elmer Henderson, was successful in arguing to the United States Supreme Court in 1950 that \\"...segregative dining practices on the railroads could not be equal\\".Henderson v. United States, 339 U.S. 816 (1950), Henderson v. United States, No. 25, Argued April 3, 1950, Decided June 5, 1950, 339 U.S. 816 accessed at on March 21, 2017 :\\"Under the rules of an interstate railroad, dining cars are divided so as to allot ten tables exclusively to white passengers and one table exclusively to Negro passengers, and a curtain separates the table reserved for Negroes from the others. Under these rules, only four Negro passengers may be served at one time, and then only at the table reserved for Negroes. Other Negroes who present themselves are compelled to await a vacancy at that table, although there may be many vacancies elsewhere in the diner. The rules impose a like deprivation upon white passengers whenever more than 40 of them seek to be served at the same time and the table reserved for Negroes is vacant.\\" The court held that these rules violated the Interstate Commerce Act, which makes it unlawful for a railroad in interstate commerce \\"to subject any particular person . . . to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.\\" Henderson's court victory in integrating interstate travel contributed to Maryland repeal of its railroad segregation laws in 1951. So as Bogen writes, \\"generations of protesters and lawyers who resisted segregation ... in Maryland played their role in making it possible for a woman in Montgomery, Alabama ...(Rosa Parks)... to change the world.\\" See also * List of defunct Maryland railroads Notes W.

It was published online and made available for digital download on March 17, 2017. For the song, Lee collaborated with the movie's score producer Michael Wandmacher and director Eric Dennis Howell with whom she got acquainted to Voice from the Stone and its plot. Inspired by the movie's story line which she could relate to her personal life as a recent mother, Lee decided to contribute to the soundtrack with an original song. Musically, \\"Speak to Me\\" is a piano ballad instrumentally complete with strings, booming drums and cellos and features lyrics in which the protagonist pleads for love. Upon its release, the song received critical acclaim from music critics most of whom praised its haunting and cinematic sound accompanied by the singer's trademark vocals. A music video for the song for which Lee collaborated with Howell was filmed at the same location as the movie, in Siena. It serves as a backstory to the movie and it features Lee singing the song and playing the piano in a gothic castle setting; shots of her walking at a garden with a boy are present throughout. As the song itself, the visual received positive feedback from critics who felt that it was a fitting accompaniment to the song's overall musical style and the movie's tone. Background Following the release of Evanescence's third self-titled studio album (2011) and its accompanying promoting tour (2011-12), the band went on a hiatus, with its group members starting to pursue individual projects. Lee started focusing on recording music for soundtracks and movies, releasing her first soundtrack album Aftermath in 2014 from the movie War Story. In October 2015, Lee revealed that although still not certain if the band would return to the music scene with newly recorded material, she definitely would go on recording and writing new solo music \\"with every intention of people hearing it\\". She started releasing cover versions of four songs on her official YouTube account; these songs were later compiled in her first EP album released in 2016, titled Recover, Vol. 1. Although Evanescence returned to stage in late 2015 and continued touring in 2016 and 2017, Lee continued writing and recording solo music. A children's album titled Dream Too Much consisting of songs inspired by and dedicated to her first child followed as part of her solo career. The beginning of 2017 also saw a single release of an English rework of the Italian song \\"L'amore esiste\\" (2015) by Francesca Michielin. In August 2015, it was revealed that Lee would write music for the ending credits of the independent movie Voice from the Stone, directed by Eric Dennis Howell. In 2016, she started recording and finalizing the song; a video of her composing the song at Skywalker Ranch, where she played the piano and rehearsed the vocals was uploaded on her official YouTube channel on April 11, 2016. The video also featured various scenes of the movie itself set to snippets from the song. \\"Speak to Me\\" premiered on March 17, 2017 when it was also available for digital download on iTunes Store and several other digital music outlets. The digital single contains two versions of the song, the first one being the one featured in the movie and the second one being the studio recording of the song. Initially written only as the ending song of the movie only, \\"Speak to Me\\" was also used in the trailer after Howell and Wandmacher were both satisfied with the final result. Recording and composition A picture of the Skywalker Ranch where \\"Speak to Me\\" was written and composed Lee was initially contacted by the movie's director to write music for it. Closely related with both the director of the movie, Eric Howell, and the composer of its musical score, Michael Wandmacher, Lee had a conversation with both and \\"felt a surge of inspiration and immediately began writing\\" shortly afterwards. Lee elaborated how it was \\"a rare phenomenon to really share a creative vision so completely, and that made for a very powerful experience, and an end result that I am very proud of\\". She watched an unedited and incomplete version of Voice from the Stone in order to see if she would want to contribute to the movie's score; Lee was impressed by it. Since Voice from the Stone follows the story of a nurse trying to help a mute young boy who has recently lost his mother speak again, Lee felt that the plot \\"resonated very deeply\\" with her due to the fact that she had recently become a mother. The song she was asked to write was meant to illustrate the child's deceased mother's perspective and the feelings of unlimited love that extend even beyond death. In the movie, the mother's character is a classical singer and a piano player who also enjoyed the perks of motherhood; Lee expressed her compatibility with the given description, saying, \\"There is no way that this could have been more me! It's meant to be me, it has to be me, and I'm writing this song!\\". The singer further added that \\"it wasn't a stretch, in any way, for me to put myself exactly in the spot where I needed to be to write this song\\". Lee talked to the director and the score composer on the phone to discuss their opinions of what they think the ending song should sound like and Lee went to the piano right afterwards, conceiving the initial idea in an hour. She sent it to them afterwards and they both agreed that it is the direction they want to get on. Lee was invited to Skywalker Ranch which also served as the place where the movie's audio mixing was being handled. Lee went to record there for three days which marked the first time she had separated from her recent child. She revealed that the situation \\"put me in exactly the right place, emotionally, to sing and write from that emotional place that I needed to be in\\". The recording studio and the scenery at the ranch were the ideal environment for the singer to finish the writing process. Whenever she would get a writer's block composing at the piano, Lee would bike into the forest, during which she would \\"feel the beauty of earth and loneliness, at the same time\\". \\"Speak to Me\\" was completely recorded in two weeks. \\"Speak to Me\\" is a piano-led ballad which features Lee's vocals which were described as \\"haunting\\". Besides piano, its instrumentation is also provided by subtle strings as well as low-sounding drums and cellos which according to Billboards Gil Kaufman \\"amp up the track's tension\\". According to Kaufman, the \\"chilling\\" song marked a return \\"into the spooky zone\\" for Lee. He further found her \\"signature emotion-choked vocals\\" present over the track's \\"haunting\\" piano line. Similar sentiments were offered by Riddhi Chakraborty from Rolling Stone India who felt that \\"Spoke to Me\\" marked a return to Lee's \\"signature style of powerhouse vocals combined with delicate piano\\", which he found to be similar to some of Evanescence's song, particularly \\"My Immortal\\" (2003) and \\"Lithium\\" (2006). Lyrically, the song finds the protagonist calling a \\"departed, ghostly\\" love as exemplified in the lyrics, \\"We are one breath apart, my love / And I'll be holding in it till we're together / Hear me call your name / Just speak, speak to me\\". Critical reception Billboards Gil Kaufman: \\"It's the perfect shot of Celtic-tinged gothic balladry for fans of Lee's band\\". Vanessa Vallon, writing for the website AXS noted that \\"Speak to Me\\" served as a demonstration by Lee of her \\"versatility\\"; she further described her vocal performance on the song as \\"gorgeously plead[ing]\\". Mike Wass from the music blog Idolator, deemed the song to be \\"strikingly beautiful\\" and noted how it \\"evokes the gothic drama and emotional intimacy of 'My Immortal'\\". Music Week journalist Ben Homewood felt that it would be an understatement to say that the song's usage in the trailer for the movie \\"heightens the drama on display\\". Writing for LemonWire, Jessica Tamez praised Lee's vocals, describing them as \\"liquid gold to say the very least\\" and adding that she managed to convey the same \\"intensity and beauty\\" characteristics of all her work. Tamez went on to praise the singer for her ability \\"adequately capture the depth of a situation and magnify that with such elegance [which] distinguishes her amongst fellow artists\\" and observed that the melody of \\"Speak to Me\\" managed to be a fitting accompaniment to the movie's profundity. Keith Spera from The Advocate described the song as \\"lush\\". Music video A music video for the song was filmed in Siena in Italy, which also served as the filming location for Voice from the Stone. Lee collaborated with Howell on the video and they both imagined it as a \\"parallel and backstory to the film\\" which explores the relationship between the main protagonist and her son and the notion that \\"love is stronger than death\\". The five-minute video features Lee singing and performing the song on a piano at a gothic Italian castle and walking around its surroundings. It opens with a close-up black-and-white shot of Lee lip- syncing the song's lyrics. She is later seen walking with a seemingly lonely child at a garden. For the clip, Lee is dressed in a medieval-styled gown which she co-designed with the Voice from the Stone costume designer. The clip premiered on Lee's official YouTube channel on March 27, 2017. According to Chad Childers from Loudwire, it served as a proof that she was \\"certainly embracing the vibe and the feel\\" of the song. McKenzie Dillon from the website MXDWN, who described the song itself as \\"hauntingly beautiful\\" felt that its visual \\"follows the same tone\\". Lindy Smith from the Alternative Press summarized the clip as \\"visually-stunning\\" and \\"enchanting\\". Live performances \\"Speak to Me\\" was performed during the encore of the set list of Evanescence's Synthesis Tour (2017-18). The performance featured Lee playing the piano accompanied by an orchestra.

It features guest vocals by Grace Jones, who accompanies lead singer Damon Albarn throughout the track. Composition and recording =Origins= One of Damon Albarn's goals during the production of Humanz was to represent female artists more thoroughly. Speaking in an interview, Albarn listed Bobby Womack, Ike Turner, and Ibrahim Ferrer as examples of musical \\"patriarchs\\" who he'd already collaborated with; Albarn desired to collaborate with \\"matriarchs\\" as well, believing it necessary for an album titled \\"Humanz\\". According to Albarn, he and Jones had met several times before recording \\"Charger\\" together: \\"I'd met her once in her nightclub, where I made the mistake of saying she looked like Little Red Riding Hood because she was wearing a red cape. She turned around and said 'Little Black Riding Hood,' and turned back. I didn't speak to her again.\\" Despite the misstep in introductions, Jones later attended a performance of Albarn's Monkey: Journey to the West, admitting to Albarn that she enjoyed it. Jones and Albarn were acquainted through mutual management affiliates, though Albarn emphasized that it didn't make the process of collaborating with her any easier. =Recording= Scheduling proved difficult from the onset, with Albarn claiming that it took about four months to secure a recording day with Jones. During this period, Albarn continued work on \\"Charger\\"; by the time Jones was available to record, Albarn had already constructed an instrumental onto which an unnamed vocalist sang over, presumed to be Pauline Black, as she is featured on the Super Deluxe version of the song. Once Jones and Albarn had gathered in the studio, Albarn played the song to her. Jones was initially ambivalent, complaining about a \\"noise.\\" Albarn repeatedly questioned Jones on what the noise might be, eventually coming to his conclusion that Jones wasn't satisfied with the other vocalist's singing. After Albarn removed the unnamed singer's vocals from \\"Charger,\\" Jones was prepared to begin recording. Commenting on the moment, Albarn said: \\"She wouldn't say it was this other person's voice. Once the voice had been taken off, the track was ready to work on. Some people don't necessarily want to be on the same tune with somebody else.\\" Jones' recording session was prolonged and frenetic, lasting four hours. Jones ad-libbed much of the session, and with such intensity that Albarn was taken aback: \\"It's slightly supernatural, her energy. Not entirely of this world.\\" Some time after the recording session, Albarn covered the studio floor with pieces of paper with Jones' lyrics printed on them, crafting the lyrics to \\"Charger\\" from whichever fragments he felt were suitable. Album recording engineer Stephen Sedgwick‚Äôs final mix session of \\"Charger\\" contains 90 separate tracks. Critical reception \\"Charger\\" has received generally positive reviews: both Q Magazine and Consequence of Sound listed it as one of Humanz' highlight tracks, with the latter commenting: \\"Sure, Grace Jones‚Äô insidious laughter on ‚ÄúCharger‚Äù while industrial beats scratch behind her may seem out of place, but it‚Äôs one of Gorillaz‚Äôs best songs to date, pushing the dance playlist setup of the album into a decidedly disordered flash of color and sound.\\" Some critics took pleasure in the dichotomy between Albarn and Jones' vocals, with NME characterizing \\"Charger\\" as a track \\"where Grace Jones bares some sphinx-like teeth over a distorted two-note line [...] while Albarn‚Äôs bewildered vocals splutter out in flouncy dribs and drabs.

Retrieved March 18, 2017.  History  The two states have historically had distant relations due to the split between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In medieval history, contact between Bulgaria and the Papal States (to which Holy See is formal successor) was limited. In 1925, Angelo Roncalli was sent to the Kingdom of Bulgaria as the apostolic visitor by Pope Pius XI, before being appointed as the apostolic delegate in the country in 1931. There were never formal diplomatic relations between the Bulgarian kingdom and the Holy See, but the government tacitly acknowledged the Holy See's presence and work inside the country. In February 1949, the foreign ministry of the Bulgarian People's Republic removed all legal recognition of the Holy See.Pavlova, Ekatarina (July 2, 2016). 25 Years of Diplomatic Relations Between Bulgaria and the Holy See. Diplomatic Spectrum. Retrieved March 18, 2017. Shortly after World War II, the Communist Party of Bulgaria initially showed benevolence towards Catholic organizations in the country prior to the signing of the Paris Peace Treaty to demonstrate its democratic values to the Western Allies. But after the signing the new government began its crackdown on Catholic organizations, justifying it by claiming that the Catholic Church in Bulgaria backed reactionary anti-democratic opposition. At an Orthodox conference in Moscow, in July 1948, they accused the Roman Holy See of supporting Italian fascism and called for the abrogation of concordats with the Catholic Church. In a letter to the Vatican Secretary of State, Foreign Minister Vasil Kolarov declared that Bulgaria no longer recognized the Holy See and that its apostolic delegation had no legal status.Leu»ôtean, Lucian (2014). Eastern Christianity and Politics in the Twenty-First Century. Relations between the Holy See and Bulgaria were tense during the communist era, though Agostino Casaroli worked to maintained relations with some Eastern bloc countries. Their relations began warming up in the 1980s until the collapse of communism, with the newly-formed Republic of Bulgaria requesting to reestablish diplomatic relations with the Holy See in December 1990. The Bulgarian foreign ministry granted the Catholic Church in Bulgaria equal rights under the law in 1989, as part of the democratization process. The Catholic Church still faced some challenges in post-communist Bulgaria, but the visit of Pope John Paul II in 2002 and efforts made by the former Tsar of Bulgaria, Simeon Saxe-Coburg- Gotha, helped improve the situation for Catholics in the country.

The former lordship was raised into the Principality of Joinville under the House of Guise by French king Henry II in 1551, and passed on to the House of Orl√©ans in 1688. Even though the principality was abolished with the end of the French monarchy, the title Prince of Joinville (French Prince de Joinville) continued to be used as a courtesy title. History Joinville (from medieval Latin Jonivilla or Junivilla) lies on the river Marne in eastern Champagne. In the early eleventh century, when a castle was built or possibly just enlarged at the site, it lay close to the border between the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire. The family of the lords of the castle rose to prominence late in the eleventh century when they acquired a second castle of Vaucouleurs. From then on the lord of Joinville, as one of the few \\"multicastle\\" lords in Champagne, regularly attended the court of his superior, the count of Troyes. Lord Geoffrey III followed Count Henry I on the Second Crusade (1147‚Äì49) and afterwards was appointed seneschal of Champagne (1152), an office that became hereditary in his family. The Joinville family patronised the Cistercian monasteries of Clairvaux and La Cr√™te, but their relationship with the nearby Benedictine house of Montier-en-Der was one of rivalry. The family also had influence in local cathedral chapters. Guy was elected bishop of Ch√¢lons (1164‚Äì90) with the help of Count Henry I, and William became bishop of Langres (1209‚Äì19). By the turn of the 13th century, the lordship of Joinville included, other than the area of modern-day Joinville, the modern communes of Sailly, Vaucouleurs and Marnay-sur-Marne. In 1204, Lord Geoffrey V and his younger brother Robert died while on the Fourth Crusade. Since William had entered the church, the lordship passed to the fourth brother, Simon, while the fifth, Guy was given Sailly and established a cadet lineage. Simon's sons again divided the lordship: Joinville and the seneschalcy went to John, while Vaucouleurs passed to Geoffrey in 1298, and Simon received Marnay. In April 1551, French king Henry II elevated the lordship of Joinville into a principality, turning Francis, duke of Guise, into the first prince of Joinville. His descendant Marie died without children, with her titles inherited by her cousin Anne Marie Louise d'Orl√©ans, with the principality of Joinville becoming a possession of the House of Orl√©ans. In the 19th century, Louis Philippe I, who would become the last French monarch, bestowed on his son Fran√ßois the title of prince of Joinville. Upon marrying princess Francisca of Brazil, Fran√ßois received as dowry a portion of lands in the South of the Empire of Brazil which were incorporated to the lands of the prince of Joinville. In 1848, the French monarchy was formally abolished and all the lands of the Orl√©ans family in France confiscated, with the lands in Brazil becoming the last remnants of the lands of the prince of Joinville. Those lands are nowadays the Brazilian city of Joinville.

Anna briefly stayed at Abeokuta. In 1853 she arrived in Ibadan and although they had intended to travel further they decided to set up their mission in that settlement. Ibadan's population was around 55,000 according to David. Anna would teach in the school that they built and she would run the mission when David was away preaching or trying to translate the New Testament. Her husband could speak Yoruba and he was on good terms with the local dignitaries. This advantage meant that the children of local chiefs attended and sometimes boarded at the school which Anna ran. The first two Christian converts were Yejide and Akielle who were the son and daughter of a local chief. Lady Hannah Buxton sent boxes of toys to Hinderer in 1855. By 1866 her grandchildren were parcelling up toys to send to Nigeria. In 1860 war broke out and the hostilities prevented them from being able to travel to the coast for five years. Parcels from Lady Buxton could not be sent as they would be ambushed. Money and food ran out and Hinderer had to return children in her own care wherever possible. Sadly one of their converts died after being mistreated by their family for being Christian. This was the start of her poor health and she returned to England in 1869. Death and legacy Two Victorian missionaries Hinderer died in Martham in Norfolk in 1870 where her husband was acting as curate. Two years later her memoirs were published.

Her social art projects, exhibitions and research have taken up questions of conscience, truth, and the nature of interpersonal relationships, particularly as they are enacted through conversation.Smith, Steven Ross. \\"Linda Duvall.\\" Saskatchewan Arts Alliance, 2006. http://www.artsalliance.sk.ca/resources-and-tools/studies-and-facts/2006/910. Her art employs photography, video, installation, performance art, and community-based research including Internet-based archiving. They often feature invitations for individuals or groups to participate in specific tasks involving conversation or expression. Overall Duvall's work investigates speech acts (such as, confessions, gossip and expressions of regret), the nature of truth, the process of grieving, intimacy and vulnerability. Her solo exhibitions have been hosted by Art Gallery of Hamilton, Dunlop Art Gallery, Art Gallery of Mississauga, Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno Guatemala City, Custom House Gallery Westport Ireland, Box Hotel Gallery Barcelona and Thunder Bay Art Gallery. She has served on a number of boards of artist-run organizations including, Paved Arts, Red Head Gallery, The Photographer's Gallery (now known as PAVED Arts), BlackFlash Magazine.  Educational Background  Linda Duvall studied sociology and English at Carleton University and education at Queen's University. She earned an A.O.C.A diploma from Ontario College of Art and Master of Fine Arts degrees from University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Transart Institute.  Artistic Practice  Linda Duvall moved with her family from Ontario to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 1993, where she taught at the University of Saskatchewan. Following studies in sociology and English, Duvall has produced artworks that have situated conversation, dialogue, and cultural exchange as both methods and artistic results. In 1997 her work, Traducci√≥n/Translation was presented at Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno in Guatemala City and later at The Photographer's Gallery in Saskatoon (now known as PAVED Arts). This work superimposed handwritten Spanish quotations from immigrants about Saskatchewan onto images of the Canadian prairies. A number of her works invite and present more intimate conversational exchanges, such as Tea Gone Cold (1999), in an exhibition called Antipathies and Correspondences: Rae Staseson, Linda Duvall, Joanne Bristol, at the Mendel Gallery (now known as Remai Modern Art Gallery of Saskatchewan), and Tea and Gossip (2003, Red Head Gallery, Toronto; 2004, Kenderdine Art Gallery, University of Saskatchewan, and other locations). With the 2005 work, Lament (Red Head Gallery and Agnes Etherington Art Centre in 2008), Duvall's work turned to more sorrowful modes of discourse. In Lament, Duvall presented audio recordings of people reading public laments such as, confessions, pleas of apology or regret, and announcements of unexpected tragedy or death. Audience members were invited to participate in these public readings, while visual footage of Duvall involved in a violent police incident was visible in the room. The work, She Can't Begin (2007, Red Head Gallery), presented the artist's own words in response to her 23-year-old son's suicide superimposed on video images of the prairie landscape of his death. Also in direct response to these events she produced a small artist's book, Desperately Sorry Emails (2008) as a magazine insert in BlackFlash. In 2009 a major work resulted from Duvall's collaborative work with organizations supporting incarcerated individuals and their families. Where were the Mothers? (Art Gallery of Mississauga and Dunlop Art Gallery) is a gallery- based video installation as well as a professionally produced audio CD featuring songs written and performed by individuals who as the CD brochure describes \\"have had run-ins with the law, lived or worked on the street, dealt with addictions or participated in illegal street gangs.\\" Street-involved women are the subject of Living in 10 Easy Lessons (2012, G44 Centre for Contemporary Photography) which Duvall produced in collaboration with artist, Peter Kingstone, and women who they met through Adelaide Resource Centre for Women in Toronto. This work resulted in an exhibition of photo, text and video, as well as an educational materials (posters, brochures) which were distributed throughout the city. A discussion event involving community service providers was organized by the gallery in conjunction with the exhibition. Critical reactions to the project questioned the way the participants, who were visually identifiable in the exhibition and educational materials, were presented as wilfully circulating illicit methods of survival.turions, cheyanne (2012). \\"Living in 10 Easy Lessons\\".

Accessed 18 March 2017. https://gallery44.org/exhibitions/living-10-easy-lessons Published reactions to Living in 10 Easy Lessons and other Duvall works also emphasize the way the speech acts of participants in Duvall's art works disrupt the authority of public and cultural institutions.Klassen, Lois. Looking at Word Finding, a Practice-Based Research Project about Participatory and Dialogical Art Processes. [Electronic Resource]. Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design Masters Thesis. [Vancouver] : Emily Carr University, 2011. Also in 2012, a solo exhibition entitled The Toss (Gallery TPW) took up again Duvall's personal experience with police violence, the media footage of which had been frequently broadcast in local TV advertising and was included in her 2005 work, Lament.Moser, Gabrielle (2012). \\"Linda Duvall - The Toss.\\" Exhibition Essay. Toronto: Gallery TPW. Retrieved 20 March 2017 http://gallerytpw.ca/exhibitions/lduvall/ For this project, the artist displayed using video footage, her own process of learning the technique of tossing assailants that was used on her by the police, and her own use of the technique in realistically staged scenarios. In more recent work, Duvall has actively solicited the voices of those familiar with cultural production to participate in her projects. In The Unacknowledged (2016, Remai Modern Art Gallery), she invited artists as well as theologians, poets, lawyers, inmates, filmmakers, health care workers and street-involved women to produce commemorative panels for individuals whose bodies were not identified after death. The new work, In the Hole (2017), invites artists to spend 6 hours a day (for up to three days) in a large hole dug into the earth on her rural Saskatchewan property. At the same time, visitors to the gallery at PAVED Arts in Saskatoon (60 miles away) will view what is captured on the camera installed in the hole.

While also absorbing all the oxygen from the water, creating dead zones. Cultural eutrophication is when a flux of excess nutrients from human activity are added into a local run-off which in turns speeds up the natural eutrophication.Cultural eutrophication (2010) Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved April 26, 2010, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: This is caused by human activity, this problem became apparent once the green revolution and industrial revolution began in the last century. Phosphates and nitrates are the two main nutrients that cause cultural eutrophication as they enrich the water allowing for aquatic plants such as algae to grow rapidly. Algae is prone to blooming into large quantities removing oxygen from the water generating anoxic conditions. This anoxic environment kills off any organisms in the water body and make it hard for terrestrial animals to gain access to the water for drinking. Increased competition for the added nutrients can cause potential disruption to entire ecosystems and food webs, as well as a loss of habitat, and biodiversity of species. There are many ways in which nutrients are added through human activity, including but not limited to: waste treatment plants, golf courses, fertilizing lawns, burning of fossil fuels and agricultural practices. Cultural eutrophication can occur in fresh water and salt water bodies, usually shallow waters are the most susceptible. In shallow lakes, sediments are frequently disturbed by wind-wave and resuspended, which result in huge nutrients release to overlying water As well the shallow areas are normally where the run-off reaches first and has less water to dilute the excess nutrients. This begins to cause many problems for the nearby wildlife as well as recreational activities for humans. Eutrophication restricts water use for fisheries, recreation, industry and drinking because of increased growth of undesirable algae and aquatic weeds and the oxygen shortages caused by their death and decomposition. Effects One response to added amounts of nutrients in the aquatic ecosystem is the rapid growth of microscopic algae, also known as an algal bloom. In freshwater systems, the formation of floating algal blooms are commonly nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). This outcome is favored when nitrogen inputs are reduced and phosphorus inputs are increased. Large amounts of algae reduce the amount of dissolved oxygen available in the water for other organisms, which increases fish mortality rates. Nutrient pollution is a major cause of algal blooming, however, the excess nutrients also facilitate the growth of other aquatic plants. Following this, overcrowding occurs and plants compete for sunlight, space, and oxygen. Overgrowth of water plants also blocks sunlight and oxygen for aquatic life in the water, which threatens their survival. Increased competition for the added nutrients can cause potential disruption to entire ecosystems and food webs, as well as a loss of habitat, and biodiversity of species. Research The Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) that spans from Michigan, USA to Ontario, Canada is a fully equipped, year-round, permanent field station that uses the whole ecosystem approach and long-term, whole-lake investigations of freshwater focusing on cultural eutrophication. ELA is currently cosponsored by the Canadian Departments of Environment and Fisheries and Oceans, with a mandate to investigate the aquatic effects of a wide variety of stresses on lakes and their catchments.Schindler, David W., Vallentyne, John R. (2008). The Algal Bowl: Overfertilization of the World's Freshwaters and Estuaries, University of Alberta Press, .  Sources of anthropogenic pollution  = Raw sewage = Aerial view of Lake Valencia experiencing a large cultural eutrophication flux due to untreated wastewater discharging into the lake. Raw sewage is a large contributor to cultural eutrophication since sewage matter is very rich in nutrients. Releasing raw sewage into a large water body is referred to as sewage dumping, which is a large problem in today's society even in developed countries. There are multiple different ways to fix cultural eutrophication with raw sewage being a point source of pollution. Waste collection, incineration, and waste treatment have become common practices in industrialized parts of the world. A wastewater treatment plant is where the water will be filtered to regular water before discharging back into a large water body. In some areas incineration is used where the solid waste is exposed to high temperatures turning the waste into ash. Convectional sludge incineration systems mostly charge dewatered sludge directly into the incinerator. Generating an anaerobic environment is also another method where microorganisms degrade the waste without the use of oxygen. An anaerobic system can be used for pretreatment prior to discharging to a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The incineration method and the anaerobic methods are the most environmentally friendly compared to others. Anaerobic treatment use substantially less energy, require less chemicals, and incur lower sludge handling costs compared to aerobic treatments; as well the biogas produced is a source of renewable energy to generate electricity. Similarly, incinerating a ton of waste produces electric energy equivalent to 52.1 kWh/ton of combustible waste in the combines heat and power generation; this amount displaces electricity that would be provided by an electric utility power plant that uses fossil fuels in Korea. =Agriculture= An example in Tennessee of how the fertilizer on fields can quickly turn into runoff with a flux of nutrients that flows into a local water body. Since the agricultural boom in the 1910s and again in the 1940s to match the increase in food demand, agricultural production relies heavily on the use of fertilizers. Fertilizer is a natural or chemically modified substance that helps soil become more fertile. These fertilizers contain high amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen, which results in excess amounts of nutrients entering the soil. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are the \\"Big 3\\" primary nutrients in commercial fertilizers, each of these fundamental nutrients play a key role in plant nutrition. When nitrogen and phosphorus are not fully utilized by the growing plants, they can be lost from the farm fields and negatively impact air and downstream water quality. These nutrients can eventually end up in aquatic ecosystems and are a contributor to increased eutrophication. When farmers spread their fertilizer whether it is organic or synthetically made most of the fertilizer will turn into runoff that collects downstream generating cultural eutrophication. There are many ways to help fix cultural eutrophication caused by agriculture. Safe farming practices is the number one way to fix the problem. Some safety precautions are: # Nutrient Management Techniques - Anyone using fertilizers should apply fertilizer in the correct amount, at the right time of year, with the right method and placement. # Year - Round Ground Cover - a cover crop will prevent periods of bare ground thus eliminating erosion and runoff of nutrients even after the growing season has occurred. # Planting Field Buffers - By planting trees, shrubs and grasses along the edges of fields to help catch the runoff and absorb some nutrients before the water makes it to a nearby water body. # Conversation Tillage - By reducing frequency and intensity of tilling the land will enhance the chance of nutrients absorbing into the ground.

An artificial lake constructed for agricultural purposes, it is also known as Akanuma Reservoir. A development to make it into a resort site is also underway. It is in Yatsugatake-Ch≈´shin K≈çgen Quasi-National Park.  Geography  The lake is positioned about four kilometres to the northwest of Mount Tateshina. The lake's surface is 1540 metres above sea level, has a surface area of 0.12 square kilometres, a circumference of 1.5 kilometres and an average depth of 4 metres. In 1966, the warm water reservoir was completed on the site of a wetland called Akanuma. It was constructed as part of a plan to improve an agricultural irrigation channel from the Edo period. Holding 320, 000 cubic metres, it provides water to 1537.3 hectares of farmland downstream. As Mount Tateshina is sometimes known as Menokami-yama ('Goddess mountain'), the lake was named Megami-ko ('Goddess lake') after it. The Venus Line road opened in 1967 and connected the lake to Lake Shirakaba, which was a more established tourist destination. Seizing the opportunity, Tateshina then got a licence to use the surface of the lake and further developed the lake as a tourist attraction, building several accommodation and leisure facilities, In the area around the lake there natural woods of Japanese white birch and Japanese larch, and in spring and early summer one can see eastern skunk cabbage and Japanese azalea at their peaks, respectively. Boats can be seen on the lake in summer, and in August the Shirakaba K≈çgen Firework Display is held. The red leaves of autumn have also been praised for their beauty. In winter, the frozen lake surface is turned into a race track, which is used to hold courses in road safety as well as to test drive cars in development. With the help of English literature scholar Kimie Imura, the Lake Megami Fairy Festival has been held since 2010. The area's abundant nature is said to be popular with the fairies spoken of in European folklore, and the event is held to coincide with periods when fairies are supposedly close to the human world (in the fiscal year of 2011, it was held in May, June, October and February). It was conceived as a plan to revitalise the area, and by making fairies the theme it has a high degree of originality and newsworthiness. As well as this, the event takes place between the summer and winter tourist seasons, with an aim to increase visitor numbers in that period.

Its source is in Mizuide. Shiozawa-segi () is an irrigation channel that flows through Tateshina. Along with Uyama-segi and Yaebara-segi, it is considered one of the three major irrigation channels of Tateshina. It is also registered on the Sosui Hyakusen, a list of the best one hundred in Japan. It was originally built by Rokugawa Ch≈çsabur≈ç, work began in 1644 and finished in 1646. Its sources are located in the mountains, at Benzaiten (1680 metres above sea level) and Mizuide (1660 metres above sea level) amongst others. Before this time the feudal domain had a kokudaka of a little over fifty koku, but after the completion of Shiozawa-segi this increased rapidly. In 1672 it had reached as much as 662 koku. Rokugawa Ch≈çsabur≈ç's name, along with his great power, was passed down for many generations. The family was responsible for maintaining and managing the irrigation channel, controlling the amount of water supplied. Lake Megami was constructed with the objective of storing excess water from Shiozawa-segi to make up for water shortages. Construction began in April 1942 to improve the water supply for agriculture in the six villages of Ashida, Yokotori, Mitsuwa, Motomaki, Kitamaki and Shiokawa (present day Tateshina, Saku, T≈çmi and Ueda). Pupils from Tateshina Agricultural School (now Tateshina High School) were mobilised to work on it. From 1946, construction went ahead under the authorisation of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, but due to a lack of materials and food, construction was suspended in 1949. In 1961, work began on the Prefectural Mimakihara Agricultural Water Supply Improvement Project. The work of upgrading to the current method of supplying water from Araido Weir that comes from each water source started. Adding to the practical use of an already existing irrigation channel, a new tunnel was dug up and maintenance of the main waterway was promoted. Work on suspended Lake Megami project resumed, and while construction was delayed due to difficult terrain, it was completed in 1966. The whole of the Prefectural Mimakihara Agricultural Water Supply Improvement Project was finished in 1976. The construction cost totalled 1.4 billion yen. There were also plans for a hydroelectric power station, but they were not implemented.

Kawatar≈ç promised to no longer do evil, and that night he left Akanuma Pond and went to live in a pond he made behind Wada-shuku. As the pond appeared overnight, it came to be known as Yo no Ike ('the Night Pond'), while Akanuma Pond dried up. =Kagihikiishi= Kagihikiishi is a giant stone near Megami Lake. Long ago travellers supposedly prayed at the stone for a safe journey. A historic landmark, today the stone is designated as one of Tateshina's cultural assets. The kappa from the above story is said to have sat on this stone. Kawatar≈ç would take the shape of a human child and sit upon the stone, inviting passersby to a game of kagihiki ('key (or hook) pulling'). In the game, the players makes their fingers into the shape of a hook (the Japanese words for 'key' and 'hook' are pronounced the same way), join them up with the other player and pull each other. Those unfortunate enough to play the game with Kawatar≈ç would be dragged into the water by force once they locked fingers with him.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A hybrid solar eclipse shifts between a total and annular eclipse. At certain points on the surface of Earth it appears as a total eclipse, whereas at other points it appears as annular. Hybrid eclipses are comparatively rare. This eclipse is a hybrid event, a narrow total eclipse, and beginning and ending as an annular eclipse. The greatest eclipse was in northeasternmost Antarctica south of where the Indian and Pacific Ocean divides at 69.1 S and 144.5 E at 23:51 UTC (9:51 am on October 31), in that portion of Antarctica and the surrounding waters it shown as a total eclipse, the remainder was as an annular, first in the Indian Ocean then in the Antarctic Peninsula. Description The eclipse was visible in the islands of Java, Bali, Sunda (the three compromising a part of Indonesia today) and Timor including Portuguese Timor (now East Timor), the Asian islands, almost the whole of Australia with the exception of the Cape York Peninsula, Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, Macquarrie Islands, New Zealand, Chatham Islands, Antipodes and some remaining small islands. In Australia, it showed up to 10% obscuration in the south of the Gulf of Carpentaria, around 15% in Brisbane, 25‚Äì30% in Central Australia, around 40% in Sydney, 50% in Melbourne, around 55% in Tasmania and the Nullarbor Plain and around 60% in Perth, Western Australia. Elsewhere it showed 10% in the north tip of New Zealand's North Island, up to 30% in the area of Wellington, 45% in Otago. and 60% in the Chatham Islands. It was also around 90% in the shores of Western Antarctica and around the 180th meridian. The rim of the eclipse included the area south of Cairns, Queensland, the Coral Sea and Cook Islands.

She was the supporter and student of Sidi Bousaid al-Baji and Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili. Her presence as a woman on the high level of education and advocacy activity and charity event was very unusual in her time. Life Dates given for  øƒÄ æisha's life vary slightly, but scholarly sources give 1199‚Äì1267 CE (595‚Äì665 AH).Nelly Amri, La sainte de Tunis. Pr√©sentation et traduction de l‚Äôhagiographie de  øƒÄisha al-Mann≈´biyya (Arles: Sindbad-Actes Sud, 2008). According to her hagiography,  øƒÄ æisha was born in the village of La Manouba (al-Man≈´ba), near Tunis, and showed signs of her saintliness already in childhood, challenging social norms and effecting miraculous deeds (karamƒÅt). In portraying  øƒÄ æisha's socially transgressive behaviour, her saint's life 'aligns her with the ·π¢≈´fƒ´ model of the ‚Äúblamable ones‚Äù (ahl al-malƒÅma), those who went about transgressing social norms on purpose'. Among her most famous deeds, 'after her father had slaughtered a bull at her request, she cooked it, distributed its meat to villagers, and brought it back to life in order to reveal her sainthood. This event is regularly commemorated in song during rituals held at her shrines'.  øƒÄ æisha studied in Tunis with ShƒÅdhiliyya ·π¢≈´fƒ´s, moving back and forth between her rural home and urban Tunis. Prominent influences were the female mystic RƒÅbi øa al- øAdawiyya al-Qaysiyya (c. 95/714‚Äì185/801); Ab≈´ l-·∏§assan al-ShƒÅdhilƒ´ (c. 593‚Äì656/1196‚Äì1258), who founded the ShƒÅdhilƒ´ ·π¢≈´fƒ´ order; the Baghdadi  øAbd al-QƒÅdir al-Jƒ´lƒÅnƒ´ (470‚Äì561/1077 or 1078‚Äì1166, of Baghdad, namesake and patron of the QƒÅdiriyya); and al-Junayd (d. 297/910), a ShƒÅfi øƒ´ scholar associated with Baghdad but of Persian origin.  øƒÄ æisha is one of the few women to have been the subject of a written saint's life (manƒÅqib) in the Islamic world of her time, and 'represents a leading figure of women‚Äôs sainthood in Islam'. Whereas it was customary for female saints in her region to be recluses,  øƒÄ æisha mixed with male society, whether the poor; S≈´fƒ´ scholars; or even the ·∏§af·π£ƒ´d sultan. She had two shrines dedicated to her, one in La Manouba (destroyed in 2012) and the other in the Gorjani district of Tunis.Katia Boissevain, 'al-Mann≈´biyya, Sayyida  øƒÄ æisha', in Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE, ed. by Kate Fleet and others (Leiden: Brill, 2012-), consulted online on 29 June 2017 .  Her commemoration  The neighbourhood Saida Al Manoubya in Tunis In popular memory,  øƒÄ æisha represents a powerful and respected saint. One of the souks of the Medina of Tunis, \\"Souk Al-Saida Al- Manoubya\\", was named after her. A few kilometres from the Medina, a popular neighbourhood, Gourbivilles, takes her name. Al-Manoubya used to retire to pray in that neighbourhood. The inhabitants of Manouba built a second mausoleum to commemorate  øƒÄ æisha under the name of \\"The Mausoleum of Al-Saida Al-Manoubya\\" in her birthplace area. That mausoleum is very famous and has a big value in the Tunisian national heritage and history. It was vandalised and burned after the Tunisian Revolution, on 16 October 2012.

Education  Kelly Jazvac received her Bachelor of Arts from the University of Guelph in 2003, and her Master of Fine Arts from the University of Victoria in 2006.  Artistic practice  Jazvac works primarily in sculpture, installation, and collage. Her work has often expressed environmental concerns pertaining to pollution, environmental waste, the fetishization of images and products, and the afterlife of human activity and presence. Jazvac describes her own views on sculpture and installation as, \\"a practice that addresses the way objects and human bodies coexist in the world.\\" She often works with salvaged vinyl, which she physically transforms to create compressed sculptures. Her practice has been described as having, \\"ecological overtones, as a salvaging enterprise that might result in a wearable quilt or a habitable shelter.\\" Some have compared Jazvac's textile-like wall hangings to the work of Robert Rauschenberg. Jazvac is also known for the Plastiglomerates, which were collected from Kamilo Beach, Hawaii. The name was proposed by Jazvac alongside Charles Moore and Patricia Corcoran, and it designates a type of stone that contains mixtures of natural debris melded with hardened molten plastic. The plastiglomerates have been displayed as both sculptural ready-mades and as natural history specimens. It has been suggested that the plastiglomerates may be considered a marker of the Anthropocene. = Selected exhibitions = * Anthropophotogenic, University of Waterloo Art Gallery, Waterloo * Recent Landscapes, Louis B.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and up to three white to cream-coloured and red flowers, although the relative amount of each is variable. It is one of the later-flowering spider orchids and occurs in the far south-west corner of the state.  Description  Caladenia serotina is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, long and wide. Up to three flowers long, wide are borne on a stalk tall. The flowers have varying amounts of red and white or cream colours. The sepals and petals have long, thick, yellowish tips. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide and the lateral sepals have similar dimensions but spread widely and curve stiffly downwards near the tips. The petals are long and wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is long, wide and white but with narrow red teeth up to long on the sides. The tip of the labellum is curled under and there are between four and eight rows of red, cream or white calli along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from October to early January but is more prolific after fire the previous summer.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia serotina was first formally described in 1992 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown in Orchids of South-West Australia from a specimen collected near Manjimup but the description was not validly published. The description was validated by the same authors in a 2002 edition of Nuytsia.

The building, which is adjacent to the African Burial Ground National Monument, was opened in 1995. The building is named for Ted Weiss, deceased Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from New York. The building houses the Internal Revenue Service, Environmental Protection Agency, and the General Accounting Office. History The initial phases of the design process started in 1988 with the request for proposals by the General Services Administration (GSA). Two buildings were specified in the proposal, one to act as a federal courthouse, and the other to accommodate federal offices. The original plan also included a public pavilion to house day care facilities, an auditorium, and of parking below the building. In October 1991, intact burials of human remains were discovered during an archeological survey and excavation. The agency had done an environmental impact statement (EIS) prior to purchase of the site, but the archeological survey had predicted that human remains would not be found because of the long history of urban development in that area. Initially, GSA had planned full archeological retrieval of the remains as full mitigation of the effects of its construction project on the burial ground. Within the year, its teams removed the remains of 420 persons from the site, but it had become clear that the extent of the burial ground was too large to be fully excavated. In 1992, activists staged a protest at the site about GSA's handling of the burial issue, especially when it was found that some intact burials were broken up during construction excavation at part of the site. GSA halted construction until the site could be thoroughly assessed. It provided additional funding to conduct a further archaeological excavation to reveal any other bodies on the site and to assess the remains. After controversy and negotiations, the plans were modified and the design for the pavilion was removed from the building plans. In lieu of the pavilion, a 50-foot high interior arcade with a vaulted top was constructed. Description The building is designed in a modernized Federal architecture style and is divided into two parts - an office tower and a three-story special function facility. The office building is a 30-story high rise structure with two mechanical penthouse levels above grade and two parking levels below grade. The high-rise structure is enclosed with Deer Isle granite, pre-fabricated, panelized, cladding system with punched aluminum windows. Crowning the entire building is an open barrel vaulted cage, placed atop a granite-sheathed, box-shaped penthouse housing the mechanical systems for the building. The mezzanine level of the office building includes a fitness center and central mechanical room. The 3rd through 29th floors are typical office floors complete with access flooring and nine foot ceilings. A conference center is located on the 30th floor with multi-story meeting and conference facilities. The sidewalks along the perimeter of the building are custom-colored admixture concrete which coordinates with the building module. Exterior landscaping consists of tree plantings along the curb line on Duane and Reade Streets, with custom-designed tree grates. =Artwork= A rule for all new Federal buildings stipulated that one-half of one percent (00.5%) of the building's estimated construction cost is set aside for \\"Art-in- Architecture\\" projects. The building houses several works of art; The Roger Brown Mosaic next to the African American Burial Ground; the Clyde Lynd sculpture American Song is located at the building's entrance; the Barbara Chase-Riboud bronze memorial, Africa Rising in the building's lobby, silk screen canvas Renewal by Tomie Arai, and the New Ring Shout, by the collaborative team of sculptor Houston Conwill, architect Joseph De Pace, and poet Estella Conwill Majozo, is sited in the central rotunda.

It was Swirlies' first release for Taang! Records and documents the band's early material recorded in 1991 and 1992. The album is mostly made up of songs selected from their three previous 7\\" records, as well as previously unreleased material. Content Swirlies recorded the songs on What to Do About Them in multiple sessions on three different recording formats: Three songs were taken from the group's \\"Didn't Understand\\" single, recorded on 8-track reel-to-reel in guitarist Damon Tutunjian's Mission Hill apartment with drum parts recorded at M.I.T. by WMBR DJ John McGee. Two more songs were recorded at Fort Apache Studios by sound engineer Tim O'Heir and mixed at Q Division Studios by Rich Costey, with whom the band would continue to work for over a decade. The album's other songs were created on a 4-track cassette recorder by Tutunjian at home. The band sequenced the songs on What To Do About Them in a way that created an arc in fidelity‚Äîfrom studio to 8-track to 4-track to 8-track to studio, and so on‚Äîand linked songs with field recordings and non-sequiturial soundbites as transitions. The song \\"Tall Ships\\" opens the record by sampling a pack of feral dogs howling. \\"Her Life of Artistic Freedom\\" is a home recording of solo guitar and voice set to the beat of a skipping record. On vinyl releases, the song played out into a locked groove that ended the side of the record. The lo-fi track \\"Cousteau\\" is framed by bits of dialogue and magnetic tape noises, ending in a warbled demo recording of the band's song \\"Jeremy Parker,\\" a studio version of which would appear on the next Swirlies release, Blonder Tongue Audio Baton. Tunings The album shows the band's increasing penchant for alternate guitar tunings, with the earlier material in Swirlies' baseline half-step below standard tuning of D#/G#/C#/F#/A#/D# on both guitars. Tutunjian retunes his guitar on the home- recorded \\"Cousteau\\" to D#/F#/C#/F/G#/D#, to D#/F#/C#/F#/A#/A# to accompany Carmody's voice on \\"Chris R.,\\" and even further afield to G/C/F/A#/D/G on \\"Tall Ships.\\" Artwork The album's front cover and inner sleeve drawings are by cartoonist Ron Reg√© Jr., who also contributed vocals and noises to the record's final track. The back cover features a close-up photograph of an ostrich, a bird that would appear as Swirlies' mascot on further record sleeves, T-shirts, and other artwork affiliated with the band. Other versions Swirlies began playing a full band version of \\"Her Life of Artistic Freedom\\" and recorded it as part of a session for the John Peel Show.

A film adaptation is being produced by Paramount Players. Narrative The book details Trevor Noah growing up in his native South Africa during the apartheid era. As the mixed-race son of a white father and a black mother, Noah himself was classified as a \\"coloured\\" in accordance to the apartheid system of racial classification. According to Noah, he stated that even under apartheid, he felt trouble fitting in because it was a crime \\"for [him] to be born as a mixed-race baby\\", hence the title of his book. In large part, the book is a paean to Noah's mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo, who grew up in a hut with fourteen occupants. Noah describes his mother as being stubborn, fearless, and an extraordinary teacher. She was a fiercely religious woman who took her son to three churches every week, a prayer meeting on Tuesday, Bible study on Wednesday and youth church on Thursday, even when black South Africans were rioting in the streets and most people were cowering in their homes. The book opens with young Noah being thrown out of a minibus by his mother because she thought the driver, a man from another South African tribe, was going to kill them. Later in life, young Noah is caught stealing a car, and his mother lays down the law about crime and punishment. Later, Noah tells the story of how his stepfather shot her in the head while she was returning from church with her family. Young Noah developed social and mental agility that helped him during these times of trial, whether he was talking in their own language with different tribes, or risking arrest and violence by selling illegal bootleg CDs in dangerous neighborhoods. Through it all, his mother administered tough love and \\"old-school, Old Testament discipline\\". And through his autobiography, Noah tells his story with admirable articulation and engaging humor. Reception Published in November 2016, Born a Crime was received favorably by major U.S. book reviewers. It became a #1 New York Times Bestseller and was named one of the best books of the year by The New York Times, Newsday, Esquire, NPR, and Booklist. In early 2017, its title was used as a clue in the New York Times Crossword Puzzle. Film adaptation The memoir will be adapted into a film starring Lupita Nyong'o as Patricia, Noah's mother.

He has been a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea since 2007, representing the electorate of Bulolo Open. From 8 June 2019, to August 2019 Basil served as the Treasurer of Papua New Guinea. Early life Basil was educated at Bumayong Lutheran Secondary School and was a businessman prior to entering politics, where he was managing director of seafood and aquaculture company BSJ Fishing and Trading. He was also a board member of the Morobe Fisheries Management Authority.  Early political career  He was an unsuccessful candidate for the People's Progress Party at the 2002 election. He was elected to the National Parliament at the 2007 election for the People's Progress Party, and immediately became its deputy leader, with the party in the opposition. Key issues in his first term were the improvement of district roads, managing issues associated with the Wafi and Hidden Valley mining projects, and occasional ethnic unrest. In 2009, Basil was involved in a deal which saw the people of Bulolo District assigned a half share of the provincial government's share of the Morobe Mining Joint Venture. In December 2009, he claimed the National Parliament building was unfit for occupation and should be condemned. He was a member of the Public Accounts Committee when it reported, in the same month, that only five out of nearly 1000 government agencies had met accountability and transparency requirements, describing it as a \\"sign of a failed state\\" and threatening to resign from the committee if prosecutions were not initiated against those who had misused funds. In July 2010, Prime Minister Michael Somare told Basil during a parliamentary no- confidence vote \\"if you were outside I would kill you\\", which received wide media attention. Opposition Leader On 10 January 2011, Basil resigned from the People's Progress Party and joined the Papua New Guinea Party (PNGP), then the largest opposition party. On 11 May 2011, he became Deputy Opposition Leader under PNGP leader Belden Namah. He was a trenchant critic of Somare in the months prior to the no-confidence vote that ousted Somare in favour of Peter O'Neill in August 2011, repeatedly assailing the government regarding alleged corruption and the state of Somare's health. He was subsequently appointed Minister for National Planning in the new O'Neill government on 5 August 2011, and was also the responsible minister for new anti-corruption investigative body Task Force Sweep. In May 2012, a reported crowd of 10,000 came to witness his renomination for the 2012 election, at which he stated that he was defending his seat to finish incomplete projects in his ten months as minister. He was re-elected, standing for the Papua New Guinea Party, in July, receiving an absolute majority of the vote in a crowded field of candidates. O'Neill dumped the PNGP from his governing coalition after the election, having fallen out with leader Namah, costing Basil his ministry. Basil filed a court challenge to prevent from sitting while final election writs were returned, which delayed but did not prevent O'Neill from being sworn in for a full term. Basil was again named Deputy Opposition Leader in August 2012, while also serving as Shadow Minister for National Planning, District Development and Health and HIV/AIDS. In the same month, he repeatedly criticised the O'Neill government over a reported travel ban preventing foreign journalists from visiting Manus Island, home to the Australian Manus Regional Processing Centre. In October, he voiced strong opposition to deep sea mining in Papua New Guinea. Basil organised a rural electrification program back in his own district, which was well-received. He remained in the opposition as its numbers declined to only six by May 2013, as various MPs defected to the government. Basil was heavily critical of the deal which allowed for the expansion of the Manus detention centre, and was involved in an opposition legal challenge claiming that it was unconstitutional. In September 2013, Basil was one of only two MPs to vote no on a bill which restricted no-confidence votes, requiring a month's notice and a minimum of 22 MPs. He repeatedly complained throughout much of his second term that he and other opposition MPs were having difficulty accessing their District Service Improvement Program funds, in contrast to government MPs, and was repeatedly praised in media coverage for improving local services in spite of the interference. In June 2014, Prime Minister O'Neill asked police to investigate Basil and sacked anti-corruption head Sam Koim, claiming that they had colluded to oppose him. In August 2014, Basil resigned from the Papua New Guinea Party and joined the Pangu Party, immediately becoming party leader. Pangu, the oldest party in Papua New Guinea and one-time governing party, had not been represented in parliament since the 2013 death of Ludwig Schulze, its sole member to be re-elected in 2012. After some confusion about the loyalties of the revived party, he continued as Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He continued as deputy after Don Polye ousted Namah as Opposition Leader in December 2014. In August 2015, he was joined by a second Pangu MP when their endorsed candidate, William Samb, won a by-election in Goilala Open. He continued to campaign around the interference with DSIP funds of opposition MPs, claiming that past governments had not discriminated against the opposition in the way that O'Neill had. In April 2016, he saw the opposition's long-running court case regarding the Manus Island detention centre decided in their favour, with the Supreme Court ruling that it was unconstitutional. On 3 May 2016, Basil became Opposition Leader after the National Court upheld a challenge to Polye's 2012 election victory, set aside the result and ordered a belated recount of votes in his seat. However, he relinquished the leadership back to Polye on 26 May, two days after Polye won a stay of the earlier decision pending an appeal. He was comfortably re-elected at the 2017 election, at which he led a Pangu Party comeback, with the once-dormant party winning a number of seats. On 7 May 2019, he left the Pangu Party to become the leader of the Melanesian Alliance Party. As part of the First Marape Cabinet, Basil was appointed as Treasurer on 7 June 2019.

Her work deals with colonial and post colonial relationships negotiated by African and Caribbean diasporas. She uses photography, moving image, site specific performance, landscape, research, and collaboration to explore individual and collective performances of colonial- era pseudo science, racial categorization, migration within the transatlantic slave trade, memorialization, and transnational capitalism. Biography and education  Huber was born in 1975 in Z√ºrich, Switzerland to a Haitian mother and Swiss father. Her maternal grandfather emigrated to New York in 1965 to escape the regime of the Haitian dictator Fran√ßois Duvalier. Seeking refuge from the regime, Huber's maternal grandfather migrated to New York City in 1965. Huber graduated with BA in graphic design from the Zurich University of the Arts and Vocational College for Art and Design Zurich. She moved to Finland to become partners with Petri Saarikko. In 2006 she completed an MA in Visual Culture from the University of Art and Design in Helsinki. Currently she is a PhD candidate in Arts Research from Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture in Helsinki. She lives in Helsinki with her husband and son, and travels internationally for artists residencies and exhibitions. Exhibitions and collaborations Huber began working with the Demounting Louis Agassiz, a collective that has demanded the renaming of the Agassiz peak in the Swiss Alps since 2007. Louis Agassiz was an American and Swiss pseudo- scientist and professor who supported scientific racism and argued for Eurocentric racial categorizations of humans in the 19th century. The Demounting Louis Agassiz petition has collected over 2,500 signatures internationally to change the name of this peak to honor Renty, an enslaved man of Congolese descent who was photographed on a plantation in South Carolina as part of Agassiz's project. Huber continued her research into Agassiz with Brazilian historian Maria Clara Machado, publishing (T)races of Louis Agassiz: Photography, Body and Science, Yesterday and Today (2010) as part of an exhibition for the 29th Sao Paulo Art Biennial in 2010. At the intersection of contemporary art, cultural geography, and political activism, Huber's critique of the reproductive relationship between contemporary culture and historic oppression has been honored by leading culture-producing platforms within the contemporary art world, such as the Venice Biennial (2015), the San Paulo Biennial (2010). In addition, Huber's work has been acquired by the permanent collection of Kiasma, the Finnish Museum of Contemporary Art.

It was founded in 2015 by Jonathan Haidt, a psychologist, and Nicholas Quinn Rosenkranz, a constitutional law scholar. History In 2011, Jonathan Haidt, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia, gave a talk at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology in which he argued that political conservatives were under-represented in social psychology and that this hinders research and damages the field's credibility. In 2015, Haidt was contacted by Nicholas Quinn Rosenkranz, a Georgetown University law professor, who had given a talk to the Federalist Society discussing a similar lack of conservatives in law and similarly argued that this undermines the quality of research and teaching. Haidt and Rosenkranz formed \\"Heterodox Academy\\" to address this issue. Initial funding for the group came from the Richard Lounsbery Foundation and The Achelis and Bodman Foundation. The Heterodox Academy website was launched with 25 members in September 2015. A series of campus freedom of speech controversies, such as those surrounding Erika Christakis at Yale and the 2015‚Äì16 University of Missouri protests, coincided with an increase in membership. Membership was initially open to tenured and pre-tenure professors, but has been expanded to adjunct professors, graduate students, and postdoctorals. The group has a selective membership application process which is partly intended to address imbalances toward any particular political ideology. In July 2017, the group had 800 members internationally. As of February 2018, around 1,500 college professors had joined Heterodox Academy, along with a couple hundred graduate students. In 2018, Debra Mashek, a professor of psychology at Harvey Mudd College, was appointed as the executive director of Heterodox Academy. In 2020, the organization had around 4,000 members. Programs and activities In 2016 and 2017, Heterodox Academy published an annual Heterodox Academy Guide to Colleges, a ranking based on \\"political conformity and orthodoxy\\". In June 2018, Heterodox Academy held an inaugural Open Mind Conference in New York City, featuring several academic guests recently involved in campus free speech issues, like Robert Zimmer, Luc√≠a Mart√≠nez Valdivia, Allison Stanger, Alice Dreger, and Heather Heying. Heterodox Academy operates an online platform named \\"Open Mind\\" that seeks to reduce political polarization in schools and workplaces. The organization also administers a \\"Campus Expression Survey\\", designed to allow professors and college administrators to survey their students' feelings about freedom of expression on campus. Ideology and reception Heterodox Academy formally describes itself as non-partisan. In 2018, the group's website described its mission as encouraging political diversity to allow dissent and challenge errors. According to Vox's Zack Beauchamp, Heterodox Academy advances conservative viewpoints on college campuses by playing into or presenting the argument that such views are suppressed by left-wing bias or political correctness. Commenators such as Beauchamp and Chris Quintana, writing in The Chronicle of Higher Education, have disputed Heterodox Academy's assumption that college campuses are facing a \\"free-speech crisis\\", noting the lack of data to support it and arguing that advocacy groups such as Heterodox Academy functionally do more to narrow the scope of academic debates than any of the biases they allege.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. Description The eclipse was visible in nearly all of Africa (with the exception of a part of what is now southern Namibia and southern South Africa), southern Europe, parts of the Middle East and other parts of Asia, Mysore, Maldives, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Sumatra and western Java as well as a part of the middle Atlantic and most of the Indian Ocean. It was part of solar saros 130. The umbral portion which was as far as 242 km, it included areas that were 50 miles (90‚Äì100 km) south of the islands of Santiago and Maio in Cape Verde, Senegambia including the kingdoms of Sine and Saloum, Mali, Songhai (or Songhay), Wadai, Darfur, a part of what is Sudan and the South Sudan and Ethiopia. The greatest occurred at 4.6 N, 40.6 E near the Dawa River in Ethiopia not far from the present day border with Kenya at 9:04 UTC (1:04 PM local time) and lasted for over 6 minutes. The eclipse showed up to 40% obscuration in Europe and 75% in Yemen in the Middle East, areas that showed up to 50% obscuration included Spanish controlled Canary Islands Morocco, Ottoman Algeris, Tunis, Libya and Egypt and near Oman and on the other side present-day Gabon, the Congo Basin, Malawi, present-day northern Mozambique and southern Madagascar. On Madagascar, it showed from 40% in the south to nearly 80% obscuration in the north. In Madeira, it showed around 30‚Äì35% obscuration, 90‚Äì95% obscuration in parts of Cape Verde, around 55% in Socotra, 85‚Äì90% in the Mascarene Islands and about 25% in the Chagos Archipelago. Areas that were on the rim of the eclipse included the area of the Azores, France including Brittany, the Alps, Ottoman Moldavia and Armenia, Persia (now Iran), Mysore and Sumatra and very close to Antarctica. The eclipse started at sunrise off Cape Verde, the umbral path went southeast and finished as sunset off the coast of Australia (called[New Holland at the time).

Considered a \\"nationalist capitalist\\" by the Chinese Communist Party, Liu's family was one of the few pre-1949 industrialists that received protections from the government. Liu served as a representative from Shanghai to the first National People's Congress and was a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

His father worked at China's largest Chinese-owned shipping firm, China Merchants Steam and Navigation Company. Liu's father died at the age of thirty-five in 1894, when Liu was only six years old. His father's premature death plunged the family into a tight financial situation, and Liu feel the need to begin laying plans for a future in business at a relatively young age.

However, due to inadequate funds as a teenager, he left the university before he could graduate. Cochran, Sherman, and Hsieh, Andrew. The Lius of Shanghai. Harvard University Press, 2013, p. 15. On October 30, 1907, at the age of nineteen, Liu married Ye Suzhen in their hometown of Shanghai. Ye came from a family that saw themselves as part of a distinguished merchant dynasty that had descended from Ye Chengzhong, one of Shanghai's richest Chinese merchants. She helped Liu make a start in business by bringing a dowry with her into the Liu household and serving as a channel for the transfer of other funds from the Ye family to the Lius. Cochran, Sherman, and Hsieh, Andrew. The Lius of Shanghai. Harvard University Press, 2013, p. 17.  Business ventures  Liu's career in business and industry began in 1909. He took a job as a comprador at the Kailuan Mining Administration, a Sino-British coal-mining company, where he rapidly rose up the corporate ladder. He took advantage of contacts in his Ningbo native-place network to distribute Kailuan's coal and mobilize capital from Shanghai's banks. In the 1920s, he used this capital to establish several major enterprises spanning many industries-- coal distribution, wharf operations, and the manufacture of wool textiles, cement, and matchsticks. Companies under his name included the China Coal Briquette Company, Shanghai Portland Cement Works Company Limited, Greater China Match Company, China Wool Manufacturing Company Limited, East China Coal Mining Company, and Chung Hwa Wharf Company. By the mid-1930s, his total investment amounted to nearly ten million Chinese dollars, and Liu had become the single largest shareholder of his major operations.Bian, Morris L. \\"Review of Business Expansion and Structural Change in Pre-War China: Liu Hongsheng and His Enterprises, 1920‚Äì1937 by Kai Yiu Chan.\\" The Business History Review 81, No. 3 (Autumn, 2007), p. 642. The breadth of his business ventures earned Liu the title of \\"King of Industry\\". In the early 1930s, Liu also ventured into the banking and insurance sectors by founding the China Development Bank and the China General Insurance Company. \\"Liu Hongsheng 1888‚Äì1956.\\" In Encyclopedia of Modern China, edited by David Pong, 515‚Äì517. Vol. 2. Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2009. Gale Virtual Reference Library (accessed March 19, 2017). = Greater China Match Company = Liu earned the nickname of \\"Match King\\" by founding and operating the Greater China Match Company, the largest and most successful matchstick enterprise of China's Republican Era. Liu entered the match industry in 1920, founded the China Match Company in 1930, and by 1937 had secured 55 percent of the match market in the Lower and Middle Yangzi and Southeast China, three times more than his closest rival. Cochran, Sherman. \\"Three Roads into Shanghai's Market.\\" In Shanghai Sojourners, edited by Frederic Wakeman, Jr., and Wen-hsin Yeh. University of California, Berkeley: 1992, pg. 57. In 1920, Liu built his first match factory, the Hongsheng (Hong Sung) Match Mills, in the city of Suzhou. By the late 1920s, his Suzhou factory ranked third highest in production and sales of any Chinese-owned match manufacturer in the Lower Yangzi region, and his second factory at Jiujiang ranked first in the Middle Yangzi region. Cochran, Sherman. \\"Three Roads into Shanghai's Market.\\" In Shanghai Sojourners, edited by Frederic Wakeman, Jr., and Wen-hsin Yeh. University of California, Berkeley: 1992, pg. 59. In 1930, Liu decided to launch his business into the more competitive markets of his hometown of Shanghai. In July 1930, he persuaded two other Chinese match manufacturers to join him in forming a combine, named the China Match Company, with Liu as general manager. This allowed Liu to quadruple his matchstick production. By the end of 1930, Liu also bought the two largest match companies in the Middle Yangzi region and several smaller ones there. At the height of the anti- Japanese boycott between July 1931 and June 1932, China Match supplied 46.2 percent of the matches sold in the Lower Yangzi and 72.7 percent of those sold in the Middle Yangzi. Cochran, Sherman. \\"Three Roads into Shanghai's Market.\\" In Shanghai Sojourners, edited by Frederic Wakeman, Jr., and Wen-hsin Yeh. University of California, Berkeley: 1992, pg. 63. In the mid-1930s, amid broken price agreements and vicious price wars, Liu Hongsheng took the lead in forming a Shanghai-based interregional match cartel. Under the auspices of the National Match Manufacturers' Association, in July 1934 Liu established the Joint Sales Office with headquarters in Shanghai. Cochran, Sherman. \\"Three Roads into Shanghai's Market.\\" In Shanghai Sojourners, edited by Frederic Wakeman, Jr., and Wen-hsin Yeh. University of California, Berkeley: 1992, pg. 67.  Relations with the government  = Republican Era = Right up until the last year of the Chinese civil war in 1948, Liu Hongsheng remained aligned with Chiang and the Nationalists. In 1932‚Äì1934, Liu had been the director of the state-owned China Steam Navigation Company, and in 1936‚Äì1937, he served as head of the Chinese National Joint Production and Sales Union for Matches, a state-sponsored cartel. During the Sino-Japanese War, Liu followed Chiang Kai- shek to Chongqing, where he presided over the government's cigarette and match monopoly. Liu returned to Shanghai at the end of the war in 1945, where he served as the government's chief director of the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and director of its Shanghai regional office.Cochran, Sherman. \\"Capitalists Choosing Communist China.\\" In Dilemmas of Victory: The Early Years of the People's Republic of China, edited by Jeremy Brown and Paul G. Pickowicz. Harvard University Press: 2007, pg. 361‚Äì362. However, after the Nationalist government's failure to halt runaway inflation and the Nationalists repeatedly referring to Chinese capitalists as \\"traitorous merchant-speculators\\", Liu briefly fled to Hong Kong in May 1949 and severed his ties with the Nationalist government. Cochran, Sherman. \\"Capitalists Choosing Communist China.\\" In Dilemmas of Victory: The Early Years of the People's Republic of China, edited by Jeremy Brown and Paul G. Pickowicz. Harvard University Press: 2007, pg. 366. = Communist Era = In November 1949, Liu was persuaded to return to Shanghai by members of his family and top leaders in the Communist Party. Thus began his time as one of China's top \\"nationalist capitalists,\\" who were regarded as patriotic and encouraged to stay as citizens of the People's Republic.Cochran, Sherman. \\"Capitalists Choosing Communist China.\\" In Dilemmas of Victory: The Early Years of the People's Republic of China, edited by Jeremy Brown and Paul G.

Pickowicz. Harvard University Press: 2007, pg. 371. In 1952, the Chinese Communist Party's Five-Anti Campaign elevated Liu to positions of national leadership. The Five-Anti Campaign aimed to denounce capitalists, but the Liu family was exonerated and declared to be model national capitalists. He became a representative from Shanghai to the first National People's Congress and a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.Cochran, Sherman. \\"Capitalists Choosing Communist China.\\" In Dilemmas of Victory: The Early Years of the People's Republic of China, edited by Jeremy Brown and Paul G.

By early 1956, Liu had fully transferred all his industries, worth over 20 million RMB, to joint state-private ownership.\\"ÂàòÈ∏øÁîü\\" shtong.gov.cn. Retrieved March 18, 2017.

The River Pegnitz and its tributaries flow through the region.  Location  In the west the Hersbrucker Alb reaches the valley of the Schnaittach. It is bounded by the course of the Pegnitz and Hiltpoltstein to the west, Betzenstein to the north, Auerbach in der Oberpfalz and Sulzbach-Rosenberg to the east and Alfeld (Mittelfranken) to the south. Much of it lies within the Bavarian provinces of Middle Franconia and the Upper Palatinate; a small part is in Upper Franconia. The Hersbrucker Alb is formed from the White Jura platform of hard, brittle and karstified massive and Corallian Limestones and the Franconian dolomite together with their more recent depositions. Numerous caves and a striking rock landscape have resulted in the area being referred to as \\"Hersbruck Switzerland\\" (Hersbrucker Schweiz, formerly N√ºrnberger Schweiz). The Hersbrucker Alb is part of the Northern Franconian Jura climbing area. The term Alb may come from the Latin montes albi (\\"white mountains\\").

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and usually only one red and cream-coloured flowers with an unusual S-shaped labellum.  Description  Caladenia sigmoidea is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, long and about wide. Usually only one red and cream- coloured flower, long and wide is borne on a stalk tall. The sepals and petals have thick, brown, club-like glandular tips long. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are long and about wide and curve stiffly downwards. The petals are long, about wide and curve stiffly upwards. The labellum is long, wide and creamy white with red stripes. The sides of the labellum have up to six short teeth on each side and there are two rows of red, anvil-shaped calli along its mid-line. The shape of the labellum is unusual in that it curves downward but with the tip turned up, producing an S-shape when viewed from the side. Flowering is from August to September.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia sigmoidea was first formally described by Richard Rogers in 1938 from a specimen collected at Kumarl near Salmon Gums, and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. The specific epithet (sigmoidea) is \\"from the Latin sigmoideus (sigmoid, curved like the letter S), alluding to the sigmoid shaped labellum\\".  Distribution and habitat  The sigmoid spider orchid is widespread between Mount Jackson and Mount Ragged in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions where it grows on stony hills, woodland and on granite outcrops.

As of 2016, the Guild included 85 members, ranging in skill from hobbyist to professional weavers, from Eugene, Springfield, and rural communities of surrounding Lane County, Oregon, USA. The Guild sponsors workshops, a lending library, skill demonstrations in a variety fiber arts, equipment sharing, and events to raise funds for local charities.  History  On March 18, 1946, 16 people met to discuss forming a group for handweavers, following the example of guilds established in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington. Guild founder Mary Elizabeth Starr Sullivan had studied weaving at the Cranbrook Art School and taught at the University of Washington. In the 1930s, she had several pieces included in a traveling exhibition, with showings at schools and museums. Guild historian Clarice Krieg wrote of the founding, \\"In order to give the group real guild status, a two tier membership was proposed ‚Äì apprentice and master; and the guild was to assume real responsibility for teaching weaving.\\" However, the founding group recognized that goal was too ambitious, and decided to instead focus on \\"helping each other with the exchange of our knowledge\\". Initially, dues were 50 cents per year, and the group met in members' homes. By 1954, the group had grown to 30 members, and moved to the Woman‚Äôs City Club building, raising dues to $3.50 annually to cover rent. Between 1946 and 1953, the Guild participated in hobby shows sponsored by the Eugene Garden Club Crafts Group. During the same period, the Guild also entered competitions at the annual Lane County Fair, and provided an exhibit with a working loom at the fairgrounds. By 1950, Guild members began holding twice-yearly sales of woven goods, and for the first sales event, fourteen members donate 537 items for sale. In June 1952 members had started monthly workshops for members. By 1954, membership stood at 30, and the Guild moved to the Woman‚Äôs City Club building, raising monthly dues to $3.50 to afford the rent. The Guild had attempted to offer classes in 1949, without much success, but that changed in 1951 when Berta Frey, a weaver with a national reputation, offered a workshop. The workshop was \\"a profitable and successful venture... a true guild experience\\", according to Krieg.  Programs and activities  In 2014, the local Maker Faire said of the Eugene Weavers' Guild: \\"The Guild has supported the weaving community in Eugene since 1946 with meetings, workshops, equipment sharing, a lending library... Guild members include both professional and hobbyist weavers at all skill levels.\\" The Guild offers demonstrations at the Lane County Fair and Oregon State Fair, as well as local venues. The Guild also fosters interest groups at the Eugene Textile Center on various fiber arts topics, with conversations about past, present, and future projects; Fiber Challenge, with a focus on annual themes including weave structures and other research topics; Shibori and Indigo, to explore dyeing methods and applications; and Ply Split Braiding Study Group for those interested in ply split braiding.

The book covers the history of autism and autism advocacy. Issues that they discuss include the Refrigerator mother theory and the possibility of an autism epidemic. One autistic individual they cover in particular is Donald Triplett. Another point they covered was psychiatrist Leo Kanner. This book has additionally discussed the debate concerning the neurodiversity movement, especially with respect to low-functioning autistics.  Story  The book starts by focusing on Donald Triplett, the first recorded child to be diagnosed with autism. It discusses how he was treated and on his family. The book then focused on the refrigerator mother theory, which claimed that parents were the main cause of autism. It examined Leo Kanner and Bruno Bettelheim's role in the formation of this theory, and discussed whether Kanner supported the refrigerator mother theory or not. The following parts focused on redefining the disorder so that more people with autism could receive treatment and improve their potential. After that, the beginnings of early modern research of autism were discussed, along with how the disorder should be defined and whether it was a benefit or a deficit. The final chapters focus on the rise of public knowledge of autism, the MMR vaccine controversy, and the neurodiversity debate.  Reception  Kirkus Reviews wrote that the book was compelling and well-researched, and the authors blended the search for treatment with the personal stories of various individuals. Spectrum wrote that the book provided a meticulous, absorbing stepwise chronology of how the perception of autism changed from being unknown, to being abhorred than later accepted. Ari Ne'eman has criticized the book for sympathizing with a parent who murdered their autistic child, and has claimed that the book misrepresents the neurodiversity movement. =Awards= In a Different Key was a finalist for the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction, described by the reviewers as \\"a passionate work of advocacy that traces public perceptions about autism from chillingly cruel beginnings to a kinder but still troubling present.\\"  References  External links * Official website American non-fiction books Books about autism 2016 non-fiction books ","title":"In a Different Key"},{"id":"53527413","text":"Barth√©lemy Hervart or Herwart (16 August 1607 - 22 October 1676) was a Huguenot banker. He saved the French monarchy on several occasions during the Fronde, the series of civil wars in France in the mid-17th century, by means of important loans, and during the period of the fall of Louis XIV's Superintendent of Finance Nicolas Fouquet. Along with his brother and several other partners, Hervart took part in the financing of the salt marsh drainage project in Arles and Les Baux.  Early life and family  Hervart's father Daniel Herwart was a Protestant banker from Augsburg who moved to Lyon. Hervart was married to Esther Vimar in 1697 with whom he had three children: Jean-Antoine Hervart, Anne Hervart, who converted to Catholicism, and Esther Hervart. Esther married , and moved to England after he died where she acquired citizenship, remarried, and had five children. Other Herwart or Hervart family included Barth√©lemy's ancestor Georg Herwart who was mayor of Augsburg from 1539 to 1548, Georg's son Ulrich, who moved to Lyon, and Ulrich's son Daniel who married Anne Erlin in 1599 and had four children, including Barth√©lemy.  Career  Bernard of Saxe-Weimar. = Military related = Richelieu, by Champaigne Initially an arms dealer, Herwart was Army paymaster for Bernard de Saxe-Weimar, a general in the Thirty Years War. When the general died in 1639, Hervart was put in charge of negotiating with Cardinal Richelieu for the reincorporation of Bernard's troops into the service of . This culminated in the signing of the Treaty of Breisach on 9 October 1639, which in turn allowed Barth√©lemy and his brother Jean Henry to acquire French nationality and land in Alsace at Huningue, as well as the estate at Landser. = Banking = Jean-Baptiste Colbert by Robert Nanteuil (1676). Following that, the brothers became bankers in Paris. Barth√©lemy was Councillor of State in 1649. His financial support permitted Cardinal Mazarin to overcome his opponents. Hervart was named Intendant des finances in 1650, and, even though he was Protestant, obtained the post of Controller-General of Finances in 1657. He retained that position until 12 December 1665. Portrait of Fouquet. After the arrest of Nicolas Fouquet, gave exclusive authority over his finances to Colbert, as he was already \\"a member of our council and Intendant of Finances\\" and made Colbert his Controller-General of Finances a position previously carried out collectively by Louis Nicolas le Tonnelier de Breteuil and Barth√©lemy Hervart. Breteuil and Hervart were duly compensated for the loss of position. When Fouquet fell out of favor, Hervart was sued like many financiers, and sentenced to pay a token fine. He was also an investor in salt marshes, in a company for the drainage of the marshes of Arles and Baux, and of the French East India Company. = Marsh project funding = The canal of the Baux Valley, bordering the former Baux Marsh. Arles and Les Baux-de-Provence are located in southwestern Provence just north and east of the marshy Camargue region along the Mediterranean. On 16 August 1642, a contract to drain the marshes was agreed to between the group of Protestant financiers represented by Dutch engineer : first, the Arles marsh located between Arles and Tarascon, and second, the marsh at Les Baux. Wheat field in the former Baux Marsh. Northern slope of the Linsolat rocks. Van Ens was the engineer in charge of the project. In order to finance the labor, the \\"Company for the Drainage of the Marshes of Arles and Baux\\" (Soci√©t√© de dess√®chement des marais d'Arles et des Baux) was founded. Funds were obtained by financiers close to Cardinal Richelieu and Mazarin, including the Hervart brothers Barth√©lemy and Jean Henry, and Jean Hoeufft. Other partners included Madame Van Ens (heir of her husband), Octavio de Strada of Dutch origin, Michel Lucas, and Jean Fran√ßois Genoyer. Fontvieille. Jean Henry Hervart took charge of the company at Arles. On 31 October 1653, articles were drawn up concerning the rules and regulations concerning the drainage operation and covered the management of the work and the responsibility of the associates. It also imposed a requirement to meet yearly on 16 August to \\"advise and organize the affairs of the company, and to proceed with the nomination of a Director.\\" Over time, the membership declined. Van Ens died in 1652. Lucas abandoned his shares to the heirs of Jean Hoeufft, who died before Van Ens, and to the Hervarts in 1659. Stada died in 1655. By 1659, the company only included the Hervarts, and the Hoeufft heirs. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1598, the Hervarts' goods were seized by the King, as they were considered to be religionnaires. Their goods were only returned in 1692 and only to Catholic heirs residing in France. Property of Hoeufft's heirs were not affected as he was Dutch, but they were confiscated during the war with Holland, and eventually returned in 1713. Descendants of Hervart and Hoeufft thus remained the owners of the company during the 18th century.  Death  Hervart died extremely rich in Paris in 1676, without having been unduly affected because of his Protestant faith.

Early life and education  Bert Hodge Hill was born on March 7, 1874 in Bristol, Vermont to Carrie Emily Hodge and Alson Collins Hill. He received his AB from the University of Vermont in 1895. He was principal at the Newport Academy in Newport, Vermont from 1895-1895. He obtained his MA from Columbia University in 1900.  Archeological career  He attended the American School of Classical Studies in Athens (ASCSA) in 1901, as a Driser Fellow of Columbia University. He continued at the school as a Fellow of the Archeological Institute of America for two years (1902‚Äì1903). He moved back to the United States, where he was Assistant Curator of Classical Antiquities at the Museum of Fine Arts and Lecturer in Greek Sculpture at Wellesley College. He then returned to ASCSA and served as director of the school for the next twenty years, from 1906 to 1926. As director, he supervised the Corinth Excavations where his focus was the springs of Peirene, Glauke and the Sacred Spring. He also participated in the study of the monuments of the Athenian Akropolis, specifically the Erechtheum and the Parthenon. Hill was director of the University of Pennsylvania's Archeological Expedition in Cyprus at the excavations of Lapithos and Kourion in 1932 and from 1934 to 1952. He was the Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer of the Archeological Institute of America for 1936‚Äì1937. He had a scholarly interest in architecture, sculpture, and topography, and was involved in research of epigraphy.  Private life  Hill married archeologist Ida Carleton Thallon in 1924, and the two moved in together in Athens with Thallon's long-term partner Elizabeth Pierce Blegen and her new husband Carl Blegen (for whom Hill appears to have had unreciprocated romantic feelings). They referred to this arrangement - by which Thallon Hill and Pierce Blegen were able to continue their previous relationship, having specified that they would still travel together and spend time alone as well as with their husbands - as 'the family', 'the quartet', or 'the Pro Par' (Professional Partnership). In 1929, the family moved into a new house at 9 Ploutarchou Street, and their home became a popular meeting place for archeologists, students of all foreign schools, diplomats, Vassar alumnae, Greek scholars, Fulbright scholars, and the staff of the American embassy. During World War II, Hill remained in Athens to look after the home on Ploutarchou Street while Ida Hill moved to the United States with the Blegens for the duration of the war. He volunteered with the Red Cross in Greece during World Wars I and II and served on the Greek Refugee Settlement Commission in the 1920s. Ida Hill died at sea on a return voyage to Athens in 1954, with Elizabeth Blegen at her side. Hill died in 1958 in Athens. Elizabeth Blegen died in 1966. Carl Blegen died in 1971. The four archeologists and friends are buried next to each other in the First Cemetery of Athens.

Guastini directing the segment titled To Catch a Demon. The feature film consists of four segments To Catch A Demon, The Hunters & The Hunted, Cam Girls and Amanda's Revenge with a short opening sequence titled Wrap Around. Plot The film is presented as an anthology of short horror films, built into a frame narrative which acts as its own short horror film. Each short film is linked together with the concept of found footage. =Wrap Around= Sam and Marie find blood and a mess in their small theatrical playhouse, and blame their friend. =To Catch a Demon= *Directed by Vincent J. Guastini Dr. Martin Callahan and his graduate student Nicole believe that night terrors are a result of the time dilation humans experience during REM sleep, which allows \\"transdimensional entities\\", or what some people call demons, to become visible. They attempt to perform an experiment to catch these entities with their hired cameraman Jason filming using a special high-speed camera. Their first attempt catches fleeting images of an entity. During their second attempt, the same entity attacks Martin and sticks tentacles down his throat, using him to communicate to Nicole and Jason. Nicole and Jason lose consciousness as they attempt to flee. After regaining consciousness, they see Martin unharmed. Martin informs them they are trapped in a different time dilation due to the experiment, and that the area may have different flows of time, keeping them trapped there in a time dilation where the outside world seems frozen and they are invisible to others, just like the entities usually are. Martin thinks he can reverse the time dilation. Just as he is about to do so, Jason attempts to grab his high- speed camera and things go from bad to worse. =The Hunters & the Hunted= David and Karen move into a new home and almost immediately begin to hear mysterious sounds coming from the roof and from around the house. They decide to record the events, which include seemingly unexplainable phenomena such as objects moving on their own. After David is attacked by an unseen force, leaving a visible handprint on his back, they call in paranormal investigators. The investigators, consisting of a lead investigator, director, and cameraman, arrive and sets up equipment and recording devices to collect information. They leave the house and let the cameras run overnight. As they get ready for bed, Karen, and then David, are attacked by an unseen force. The investigators review the recordings from the previous night and see a haunting image of a menacing girl. Karen becomes upset at this revelation and leaves the room, while David stays behind and explains to the investigators that the girl is likely their daughter, Ashen, who died 3 years ago. A seance is performed which appears to enable communication with Ashen, as well as another entity. The seance is interrupted and Karen leaves the room in hysterics. David and the remaining investigators follow after Karen to the bottom floor of the house, leaving only the cameraman behind. After the team fails to respond on their walkie-talkies, the cameraman searches downstairs and finds the lead investigator and director dead in the bathroom, with the former having her eyes ripped out. The cameraman attempts to flee the house but is knocked unconscious. Upon waking up, it is revealed that Karen and David are actually serial killers that lured the team to their home under false pretenses by using special effects and video editing tricks to fake the haunting. While criticizing him for not looking into their backgrounds before taking on the job, the daughter Ashen is shown to be alive and having contributed to the fake haunting. Ashen asks if she can kill someone \\"this time\\" and David agrees. Karen then films as David and Ashen hold a knife together and stab the semi-conscious cameraman multiple times as they discuss their next location for serial murders occurring in Seattle. =Cam Girls= Caitlin, a cam girl in a lesbian relationship, video chats with her friend telling him about unexplained blackouts after going out with her girlfriend Sindy. Caitlin says she did things she could not explain; things she would never do sober. Her friend advises her to drink less and everything should be fine. Sindy returns home and the two prepare for a special cam session where one member from a group chat will receive a free private show. Sindy asks Caitlin if she can convince her selection to cut himself, just a little bit. Sindy selects Gerry, a mild mannered overweight man. Sindy walks off screen and Caitlin begins flirting with Gerry. She asks him to give her a video tour of his house. As he gives Caitlin the tour a dark figure can be seen lurking in the background. Caitlin requests that Gerry cut his hand, which he does. Things intensify as flashes of evil are seen and the relationship between Caitlin and Gerry grows increasingly intense when she tells him to take the knife and slit his own throat. He becomes upset at the request and asks why she would want him to commit such an act. Caitlin responds by saying it is the only way they can be together. He is visibly straining to stop himself from cutting his own throat as she increasingly urges and seduces him into killing himself. He stops himself only for her to become upset and again tempt him, finally succeeding as the camera feed cuts out. Later, Caitlin and Sindy show up at Gerry's house and they begin eating him. =Amanda's Revenge= Amanda talks directly to the camera about being abducted and kidnapped for four months and states her intention of exacting revenge on her captors. Four month earlier, during a party, Amanda's friend Josh tells Ryan, Amanda's childhood best friend, that he saw two men carry an unconscious Amanda into a room. Ryan and Josh break into the room, subdue the molesters, and due to quick action appear to have prevented a rape from occurring. However, the next morning Amanda walks out in a trance suggesting she was violated in unimaginable ways. Suddenly the entire house quakes and Amanda sleepwalks back to her room, only to awaken with no memory of the incident. Even stranger, Ryan and Josh realize that there was no reported earthquake and everything seems fine outside. A month later Amanda calls her friends over to watch her sleep at night. Something is wrong with Amanda and she's getting worse. However, instead of staying awake, everyone mysteriously passes out and the camera shuts down. Amanda confides in Ryan, who is her childhood best friend, that something unexplainable has been happening in her life. She reveals telekinetic abilities to Ryan. However, Ryan believes it to be a trick. Amanda tells him to not worry about it, 'they' are not as smart as 'they' think they are. Two months later, Amanda is living in a cabin miles from nowhere with no electricity. However, she has recorded a video of her abductors and she shows it to Ryan. She asks Ryan to come to the cabin to help her. Ryan agrees and Amanda sets a trap to exact her revenge.

It takes place in rural Armenia as well as Los Angeles and Las Vegas. It was filmed entirely in and around Los Angeles except for one weekend of filming in Las Vegas. It stands as the debut work for its director, screenwriter, producer and most of the cast, with the notable exception of Sally Kirkland. Plot The Bride from Vegas opens with what seems a completely different film. It looks like a low-budget Chinese action film. This turns out to be a film set, and the star of the non-existent film, Allison (Charlene Rose) gets fired. Mike (Mikael Sharafyan) is a young man living a simple life in rural Armenia with his parents. When his street-wise cousin shows him a photo of Las Vegas showgirls, Mike falls in love with one of them and decides to travel to America, find the girl in the photo and marry her. To raise the money he needs, he sells his pet cow. This is only after a decidedly one-sided conversation with the cow. Note ‚Äì as long as Mike is in Armenia, all actors speak Armenian and English subtitles are shown. His flight to Las Vegas is interrupted through a mishap, and he lands in Los Angeles. His travel across the desert is mostly filled with random characters, each building his idea of America. Once in Las Vegas, Mike runs into Allison and the search for the showgirl begins. At this point the romance truly starts and the film follows a standard \\"rom-com\\" structure. Production The film was filmed over a month with San Bernardino Valley, California standing in for Armenia, a warehouse near Van Nuys Airport serving as the opening scene, multiple restaurants in Glendale, California, and the jail/police station set in Anaheim, California.

To make the prophecy come true a secret sect of monks join an obsessed geneticist to artificially create the perfect specimens. Hugh Stanton and his daughter Lucy have lost his wife and her mother. This after having had a brief meeting with a mysterious Etruscan man. To knowledge only one rather poor picture of this man exists.

The British Royal Navy captured her in 1777. She grounded and was destroyed in 1780. South Carolina Navy In December 1775, South Carolina purchased a shallow-draft, coasting schooner and re-rigged her as a brigantine that they named Comet. She cruised against the British with some success. An escapee from Charlestown reported to the British on what vessels were in the harbour. One was a brig of 14 guns, a former letter of marque, that had been a prize to Comet.Crawford et al., (1996), vol. 10, p.558.

The mention in the London Gazette of Comets capture describes her as being on a cruise from South Carolina, armed for war, and under the command of James Pyne. It also gives her ownership as \\"Congress\\". Daphne sent Comet into New York. Another report refers to Comet as a privateer, of 18 guns and 84 or 87 men, and states that Daphne captured her off the Isle of Pines. Daphne landed her prisoners at Pensacola, where a handful escaped. Daphne and Comet, with a prize crew of 35 men, then cruised of the Charlestown bar. Comet, under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Drury, arrived at New York on 7 March 1778.Crawford et al., (2005), vol. 11, p.558. Royal Navy The Royal Navy took Comet into service. At some point the Navy had Comet cut down to a galley. then towed her to Savannah, Georgia to operate from there. On 16 April 1779, the armed sloop , Comet, and two other galleys, Thunder and Hornet, captured the two Georgia navy galleys ‚Äì Lee and Congress ‚Äì near Yamasee Bluff on the Savannah River. Congress was armed with one 18-pounder and one 12-pounder gun in her prow, and two 6-pounder and two 9-pounder guns in her wales. She had 100 men aboard including South Carolinian troops. Congress became , under Lieutenant George Prince. Lee was armed with one 12 and one 9-pounder gun in her prow, and two 4-pounder and two 1-pounder guns in her wales. She had 130 French men aboard. Lee became , under the command of Mr. Edward Ellis Watmough. Comet and the galley Snake may have been at Wappoo, where they protected Lt. Col. John Maitland's retreat, enabling him to reach Savannah with his troops just in time to reinforce it before the commencement of the Franco-American Siege of Savannah. To protect Savannah, the Royal Navy contributed two over-age frigate: Fowey and . They landed their guns and most of their men to reinforce the land forces. In addition, the British also deployed the armed brig and the armed ship , the latter from the East Florida navy. There were two galleys, Comet and Thunder, the latter too from East Florida. Lastly, the British armed two merchant vessels, Savannah, and Venus. On 19 September, as Charles-Marie de Trolong du Rumain moved his squadron up the river, he exchanged fire with Comet, Thunder, Savannah, and Venus. Rose was leaking badly so the next day the British scuttled her just below the town to impede the French vessels from progressing further. They also burnt Savannah and Venus. By scuttling Rose in a narrow part of the channel, the British effectively blocked it. Consequently, the French fleet was unable to assist the American assault. Germaine took up a position to protect the north side of Savannah's defenses. Comet and Thunder had the mission of opposing any attempt by the South Carolinian galleys to bombard the town. Over the next few days British shore batteries assisted Comet and Thunder in engagements with two South Carolinian galleys; during one of these they severely damaged Revenge. On 17 October the Franco-American force abandoned the siege. Comet participated in the Siege of Charleston in 1780. She was under the command of Lieutenant Samuel McKinley. Fate On 29 April 1780 Comet ran aground at the entrance to the Hog Island Channel. The Americans had built a redoubt on Haddrell's Point to control access to the channel, and Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot needed to neutralize it if he was to move his vessels into the Cooper River to support General Sir Henry Clinton's planned attack on the Charles Town neck. Comet attacked the redoubt but the American's were able to destroy her when she became unable to escape.The Revolutionary War In Mount Pleasant, South Carolina: Haddrell's Point Recoubt.

In Queensland it is with the locality of Birdsville in the Shire of Diamantina. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012.  History  Poeppel Corner was marked in 1880 during the official survey of the western section of the border between Queensland and South Australian undertaken in 1879-1880. It defines the most westerly corner between Queensland and South Australia. Its marking was a surveying feat of its time. Letters Patent issued by Queen Victoria in June 1859 separated the new Colony of Queensland from New South Wales (NSW). They described Queensland's border as the watershed from Point Danger (28¬∞8\\"S) west to the Dumaresq River; the Dumaresq, Macintyre and Barwon Rivers to latitude 29 degrees South; and along latitude 29 degrees South to the 141st meridian of East longitude, which was the eastern boundary of South Australia. Although legal opinion advised that the 141st meridian was the western boundary of Queensland, Surveyor-General Augustus Charles Gregory believed otherwise. In a memorandum of 28 September 1860 he wrote: > \\"the western boundary ... appears to be the 141st meridian; but it is > probable that it was not described in the Letters Patent erecting the > Colony, with greater distinctness, expressly with a view to a future > adjustment, when more certain information should have been collected as to > the natural features of the country... It is now submitted that the 141st > meridian passes through the tract of country known as the \`Plains of > Promise\\" and that the Eastern shore [of the Gulf of Carpentaria] possesses > no harbours. It would therefore be desirable to adopt the 138th meridian as > the boundary; as that line would pass through a barren tract of country, and > bring 'Investigator's Road' [an anchorage] within the limits of Queensland.\\" Furthermore, expeditions in 1861-1862 funded by the South Australian, Victorian and Queensland governments to rescue the missing explorers Burke and Wills, who had failed to return from a journey from Cooper Creek to the Gulf of Carpentaria, led to the exploration of an enormous area of the inland and were predicted to stimulate interest in this previously unknown tract of land beyond Queensland's western boundary. Writing to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 5 September 1861, the Queensland Governor George Bowen indicated his colony's willingness to protect any settlers so attracted, provided that the western boundary could be extended to include the Gulf. The proposal was accepted on condition that the additional territory could be reclaimed later should another colony be formed in northern Australia. In response, a despatch dated 14 December 1861 from the Secretary of State for the Colonies advised that the proposed annexation to the 138th Meridian of longitude should be revoked under Act 24 and 25 Victoria, c.44. This immediately provoked a despatch from Sir George Bowen, dated 18 January 1862, stating that Queensland had taken provisional control of this area. Subsequently, on 12 April 1862 Letters Patent were issued describing the accession of \\"so much of our Colony of New South Wales as lies to the northward of the 26th parallel of south latitude and between the 141st and 138th meridian of east longitude...\\". Thereby two more corners in Queensland's western boundary were created and the colony acquired part of the Barkly Tableland and the area which later became the Mount Isa mineral field. A revised definition of the extent of Queensland was subsequently proclaimed on 23 June 1862. In July 1862 Sir Charles Nicholson reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that: \\"On the west, the whole of the basin of the 'Barcoo' for several hundred miles, as far as the 142nd meridian of East longitude, is becoming rapidly occupied by squatters, and the authorised possession of the greater part of it has already, I believe, been secured under pastoral licenses...'. Pastoralists began settling the Cooper and Bulloo country and the adjacent portion of South Australia in 1864 with Bulloo Downs being the first run in the Bulloo area. By the end of the decade the Cooper country was also settled. During the 1870s, settlement extended west to the Diamantina, Mulligan and Georgina areas. In 1873, the pastoral districts were named - Gregory South comprised the Bulloo and lower Cooper area and the remainder became Gregory North. Initially runs in both districts were stocked with cattle and sheep. By 1885 all available land in Queensland's far south- west had been claimed. This land, comprising the floodplains of the Mulligan, Georgina, Diamantina and Bulloo Rivers and Cooper Creek, which form part of a vast inland drainage system originating in Queensland's central west and north-west and eventually reaching Lake Eyre, became known as Channel Country. During floods, the semi-arid region becomes a network of channels, watering cattle-fattening grasslands. Agitation by pastoralists in the Cooper region for surveying of the border because of uncertainty as to its position began in the 1870s. In 1877 James McLeod, the new owner of Cullamurra run, applied to the South Australian Commissioner of Crown Lands to have the colony's border surveyed urgently, after finding himself in dispute with his eastern neighbour John Conrick of Nappa Merrie over their station boundaries. Another factor in the determination of Queensland's borders was the collection of customs duties at the border and establishment of border customs offices. Inter-colonial border duties were introduced in Australia in the 1850s, after the Murray River became the boundary between New South Wales and Victoria. Their introduction demonstrated that the Australian colonies were developing in divergent and independent ways. As each new colony was declared, it established its own customs administration, which was responsible for the collection of lucrative custom duties and the prevention of smuggling. As the western regions of the colony developed and internal trade routes were established, custom facilities were required along the borders with New South Wales and South Australia. In mid-1862, the Queensland Government had assented to the provisions of the New South Wales Border Customs Act, introduced to provide for a mutual Queensland-New South Wales system of collecting customs duties payable on goods crossing their shared border. Queensland's Customs Duties Act 1870 provided the colony with independent legislation to regulate the collection of duties on goods imported from other colonies. A small Customs Border Patrol consisting of a police inspector, sub-inspector and four constables was appointed with powers to collect duties from 1 January 1871. They travelled along the Queensland-New South Wales border, collecting duties and keeping careful records regarding the type and value of goods and the amount of monies collected. They also recommended 11 sites suitable for custom offices and these were later established. Those near the South Australian border were at Betoota, Birdsville and Oontoo. The marking of the Queensland- South Australian border was undertaken in 1879-1880 by the South Australian Government as the final section of a survey of its border on the 141st meridian, which had started at the Murray River. William Barron was the surveyor chosen to undertake the border survey, but after surveying from the Murray River to Cameron Corner then north to Cooper Creek, his health failed and he was forced to return to Adelaide. Augustus Poeppel, circa 1880 Lawrence Wells, circa 1890 Surveyor Augustus Poeppel took over the survey in January 1880, assisted by Lawrence Wells. He arrived at the survey camp at Innamincka on 3 February 1880, spent the following month taking observations and preparing rations and equipment, then on 5 March, with two months' rations and the animals in good condition, the survey team returned to work. They continued the line to the 26th parallel where they met their Queensland colleague Alexander Hutchinson Salmond. Together the surveyors took star observations for latitude to fix the position at 26 degrees S and 141 degrees E (now known as Haddon Corner, named after the nearby pastoral lease). After marking the corner they continued the survey line marking the border with mileposts recording the distance from the surveying starting point at the Murray River. Then on 30 June 1880 Poeppel and his survey party began the westward survey along the 26th parallel, running a series of 10-mile chords and setting the mileposts on the arc of the parallel by calculated offsets. They experienced many hardships on this section of the survey traversing Australia's most inhospitable country - the vast waterless plains of the Sturt Stony Desert and the salt lakes and sand hills of the Simpson Desert. Their diet was salt beef and damper causing all to develop scurvy. They relied on Aboriginal people to guide them to wells as water was so scarce. They reached the final corner at 26 degrees South 138 degrees East, marking it with a timber post by the end of 1880. Drought forced them to return to Adelaide. Later the South Australian Triangulation Survey reached the border and on checking the mileposts, discovered an error in chainage and the corner post was relocated from the salt lake, Lake Poeppel, to its foreshore. Starting in 1883 Poeppel and Wells began the survey of the Queensland- South Australian border along meridian 141 degrees E. Augustus Poeppel was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1839, the son of an architect. Emigrating with his family in 1849, he settled in South Australia before moving to Victoria to become a mining surveyor and architect. In 1878, after short periods in New Zealand and Western Australia, Poeppel joined the South Australian Lands Department and was soon appointed to the border surveys. During the Queensland- Northern Territory border survey, from the 142-mile post, he suffered from trachoma and lost in weight, forcing his withdrawal in July 1885. His health was broken and he later lost sight in one eye. He retired to Melbourne where he died in 1891 aged 52. Lawrence Wells, born in 1860 in South Australia, entered that colony's Survey Department in 1878. In the following year, at the age of 23, he joined the border surveys, eventually assisting with almost the entire survey of the Queensland-South Australian- Northern Territory borders, completed in 1886. Later Wells became a well-known explorer, known as \\"the last of the great inland explorers\\". In 1891-92 he accompanied the Elder Scientific Exploring Expedition, which discovered the East Murchison goldfield; in 1896 he led the Calvert Scientific Exploring Expedition, investigating northern Western Australia; and in 1903 he led South Australia's North-West Prospecting Expedition. Later Wells held administrative positions in the state and federal public services, and was appointed Order of the British Empire in 1937. Since the nineteenth century, various explorers of the Simpson Desert have included a visitation to Poeppel Corner. In 1883 the corner was visited by another South Australian surveyor, Charles Winnecke who, after departing from Farina in northern South Australia, headed north-west to Poeppel Corner, later exploring the south-eastern and north- eastern sections of the desert to assess its pastoral potential. Although disappointed with his findings, he travelled deeper into the desert than anyone before him. The next explorer to visit Poeppel Corner came many years later. In 1936, Edmund Albert (Ted) Colson, a pastoralist of Blood Creek Station, near Abminga, in northern South Australia, became the first European to cross the Simpson Desert. Colson crossed from west to east, travelling along the 26th parallel from Mount Etingambara, hoping to locate the Poeppel Corner post and then follow the border mileposts to Birdsville. However, on his eastward journey, Colson missed the post by , but located it on his return journey. To record his passing, he photographed it and nailed a tin plate to it bearing the date and his initials. Other explorations across Simpson Desert, notably those by David Lindsay in 1886 and Cecil Madigan in 1939, came close by Poeppel Corner but did not actually visit it. So, it was not until the 1960s that it was visited again, in a series of vehicular crossings made by Dr Reg Sprigg of Geosurveys Australia. By that time the original corner post had deteriorated due to white ants and dry rot, prompting Sprigg to take it to Adelaide for conservation treatment.' The area was opened up to scientific investigation and tourism by the Sprigg expeditions, together with a well-publicised crossing made in 1966 by the Leyland Brothers which proved that the Simpson Desert was accessible to four-wheel drive vehicles. In 1967 a large part of the desert became protected with the proclamation of South Australia's Simpson Desert National Park (now Munga-Thirri‚ÄîSimpson Desert Conservation Park) and Queensland's Simpson Desert National Park (now Munga-Thirri National Park); the latter being extended in 1983. By this time, interest in the desert was increasing, with many people visiting Poeppel Corner. In 1986 the Friends of the Simpson Desert Conservation Park was formed in South Australia to assist with the park's conservation. In 1989 the group erected a replica of the original post at Poeppel Corner. Poeppel Corner is a well-known tourist destination today. Given the enormous physical difficulties which the surveyors faced in the task, their survey of the Queensland-South Australian border was impressive. Today, Global Positioning System (GPS) can pinpoint place by longitude and latitude more accurately. It is now apparent that the intended corner between Queensland and South Australia at 26 degrees S 138 degrees E was not achieved. The Poeppel Corner post does not correlate with the confluence of 26 degrees South 138 degrees East as was originally intended. However, the Queensland Boundaries Declaratory Act 1982 confirmed \\"that each land boundary of the State ... as ... defined in the Letters Patent ... by reference to a parallel of latitude or a meridian of longitude is and always has been the boundary ... permanently fixed by marking it upon on the surface of the earth before 1900...\\". The corner post as a survey mark is protected under the Survey and Mapping Infrastructure Act 2003 and the Survey and Mapping Infrastructure Regulation 2004 whereby a person must not interfere with a survey mark unless certain conditions are met.  Description  Poeppel Corner Survey Marker is at the westernmost of Queensland's three south-western corners located at the intersection of the Queensland, South Australia and Northern Territory borders, near Lake Poeppel - a salt lake. It is approximately west of Haddon Corner and north-west of Cameron Corner. The survey marker is within the Simpson Desert, a vast region in which linear dunes are the main landscape feature. The confluence of 26 degrees S 138 degrees E is between Lake Poeppel (immediately to the west) and a linear dune that trends SSE-NNW a little over half a kilometre to the east. There is a discrepancy of several hundred metres between the specified latitude and longitude and the officially mapped border. Land on the Queensland side of the border is in the Munga-Thirri National Park while the South Australian side is part of the Munga-Thirri‚ÄîSimpson Desert Conservation Park.  Heritage listing  Poeppel Corner Survey Marker was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Poeppel Corner (1880), marking the south- western extension of Queensland's border with South Australia, is important in demonstrating the priority placed on clear border demarcation by the governments of Queensland and South Australia. Set borders were an important part of colonial economic and administrative development, providing certainty for governments and pastoralists, and enabling the collection of customs duties. Poeppel Corner is the result of early cooperation between Australian colonies and provides lasting evidence of the feat of endurance which marking the Queensland-South Australia border involved. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. Poeppel Corner represents the culmination of a difficult feat of geodetic surveying and is an early application of this branch of surveying in Queensland. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Poeppel Corner is important to the Australian community as a geographical and cultural landmark, and is a well-known tourist attraction. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Poeppel Corner has an important association with the life and career of Augustus Poeppel (1839-91) and Lawrence Allen Wells (1860-1938), who later surveyed the Queensland-Northern Territory border and whose work contributed to the opening-up of outback Australia for European settlement.

Aborted takeoff The United States Air Force (USAF) Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-52D Stratofortress (serial number 55-0103) of the 4252d Strategic Wing had a full bomb load and broke up and caught fire after the aircraft aborted takeoff at Kadena Air Base while it was conducting an Operation Arc Light bombing mission to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Thousands of artillery projectiles at Chibana Army Ammunition Depot, February 1969 Tens of thousands of artillery projectiles at Chibana Army Ammunition Depot, September 1969 Resultant fire and explosion The fire resulting from the aborted takeoff ignited the aircraft's fuel and detonated the bomb load of twenty-four bombs, (twelve under each wing) and forty two bombs inside the bomb bay and caused a blast so powerful that it created an immense crater under the burning aircraft some deep and across. The blast blew out the windows in the dispensary at Naha Air Base (now Naha Airport), away and damaged 139 houses. Recovery and investigation The aircraft was reduced \\"to a black spot on the runway\\" The blast was so large that Air Force spokesman had to announce that there had only been conventional bombs on board. Nothing remained of the aircraft except landing gear and engine assemblies, the tail turret, a few bombs, and some loose explosive that had not detonated. Very small fragments of aircraft metal from the enormous blast were \\"spread like confetti,\\" leaving the crew to use a double entendre to refer to the cleanup work, calling it, \\"'52 Pickup.\\" The Electronic Warfare Officer and the Crew Chief later died from burn injuries after being evacuated from Okinawa. Two Okinawan workers were also injured in the blasts. Had the aircraft become airborne, it might have crashed about north of the runway and directly into the Chibana ammunition storage depot. The Chibana depot stored ammunition, bombs, high explosives, and tens of thousands artillery shells and is now known to have held warheads for 19 different atomic and thermonuclear weapons systems in the hardened weapon storage areas. The weapons included W28 warheads used in the MGM-13 Mace cruise missile and W31 warheads used in MGR-1 Honest John and MIM-14 Nike-Hercules (Nike-H) missiles. The storage depot at Chibana also included 52 igloos in the Project Red Hat chemical weapons storage area and presumably Project 112's biological Agents.Organizational History- 267th Chemical Company, Letter of Capt. Charles H. Vogeler RIBCD-267CML (March 26, 1966) The crash led to demands to remove the B-52s from Okinawa and strengthened a push for the reversion from U.S. rule in Okinawa. Okinawans had correctly suspected that the Chibana depot held nuclear weapons. The crash sparked fears that another potential disaster on the island could put the chemical and nuclear stockpile and the surrounding population in jeopardy and increased the urgency of moving them to a less populated and less active storage location.

History Supermarket Direct was founded by Adrian Flanagan and Dominick Scott-Flanagan, and launched in October 1995. The deal with Sainsbury's made Sainsbury's the first major grocery store in the UK to provide home shopping. At the launch, customers could select from a catalogue of 1,700 proprietary branded groceries, and telephone or fax their order to a call centre. Orders received before 6pm could be delivered within a two-hour period the following day. Following a relaunch in 1996 a further 800 Sainsbury's-branded groceries were added to the catalogue, and by November 1998 over 4,000 products were available including Flanagan's own label products. Delivery was charged for, initially at ¬£4, later at ¬£5. Running a small fleet of 12 vans, by the start of 1997 the company had 5,000 regular customers and was taking 170 orders per day. Somerfield bought Supermarket Direct in April 1999 for ¬£3.25 million, and Supermarket Direct partners Dominick Scott-Flanagan and David Noble joined the Somerfield Direct board.

Background  1982 CIA map of East Africa with Seychelles in the center The Republic of Seychelles achieved independence on 29 June 1976. James Mancham was president and France-Albert Ren√© was prime minister, but relations between the two quickly soured. In 1977 Ren√©'s leftist supporters launched an armed coup while Mancham was in London. Though Ren√© denied any responsibility, he assumed the presidency in June. Two plots were formulated the following year to depose him, but they failed. In 1979 his party won an election and he pursued a socialist agenda, upsetting the small but influential middle class population. His reign also saw the withdrawal of South Africa's landing rights as well as a deterioration of economic ties between the two countries. Ren√© frequently warned that sympathizers of the old government were conspiring to use mercenaries to stage a counter-coup. Most of his critics dismissed the alleged plots as exaggerated or even fabricated excuses to jail political opponents. In 1978 the deposed Mancham approached the South African government through Seychelles exiles to garner support for a counter-coup. The South African government was willing to set aside a small number of special forces for a plot, but directed Mancham's representative to Mike Hoare. \\"Mad\\" Mike Hoare had served as a mercenary during the Congo Crisis and, at the time, had retired to Hilton, KwaZulu-Natal and was living as a stock broker and investment manager. He agreed to lead the coup. = Planning = South African officials organized the coup under the code name \\"Operation Angela\\". As plans developed, an internal struggle emerged between the Defence Intelligence Division (SADF-ID) and the National Intelligence Service (NIS) over which agency would be responsible for the operation. In the end, SADF was given charge of the plot but an NIS agent, Martin Dolinchek, was appointed to be a liaison officer with the task force. Seychellois exiles G√©rard Hoarau, Paul Chow, and Edie Camille helped orchestrate the coup plot. Hoare determined that bringing in weapons via boat was, in spite of its effectiveness, too expensive a method to carry out. Hoare managed to assemble a force of 54 white putschists (himself included). Of these, 27 were members of the South African Defence Force, 9 ex-Rhodesian soldiers, 7 ex-Congo mercenaries, 1 NIS agent (Dolinchek), and 3 civilians. Hoare also advised that US$5 million be raised for the operation, but only US$300,000 was garnered. The rest of the mercenaries' salaries would come from the Seychelles Treasury. Nine of Hoare's team were sent to the island of Mah√©, Seychelles in advance. They were to identify potential targets and rally support from dissident Seychellois soldiers. The rest would arrive on a chartered Royal Swazi National Airways plane in the afternoon of 25 November 1981 disguised as vacationing rugby players and members of a charitable beer drinking club. They took the name of their beer club ‚ÄìYe Ancient Order of Froth-Blowers (AOFB)‚Äì from a London society that had been defunct since the 1930s. As part of their cover, the mercenaries disguised as AOFB members filled their baggage with toys that were to be supposedly distributed to local orphanages. In reality, these were meant to conceal the weight of AK-47 rifles hidden under the false bottoms of each item of luggage. Hoare ensured that the toys were as bulky as possible to best suit the purpose. The putschists' plan was to arrive on Mah√©, rendezvous with the advance team, and disperse around the island to various hotels. They were to wait for several days until Ren√© would be holding a cabinet meeting in the Maison du Peuple during which time they would launch their coup. They would seize the government, the airport, the radio station, police station, the army camp at Pointe La Rue, and other strategic locations. From the radio station they would broadcast that they had taken power on behalf of Mancham. The Seychellois exiles had assured the putschists that they would have the assistance of a 400-strong \\"local resistance force\\", but none existed.  Coup attempt  Seychelles International Airport, the site of the abortive coup At 17:30 on 25 November 1981, Hoare and 43 mercenaries flew into Seychelles International Airport at Pointe La Rue on Mah√©. All but two of the putschists had made it through customs when a security supervisor began a thorough search of the luggage of a mercenary, discovering an AK-47. Realising their cover was blown, the mercenaries produced their weapons. One security guard ran towards the office to request assistance. The guard reached the office, bolted the door, and successfully raised the alarm, beginning a six-hour gun battle at the airport. About 70 present airport staff were taken hostage by the mercenaries. President Ren√© was in his residence when he received a phone call about the incident at the airport. He immediately put the island on alert, calling all police and militia into service and imposing a 24-hour curfew. Colonel Ogilvy Berlouis, the chief of the Defence Force, was ordered to secure the airport and prevent the mercenaries from escaping. The number of mercenaries was unknown to the Seychellois, as was the fact of whether the attack at the airport was supposed to coincide with a seaborne invasion. Hoare's men erected a roadblock on the north end of the airport and mounted an unsuccessful attack on the Pointe La Rue Barracks in which one mercenary was wounded. Seychellois forces, with two armoured vehicles, occupied the airstrip, confining the putschists to the airport's buildings. They also fired upon the chartered aircraft, disabling it. One of the armoured vehicles made its way to the terminal forecourt, but the lights were out in the building and the driver had difficulty spotting the mercenaries. The vehicle's tires were quickly shot out and it was set ablaze by a Molotov cocktail. 2nd Lieutenant David Antat, the vehicle's commander, emerged from the top and engaged the mercenaries. They surrounded the vehicle and shot Antat several times in the chest, killing him. While the fighting was underway, Air India Flight 224 (a Boeing 707) en route from Salisbury (now Harare) to Bombay (now Mumbai) carrying 13 crew and 65 passengers closed in to land for a scheduled refueling. The mercenaries, having just seized the control tower, gave permission for it to land. Berlouis was afraid that the plane might be carrying mercenary reinforcements. He ordered trucks to block the runway while flares were fired to direct the pilot to disengage. At that point the plane was too committed to the landing to pull up and proceeded to land. Despite the lack of runway lighting, the pilot managed to maneuver the aircraft around the trucks, though it sustained superficial damage to its right wing. Seychellois forces began firing in the direction of the Boeing, spreading worry among some of the mercenaries who saw the aircraft as their only means of escape. The putschists then boarded the flight and mercenary Peter Duffy asked Captain Umesh Saxena to take them to Zimbabwe. After some negotiation, Saxena agreed to fly them to Durban, South Africa. Five mercenaries, NIS agent Dolinchek (under the alias Anton Lubic), and one female civilian accomplice were left behind and arrested. Six of them had been part of the advance team. One mercenary had been killed and two wounded. One Seychellois soldier was killed and a police sergeant was wounded.  Aftermath  Hoare later authored a book on the coup attempt, entitled The Seychelles Affair. After the event David Antat became a Seychelles national hero.

They produce little or no tailpipe emissions, reduce dependence on petroleum and also have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and health effects from air pollution, depending on the source of electricity used to charge them and other factors. Electric motors are significantly more efficient than internal combustion engines and thus, even accounting for typical power plan efficiencies and distribution losses, less energy is required to operate an EV. Producing batteries for electric cars requires additional resources and energy, so they may have a larger environmental footprint from the production phase. EVs also generate different impacts in their operation and maintenance. EVs are typically heavier and could produce more tire, brake, and road dust, but their regenerative braking could reduce brake particulate pollution. EVs are mechanically simpler, which reduces the use and disposal of engine oil. Advantages and disadvantages Battery electric cars have several environmental benefits over conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), such as: * Elimination of harmful tailpipe pollutants such as various oxides of nitrogen, which kill thousands of people every year * The potential for a significant reduction in emissions. However, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the emission intensity of the power sources used to charge the vehicle, the efficiency of the said vehicle and the energy wasted in the charging process. For mains electricity the emission intensity varies significantly per country and within a particular country, and on the demand, the availability of renewable electricity and the efficiency of the occasional fossil fuel-based generation, less and less used. Plug-in hybrids capture most of these benefits when they are operating in all-electric mode. Electric cars have some disadvantages, such as: * Reliance on rare-earth elements such as neodymium, lanthanum, terbium, and dysprosium, and other critical metals such as lithium and cobalt, though the quantity of rare metals used differs per car. Though Rare Earth metals are plentiful in the Earth's crust, only a few miners hold exclusivity to access those elements. * Possible increased particulate matter emissions from tires. This is sometimes caused by the fact that most electric cars have a heavy battery, which means the car's tires are subjected to more wear. The brake pads, however, can be used less frequently than in non-electric cars, if regenerative braking is available and may thus sometimes produce less particulate pollution than brakes in non-electric cars. Also, some electric cars may have a combination of drum brakes and disc brakes, and drum brakes are known to cause less particulate emissions than disc brakes. * pollution emitted in manufacturing, especially the increased amounts from producing batteries  Particulates  Like all cars electric cars give off particulate matter (PM) from road tyre and brake wear, and this contributes to respiratory disease. In the UK alone non-tailpipe PM (from all types of vehicle not just electric) may be responsible for between 7,000 and 8,000 premature deaths a year. However, lower fuel, operation, and maintenance costs of EVs could induce the rebound effect, releasing more particulates. Electricity generation for electric cars A solar energy charging station in North America Electric cars emit less greenhouse gas over their lifetime than fossil fuel cars, except possibly in a country with a very high proportion of oil or coal-fired electricity, such as Cyprus, Estonia and Poland. The size of the difference depends on distance driven as well as the source of the electricity, because the difference is mainly when the car is being driven rather then when it is being manufactured or recycled. For example, battery electric and hydrogen vehicles do not produce emissions at all when driven, but only if their energy comes from renewable electricity or low carbon sources like nuclear. Timing the charging process of electric vehicles according to the power generated by renewable power sources can increase the percentage of renewable energy in the electric grid. Article \\"EV CO2 emission\\" from homechargingstations.com Even when the power is generated using fossil fuels, electric vehicles usually, compared to gasoline vehicles, show significant reductions in overall well-to-wheels global carbon emissions due to the highly carbon-intensive production in mining, pumping, refining, transportation and the efficiencies obtained with gasoline. This means that even if part of the energy used to run an electric car comes from fossil fuels, electric cars will still contribute to reduce emissions, which is important since most countries' electricity is generated, at least in part, by burning fossil fuels. Researchers in Germany have claimed that, while there is some technical superiority of electric propulsion compared with conventional technology, in many countries the effect of electrification of vehicles' fleet emissions will predominantly be due to regulation rather than technology. The emissions of electrical grids can be expected to improve over time as more wind and solar generation is deployed. Many, but not most or all countries are introducing average emissions targets across all cars sold by a manufacturer, with financial penalties on manufacturers that fail to meet these targets. This has created an incentive for manufacturers, especially those selling many heavy or high-performance cars, to introduce electric cars and turbocharged cars as a means of reducing average fleet emissions. Air pollution and carbon emissions in various countries Electric cars have several benefits over conventional internal combust engine automobiles, reduction of local air pollution, especially in cities, as they do not emit harmful tailpipe pollutants such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit may only be local because, depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions may be shifted to the location of the generation plants. This is referred to as the long tailpipe of electric vehicles. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the emission intensity of the power sources used to charge the vehicle, the efficiency of the said vehicle and the energy wasted in the charging process. For mains electricity the emission intensity varies significantly per country and within a particular country, and on the demand, the availability of renewable sources and the efficiency of the fossil fuel- based generation used at a given time. Charging a vehicle using renewable energy (e.g., wind power or solar panels) yields very low carbon footprint- only that to produce and install the generation system (see Energy Returned On Energy Invested.) Even on a fossil-fueled grid, it's quite feasible for a household with solar panels to produce enough energy to account for their electric car usage, thus (on average) cancelling out the emissions of charging the vehicle, whether or not the panel directly charges it. Even when using exclusively grid electricity, introducing EVs comes with a major environmental benefits in most (EU) countries, except those relying on old coal fired power plants. So for example the part of electricity, which is produced with renewable energy is (2014) in Norway 99 percent and in Germany 30 percent. =United Kingdom= Sales of fossil-fuelled cars are expected to be ended in 2030, although existing ones will be allowed to remain on some public roads depending on local rules. One estimate in 2020 said that if all fossil-fuelled cars were replaced UK greenhouse gas emissions would fall by 12%. But because UK consumers can select their energy suppliers, it depends on how 'green' their chosen supplier is in providing energy into the grid. Two thirds of automobile contamination arise from tire, brake, and road dust, the UK government disclosed in July 2019. Particulate matter pollution continues to increase even with electric cars. =United States= Net electricity generation by energy source. Coal is no longer the predominate source of electricity in the U.S. Chart does not take into account roof top solar. According to a Union of Concerned Scientists study in 2018: > \\"Based on data on power plant emissions released in February 2018, driving > on electricity is cleaner than gasoline for most drivers in the US. Seventy- > five percent of people now live in places where driving on electricity is > cleaner than a 50 MPG gasoline car. And based on where people have already > bought EVs, electric vehicles now have greenhouse gas emissions equal to an > 80 MPG car, much lower than any gasoline-only car available.\\" =Germany= Some months in 2019 have seen more than 50% of all generation from renewable sources and is expected to rise further as coal generation is first used only for standby and slowly phased out. =France= In France, which has many nuclear power plants, emissions from electric car use would be about . Because of the stable nuclear production, the timing of charging electric cars has almost no impact on their environmental footprint. =Norway & Sweden= Since Norway and Sweden produce almost its entire electricity with carbon-free sources, emissions from driving an electric car are even lower, at about in Norway and in Sweden. Environmental impact of manufacturing Electric cars also have impacts arising from the manufacturing of the vehicle. Since battery packs are heavy, manufacturers work to lighten the rest of the vehicle. As a result, electric car components contain many lightweight materials that require a lot of energy to produce and process, such as aluminium and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers. Electric motors and batteries add to the energy of electric-car manufacture. There are two kinds of motors used by electric cars: permanent magnet motors (like the one found in the Tesla Model 3), and induction motors (like the one found on the Tesla Model S). Induction motors do not use magnets, but permanent magnet motors do. The magnets found in permanent magnet motors used in electric vehicles contain rare-earth metals which are used to increase the power output of these motors. The mining and processing of metals such as lithium, copper, and nickel requires much energy and it can release toxic compounds. In developing countries with weak legislation and/or enforcement thereof, mineral exploitation can increase risks further. As such, the local population may be exposed to toxic substances through air and groundwater contamination. New battery technologies may be needed to resolve those problems. Li-ion batteries recycling is rarely done in developing and developed countries. In fact, in 2017, only just 5% of lithium-ion batteries were actually recycled in the EU. A 2018 report by ADAC (which looked at vehicles running on various fuels, including gas, diesel, hybrid and electricity) stated that \\"no powertrain has the best climate balance, and the electric car is not always particularly climate-friendly compared to the internal combustion engine car.Electric, Gas, Diesel & Hybrid: Life Cycle Assessment Of Passenger Cars ‚Äî New ADAC Report At its website, ADAC mentions that a big problem in Germany is the fact that much of the produced electricity comes from coal-fired power plants, and that electric cars are only climate-friendly when equipped with regeneration.Klima- Studie: Elektroautos brauchen die Energiewende Several reports have found that hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and all-electric cars generate more carbon emissions during their production than current conventional vehicles but still have a lower overall carbon footprint over the full life cycle. The initial higher carbon footprint is due mainly to battery production. In 2017, a report made by IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute also calculated that the emissions of lithium-ion batteries (present in many electric cars today) are in the order of 150‚Äì200 kilos of carbon dioxide equivalents per kilowatt-hour battery. Half of the emissions (50%) comes from cell manufacturing, whereas mining and refining contributes only a small part of the emissions. In practice, emissions in the order of 150‚Äì200 kilos of carbon dioxide equivalents per kilowatt-hour means that an electric car with a 100kWh battery will thus have emitted 15‚Äì20 tons of carbon dioxide even before the vehicle ignition is turned on. However, Popular Mechanics calculates that even if the 15‚Äì20 tons estimate is correct, it would only take 2.4 years of driving for the electric car with a 100kWh battery to recover the greenhouse emissions from the battery manufacturing. Furthermore, two other studies suggest a 100kWh battery would generate about 6-6.4 tons of emissions, so significantly less than what the IVL study claims. . However, in December 2019, IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute updated their 2017 study, reducing their estimate to 61-106 kg CO2-eq per kWh of battery capacity, with potential to go even lower. The new study therefore shows carbon emissions from battery production are 2-3 times less intensive than previously reported, questioning studies that had taken the 2017 figure to prove EV were not better than ICE cars on life-cycle assessments. Citing the 2019 study: > \\"The apparent decrease in total GWP [Global Warming Potential] from the 2017 > report (150-200kg CO2-eq/kWh battery capacity) to 61-106kg CO2-eq/kWh > battery capacity is partly due to that this report includes battery > production with nearly fossil free electricity use which is the main reason > for the decrease in the lowest value. The lowering of the high value is > mainly due to improved efficiency in cell production. Another reason for a > decrease is that the emissions from recycling are not included in the new > range. They were about 15kg CO2-eq/kWh battery capacity in the 2017 report.\\" A 2020 study from Eindhoven University of Technology mentioned that the manufacturing emissions of batteries of new electric cars are much smaller then what was assumed in the IVL study (around 75 kg CO2/kwh) and that the lifespan of lithium batteries is also much longer then previously thought (at least 12 years with a mileage of 15000 km annually). As such, they are more ecological then gasoline-powered internal combustion cars. Comparing the lifetime greenhouse gas emissions of electric cars with the emissions of cars using gasoline or diesel  Raw material availability and supply security  Common technology for plug-in hybrids and electric cars is based on the lithium-ion battery and an electric motor which uses rare-earth elements. The demand for lithium and other specific elements (such as neodymium, boron and cobalt) required for the batteries and powertrain is expected to grow significantly due to the future sales increase of plug-in electric vehicles in the mid and long term. , the Toyota Prius battery contains more than of the rare-earth element lanthanum, and its motor magnets use neodymium and dysprosium. While only of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) are required in a smartphone and in a tablet computer, electric vehicles and stationary energy storage systems for homes, businesses or industry use much more lithium in their batteries. a hybrid electric passenger car might use of LCE, while one of Tesla's high performance electric cars could use as much as . Some of the largest world reserves of lithium and rare-earth metals are located in countries with strong resource nationalism or unstable governments raising concerns about the risk of replacing dependence on foreign oil with a new dependence on hostile countries to supply strategic materials. in \\"Plug-in Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?\\" ;Lithium The Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia is one of the largest known lithium reserves in the world. The main deposits of lithium are found in China and throughout the Andes mountain chain in South America. In 2008 Chile was the leading lithium metal producer with almost 30%, followed by China, Argentina, and Australia. Published on Forbes Magazine dated November 24, 2008. In the United States lithium is recovered from brine pools in Nevada. Nearly half the world's known reserves are located in Bolivia, and according to the US Geological Survey, Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni desert has 5.4 million tons of lithium. See page 95. Other important reserves are located in Chile, China, and Brazil. Since 2006 the Bolivian government have nationalized oil and gas projects and is keeping a tight control over mining its lithium reserves. Already the Japanese and South Korean governments, as well as companies from these two countries and France, have offered technical assistance to develop Bolivia's lithium reserves and are seeking to gain access to the lithium resources through a mining and industrialization model suitable to Bolivian interests. According to a 2011 study conducted at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of lithium should not be a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles, as the study estimated that on the order of 1 billion 40 kWh Li- based batteries (about 10 kg of lithium per car) could be built with current reserves, as estimated by the U.S. Geological Survey. Another 2011 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company found that there are sufficient lithium resources to support global demand until 2100, including the lithium required for the potential widespread use of hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles. The study estimated global lithium reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period analyzed at 12‚Äì20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates. A 2016 study by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) found that availability of lithium and other finite materials used in the battery packs will not be a limiting factor for the adoption of electric vehicles. BNEF estimated that battery packs will require less than 1% of the known reserves of lithium, nickel, manganese, and copper through 2030, and 4% of the world's cobalt. After 2030, the study states that new battery chemistries will probably shift to other source materials, making packs lighter, smaller, and cheaper. See embedded video. ;Rare-earth elements China has 48% of the world's reserves of rare-earth elements, the United States has 13%, and Russia, Australia, and Canada have significant deposits. Until the 1980s, the U.S. led the world in rare-earth production, but since the mid-1990s China has controlled the world market for these elements. The mines in Bayan Obo near Baotou, Inner Mongolia, are currently the largest source of rare-earth metals and are 80% of China's production. In 2010 China accounted for 97% of the global production of 17 rare-earth elements. Since 2006 the Chinese government has been imposing export quotas reducing supply at a rate of 5% to 10% a year. Prices of several rare-earth elements increased sharply by mid-2010 as China imposed a 40% export reduction, citing environmental concerns as the reason for the export restrictions. These quotas have been interpreted as an attempt to control the supply of rare-earths. However, the high prices have provided an incentive to begin or reactivate several rare-earth mining projects around the world, including the United States, Australia, Vietnam, and Kazakhstan. Evolution of global rare-earth oxides production by country (1950‚Äì2000) In September 2010, China temporarily blocked all exports of rare-earths to Japan in the midst of a diplomatic dispute between the two countries. These minerals are used in hybrid cars and other products such wind turbines and guided missiles, thereby augmenting the worries about the dependence on Chinese rare-earth elements and the need for geographic diversity of supply. A December 2010 report published by the US DoE found that the American economy vulnerable to rare-earth shortages and estimates that it could take 15 years to overcome dependence on Chinese supplies. China raised export taxes for some rare-earths from 15 to 25%, and also extended taxes to exports of some rare-earth alloys that were not taxed before. The Chinese government also announced further reductions on its export quotas for the first months of 2011, which represent a 35% reduction in tonnage as compared to exports during the first half of 2010. In order to avoid its dependence on rare-earth minerals, Toyota Motor Corporation announced in January 2011 that it is developing an alternative motor for future hybrid and electric cars that does not need rare-earth materials. Toyota engineers in Japan and the U.S. are developing an induction motor that is lighter and more efficient than the magnet-type motor used in the Prius, which uses two rare-earths in its motor magnets. Other popular hybrids and plug-in electric cars in the market that use these rare-earth elements are the Nissan Leaf, the Chevrolet Volt and Honda Insight. For its second generation RAV4 EV due in 2012, Toyota is using an induction motor supplied by Tesla Motors that does not require rare-earth materials. The Tesla Roadster and the Tesla Model S use a similar motor.  Lower operational impacts and maintenance needs  Battery electric vehicles have lower maintenance costs compared to internal combustion vehicles, since electronic systems break down much less often than the mechanical systems in conventional vehicles, and the fewer mechanical systems on board last longer due to the better use of the electric engine. Electric cars do not require oil changes and other routine maintenance checks. Internal combustion engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion as most of the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%. in \\"Plug-in Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?\\"  See also  * NEV's and electric velomobiles: low-capacity battery electric vehiclesAre tiny electric cars the answer to big city pollution problems? * Converting existing vehicle to electric (see environmental impact of manufacturing) * Solar car: car powered by an electric motor, fed by a PV-panel; this does not have some of the disadvantages noted in this article * Fuel cell car: car powered by an electric motor, fed by a fuel cell; this may not have some of the disadvantages noted in this article (if not foreseen with an additional battery) * Induction motor: does not have permanent (rare-earth) magnetsInduction motors overview * Modal shift * Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles * Plug-in hybrid electric car: is a hybrid electric vehicle whose battery can be recharged by plugging it into an external source of electric power, as well by its on-board engine and generator.

They eventually settling in Gainesville, Georgia, where her father established a ministry. Bell's artistic training began at Gainesville's Brenau College, which was followed by studies at the University of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. At the latter, she won the Cresson Traveling Scholarship, the Second Toppan Prize and the Mary Smith Prize. Her diverse education included lessons at the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris, the Hans Hoffmann School of Fine Arts in Munich and Capri, and at Teachers College, Columbia University. Bell taught art for a time at Bergen College, and for nearly thirty years lived in New York City, where she was on the faculty of the Parsons School of Design. Periodically throughout her life, Bell would return to the South to sketch, paint, and find artistic inspiration. In addition to teaching and painting, she also penned a memoir, The Restless Bells, documenting her family's history from Reconstruction through World War II. The book was published in 1973. When her health began to decline after the book's completion, Bell relocated to Georgia, where she died in 1981. Bell's style was based on that of the Impressionists, but was informed by certain modernist sensibilities as well. She was known for her depictions both of the rural life of the southern United States and of the New York urban scene; she also produced portraits and still lifes, and worked in both oils and watercolor.

It has thin, fibrous bark, egg-shaped leaves, small white flowers and woody fruit. Description Leptospermum erubescens is a shrub that typically grows to a height of and has thin, fibrous bark that is shed in long strips. The young stems are thick, have soft hairs at first and spread widely apart from each other. The leaves are sessile, narrow to broadly egg-shaped, mostly long and wide. The flowers are borne singly or in pairs on the ends of short shoots that continue to grow after flowering. There are broad, reddish bracts and bracteoles at the base of the flower buds, the bracteoles falling off as the flowers develop. The flowers are white or pink, less than wide on a pedicel about long. The floral cup is hairy, long and the sepals are dark-coloured, about long with hairy edges. The petals are about long and the stamens in groups of three to five and long. Flowering occurs from July to October and the fruit is a woody capsule in diameter with the remains of the sepals attached. Taxonomy Leptospermum erubescens was first formally described in 1844 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Lehmann's Plantae Preissianae. The specific epithet (erubescens) is from Latin meaning \\"reddening\\" or \\"blushing\\", referring to the flowers. Distribution and habitat The roadside tea-tree grows on road verges, plains, in gullies and among rocky outcrops in heath and woodland. It is widespread in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain, Warren and Yalgoo biogeographic regions.

Lutterlough began working at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) as an elevator operator in the 1940s at a time when discriminatory hiring practices prevented African-Americans from working in a curatorial or scientific capacity at the Museum. In the late 1950s, after having gained extensive knowledge of the museum's exhibitions, she asked for and achieved a role in entomological work, eventually restoring hundreds of thousands of insects, classifying thousands. She co-identified 40 type specimens, specimens that stand as the representative example of the species. In 1979, a mite was named in her honor. Early life and education Lutterlough was born Sophie G. Mack in Washington, D.C., and had two sisters and a brother. She graduated from Dunbar High School in 1928 where she took classes in biology, near the top of her class. Career In 1943, Lutterlough applied for a job at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (NMNH). Racial barriers against African-Americans prevented her from direct employment in the museum's curatorial and science work. She was employed on a trial basis as an elevator operator - the first woman in that position at the Smithsonian - and held that position for 14 years, during which she studied the museum's exhibits on her lunch break and became \\"a one-women [sic] information bureau\\" to museum visitors. It was common for people without academic qualifications in science to become scientists through training and experience at the NMNH. Lutterlough started on that path in 1957, when she asked an insect curator, J.F. Gates Clark, if she could work in his department, and gained a position as insect preparator. This had happened in 1926 for at least one other African-American, Barry Hampton, who moved from being a mail clerk to working in the Division of Reptiles and Bachtrachians, although he was still classified as a laborer. Jeannine Smith Clark worked at the NMNH as a volunteer tour guide from the late 1960s, and Margaret Collins, an African-American zoology professor at Howard University, was a research associate at the NMNH from the late 1970s. There were no other African-Americans employed as scientists there in 1985. African-Americans were still greatly under-represented among entomologists in 2008, when only eight faculty members of 1,348 on U.S. websites could be identified as African-American. Lutterlough worked on identifying the NMNH's insect collection, becoming a research assistant within two years. For the next 24 years, she restored and classified many arthropods in the Myriapoda group, that includes centipedes and millipedes, as well as ticks and other species. The NMNH's 1963/64 annual report, for example, reported that she restored over 300,000 ticks in the preceding year. Lutterlough took college courses in science and writing, and studied German to support her development as an entomologist. Among her achievements were restoring 35,000 ticks, enabling her and her supervisor, Dr. Ralph Crabill, to identify 40 type specimens (a specimen that is the reference point for others in its species). She retired from NMNH after 40 years. Personal life In 1941, Lutterlough married Henry E. Lutterlough. Henry Lutterlough was a member of the Earl Reece Stadtman biochemistry laboratory at the National Institutes of Health. Lutterlough was widowed, and in 1999, she moved to live with her daughter in Monroe Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey. She was a member of the People's Congregational Church from 1960, and the first soprano in the choir. She joined the Cross of Glory Lutheran Church and its choir when she moved to New Jersey. Lutterlough died in Monroe Township on 11 February 2009, at the age of 98. Honors In 1979, a mite of the genus Pygmephorus was named for her. Pygmephorus lutterloughae is a large mite, described from a sample in the NMNH collection (No. 3782), collected in Oregon in 1970. In 1983 when she retired from the Smithsonian, Lutterlough was honored with an Exemplary Service award.

History Enescu began work on his Second Piano Quartet in July 1943. The first movement was finished on 27 July in Bucharest, the second movement on 27 August in Dorohoi, and the score was completed on 4 May 1944, at the composer's villa Lumini»ô, near Sinaia, all during the worst part of the war for Romania. Nevertheless, it contains some of his most tranquil music. The score is dedicated to the memory of his composition teacher, Gabriel Faur√© (; ). The first performance of the work was given at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, by the Albeneri Trio (Alexander Schneider, violin; Benar Heifetz, viola; Erich Itor Kahn, piano) with violist Milton Katims, on 31 October 1947, under the auspices of the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation. A rival contender for the premiere was a French radio broadcast performance by Yvonne Astruc, violin, Maurice Vieux, viola, Charles Bartsch, cello, with the composer at the piano, on 29 October, but almost certainly in 1948 rather than 1947 . Analysis The quartet is in three movements: * Allegretto moderato * Andante pensieroso ed espressivo * Con moto moderato ‚Äì Allegro agitato The first movement, in D minor, is in sonata-allegro form; the second, slow movement, in E major, is in a three-part song form, with introduction and coda; the finale is an agitated, rapid movement in free sonata form in D minor but ends with a coda in D major. Characteristically for Enescu, the quartet is built cyclically: The opening idea of the first movement generates the thematic substance of the whole quartet. Fragments or cells of this idea are found throughout, often transformed and integrated into the composition of other main themes .

The two teams have met 101 times since their first meeting in 1896, and Colgate‚ÄìCornell was the 17th most-played college football rivalry as of 2013. Cornell has played Colgate in football more times than any other opponent except Ivy League rivals Penn and Columbia. The series is tied 49‚Äì49‚Äì3, but Colgate has won 29 of 35 meetings since 1980. History Colgate University, located in Madison County, New York, and Cornell University, located in Tompkins County, New York, are less than 100 miles from each other. Their close proximity and membership in rival athletic conferences (the Patriot League and the Ivy League, respectively) contribute to the rivalry between the two schools. The Colgate and Cornell football teams met for the first time in Ithaca on September 26, 1896, a game that ended in a 6‚Äì0 victory for Cornell. Cornell would go on to win or tie the next 13 meetings until Colgate clinched its first win in the series, 13‚Äì7, in 1912. Cornell continued to dominate the series, compiling a 29‚Äì7‚Äì2 record against Colgate through 1951. Colgate took 9 of 13 meetings from 1952 through 1964, after which Cornell returned to dominance, winning 8 of 10 from 1965 through 1974. Since then, Colgate has held the advantage in the series, but Cornell's early dominance has rendered the all-time series record nearly even. The game is usually played in late September or early October and has alternated between Colgate's Andy Kerr Stadium in Hamilton, New York, and Cornell's Schoellkopf Field in Ithaca, New York, since 2009. The rivalry has been largely uninterrupted from its beginning in 1896, but the teams did not meet in 1909‚Äì10, 1915‚Äì16, 1918, and 1924‚Äì36. The Colgate‚ÄìCornell game has been annual since 1937, save for four exceptions in 1994, 1995, 1998, and 2012. Of the teams' more notable meetings, Colgate was Cornell's opponent when Cornell played its first-ever Friday night home game in 2015, which Colgate won 28‚Äì21. In 2016, the Big Red defeated the nationally-ranked Raiders in Hamilton, 39‚Äì38, after having trailed 28‚Äì5; it was the first time Cornell defeated a ranked team on the road since 1950.

It was founded by William L. Shannon and Stanley D. Wilson (de), both of which are alumni of Harvard University. The firm offers various geotechnical, geological and environmental services ranging from natural resource management to geophysical surveying for public and private sectors. The company‚Äôs markets include dams and levees, design and construction, energy, federal, industrial, property development, transportation, wastewater management, and waterfront facilities. However, over half of their work is devoted to retrofitting and performing safety investigations on transportation projects. Founding The firm is a manifestation of a revolution in civil engineering as a result of the birth of geotechnical engineering which became a new field by the mid 20th century. Radically new concepts were taking shape in soil and rock mechanics pioneered by Professor Arthur Casagrande, a leading figure in geotechnical engineering and who encouraged Shannon and Wilson to form a partnership. The professor and his colleagues, including the founders of the firm, were in the process of establishing the foundation of what later came to be known as geotechnical engineering. Staff In 1998, the firm peaked at 130 employees. However, with the introduction of the tax-cutting Initiative 695 and the recession after that, both of which slashed transportation funding, the number of employees was reduced to 90 and has never exceeded 100 staff for several years. However, the company has since grown to more than 300 employees in 11 offices nationwide. Events =Expansion= Although headquartered in Seattle, the firm has offices based in Richland, Portland, St. Louis, Fairbanks, Anchorage and Denver. The Denver office opened around 2000 to work on a nearby revamp of Interstate 25. =Lawsuits= In 2002, Shannon & Wilson became involved in a lawsuit as a result of property damage initiated by landslides in a residential area on Perkins Lane on top of Magnolia Hill. The court ended up ruling in favor of Shannon & Wilson however. Recognition For more than half a century, Shannon & Wilson has played a major role in the design and construction of renowned public and private projects in the Puget Sound region. In recognition of their achievements, each year Shannon & Wilson sponsors the Stanley D. Wilson Memorial Lecture at the University of Washington, the Stanley D. Wilson Fellowship at the University of Illinois, and the William L. Shannon Endowed Fellowship at the University of Washington.

The coverage here follows Diplomatic history of World War I and precedes Diplomatic history of World War II. The important stages of interwar diplomacy and international relations included resolutions of wartime issues, such as reparations owed by Germany and boundaries; American involvement in European finances and disarmament projects; the expectations and failures of the League of Nations; the relationships of the new countries to the old; the distrustful relations of the Soviet Union to the capitalist world; peace and disarmament efforts; responses to the Great Depression starting in 1929; the collapse of world trade; the collapse of democratic regimes one by one; the growth of economic autarky; Japanese aggressiveness toward China; Fascist diplomacy, including the aggressive moves by Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany; the Spanish Civil War; the appeasement of Germany's expansionist moves toward the Rhineland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, and the last, desperate stages of rearmament as another world war increasingly loomed.Norman Rich, Great Power Diplomacy since 1914 (2003) pp 70-248. Background Peace and disarmament There were no great wars in the 1920s. There were a few small wars on the periphery that generally ended by 1922 and did not threaten to escalate. The exceptions included the Russian Civil War of 1917-22, Polish‚ÄìSoviet War of 1919-21, the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-22, and some civil wars, such as in Ireland. Instead, the ideals of peace is a theme that dominated the foreign affairs of all major nations in the 1920s. British Labour leader and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald was especially articulate: > \\"So soon as you aim at a guarantee by a body like the League of Nations you > minimize and subordinate the military value of the pact and raise to a > really effective standard the moral guarantees that flow from Conciliation, > arbitration, impartial, and judicial judgment exercised by the body.\\" =League of Nations= The main institution intended to bring peace and stability and resolve disputes was the League of Nations, created in 1919. The League was weakened by the non-participation of the United States, Germany, and the Soviet Union, as well as (later) of Japan. It could not handle the refusal of major countries, especially Japan and Italy, to accept adverse decisions. Historians agree it was ineffective in major disputes.F.P. Walters, A History of the League of Nations (Oxford UP, 1965). Available for free on the site of the UN in Geneva library .C. L. Mowat, ed. The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 12: 1898-1945 (1968) pp 242-68. A series of international crises strained the League to its limits, the earliest being the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japan was censured and quit the League.Ian Hill Nish, Japan's Struggle with Internationalism: Japan, China, and the League of Nations, 1931-3 (Routledge, 1993). This was soon followed by the Abyssinian Crisis of 1934-36, in which Italy invaded Ethiopia (Abyssinia), one of the two independent African nations. The League tried to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weaknesses, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose it as a counterweight against Hitler's Germany. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany.George W. Baer, \\"Sanctions and security: The League of Nations and the Italian‚ÄìEthiopian war, 1935‚Äì1936.\\" International Organization 27#2 (1973): 165-179. The Abyssinian war showed the world how ineffective the League was at solving disputes. It played no role in dealing with the Spanish Civil War. The league also could not resolve other smaller conflicts involving major European nations, such as the Rif War between Spain and Morocco separatists.Pablo La Porte, \\"'Rien √† ajouter': The League of Nations and the Rif War (1921‚Äî1926),\\" European History Quarterly (2011) 41#1 pp 66‚Äì87, online =Disarmament= The Washington Naval Conference, also known as the Washington Arms Conference or the Washington Disarmament Conference, was a military conference called by U.S. President Warren G. Harding and held in Washington, under the Chairmanship of Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes from 12 November 1921 to 6 February 1922. Conducted outside the auspice of the League of Nations, it was attended by nine nations: the United States, Japan, China, France, Great Britain, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Portugal. Soviet Russia was not invited. The conference focused on resolving misunderstandings or conflicts regarding interests in the Pacific Ocean and East Asia. The main achievement was a series of naval disarmament postals agreed to by all the participants, which lasted for a decade. These resulted in three major treaties ‚Äì Four-Power Treaty, Five-Power Treaty (the Washington Naval Treaty), the Nine-Power Treaty ‚Äì and a number of smaller agreements.Thomas H. Buckley, The United States and the Washington Conference, 1921-1922 (U of Tennessee Press, 1970).Raymond G. O'Connor, \\"The\\" Yardstick\\" and Naval Disarmament in the 1920s.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 45.3 (1958): 441-463. in JSTOR Britain now took the lead. The successful London Naval Treaty of 1930 continued the warship limitations among the major powers first set out in 1922. The treaties of 1922-30 preserved peace during the 1920s but were not renewed, as the world scene turned increasingly negative starting in 1931. B. J. C. McKercher, \\"The politics of naval arms limitation in Britain in the 1920s.\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 4#3 (1993): 35-59. =The peaceful spirit of Locarno= The seven international treaties negotiated at Locarno in 1925 by the major powers in Europe (not including the Soviet Union) significantly strengthened the legitimacy of Germany, paving the way to its return to the role of a major power and membership in the League of Nations in 1926, with a permanent seat on its council. The Locarno Treaties marked a dramatic improvement in the political climate of western European in 1924‚Äì1930. They promoted expectations for continued peaceful settlements, often called the \\"spirit of Locarno\\". This spirit was made concrete when Germany joined the League in 1926, and the withdrawal of Allied troops occupying Germany's Rhineland. Historian Sally Marks says: > \\"Henceforth the spirit of Locarno would reign, substituting conciliation for > enforcement as the basis for peace. Yet for some peace remained a desperate > hope rather than an actuality. A few men knew that the spirit of Locarno was > a fragile foundation on which to build a lasting peace.\\" Nazi Germany had no use for a peaceful spirit. It repudiated Locarno by sending troops into the demilitarized Rhineland on 7 March 1936.Gaynor Johnson, Locarno Revisited: European Diplomacy 1920-1929 (2004) excerpt and text search =Outlawing war= Fourteen major nations were the first to sign the Kellogg-Briand Pact in Paris in 1928 The Kellogg‚ÄìBriand Pact of 1928 was a proposal drafted by the United States and France that, in effect, outlawed war to resolve \\"disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them\\". Most nations readily signed up and used the occasion to promote the goal of peaceful foreign policies. The only issue was the actual formula of the renunciation of all wars ‚Äì the French wanted the definition restricted to wars of aggression, while the Americans insisted it should include all kinds of warfare. Historian Harold Josephson notes that the Pact has been ridiculed for its moralism and legalism and lack of influence on foreign policy. He argues that it instead led to a more activist American foreign policy. Its central provisions renouncing the use of war, and promoting peaceful settlement of disputes and the use of collective force to prevent aggression, were incorporated into the UN Charter and other treaties. Although civil wars continued, wars between established states have been rare since 1945, with a few exceptions in the Middle East.Harold Josephson, Diplomatic History (1979) 3#4 pp 377-390. In the United States, much energetic grass-roots support came from women's organizations and Protestant churches.Robert Moats Miller, \\"The Attitudes of the Major Protestant Churches in America toward War and Peace, 1919-1929.\\" Historian (1956) 19#1 pp 13-38. 26p. Argues that by 1917 the Protestant leaders saw the necessity of a war to end all war; They accepted the Treaty of Versailles and promoted the League of Nations. In the 1920s, there emerged and extensive disarmament and internationalist movement which peaked with their optimism over the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. =Criminalizing poison gas= Realistic critics understood that war could not really be outlawed, but its worst excesses might be banned. Poison gas became the focus of a worldwide crusade in the 1920s. Poison gas did not win battles, and the generals did not want it. The soldiers hated it far more intensely than bullets or explosive shells. By 1918, chemical shells made up 35 per cent of French ammunition supplies, 25 per cent of British, and 20 per cent of the American stock. The ‚ÄúProtocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous, or Other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare‚Äù [\\"Geneva Protocol\\"] was issued in 1925, and was accepted as policy by all major countries.Tim Cook, \\"‚ÄòAgainst God-Inspired Conscience‚Äô: The Perception of Gas Warfare as a Weapon of Mass Destruction, 1915‚Äì1939.\\" War & Society 18.1 (2000): 47-69.

He increasingly antagonized his supporters with foreign policy miscues.

Taylor, English History, 1914‚Äì1945 (1965) pp 202‚Äì3, 335 Britain supported the American solution to German payments through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan, whereby Germany paid its reparations using money borrowed from New York banks.Patrick O.

Its leaders believed that peace was impossible because of capitalism, secret diplomacy, and the trade in armaments. That is it stressed material factors that ignored the psychological memories of the Great War, and the highly emotional tensions regarding nationalism and the boundaries of the countries. Nevertheless, party leader Ramsay MacDonald as Prime Minister (1924, 1929‚Äì35) spent much of his attention on European policies. In his 10 months as Prime Minister 1924 he established the basic tenets of British foreign policy for the next dozen years. He had been a strong opponent of entering First World War, and in the unhappy aftermath many observers thought he had been vindicated. Incessant French demands against Germany annoyed the British leadership, and undermined the bilateral relationship with France. MacDonald made it a matter of high principle to dispense even-handed justice between France and Germany, saying, \\"let them put their demands. In such a way that Great Britain could say that she supported both sides.\\" Taylor, English History: 1914-1945 (1965) p 214-17 MacDonald played a key role in enabling acceptance of the Dawes plan, and worked hard make the League of Nations dream a reality.

In foreign affairs, however, he came to a d√©tente with Russia and officially recognized it in 1924. A frustrating issue was repayment of British loans to Russia during the war; Moscow said it would pay only if given a loan. There was strong opposition inside Britain, so discussion focused on a commercial treaty with Russia. Just days before the 1924 general election, the media released a bombshell document signed by Grigory Zinoviev, the head of the Communist International (COMINTERN) in Moscow, ordering the British Communist Party to engage in all sorts of seditious activities. Historians agree the letter was a clever forgery, and that it disrupted the campaign, but that it did not decide the election, which was won by the Conservatives. The most negative impact on Labour was its post- election focus on trickery rather than hits own structural weaknesses.Taylor, English History: 1914-1945 (1965) p 217-20, 225-26. Great Depression The Great Depression in the United Kingdom starting in 1929 put enormous pressure on the British economy. Britain move toward imperial preference, which meant low tariffs among the Commonwealth of Nations, and higher barriers toward trade with outside countries. The flow of money from New York dried up, and the system of reparations and payment of debt died in 1931. Appeasement of Germany and Italy Vivid memories of the horrors and deaths of the World War inclined many Britons‚Äîand their leaders in all parties‚Äîto pacifism in the interwar era. This led directly to the appeasement of dictators in order to avoid their threats of war.Patrick Finney, \\"The romance of decline: The historiography of appeasement and British national identity.\\" Electronic Journal of International History 1 (2000). online The challenge came from dictators, first Benito Mussolini of Italy, then Adolf Hitler of a much more powerful Nazi Germany. The League of Nations proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators. British policy was to \\"appease\\" them in the hopes they would be satiated. By 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military. The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed Czechoslovakia to Hitler's demands at the Munich Agreement of 1938.David Faber, Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II (2010) Instead of satiation Hitler menaced Poland, and at last Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain dropped appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland. Hitler, however, cut a deal with Joseph Stalin to divide Eastern Europe; when Germany did invade Poland in September 1939, Britain and France declared war; the British Commonwealth followed London's lead.Donald Cameron Watt, How War Came: Immediate Origins of the Second World War, 1938‚Äì39 (1990) Dominions and the Statute of Westminster Legislative independence of the dominions from the United Kingdom occurred in the years after the passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931 in the British parliament. The statute declared the dominions of the British Empire as \\"autonomous communities,\\" that was \\"equal in status, [and] in no way subordinate to one another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs.\\" The Act gave legal recognition to the de facto independence of the dominions, going into effect almost immediately after its passage in the dominions of Canada, the Irish Free State, and South Africa. However, the Statute of Westminster did not immediately apply to the dominions of Australia, Newfoundland, and New Zealand; with Section 10 of the statute outlining that the enactment of the Act was dependent the aforementioned realms ratifying the Statute of Westminster in their local parliaments. =France= The main goal of French foreign policy between the wars was the diplomatic response to the demands of the French army in the 1920s and 1930s to form alliances against the German threat, especially with Britain and with smaller countries in central Europe.Peter Jackson, \\"France and the problems of security and international disarmament after the first world war.\\" Journal of Strategic Studies 29#2 (2006): 247‚Äì280.Nicole Jordan, \\"The Reorientation of French Diplomacy in the mid-1920s: the Role of Jacques Seydoux.\\" English Historical Review 117.473 (2002): 867‚Äì888. 1920s France was part of the Allied force that occupied the Rhineland following the Armistice. Foch supported Poland in the Greater Poland Uprising and in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War and France also joined Spain during the Rif War. From 1925 until his death in 1932, Aristide Briand, as prime minister during five short intervals, directed French foreign policy, using his diplomatic skills and sense of timing to forge friendly relations with Weimar Germany as the basis of a genuine peace within the framework of the League of Nations. He realized France could neither contain the much larger Germany by itself nor secure effective support from Britain or the League.Eugen Weber, The Hollow Years: France in the 1930s (1996) p. 125 In January 1923 as a response to the failure of the Germans to ship enough coal as part of its reparations, France (and Belgium) occupied the industrial region of the Ruhr. Germany responded with passive resistance including printing vast amounts of marks to pay for the occupation, thereby causing runaway inflation. Inflation heavily damaged the German middle class (because their bank accounts became worthless) but it also damaged the French franc. France fomented a separatist movement pointing to an independent buffer state, but it collapsed after some bloodshed. The intervention was a failure, and in summer 1924 France accepted the American solution to the reparations issues, as expressed in the Dawes Plan.Conan Fischer, The Ruhr Crisis 1923-1924 (2003). In the 1920s, France established an elaborate system of static border defences called the Maginot Line, designed to fight off any German attack. The Maginot Line did not extend into Belgium, where Germany attacked in 1940 and went around the French defenses. Military alliances were signed with weak powers in 1920‚Äì21, called the \\"Little Entente\\".William Allcorn, The Maginot Line 1928‚Äì45 (2012). 1930s Appeasement was increasingly adopted as Germany grew stronger after 1933, for France suffered a stagnant economy, unrest in its colonies, and bitter internal political fighting. Appeasement say Martin Thomas was not a coherent diplomatic strategy nor a copying of the British.Martin Thomas, \\"Appeasement in the Late Third Republic,\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 19#3 (2008): 566‚Äì607. France appeased Italy on the Ethiopia question because it could not afford to risk an alliance between Italy and Germany.Reynolds M. Salerno, \\"The French Navy and the Appeasement of Italy, 1937-9,\\" English Historical Review 112#445 (1997): 66‚Äì104. When Hitler sent troops into the Rhineland‚Äîthe part of Germany where no troops were allowed‚Äîneither Paris nor London would risk war, and nothing was done.Stephen A. Schuker, \\"France and the Remilitarization of the Rhineland, 1936,\\" French Historical Studies 14.3 (1986): 299‚Äì338. Appeasement of Germany, in cooperation with Britain, was the policy after 1936, as France sought peace even in the face of Hitler's escalating demands. √âdouard Daladier refused to go to war against Germany and Italy without British support as Neville Chamberlain wanted to save peace using the Munich Agreement in 1938.Maurice Larkin, France since the Popular Front: Government and People, 1936‚Äì1986 (1988) pp 63-81 France's military alliance with Czechoslovakia was sacrificed at Hitler's demand when France and Britain agreed to his terms at Munich in 1938.Nicole Jordan, \\"L√©on Blum and Czechoslovakia, 1936‚Äì1938.\\" French History 5#1 (1991): 48‚Äì73.Martin Thomas, \\"France and the Czechoslovak crisis,\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 10.23 (1999): 122‚Äì159. The Blum government joined Britain in establishing an arms embargo during the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39). Blum rejected support for the Spanish Republicans because of his fear that civil war might spread to deeply divided France. As the Republican cause faltered in Spain, Blum secretly supplied it the Republican cause with arms, funds and sanctuaries. Financial support in military cooperation with Poland was also a policy. The government nationalized arms suppliers, and dramatically increased its program of rearming the French military in a last- minute catch up with the Germans.Larkin, France since the Popular Front, (1988) pp 45-62 French foreign policy in the 1920s and 1930s aimed to build military alliances with small nations in Eastern Europe in order to counter the threat of German attacks. Paris saw Romania as an ideal partner in this venture, especially in 1926 to 1939. During World War II the alliance failed. Romania was first neutral and then after Germany defeated France in 1940 and the Soviet Union annexed Northern Bukovina and all of Bessarabia it aligned with Germany. The main device France had used was arms sales in order to strengthen Romania and ensure its goodwill. French military promises were vague and not trusted after the sellout of Czechoslovakia at Munich in 1938, By 1938 French needed all the arms it could produce. Meanwhile Germany was better poised to build strong economic ties. In 1938-39 France made a final effort to guarantee Romanian borders because it calculated that Germany needed Romanian oil, but Romania decided war with Germany would be hopeless and so it veered toward Berlin.William A. Hoisington Jr, \\"The Struggle for Economic Influence in Southeastern Europe: The French Failure in Romania, 1940.\\" Journal of Modern History 43.3 (1971): 468-482. online =Fascism= Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism in Europe shortly after the First World War. It dominated Italy (1923‚Äì43) and Nazi Germany (1933-45) and played a role in other countries. It was based in tightly organised local groups, all controlled from the top. It violently opposed to liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism, and tried to control all aspects of society. The foreign policy Militaristic and aggressive. Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany were critical allies in the second world war. Japan, with an authoritarian government that did not have a well-mobilised popular base, was allied with them to form the Axis.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914‚Äì1945 (1995). Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants. A \\"military citizenship\\" arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war. The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.Michael Mann. Fascists. Cambridge UP, 2004 p. 65. Fascists argue that liberal democracy is obsolete, and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one- party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties. Opposition parties or organizations or publications are not tolerated.John Horne. State, Society and Mobilization in Europe During the First World War. pp. 237‚Äì39. Such a state is led by a strong leader‚Äîsuch as a dictator his fascist party‚Äîto forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society without dissent. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature, and views political violence and warfare as tools that can achieve national rejuvenation.Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914‚Äì1945 p. 106. Hitler re- militarised Germany's Rhineland district in 1936 in defiance of the Treaty of Versailles which said no troops would be stationed there. France and Britain did nothing.R.A.C. Parker, \\"The first capitulation: France and the Rhineland crisis of 1936.\\" World Politics 8#3 (1956): 355-373. Hitler discovered that threats and bold moves paid off, and he escalated demands against Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Finally Britain and France declared war after his invasion of Poland in September 1939. The Second World War had begun.R.J. Overy and Andrew Wheatcroft, The road to war (2009). =Germany= Germany, stripped of its overseas colonies, its Polish regions in the east and Alsace- Lorraine in the West, became a republic in 1919. It was committed to democracy and modernity, but faced internal challenges from the far left and the far right, and external pressures from France. Weimar Germany (1919‚Äì1933) In November 1918, the Kaiser and the aristocracy, were overthrown. Friedrich Ebert, leader of the Socialists (the Social Democratic Party of Germany or SPD) became Chancellor of Germany, serving until his death in 1923. His moderate faction of the SPD expelled the radical element led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. They went on to form a Communist Party, seeking the violent overthrow of the government in the name of the working class. In January 1919, Communists led the Spartacist uprising in Berlin, Bremen, Braunschweig, and the Ruhr. The Army was largely demobilized, but many veterans volunteered to form Freikorps (\\"free corps\\") which supported Ebert and his defense minister Gustav Noske. They easily crushed the poorly organized uprisings. Liebknecht and Luxemburg were killed, leading to a permanent breach between Socialist and Communists that was never healed.W.C. Mathews, \\"The Economic Origins of the Noskepolitik.\\" Central European History 27#1 (1994): 65‚Äì86. in JSTOR. In Bavaria a Communist revolt created the short lived Bavarian Socialist Republic on 6 April 1919. It was suppressed by the Army and the Freikorps the following month.Gordon A. Craig, Germany 1866-1945 (1978) pp 396-433. online =Reparations= The Versailles Treaty required Germany to pay reparations for the damage it did during the war. Germany tried to avoid the obligation, but France used military force and occupied German industrial areas, making reparations the \\"chief battleground of the post-war era\\" and \\"the focus of the power struggle between France and Germany over whether the Versailles Treaty was to be enforced or revised\\".Ruth Henig, Versailles and After: 1919‚Äì1933 (1984) p. 63.Alan Sharp. \\"The Enforcement of the Treaty of Versailles, 1919‚Äì1923.\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 16.3 (2005): 423‚Äì438. The Treaty of Versailles and the 1921 London Schedule of Payments required Germany to pay 132 billion gold marks in reparations to cover civilian damage caused during the war. This figure was divided into three categories of bonds: A, B, and C. Of these, Germany was only required to pay towards 'A' and 'B' bonds totaling 50 billion marks (). The remaining 'C' bonds, which Germany did not have to pay, were designed to deceive the Anglo- French public into believing Germany was being heavily fined and punished for the war. Because of the lack of reparation payments by Germany, France occupied the Ruhr in 1923 to enforce payments, causing an international crisis. It was resolved by American intervention in the form of the Dawes Plan in 1924.Patrick O. Cohrs, The Unfinished Peace after World War I: America, Britain and the Stabilisation of Europe, 1919‚Äì1932 (2006). This plan set out a new payment method. New York banks loaned Germany money that was used to pay reparations and rebuild its heavy industry. Despite this, by 1928 Germany called for a new payment plan, resulting in the Young Plan that established the German reparation requirements at 112 billion marks () and created a schedule of payments that would see Germany complete payments by 1988. With the collapse of the German economy in 1931, reparations were suspended for a year and in 1932 during the Lausanne Conference they were cancelled altogether. Between 1919 and 1932, Germany paid less than 21 billion marks in reparations. After 1953 West Germany paid the entire remaining balance.Leonard Gomes, German Reparations, 1919‚Äì1932: A Historical Survey (Springer, 2010). The German people saw reparations as a national humiliation; the German Government worked to undermine the validity of the Treaty of Versailles and the requirement to pay. British economist John Maynard Keynes called the treaty a Carthaginian peace that would economically destroy Germany. His arguments had a profound effect on historians, politicians, and the public at large in Britain and elsewhere. Despite Keynes' arguments and those by later historians supporting or reinforcing Keynes' views, the consensus of contemporary historians is that reparations were not as intolerable as the Germans or Keynes had suggested and were within Germany's capacity to pay had there been the political will to do so. =Rapallo and Locarno treaties= Apart from the reparations issue, Germany's highest priority was normalizing its relations with its neighbors.* Nekrich, Aleksandr M. et al. Pariahs, Partners, Predators: German-Soviet Relations, 1922‚Äì1941 (1997). The new policy was to turn east for a new friendship with the communist Soviet Union In 1922, they signed the Treaty of Rapallo.Robert Himmer, \\"Rathenau, Russia, and Rapallo.\\" Central European History 9#2 (1976): 146‚Äì183.

Gatzke, \\"Russo-German military collaboration during the Weimar Republic.\\" American Historical Review 63.3 (1958): 565‚Äì597. online Nazi Germany (1933‚Äì1945) Hitler and his Nazis turned Germany into a dictatorship with a highly hostile outlook toward the Treaty of Versailles and Jews.Richard Evans, The Third Reich in Power (2006) It solved its unemployment crisis by heavy military spending.Adam Tooze, The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy (2008) Hitler's diplomatic tactics were to make seemingly reasonable demands, then threatening war if they were not met; concessions were made, he accepted them and moved onto a new demand. When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the League of Nations (1933), rejected the Versailles Treaty and began to re-arm (1935) with the Anglo- German Naval Agreement, won back the Saar (1935), re-militarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance (\\"axis\\") with Mussolini's Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939), seized Austria (1938), took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French appeasement of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with Stalin's Russia in August 1939, and finally invaded Poland in September 1939.Gerhard L. Weinberg, The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II, 1937‚Äì1939 (1980) 1933‚Äì1935 Hitler and the leading Nazis had little diplomatic experience before they came to power in January 1933, and they moved slowly in that arena. While the concentrated on a total takeover of the power centers inside Germany.Gerhard L. Weinberg, The Foreign Policy of Hitler‚Äôs Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36 (1970) pp 25‚Äì56 The first external move was to cripple a disarmament conference that was underway in Geneva, by rejecting troop limitations. The Germans insisted that the Nazi storm troopers should not be counted in any quota system. Although Britain, France, Italy and the United States were ready to freeze armaments for four years, the Germans insisted on having \\"defensive weapons\\" immediately. Germany quit the disarmament conference and the League in October 1933 but even then few European leaders (apart from Winston Churchill) saw Hitler as an enemy or threat to peace. For example, Eric Phipps the British ambassador 1933‚Äì1937 eagerly promoted policies, later known as appeasement. He believed that the League of Nations Was the key to preventing the next war, and tried to enlist the French in efforts to get the Germans to cooperate.Gaynor Johnson, \\"Sir Eric Phipps, the British government, and the appeasement of Germany, 1933‚Äì1937.\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 16.4 (2005): 651‚Äì669. Mussolini was also eager to cooperate with Hitler, and succeeded in getting the German signature on the Four-Power Pact, between Britain, France, Italy, and Germany. The Pact failed, and after Hitler visited Mussolini in Rome, they had a falling out German intentions to take over Austria. Britain and France tried for the next several years to attract Italy more to their side than to Germany's.Aaron L. Goldman, \\"Sir Robert Vansittart's Search for Italian Cooperation against Hitler, 1933‚Äì36,\\" Journal of Contemporary History 9#3 (1974), pp. 93‚Äì130 in JSTOR In January 1934 Germany signed a non-aggression pact with Poland, which disrupted the French network of anti-German alliances in Eastern Europe.Weinberg, The Foreign Policy of Hitler‚Äôs Germany pp 57‚Äì74 In March 1935 Hitler denounced the requirement of German disarmament contained in the Versailles Treaty of 1919. Germany and Britain came to terms in June 1935, in the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. Germany promised to limit or naval expansion to 35 percent of the British, thereby driving a wedge between Britain and France.G.M. Gathorne-Hardy, Short History of International Affairs, 1920‚Äê1939 (3rd ed. 1942) pp 347‚Äì364. Americans had a deep negative attitude toward Hitler and the Nazis, and relations steadily deteriorated over trade disputes, anti-Jewish demonstrations, and rearmament. Washington decided that German foreign policy primarily reflected two factors: its internal economic problems and Hitler's expansionist dreams. Meanwhile, the new Roosevelt administration opened relations with the Soviet Union on a basis of d√©tente, along with the promise there would be no espionage.Kenneth Moss, \\"George S. Messersmith and Nazi Germany: the diplomacy of limits in Central Europe.\\" in Kenneth Paul Jones ed., US Diplomats in Europe: 1919‚Äì1941 (2nd ed. 1983) pp 113‚Äì126. 1936‚Äì37 =Eastern Europe= A major result of the First World War was the breakup of the Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman empires, as well as partial losses to the German Empire. A surge of ethnic nationalism created a series of new states in Eastern Europe, validated by the Versailles Treaty of 1919. Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan tried to do the same but were later retaken by the Bolsheviks in Russia. Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia became entirely new nations. Austria and Hungary survived with much smaller territories based on their German and Hungarian core populations.Hugh Seton-Watson, Eastern Europe Between the Wars, 1918-1941 (1945) Poland was reconstituted after the partitions of the 1790s had divided it between Germany, Austria, and Russia. Romania, Bulgaria and Albania survive the tumbled, but their borders were adjusted. All the countries were heavily rural, with little industry and only a few urban centers. Nationalism was the dominant force but most of the countries had ethnic or religious minorities who felt threatened by majority elements. Nearly all became democratic in the 1920s, but all of them (except Czechoslovakia and Finland) gave up democracy during the depression years of the 1930s, in favor of autocratic or strong-man or single party states. The new states were unable to form stable military alliances, and one by one were too weak to stand up against Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, which took them over between 1938 and 1945.E. Garrison Walters, The Other Europe: Eastern Europe to 1945 (Syracuse UP, 1988) covers seven countries. Baltic states Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania successfully broke away from Russia in 1918-1920 and became independent countries. Bolshevik radicals at first held power, especially in Latvia, but were replaced during the 1920s with conservative political coalitions based on ethnic nationalism. The population in the early 1920s ranged from 1.1 million in Estonia, and 1.8 million in Latvia, to 2.2 million in Lithuania. Minorities comprised 12% of the population of Estonia, 27% in Latvia, and 20% in Lithuania. Each was heavily rural, especially Lithuania. Each privileged its main ethnic majority and its language and religion. They all had to deal with a mosaic of minorities: Germans, Jews, Belorussians, Russians, and Poles. The minorities had different languages, religions, and cultures. The Germans generally were the main landowners. There were outside attempts to incite separatist movements, with little success. The Baltic governments limited the rights and privileges of the minorities, but the minorities had enough solidarity to resist assimilation. These attempts caused an unfavorable international reaction.Piotr ≈Åossowski, \\"National Minorities in the Baltic States 1919-1940.\\" Acta Poloniae Historica 25 (1972): 87-107. Poland's seizure of Vilnius outraged the Lithuanians and made impossible any coordination or diplomatic cooperation among the three countries.Olav Fagelund Knudsen, \\"The Foreign Policies of the Baltic States: Interwar Years and Restoration' Cooperation and Conflict (1993) 28#1 pp 47-72; DOI10.1177/0010836793028001003 All three survived until 1939-40, when they were taken over by the Soviet Union and the local leadership was suppressed, executed or escaped into exile. The Germans invaded in 1941 and were expelled in 1944. After additional purges large numbers of Russians were resettled in Estonia and Latvia, and smaller numbers in Lithuania.Smith, ed., The Baltic States: The National Self- Determination of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (1996) pp 1-69 excerpt Greece Greek troops occupied Smyrna area and also areas north of Constantinople. In Greece, the site of several revanchist wars in the years prior to the First World War, the divided international loyalties of the political elite reached a crisis over entering the World War against its historic enemy, the Ottoman Empire. During what was known as the National Schism, a pro-British, liberal and nationalist movement led by Eleftherios Venizelos struggled with the conservative and pro-German monarch Constantine I for control. Greek troops seized Smyrna and a large sector of western Anatonia in 1919. They had British support. In 1920 the Ottoman government agreed to the Treaty of S√®vres; it stipulated that in five years time a plebiscite would be held in Smyrna on whether the region would join Greece. However, Turkish nationalists, led by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, overthrew the Ottoman government and organised tried to expel the Greeks in the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922). A major Greek offensive ground to a halt in 1921, and by 1922 Greek troops were in retreat. The Turkish forces recaptured Smyrna and drove out all the Greek forces. The war with Turkey ended with an agreement to stage massive ethnic exchange, with 1.1 million ethnic Greek Christians who had lived in what was now Turkey (and perhaps could not speak Greek) moving back to Greece, and 380,000 Muslims moving to Turkey. Hungary In the chaos of 1919 Hungarian Communists, encouraged by Moscow, overthrew the government and established the Hungarian Soviet Republicon 21 March 1919. B√©la Kun was officially the foreign minister but in practice was the new leader. His regime nationalized industry and finance but made the mistake of not redistributing land to the peasants. The plan was to establish a large-scale collective farms managed by the old landlord class. Dissent grew but was violently suppressed in the Red Terror. Hungary was soon at war with Romania and Czechoslovakia, both aided by France, and the regime collapsed in August 1919.Istvan Deak, \\"Budapest and the Hungarian Revolutions of 1918-1919.\\" Slavonic and East European Review 46.106 (1968): 129-140. in JSTOR The \\"white\\" counter- revolutionaries, rooted in the landowning class, came to power under Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy, an authoritarian ruler from 1920 to his arrest in 1944.Thomas L.

Central European University, 2015) online In the 1920 Treaty of Trianon, Hungary lost a great deal of historic territory and resources, with many ethnic Hungarians now located in other countries. Ethnic Hungarians wanted a restoration of their status. Hungarians stranded elsewhere formed organizations to maintain their identity, such as Czechoslovakia's St. George Scout Circle (later called \\"Sarl√≥\\" ) and Romania's Transylvanian Youth (Erd√©lyi Fiatalok).Deborah S. Cornelius, \\"The Impact of Trianon: Intellectual and Activist Movements.\\" Hungarian Studies Review. 39.1-2 (2012): 75+. One result was closeness to fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, which promised to restore lost territories. Franco-British failed alliance with Moscow After the German occupation of Prague in March 1939, in violation of the Munich agreement, the Chamberlain government in Britain sought Soviet and French support for a Peace Front. The goal was to deter further Nazi aggression by guaranteeing the independence of Poland and Romania. However Stalin refused to pledge Soviet support for these guarantees unless Britain and France first concluded a military alliance with the USSR. In London the cabinet decided to seek such an alliance. However the western negotiators in Moscow in August 1939 lacked urgency. The talks were poorly conducted at a slow pace by diplomats with little authority, such as William Strang, an assistant under-secretary. Stalin also insisted on British and French guarantees to Finland, the Baltic states, Poland, and Romania against indirect German aggression. Those countries, however, became fearful that Moscow wanted to control them. Although Hitler was escalating threats against Poland, it refused under any circumstances to allow Soviet troops to cross its borders. Historian Michael Jabara Carley argues that the British were too committed to anti-communism to trust Stalin. Meanwhile Stalin simultaneously was secretly negotiating with the Germans. He was attracted to a much better deal by Hitler--control of most of Eastern Europe and decided to sign the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.Donald Cameron Watt, How War Came: The Immediate Origins of the Second World War, 1938-1939 (1989) pp 362-84.G.

Ulam, Expansion and coexistence: Soviet foreign policy, 1917‚Äì73 (1974) pp 147-208. The first stage from late 1917 into 1922 involved defeating foreign interventions, and an internal Civil War. The Soviets maintained control over most of the former Russian Empire, and regained control over the trans- Caucasian republics. They lost Finland, Poland and the Baltics, which remained independent until the Second World War. They regained control of Ukraine in 1921 by defeating Poland in a short, intensive war. There was a short war in 1919‚Äì20 with Romania.Barbara Jelavich, St. Petersburg and Moscow: tsarist and Soviet foreign policy, 1814‚Äì1974 (1974) pp 301-11. Flushed with victory, Lenin, Trotsky and the other leaders in Moscow were convinced that they represented the wave of the future, and that with a little help provided by the Communist International (Comintern), headed by Grigory Zinoviev they could spark anti-capitalist revolutions across the globe. However the interventions were all failures. In most cases the insurgents were quickly defeated by the established national forces. A Communist-Socialist coalition came to power in Hungary, with communist B√©la Kun becoming the dictator. The Romanians invaded and overthrew his regime in early August 1919. In Berlin the Communist forces under the Spartacist red banner led revolts in Berlin, Munich and the Ruhr that were quickly crushed by the army in a matter of days.Jonathan Haslam, \\"Comintern and Soviet foreign policy, 1919‚Äì1941\\" in Ronald Suny, ed. The Cambridge History of Russia: Volume 3, The Twentieth Century (2006) pp. 636-61. The long series of defeats produced a cordon sanitaire or chain of buffer states. The USSR had become a pariah state and the second stage was to work around that bad reputation. Its size and economic importance facilitated making trade agreements (which did not include official diplomatic recognition) with Britain, Italy, Austria, Germany, and Norway in 1921. The Treaty of Rapallo, 1922 with Germany‚Äîanother pariah state‚Äîopened up trade and recognition. It secretly allowed large-scale military training for German forces in hidden Soviet military installations. The New Economic Policy (1921‚Äì28) allowed a limited capitalism in the USSR and led to invitations to foreign corporations to do business. Henry Ford and his experts came from Detroit and built modern factories at GAZ; Ford was convinced that commerce made for peace. Lenin was incapacitated by 1922 and died in 1924. He was replaced by Joseph Stalin who rejected the goal of sponsoring Communist uprisings. In 1924 came recognition by Britain, Italy, France and Japan. Stalin removed Zinoniev and purged Trotsky and his hard-line allies who preached world revolution. The first priority, said Stalin, was expressed in the official slogan, \\"Socialism in One Country.\\" In 1928 the NEP experiment with capitalism was ended. Amid the \\"Great Game\\" in Central and South Asia, the Soviet Union signed a treaty of friendship with Afghanistan in 1921.https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts- and-maps/anglo-russian-rivalry-middle-east Throughout the 1920s, distrust and contention marked Anglo‚ÄìSoviet relations, culminating in a diplomatic break in 1927. Britain formally recognised the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR or Soviet Union, 1922‚Äì1991) on 1 February 1924. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were severed at the end of May 1927 after a police raid on the All Russian Co-operative Society whereafter prime minister Stanley Baldwin presented the House of Commons with deciphered Soviet telegrams that proved Soviet espionage activities.Christopher Andrew, \\"Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of Mi5\\"(London, 2009), p. 155.For an account of the break in 1927, see Roger Schinness, \\"The Conservative Party and Anglo-Soviet Relations, 1925‚Äì27\\", European History Quarterly 7, 4 (1977): 393‚Äì407. In 1929, the incoming Labour government successfully established permanent diplomatic relations.Brian Bridges, \\"Red or Expert? The Anglo‚ÄìSoviet Exchange of Ambassadors in 1929.\\" Diplomacy & Statecraft 27.3 (2016): 437-452. At the Sixth World Congress of the Communist International in 1928, Stalin issued orders that across the world Communist parties would never be allowed to cooperate with Socialists or other leftist parties‚Äîthey were all \\"social fascists\\" and were as evil as the capitalists because they were enemies of the proletariat. Communists infiltrated and tried to seize control of labour unions and the Socialists fought back as hard as they could. In a return to normal relations with nearby states, in 1932 Stalin signed non-aggression treaties with the cordon sanitaire states of Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, and France. The USSR joined the League of Nations in 1934.Jelavich, St. Petersburg and Moscow (1974) pp 311‚Äì340. The United States was the last major country to recognize the Soviet state. Recognition in 1933 was popular in the US; businessmen planned for large-scale trade, but it never materialized.Joan H. Wilson, \\"American Business and the Recognition of the Soviet Union.\\" Social Science Quarterly (1971): 349-368. in JSTOR Popular Front Communists and parties on the left were increasingly threatened by the growth of the Nazi movement. Hitler came to power in January 1933 and rapidly consolidated his control over Germany, destroyed the communist and socialist movements in Germany, and rejected the restraints imposed by the Versailles treaty. Stalin in 1934 reversed his decision in 1928 to attack socialists, and introduced his new plan: the \\"popular front.\\" It was a coalition of anti-fascist parties usually organized by the local Communists acting under instructions from the Comintern. The new policy was to work with all parties on the left and center in a multiparty coalition against fascism and Nazi Germany in particular. The new slogan was: \\"The People's Front Against Fascism and War\\". Under this policy Communist Parties were instructed to form broad alliances with all anti-fascist parties with the aim of both securing social advance at home and a military alliance with the USSR to isolate the fascist dictatorships.Kevin McDermott, and Jeremy Agnew, The Comintern: A History of International Communism from Lenin to Stalin (1996). The \\"Popular Fronts\\" thus formed proved to be successful in only a few countries, and only for a few years each, forming the government in France, Chile and Spain, and also China.Julian Jackson, The Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy, 1934‚Äì38 (1990). It was not a political success elsewhere. The Popular Front approach played a major role in Resistance movements in France and other countries conquered by Germany after 1939. After the war it played a major role in French and Italian politics.Helen Graham and Paul Preston, eds. The Popular Front in Europe (1988). Stalin and Ribbentrop shaking hands after the signing of the pact in Moscow in August 1939. In 1938‚Äì39, the Soviet Union attempted to form strong military alliances with Germany's enemies, including France, and Great Britain. The effort failed, and the last stage unfolded to the astonishment of the world: Stalin and Hitler came to terms. Historian Fran√ßois Furet says, \\"The pact signed in Moscow by Ribbentrop and Molotov on 23 August 1939 inaugurated the alliance between the USSR and Nazi Germany. It was presented as an alliance and not just a nonaggression pact.\\" The secret covenants agreed on a mutual division of Poland, and split up Eastern Europe, with the USSR taking over the Baltic states. The USSR helped supply oil and munitions to Germany as its armies rolled across Western Europe in May‚ÄìJune 1940. Despite repeated warnings, Stalin refused to believe that Hitler was planning an all- out war on the USSR. It came in June 1941. Ukraine Ukraine was a complex ethnic mix, comprising Ukrainians, Russians, Jews, Poles, and other minorities and lacking a strong sense of nationalism. The social, political, cultural, and economic elites were based in the major cities, espoused Russian nationalism, and were generally indifferent or hostile to Ukrainian nationalism. Peasants on the other hand, were strongly in favor of independence in order to redistribute the land. Ukraine tried to break free from Russia after the February 1917 revolution in St. Petersburg. The leadership was young, ideological, hostile to capitalism and landowners, and inexperienced. It did not realize the necessity of a strong army‚Äîit turned down a force of 40,000 trained soldiers as unnecessary‚Äînor the need to build infrastructure and public support in the rural areas.Vladyslav Verstiuk, \\"Conceptual Issues in Studying the History of the Ukrainian Revolution.\\" Journal of Ukrainian Studies 24.1 (1999): 5-20. Outside powers acted on entirely different visions for Ukraine. The British ridiculed the pretensions of the new nation.Natalya Yakovenko, \\"Ukraine in British strategies and concepts of foreign policy, 1917‚Äì1922 and after.\\" East European Quarterly 36.4 (2002): 465. White Russians, united only by their opposition to Bolshevism, wanted to restore Ukraine as a Russian province. Russian Bolsheviks did not believe in nationalism and twice invaded Ukraine in failed efforts to seize control and collectivize the farms; they succeeded the third time in 1920.Graham Tan, \\"Transformation versus Tradition: Agrarian Policy and Government‚ÄìPeasant Relations in Right-Bank Ukraine 1920‚Äì1923.\\" Europe-Asia Studies 52.5 (2000): 915‚Äì937. Americans were outraged at the large-scale massacres of Jews in 1919.Elias Tcherikower, The Pogroms in the Ukraine in 1919 (1965) Germany supported Ukrainian nationalism as a foil to Russia, but its chief goal was to obtain urgently needed food supplies. Ukraine was too poorly organized to fulfill the promised food shipments. and Peter Lieb. \\"Misconceived realpolitik in a failing state: the political and economical fiasco of the Central Powers in the Ukraine, 1918.\\" First World War Studies 4.1 (2013): 111‚Äì124. Poland wanted Ukraine in order to build a population that could stand up against Germany. France wanted Poland as a strong anti-German ally and therefore supported Polish ambitions. Poland did seize Ukraine in 1919, but was driven out in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War in 1920.Oleksandr Pavliuk, \\"Ukrainian-Polish relations in Galicia in 1918‚Äì1919.\\" Journal of Ukrainian Studies 23.1 (1998) Historian Paul Kubicek states: > Between 1917 and 1920, several entities that aspired to be independent > Ukrainian states came into existence.

The Ukrainian War of Independence of 1917 to 1921 produced the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (in 1919 merged from the Ukrainian People's Republic and West Ukrainian People's Republic) which was quickly subsumed in the Soviet Union. =Spanish Civil War= The Spanish Civil War exposed political divisions across Europe. The right and the Catholics supported the Nationalists as a way to stop the expansion of Bolshevism. On the left, including labor unions, students and intellectuals, the war represented a necessary battle to stop the spread of fascism and support the cause of the Spanish Republicans. Antiwar and pacifist sentiment was strong in many countries, leading to warnings that the Civil War had the potential of escalating into a second world war.Zara Steiner, The Triumph of the Dark: European International History 1933‚Äì1939 (2013), pp 181‚Äì251. In this respect, the war was an indicator of the growing instability across Europe. The Spanish Civil War involved tens of thousands of outsiders from right and left who came to fight.Michael Alpert, A new international history of the Spanish Civil War (2004). Italy sent infantry regiments; Germany sent its air force.James S. Corum, \\"The Luftwaffe and the coalition air war in Spain, 1936‚Äì1939.\\" Journal of Strategic Studies 18.1 (1995): 68-90. Communist elements around the world, working through Popular Front collaborations with anti-fascist parties but supervised by Moscow, sent volunteers to the \\"International Brigades.\\"Daniel Kowalsky, \\"The Soviet Union and the International Brigades, 1936‚Äì1939.\\" Journal of Slavic Military Studies 19.4 (2006): 681-704. Most of these volunteers were Communist party members, typically with a dedication of their time, energy, and lives To an idealistic cause.Lisa A. Kirschenbaum, International Communism and the Spanish Civil War: Solidarity and Suspicion (2015). Many writers and intellectuals on the left became involved, including Ernest Hemingway, who supported the Republican cause, and George Orwell, who reversed himself and turned sharply anti-Communist. Moscow also sent along a cadre of agents from their secret police force, NKVD and GUM. Their mission was to enforce solidarity and the party line, and to identify and execute left-wing anarchists whose agenda threatened the Stalinist line. The Spanish government in 1937 shipped its entire gold supply (worth over $500 million at the time) to Moscow for safekeeping. This gave Stalin leverage over the Spanish government, as he controlled the payments for all sales of arms to Spain. The gold was never returned. Britain and France led a coalition of 27 nations that promised non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, including an embargo on all arms to Spain. The United States unofficially went along. Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union signed on officially, but ignored the embargo. The attempted suppression of imported materials was largely ineffective, however, and France especially facilitated large shipments to Republican troops. The League of Nations did not try to act. As the Spanish Civil War progressed, most governments maintained diplomatic relations with the Republicans, but as the Nationalists' imminent victory became apparent, the western democracies had to quickly readjust their diplomacy to prevent a permanent allegiance of the new Spanish government to the eventual Axis Powers. The French government, previously a tentative sympathizer of the Republican cause, formed the B√©rard-Jordana Agreement with the Spanish Nationalists on 25 February 1939, formally recognizing Franco's government as the legitimate government of Spain. Philippe P√©tain, the eventual leader of Vichy France, became France's ambassador to Francoist Spain. The British government recognized the Franco government on the same day, and the United States government followed suit on 7 April 1939. The Franco government maintained an ambiguous stance between the western democracies and the European fascists and joined the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact on 24 March 1939. However, the Spanish government, put off by the German-Soviet cooperation in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939, ultimately declined open membership in the Axis Powers and maintained neutrality in World War II, although Spanish volunteers were allowed to fight for the Axis cause as part of the German 250th Infantry Division. Latin America Brazil's President Get√∫lio Vargas (left) meets with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (right) in 1936, hoping a good relationship with the United States would deter an attack from Argentina. The main foreign policy initiative of the United States was the Good Neighbor Policy, which was a move toward a more non- interventionist U.S. policy in Latin America. Since the 1890s Americans had seen this region as an American sphere of influence. American forces were withdrawn from Haiti, and new treaties with Cuba and Panama ended their status as U.S. protectorates. In December 1933, Roosevelt signed the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries. The U.S. repealed the Platt Amendment, freeing Cuba from legal and official interference by the United States.William E. Leuchtenburg, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, 1932‚Äì1940 (1963). pp. 203‚Äì10. The Great Depression in Latin America had a devastating impact, as the demand for its raw materials drastically declined, undermining the critical export sector. Chile, Peru, and Bolivia were hardest hit.Paulo Drinot and Alan Knight, The Great Depression in Latin America (2014)Rosemary Thorp, Latin America in the 1930s: the role of the periphery in world crisis (2000) Intellectuals and government leaders in Latin America turned their backs on the older economic policies and turned toward import substitution industrialization. The goal was to create self- sufficient economies, which would have their own industrial sectors and large middle classes and which would be immune to the ups and downs of the global economy. Despite the potential threats to United States commercial interests, the Roosevelt administration (1933‚Äì1945) understood that the United States could not wholly oppose import substitution. Roosevelt implemented a Good Neighbor policy and did not block the nationalization of some American companies in Latin America. Mexican President L√°zaro C√°rdenas nationalized American oil companies, out of which he created Pemex.Glen Barclay, Struggle for a Continent: The Diplomatic History of South America, 1917-1945 (1972)Thomas E. Skidmore and Peter H. Smith, Modern Latin America (6th ed. 2005) =Brazil= In Brazil, the largest country, a liberal revolution of 1930 overthrew the oligarchic coffee plantation owners and brought to power an urban middle class that and business interests that promoted industrialization and modernization. Aggressive promotion of new industry turned around the economy by 1933, and encouraged American investors. support. Brazil's leaders in the 1920s and 1930s decided that Argentina's implicit foreign policy goal was to isolate Portuguese-speaking Brazil from Spanish-speaking neighbors, thus facilitating the expansion of Argentine economic and political influence in South America. Even worse, was the fear that a more powerful Argentine Army would launch a surprise attack on the weaker Brazilian Army. To counter this threat, Brazil forged closer links with the United States. Meanwhile, Argentina moved in the opposite direction. During World War II, Brazil was a staunch ally of the United States and sent its military to Europe. The United States provided over $100 million in Lend-Lease grants, in return for free rent on air bases used to transport American soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic, and naval bases for anti-submarine operations. In sharp contrast, Argentina was officially neutral and at times favored Germany.Stanley E. Hilton, \\"The Argentine Factor in Twentieth-Century Brazilian Foreign Policy Strategy.\\" Political Science Quarterly 100.1 (1985): 27-51.Stanley E. Hilton, \\"Brazilian Diplomacy and the Washington-Rio de Janeiro 'Axis' during the World War II Era,\\" Hispanic American Historical Review (1979) 59#2 pp. 201-231 in JSTOR =Border disputes and warfare= Small-scale border disputes were common,Including the Leticia Incident in 1932-33 and Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War in 1941. but only one spiralled out of control, leading to a major war: the Chaco War in 1932-35. Two small countries, Bolivia (with 2.2 million people) and Paraguay (with only 900,000) fought grueling battles over control of the Gran Chaco, a large but long-neglected border region where oil had recently been discovered. Bolivia, heavy oil, but needed a port on rivers controlled by Paraguay to export it. Bolivia used authoritarian methods to raise a large, well-equipped army. However, its soldiers were accustomed to high altitudes and became sickly in the low-lying disease infested Chaco jungles.Elizabeth Shesko, \\"Mobilizing Manpower for War: Toward a New History of Bolivia's Chaco Conflict, 1932‚Äì1935.\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 95.2 (2015): 299-334. Paraguay, employing √©migr√© Russian officers, had much better planning and logistics, and was generally more successful militarily. About 28,000 soldiers and all were killed. Paraguay was awarded about three fourths of the disputed territory in a peace treaty brokered by Argentina and four other South American nations. Frustrated Bolivian veterans formed a political party, staged a coup and ruled for three years until they in turn were overthrown by the next coupBruce Farcau, The Chaco War: Bolivia and Paraguay, 1932‚Äì1935 (1996). Asia and Africa =Egypt= In December 1921, demonstrations again led to violence. In deference to the growing nationalism and at the suggestion of the High Commissioner, Lord Allenby, the UK unilaterally declared Egyptian independence on 28 February 1922 Britain, however, continued in control of what was renamed the Kingdom of Egypt. British guided the king and retained control of the Canal Zone, Sudan and Egypt's external and military affairs. King Fuad died in 1936 and King Farouk inherited the throne at the age of sixteen. Alarmed by the Second Italo-Abyssinian War when Italy invaded Ethiopia, he signed the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt by 1949, except at the Suez Canal. During World War II, British troops used Egypt as its primary base for all Allied operations throughout the region. British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947, but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the war.P.J. Vatikiotis, The History of Modern Egypt (4th ed., 1992). =Japan= In Japan, the Army increasingly took control of the government, assassinated opposing leaders, suppressed the left, and promoted a highly aggressive foreign policy with respect to China.Andy Dailey, Move to Global War (2015) 205pp; pp 9-53 on Japan's expansion Japanese policy angered the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands.Roy Hidemichi Akagi, Japan's Foreign Relations 1542-1936: A Short History (1979) pp, 481-550 online Japanese nationalism was the primary inspiration, coupled with a disdain for democracy.James B. Crowley, Japan's quest for autonomy: National security and foreign policy, 1930-1938 (2015) ch 1. The extreme right became influential throughout the Japanese government and society, notably within the Kwantung Army, which was stationed in Manchuria along the Japanese-owned South Manchuria Railroad. During the Manchurian Incident of 1931, radical army officers conquered Manchuria from local officials and set up the puppet government of Manchukuo there without permission from the Japanese government. International criticism of Japan following the invasion led to Japan withdrawing from the League of Nations.Kenneth Henshall, A History of Japan (2012) pp 114‚Äì115.Peter Duus et al. eds. The Japanese informal empire in China, 1895-1937 (2014). The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in 1942, after conquest of the colonies of the U.S., Britain and the Netherlands. Japan's expansionist vision grew increasingly bold. Many of Japan's political elite aspired to have Japan acquire new territory for resource extraction and settlement of surplus population.Henshall, 119‚Äì120. These ambitions led to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. After their victory in the Chinese capital, the Japanese military committed the infamous Nanking Massacre. The Japanese military failed to destroy the Chinese government led by Chiang Kai-shek, which retreated to remote areas. The conflict was a stalemate that lasted until 1945.S. C. M. Paine, The Wars for Asia, 1911-1949 (2012) pp 123-70. Japan's war aim was to establish the Greater East Asia Co- Prosperity Sphere, a vast pan-Asian union under Japanese domination.Henshall, 123‚Äì124. Hirohito's role in Japan's foreign wars remains a subject of controversy, with various historians portraying him as either a powerless figurehead or an enabler and supporter of Japanese militarism.Mark Weston, Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women (2002) pp 201‚Äì203. The United States grew increasingly worried about the Philippines, an American colony, within easy range of Japan And started looking for ways to contain Japanese expansion.Greg Kennedy, \\"Filling the Void?: Anglo-American Strategic Relations, Philippine Independence, and the Containment of Japan, 1932‚Äì1937.\\" The International History Review (2017): 1-24. American public and elite opinion‚Äîincluding even the isolationists‚Äîstrongly opposed Japan's invasion of China in 1937. President Roosevelt imposed increasingly stringent economic sanctions intended to deprive Japan of the oil and steel in needed to continue its war in China. Japan reacted by forging an alliance with Germany and Italy in 1940, known as the Tripartite Pact, which worsened its relations with the US. In July 1941, the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands froze all Japanese assets and cut off oil shipments‚ÄîJapan had little oil of its own.Conrad Totman, A History of Japan (2005). pp 554‚Äì556. =China= The Chinese revolution of 1911 that overthrew the last Emperor resulted in a decade of chaotic conditions, with power held by regional warlords with no functioning national government. A series of economic boycotts, aimed especially at the dominant intruder Great Britain, effectively ended European domination of China. Sun Yat-sen, the ideological leader of the revolution against the old Chinese Empire, established a revolutionary base in south China, and tried but failed to unite the fragmented nation. With assistance from the Communist International based in the USSR, he entered into an alliance with the fledgling Communist Party of China. After Sun's death in 1925, his prot√©g√©, Chiang Kai-shek was in control of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party or KMT) and brought most of south and central China under its rule the Northern Expedition military campaign of 1926‚Äì1927. Having defeated the warlords in south and central China by military force, Chiang was able to secure the nominal allegiance of the warlords in the North. In 1927, Chiang turned on the Communists and relentlessly chased the CPC armies and its leaders from their bases in southern and eastern China. In 1934, driven from their mountain bases such as the Chinese Soviet Republic, the CPC forces embarked on the Long March across China's most desolate terrain to the northwest, where the survivors established a guerrilla base at Yan'an in Shaanxi Province. During the Long March, the communists reorganized under a new leader, Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), who looked to the peasants--not the small industrial proletariat--for his party's base.Jay Taylor, The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for Modern China (2011) pp 141-93.G. M. Gathorne-Hardy, A short history of international affairs, 1920-1939 (3rd ed. 1942) pp 230-46. The Japanese army--a virtually autonomous unit--wanted control of Manchuria and indeed all of China. Hungry for raw materials and powered by industrial and military strength, seized Manchuria in September 1931 and established ex-Qing emperor Puyi as head of the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932. The League of Nations denounced Japan, and it quit the League. The United States and Britain refused to recognize the conquest, but made no military moves at this point. The Japanese began to push from south of the Great Wall into northern China and the coastal provinces. In 1937, the Japanese army, acting largely independent of Tokyo, clashed with Chinese forces in the Marco Polo Bridge Incident outside Beijing.James B. Crowley, \\"A Reconsideration of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident.\\" Journal of Asian Studies 22.03 (1963): 277-291. A full-scale war began‚Äîthe Second Sino- Japanese War.David M. Gordon, \\"The China‚ÄìJapan War, 1931‚Äì1945\\" Journal of Military History (2006) 70#1, pp. 137‚Äì82. evaluates the major books. Japan held enormous advantages in firepower, mobility and organizational strength. China had the sympathy of most of the world, especially the United States and Britain.Ryoko Techika, \\"The basic structure of Chiang Kai-shek's diplomatic strategy.\\" Journal of Modern Chinese History 7.1 (2013): 17-34. Shanghai fell after a three-month battle and Japan took control virtually all the coastal cities. The capital of Nanjing fell in December 1937. It was followed by an orgy of mass murders and rapes known as the Nanjing Massacre. Chiang moved his national capital to remote Chongqing. Japan set up a second puppet government, the Wang Jingwei regime, based in Nanjing. The United States took the lead in expressing outrage, and began plans to systematically aid Chiang's regime by a long supply line through Indochina while demanding that Japan withdraw. Japan took control of Indochina from France in 1941, cutting the main supply line, and escalating the conflict toward a war with the United States and Britain.Michael Schaller, The US Crusade in China, 1938-1945 (1979).Bradford A.

Background On 4 November the commander of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 5th Division MG Ph·∫°m Qu·ªëc Thu·∫ßn requested the 1st Infantry Division to secure Highway 13 north of Lai Kh√™ to cover the movement of the ARVN 7th Regiment, 5th Division for an operation in the Michelin Rubber Plantation. 1st Infantry Division commander MG Seaman ordered Col. William Brodbeck's 3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division to undertake this mission. The mission in turn was given to Lt. Col. George Shuffer and his 2/2nd Infantry. Lt. Col. Shuffer established a Task Force consisting of his unit plus Troop A, 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment and Battery C, 2nd Battalion, 33rd Artillery Regiment. Lt. Col. Shuffer divided Highway 13 into 3 sectors each secured by a company and with the command group, Cavalry and artillery in the middle sector. Each day patrols would be sent out to sweep the Highway and its surroundings and they would withdraw into night defensive positions. The commander of the VC 9th Division, Senior Colonel Ho√†ng C·∫ßm decided to attack the American forces, gathering his units on the afternoon of 11 November. The main target would be the central American unit located just south of the village of Bau Bang, with the main assault by the 272nd Regiment supported by mortars and recoilless rifles and elements of the 271st Regiment. While the 273rd Regiment would attack from the south and block Highway 13 to the south preventing any reinforcement, while the 7th Battalion would be held in reserve. Battle On the night of 11 November several mortar rounds hit Lt. Col. Shuffer's central position and a night ambush killed 2 VC At 06:05 on the morning 12 November, as Lt. Col. Shuffer's forces prepared to start patrolling Highway 13, the VC launched their attack. Starting with a barrage of 50 mortar rounds, a Battalion of VC attacked from the southwest. The attack was quickly met by return fire from Troop A's M113s which broke up the attack. A second attack from the south and a third attack from the southeast were similarly beaten back by the waiting American force. At 07:00 the main attack was launched from the village of Bau Bang to the north and initially succeeded in penetrating the American position, before this attack was also repulsed. Battery C used its guns in anti-personnel mode firing 50 rounds at ground level with 2 second fuses. Air strikes by US Air Force A-1Hs and US Navy A-4s were directed against the VC mortars and recoilless rifles positioned in and around Bau Bang. At 09:00 the VC launched a final assault from the north, but were met with concentrated artillery fire and air strikes and by 13:30 the Viet Cong had abandoned their attacks and withdrawn. Aftermath Total US casualties were 20 killed and 103 wounded, while VC losses were 146 killed (body count) and a further 50 were believed to have been killed, but the bodies were removed. Vietnamese sources only acknowledged 109 killed and over 200 wounded for the VC and claimed to have killed or wounded 2000 Americans and destroyed 39 tanks and 8 heavy artillery pieces.

[] [] It is of significant importance in Eurasia as a vector of Dutch elm disease.  Description  Pronotum black and shiny, with red-brown anterior and posterior margins. Elytra, antennae, legs and abdomen are red-brown. Forehead with fine wrinkles and tubercles and a thick brush of hairs. Female's forehead convex, male's is flattened. Elytra bear well developed but shallow longitudinal punctate grooves. Elytra are tapering posteriorly. Abdomen sharply concave, oblique to the tip. In the middle of the posterior edge of the third and fourth abdominal segments there is usually an acute tubercle. The males have a continuous (although incrementally shorter toward middle) brush of golden hair at the apex of the abdomen.  Life cycle  The first generation flies mainly in June, in certain years stretching from the end of May to the middle of July. The second generation flies in August. Females prefers to lay their eggs under the bark of the lower part of the trunk, in areas where the cortex is thicker, most often on weakened standing trees or fallen trees. Egg galleries are longitudinal, 2‚Äì7 cm long, over 2 mm wide but no more than 3 mm. Larval galleries start perpendicularly from the egg gallery, the upper ones are bent upward, the lower ones downward, and the ones at the middle run rather parallelly from ones another. Larval galleries located on lower parts of the trunk are imprinted on the inner surface of the cortex, sometimes on the sapwood too to some extent. Pupal chambers are usually located in the bark. After emerging, adult beetles feed on the crotches of young twigs, and leaf petioles. Partly-developed to fully developed larvae overwinter. In the northern part of its range there is usually one generation per year, in the steppes 1 to 2 generations, and in the Caucasus usually 2 with possible indications of a third one.  Distribution  This species has been reported from throughout Europe and western Asia. In Russia, approximately as far east as Irkutsk Oblast and as far north as the southern boundary of the taiga zone. In Asia, it has also been reported from Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, China, northern Iran, and northern India (Jammu and Kashmir). In Africa, it has been reported from Morocco and Algeria.  Host plants  Reported host plants are primarily elms, but also, common ash, common walnut tree, Caucasian zelkova, as well as a number of trees in the genera Prunus (stone fruits), Quercus (oaks), Salix (willows), and Populus (for black poplar and aspen).

He is author of the book Soldier of Change which covers the media frenzy associated with his activism and his life as gay in the army. Early life Snyder-Hill grew up in Upper Sandusky, Ohio. One of the things he remembers about his childhood was the local newspaper running an April Fool's joke on April 1, 1994, about gay people and the KKK. The \\"joke\\" was that gay people and the KKK would march at a parade in the small conservative town. He writes in his book Soldier of Change: From the Closet to the Forefront of the Gay Rights Movement that as a child it bothered him, reinforcing the idea that it was wrong to be gay. Later in life, after all of the activism and publicity on September 27, 2014, the same newspaper honored him in an article about his activism. He uses this as an example of Trusting the Power of your voice and how it can change hearts and minds. In his book he details his coming out while at war. Describing the night of an artillery battle he writes: > All of the sudden there was a huge explosion off to our left. That was the > first time in my life I thought I might actually die. I happened to look up > at a picture of my brother and his girlfriend. All those years of hiding who > I was, being scared of it and not admitting or understanding it stopped > right then. My whole life had been fake. And if I were to die, I would have > never been honest with myself, never let myself love another person. I was > so scared, and I felt like I was going to die alone. He later discusses how a visit to Dachau when he lived in Germany also changed his life. He took photographs while visiting this holocaust site. One of the photos was a uniform with a pink triangle on it. He did not understand at the time what that meant, but later while in college he started wearing gay pride symbols and one of them was the pink triangle with the inscription \\"Silence = Death\\". He attributes that moment in his life to the moment when he was thrust into activism. He then started speaking out while in college at The Ohio State University. A student had written a letter in the college newspaper The Lantern Lantern Article. The student thanked gay people for leaving Columbus to march on Washington, and said that for the first time in his life he did not have to worry about contracting AIDS. This infuriated Snyder-Hill who, for the first time, publicly wrote back a response. Snyder-Hill wrote: \\"I have recently come out, I am no different than you; well, you know, I might be a little different - I just got back from defending my country in Operation Desert Storm. When I say defending my country I mean defending everyone, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation - that means everyone, including you. From this point on Snyder-Hill knew he had a calling to defend LGBT rights. He was out during college, but when he decided to re-join the US Army Reserve in March 2001, everything changed. He had to go back into the closet Military service Snyder-Hill served twenty-six years in the United States Army and Army Reserve in two stints, achieving the rank of major and earning the Meritorious Service Medal. He joined the army in 1988 at the age of 19, serving on active duty in Germany. He fought in the first Gulf War in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait before his honorable discharge in 1996. He came out after leaving the army, but when he reenlisted in 2001 he had to go back into the closet and hide his sexuality in order to serve because of the Clinton-era Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. He was deployed to Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn in 2010. Throughout his military career Snyder-Hill received numerous awards and decorations. Snyder-Hill's military awards include: Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal (w/ 1 Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster), Army Achievement Medal (w/ 1 Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster), Army Good Conduct Medal, Army Reserves Component Achievement Medal (w/ 3 Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters), National Defense Service Medal (w/ Bronze Service Star), Southwest Asia Service Medal (w/2 Bronze Stars), Iraqi Campaign Medial (w/ 1 Bronze Star), Global War on Terrorism Medal, Armed Forces Reserve Medal (w/ M Device, & 10 Year Bronze Hourglass), Army Service Ribbon, Army Overseas Service Ribbon (w/ #2 Designator), Saudi Arabian For The Liberation of Kuwait Ribbon, and five Arcams.

The US Army gave him and his husband a certificate of appreciation https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KywQJNuoGKUeNTS6le08of6SZIPKeGQI/view?usp=sharing (something that was only made possible after the fall of Don't Ask, Don't Tell). Booing at debate On September 22, 2011, at a Republican Party presidential debate in Orlando, Florida, before the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election, debate moderator Megyn Kelly directed to presidential hopeful Rick Santorum a question via a YouTube video message posed by Snyder-Hill, who was then serving in the U.S. Army in Iraq. Snyder-Hill asked whether the candidates' presidencies would \\"circumvent the progress that's been made for gay and lesbian soldiers in the military\\". In asking this question, Snyder- Hill publicly came out of the closet only two days after the official end of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Before Santorum responded, some audience members booed Snyder-Hill and then the audience loudly applauded Santorum when he said he would reinstate the ban on openly gay people serving in the military. The responses precipitated partisan reaction often chastising the audience, as well as Santorum and the other candidates, for remaining silent after the booing and not supporting the soldier. Several candidates said after the debate that they regretted not speaking up or could not hear the boos from the stage. Vice President Joe Biden called the candidates' silence on the stage after the soldier was booed \\"reprehensible\\", and in a speech at the Human Rights Campaign, President Barack Obama, who would face one of the Republican candidates in the upcoming election, sharply criticized them for remaining silent, saying: \\"You want to be commander-in-chief? You can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States, even when it's not politically convenient.\\" A few months later, first Biden and then Obama endorsed marriage equality. The booing incident at the debate was dramatized in the HBO television series The Newsroom. Steve Talks about his story in his presentation Soldier of Change: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSAHfvk_Xlg&feature;=youtu.be LGBT rights activism While a captain in the United States Army Reserve, Stephen Hill married Joshua Snyder in Washington, D.C., on May 3, 2011. Same-sex marriage was legal in Washington, but not yet across the United States. They were married in the Congressional Cemetery at the grave site of their personal hero Leonard Matlovich whose stone reads: \\"When I was in the military they gave me a medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one.\\" The couple petitioned to have their surnames combined to Snyder-Hill in the state of Ohio, which did not recognize their marriage at the time. The couple were advised to declare another, fictitious reason for the name change, but they refused. Interviewed on Current TV's The War Room, Hill said: \\"When the magistrate pulled us in there, she said that you can put any other reason on this application. ‚Ä¶ I'm not going to lie. That's one thing I have told myself since Don't Ask, Don't Tell was repealed. The Army accepts me. I'm not going to lie anymore to anybody else.\\" They sought and were granted judicial relief from a court in Columbus, Ohio. He was also interviewed on the local news channel 10 TV where he was quoted as saying, \\"I won't lie anymore, I did it for 20 years of my life, I served my country so I shouldn't have to lie on an application.\\" He and his husband were plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed by the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network challenging the Defense of Marriage Act and other federal statutes that prevented the military from providing equal protections and support to same-sex-marriage families, and lent their story to a video produced by the advocacy group Freedom to Marry supporting marriage equality. On Friday, June 21, 2013, Snyder-Hill and his husband Joshua arranged to have 25 LGBT couples married on the steps of the US Supreme Court right before the DOMA judgment. They were all married on the building's steps. During the ceremony, one of the guards came over and said to them that they were not allowed to protest, and he could not let them up on the grounds of the US Supreme Court as a group, but he said, \\"By God, nothing is preventing each couple from walking up there as a couple.\\" So they did just that. As they were married they each walked down the steps of the US Supreme court as Snyder-Hill and Joshua read out their married names.Columbus Dispatch 6/20/2013 The event attracted media and news coverage from their local Columbus News, to newspapers such as the Washington Blade.Washington Blade Volume 55 Issue 26 6/28/13 Snyder-Hill's story was featured on the front page of the LA Times on December 29, 2013. Reporter Christopher Goffard captured their story with the tagline, \\"America saw Stephen Hill's face for 15 seconds. It took him a lifetime to show it.\\" Snyder-Hill's book, Soldier of Change: From the Closet to the Forefront of the Gay Rights Movement, with a foreword by George Takei, is described by its publisher as the first memoir by military personnel about serving under the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. Snyder-Hill met with Columbus, Ohio Mayor Michael B. Coleman. He discussed his story with the Mayor, and shortly after that, the Mayor declared that he was joining the Mayors Freedom to Marry. Outlook magazine did a story on the event.Outlook Magazine March 25, 2013 Bob Vitale Snyder-Hill and his husband Joshua continue to travel as activists across the country telling their story. He uses the tagline \\"Trust the Power of your Voice\\" in speaking with universities and groups across the nation. He also did a TEDX Talk at Ohio State University in 2015 to a crowd of more than 4,000 people that ended in a standing ovation. Sexual assault claim In 1995, Snyder-Hill visited the Ohio State University (OSU) student health center. He was assigned Dr. Richard Strauss, whom he claims sexually assaulted him. He reported it to the university. He suggested changes to the university's policy and forms and reported it. The university responded that they would change their forms and that they would allow people to opt out of any uncomfortable body parts to be examined in future paperwork. The doctor was not reprimanded, or disciplined. In July 2018, Steve saw on TV that a sexual assault scandal was unfolding at Ohio State University. When he saw the doctor's face, he instantly recognized him from the 1990s. He requested his original complaint back from the 1990s and realized this was the same doctor. The original complaint as well as the letter from OSU was released by WOSU in 2018. He filed a lawsuit against OSU with other plaintiffs in 2018.

Australia Post claims that the card can be used as proof of identity in all states. It is a legitimate form of ID and is technically acceptable as proof of ID when entering licensed (alcohol-serving) venues or buying from packaged liquor stores and tobacco vendors. However, many venues will not accept the Keypass as ID, making the Learner's Permit or Driver's License a safer option as proof of ID. Additionally, Australia Post's website states that; \\"Australia Post has no control over where Keypass will be accepted\\". This is likely due to the Keypass being notoriously easy to fake.

Initially commanded by General Franz von Roques, it was an area of military jurisdiction behind Wehrmacht's Army Group North. The Group North Rear Area's outward function was to provide security behind the fighting troops. It was also a site of mass murder during The Holocaust and other crimes against humanity targeting the civilian population. In the words of historian Michael Parrish, the army commander \\"presided over an empire of terror and brutality\\". Organisation Lithuanian synagogue burn, 9 July 1941 The commander of the Army Group North Rear Area, General Franz von Roques, was responsible for the rear area security. Its headquarters was subordinated to Army Group North, while also reporting to the Wehrmacht's Quartermaster General Eduard Wagner, who had the overall responsibility for rear area security. The tasks also included transfer of prisoners of war to the rear. Roques controlled three Security Divisions (207th, 281st, and 285th) and oversaw the units of Secret Field Police of the Wehrmacht. He operated in parallel, and in cooperation, with Hans-Adolf Pr√ºtzmann and, since November 1941, with Friedrich Jeckeln, the Higher SS and Police Leaders appointed by the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler. Security warfare and crimes against humanity The area commanders' duties included security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combatting guerillas (partisans) in Wehrmacht's rear areas, which were the primary tasks of the security divisions. In addition, security and police formations of the SS and the SD (SS Security Service) operated in the areas, being subordinated to the respective Higher SS and Police Leaders. These units included multiple Einsatzgruppen death squad detachments, Police Regiment North and additional Order Police battalions. These units perpetrated mass murder during The Holocaust and other crimes against humanity. While under military jurisdiction, the area was the site of the Kaunas pogrom, instigated by the SD. During the same period, mass murder of POWs, Jews and other civilians took place at the 9th Fort. The security formations, often in coordination with or under the leadership of the Wehrmacht, conducted security warfare targeting civilian population. The so-called anti-partisan operations in \\"bandit- infested\\" areas amounted to destruction of villages, seizure of livestock, deporting of able-bodied population for slave labour to Germany and murder of those of non-working age.

The representative of the Islamist party Ennahdha for the Monastir riding, she was known for her humorous interventions during plenary sessions. Early life and education Toumia is a graduate of the Institute of Press and Information Sciences. Career Toumia worked at the Ministry of Agriculture for ten years, as well as writing articles for the newspaper L'Agruculteur and other publications. In 2009, she became a member of the Democratic Constitutional Rally, but she said in 2013 that she was sacked because of her refusal to praise the regime. After the 2011 revolution, Toumia joined Ennahdha and was on the list of candidates for the Monastir riding at the 2011 election. As a member of the constituent assembly, she became known for her humorous interventions during sessions. While many of her fellow female Islamist MPs only used classical Arabic, Toumia made comments in French, earning public mockery for her accent and lack of proficiency in the language, and leading to the party leaders asking her to stay away from the media. During the drafting of the new constitution, Toumia was indignant when lawyers described the draft as a step backward for women, arguing that it had been misunderstood. On 8 August 2014, Toumia announced that she had been removed from Ennahdha's lists for the forthcoming election saying that her \\"only wrong was her frankness, her courage and her imprint on the National Constituent Assembly.\\" As of 2016, she was working for the Ministry of Agriculture, and argued that she and four colleagues had not been promoted due to animosity toward her. Personal life Toumia is married and has three daughters. She is a Muslim and wears a hijab. In 2016, her brother, Sofiene Ben Toumia, was sentenced to 12 years in imprisonment for his role in recruiting young people to join terrorist groups.

During Operation Barbarossa, it was deployed in German-occupied areas of the Soviet Union, in the Army Group North Rear Area. The Police Regiment Centre was formed in June 1941 by combining three Order Police battalions and associated units. The regiment was subordinated to Hans-Adolf Pr√ºtzmann, the Higher SS and Police Leader (HSS-PF) for Army Group North. Alongside the Einsatzgruppen detachments, it perpetrated mass murder in the Holocaust. The information on the scope of the unit's activities remains limited as, in contrast to the Police Regiment Centre and South, the 1941 reports of the unit were not intercepted by the British intelligence. Pr√ºtzmann's command experienced communications difficulties during the summer of 1941. Then starting on September 12, the HSS-PF were instructed to not transmit their reports over the radio. Thus, none of its reports were decrypted as part of the operation Ultra, the British signals intelligence program.

She is the reigning FIS World Champion in slopestyle, winning the gold at the 2017 World Championships. Blouin won a silver medal in slopestyle at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Career Blouin was an entrant at the 2017 FIS World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain. In the final of the slopestyle event she scored a 78.00 holding off silver medalist Zoi Sadowski-Synnott who scored 77.50. She also finished 1st in qualifications and 6th in the final at the Big Air event. Blouin credited the \\"vibe\\" and atmosphere of Sierra Nevada for her world championship saying \\"I was not that stressed because the weather is so incredible here [and] the vibe is so fun. Before I dropped [in] I was super focused and I told myself I was just going to drop [in] and just have fun.\\" Building on her world championship Blouin went to the 2018 Winter Olympics as a strong medal hopeful. Those hopes seemed to be dashed when she crashed hard in training after her snowboard cut a rut and had to be carried off the slope on a stretcher. Teammate Mark McMorris would later say of her injury that \\"She whacked her noggin pretty good and cut up her face.\\" Defying the hard fall, Blouin had her name on the rider list for Sunday's qualifying runs. High winds delayed the qualifying and instead the final would be two runs for all the female athlete's the next day. In the final, high winds continued but the finals were not called off, controversially, as many riders would fall in the buffeting winds. Blouin, sporting a black eye from her crash, fell on her first run as well. Overcoming these plights, she ran a clean but easier attempt on the second run. On her third and final jump she only tried a cap single cab underflip instead of a double. This clean run was enough for her to win the silver medal behind American Jamie Anderson. Blouin acknowledged her difficult situation but despite it all said after that, \\"Now I'm here in second place, I just don't believe it. It's a dream come true.\\" Blouin made her World Cup debut at her home resort in Stoneham, Quebec in February 2012. Her first World Cup podium came when she finished second in slopestyle at the New Zealand Winter Games in August 2015. She claimed another World Cup silver at Seiser Alm, Italy in January 2017. Blouin wrapped up her 2016-17 season with a slopestyle victory at a World Snowboard Tour event, the Grandvalira Total Fight, in Andorra. Blouin won a slopesyle silver medal at the X-games in Aspen on January 25, 2020.
