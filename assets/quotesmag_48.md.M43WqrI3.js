There was a goods yard on the north side of the station. Within two years it was renamed as Ballachulish & Glencoe and renamed again following the opening of the 'new' road between Glencoe Village and Kinlochleven in 1908 as Ballachulish (Glencoe) for Kinlochleven. Apart for a short closure in 1953, this latter name remained until closure in 1966. In the railway timetables the name was shortened to simply Ballachulish with a note stating \\"Ballachulish is the Station for Glencoe and Kinlochleven\\".Table 33, British Railways, Passenger Services Scotland summer 1962. The station was opened by the Callander and Oban Railway, which was absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948, and was closed by the British Railways Board in 1966, when the Ballachulish Branch closed. In the early 1990s the station buildings were converted into a medical centre. Houses have been built in the station yard. The engine shed remained, being used by a local garage until 2015, when it was demolished to make way for more private housing.  Signalling  Throughout its existence, the Ballachulish Branch was worked by the electric token system. Ballachulish signal box was located west of the platforms, on the north side of the railway.

The house is situated on the island of Key West in Florida. It is at 907 Whitehead Street, across from the Key West Lighthouse, close to the southern coast of the island. Due to its association with Hemingway, the property is the most popular tourist attraction in Key West.McIver (2002), p. 85. It is also famous for its large population of so- called Hemingway cats, many of which are polydactyl. The residence was constructed in 1851 in a French Colonial style by wealthy marine architect and salvager Asa Tift. From 1931 to 1939, the house was inhabited by Hemingway and his wife Pauline. They restored the decaying property and made several additions. During his time at the home, Hemingway wrote some of his best received works, including the 1936 short stories \\"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\\" and \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\", the novels To Have And Have Not (1937) and Islands in the Stream (1970), and the non-fiction work Green Hills of Africa (1935). After the Hemingway's divorce and deaths, the house was auctioned off and subsequently converted into a private museum in 1964. On November 24, 1968, it was designated a National Historic Landmark. History Early history Construction on the house began in 1848 and was completed in 1851 by Asa Tift, a marine architect and salvage wrecker, in a French Colonial estate style. The house stands at an elevation of above sea level, the second-highest site on the island. The house's limestone walls are 18 inches thick, which has protected it during tropical storms and hurricanes. Hemingway Ernest Hemingway with wife Pauline on the house's grounds in the 1930s In 1928, Ernest Hemingway, generally regarded as one of the greatest American writers of his time, and his wife Pauline Pfeiffer moved to Key West, where they spent the next three years living in rented housing, the last being a two-story home at 1301 Whitehead Street. When Pauline had first seen 907 Whitehead Street during a house-scouting tour, she labeled it a \\"damned haunted house\\".McIver (2002), p. 17. At the time, the house was in foreclosure and was in deep disrepair. However, after recognizing its potential, she convinced her wealthy Uncle Gus to purchase it at $8,000 for her and Ernest as a wedding present.McIver (2002), p. 18. Ernest appreciated the seclusion that the 1.5 acre lot would offer him while writing his works. Employing out-of- work Conchs, the Hemingways restored the entire house. Most of the house's inner furnishings were selected by Pauline, but Ernest insisted on the inclusion of his hunting trophies.McIver (2002), p. 21. At the cost of air circulation, Pauline replaced the house's ceiling fans with chandeliers. The couple also converted the second story of the carriage house into a writing studio for Ernest and transformed the basement into a wine cellar.McIver (2002), p. 19. Hemingway's writing studio While Hemingway was reporting in Spain in 1937, Pauline installed a large pool on the grounds.McIver (2002), pp. 21-22. The first swimming pool in the Florida Keys, the 75 x 25 foot 80,000 gallon pool was immensely expensive. At $20,000, it was two and a half times the purchase price of the entire property.McIver (2002), pp. 21-22. Upon his return, Hemingway was irate at the costly addition. With melodramatic flourish, he threw a penny from his pocket onto the ground, declaring, \\"You might as well take my last cent,\\" despite the fact that Pauline had paid for it herself. She kept the penny and later had it embedded in the concrete.McIver (2002), pp. 21-22. Despite his initial rage, the pool grew on Hemingway and he later had a 6-foot brick wall erected around the property so that he could swim in the nude. Hemingway also kept peacocks on the property and organized boxing matches on the lawn. While living at the house, Hemingway wrote some of his best work, including the short story classics \\"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\\" and \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\", his 1937 novel To Have And Have Not, and the non-fiction work Green Hills of Africa. After his death, a manuscript was discovered in a vault in the garage; this work was published posthumously in 1970 as Islands in the Stream. After eight years of residing at the house, Hemingway moved to Cuba in 1939. Following their divorce, Pauline lived in the house until her death in 1951. It then remained in Hemingway's possession until his suicide in 1961. His three sons auctioned off the house for $80,000.McIver (2002), p. 108. Modern museum Tourists visiting the home in 2019 The new owners intended to use the Hemingway House as a private residence. However, due to persistent interest from visitors, they opened the house to the public as a museum in 1964. Although Hemingway's family had taken away much of the furnishings, the owners still possessed the bulkier furniture and many of Hemingway's possessions. As a result of not all furniture being original, the authenticity of the museum has received some criticism. Today, visitors can explore all of the house's rooms except for Hemingway's writing room, which can only be viewed through a screen. Before Hurricane Irma struck the Keys in September 2017, the entire population of the island chain were ordered to evacuate by the federal government, but the museum's curator, general manager and a team of employees declined to leave the house or evacuate its cats. Hemingway's granddaughter also urged them to evacuate, saying, \\"It's just a house.\\" Instead, several employees chose to stay with the cats and the house. They all survived the storm intact. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent decline in tourism, the museum laid off over 30 employees. Cats One of the many polydactyl cats that live on the property The house and its grounds are inhabited by dozens of cats, commonly called Hemingway cats. Around half are polydactyl, sporting six toes on each paw. The cats bear the names of celebrities, such as Humphrey Bogart or Marilyn Monroe, and have their own cemetery in the house's garden. Legend has it that all cats on the property are descended from Snowball, a white six-toed cat given as a gift to the Hemingways by a sea-captain. However, Hemingway's niece, Hilary, and his son, Patrick, have both contested the claim that Hemingway owned cats in Key West. A neighbor allegedly owned several polydactyl cats and some, such as Hilary, have suggested that these are the forebears of the Hemingway cats. Adding to the confusion, a photograph exists of a young Patrick and Gregory (another son of Hemingway) playing with a white cat in Key West. When asked about the image, Patrick said he could not remember the incident.Brennen & Hemingway (2015), Ch. 9. Beginning in 2003, the museum was embroiled in a nine-year legal struggle against the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) over whether the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, which typically regulates zoos and circuses with big cats, applied to the museum's six-toed cat population. The USDA argued that the Hemingway House was essentially a zoo, with the cats functioning as an exhibit. The USDA even sent undercover agents to monitor the cats in 2005 and 2006. The museum owners contested the USDA's claims in court. When an investigator for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) examined the cats in 2005, they concluded: \\"What I found was a bunch of fat, happy and relaxed cats.\\" Ultimately in 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled that the Animal Welfare Act was applicable because the museum used cats in advertisements and sold cat-themed merchandise.

Early life Bassett was born to Herb Bassett and Elizabeth Chamberlain Bassett near Browns Park, Colorado, but grew up in Utah, the second of two daughters. Her sister Josie was born in 1874. Herb Bassett was twenty years senior to his wife Elizabeth Chamberlain Bassett, and the couple moved to Browns Park some time around the earlier part of 1888. Herb Bassett had a profitable cattle ranch which straddled Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. He often did business with notable outlaws of the era such as Butch Cassidy, Harvey \\"Kid Curry\\" Logan, and Black Jack Ketchum, selling them horses and beef for supplies. The park, as Browns Park is known, had been a haven for outlaws long before Butch and the boys started running stolen livestock through there. For decades stolen horseflesh was trailed through the park to thriving mining communities in Eastern Colorado. Both Ann and Josie Bassett were attractive young women, well taught by their father in the arts of horse riding, roping, and shooting. Both were educated early on in prominent boarding schools, were intelligent and articulate in their speech, but chose to return to the life of ranching. Many accounts state the sisters always preferred \\"cowboying\\" to being a lady. By the time Ann Bassett was 15, she had become involved romantically with Butch Cassidy. Her sister Josie was involved with Elzy Lay. Outlaws Ben Kilpatrick and Will \\"News\\" Carver, who were both later members of the Wild Bunch gang, also dated the sisters. These associations were what first exposed Bassett to outlaws. Association with outlaws In 1896, several wealthy cattle barons in the area made attempts to purchase the Bassett ranch from the Bassetts. When the Bassetts refused, the barons began to rustle their cattle. Ann and her sister Josie, in turn, rustled cattle from them. This led to a feud, and resulted in the cattlemen bringing in killer for hire Tom Horn to deal with what the cattlemen deemed to be criminals. Horn eliminated several known rustlers during that time but took no action against the Bassetts. While he also killed two rustlers in 1900, Isom Dart and Matt Rash (a sandy-haired Texas cowboy), who were known to be associated with the Bassett family, this was unrelated to the Bassett conflict with their neighbors. By 1896, Josie Bassett was heavily involved in a relationship with Elzy Lay, Cassidy's closest friend. Josie had also become involved with Cassidy shortly after his release from an eighteen-month prison sentence, during which time Ann was involved with Ben Kilpatrick. When Elzy Lay began a relationship with a woman named Maude Davis, Josie became involved with Will \\"News\\" Carver, and Ann returned to her involvement with Cassidy. Through their relationships with the outlaws, and in exchange for their supplying the outlaws with beef and fresh horses from their ranch, the two sisters were in a position to get assistance from Cassidy and his gang in dealing with certain cattlemen who were pressing them to sell. This association was a deterrent that kept cowboys hired to harass the sisters from doing so, for fear of retribution from the outlaws. There was a report that Kid Curry, the most feared member of the Wild Bunch gang, once paid a visit to several cowboys known to be employed by the cattlemen, warning them to leave the Bassetts alone. That cannot be confirmed, but although the problems with the wealthy cattlemen's association continued well into 1902, by late 1899 the problems were rare, and there was little pressure placed on the sisters to sell their ranch. Despite the seemingly constant changes in romantic partners by both the Bassett sisters and the gang members, there is no report of there being any animosity as a result of this. Although both sisters were taking part in the fight against the powerful cattlemen's associations, it was Ann that became better known, with newspapers as well as friends dubbing her \\"Queen Ann Bassett\\". In early 1897, Bassett joined Cassidy at Robbers Roost. Elzy Lay, having ended his relationship with Josie Bassett, joined them with his girlfriend and future wife Maude Davis. According to reports of the day, Bassett and Davis were two of only five women ever allowed into the Robbers Roost hideout, the other three being Josie Bassett, the Sundance Kid's girlfriend Etta Place, and Wild Bunch gang member Laura Bullion. By April, 1897, the two women were sent home so Cassidy and his gang could concentrate on their next robbery. Cassidy would continue his romantic involvement with Bassett off and on for another four years, seeing her whenever he was near her ranch. The total length of their relationship was around seven years, but was interrupted often with his being away, and for an eighteen-month period when he was in prison starting in 1894, during which time she was involved with Ben Kilpatrick. By 1903, Bassett had married a rancher by the name of Hyrum \\"Hi\\" Henry Bernard. Shortly after the marriage, she was arrested for cattle rustling. She stood trial, but was acquitted and released. The marriage lasted six years, ending in divorce, with Bernard helping Bassett and her sister Josie in maintaining their ranch. By 1904, most of the outlaws associated with the Bassett girls were either dead or had been captured by lawmen. Ann Bassett never saw Cassidy again after he first departed for South America. Several other outlaws from lesser known gangs drifted in and out of the ranch, usually visiting only to obtain beef or fresh horses, and have a place to stay for a few days. Elzy Lay reportedly visited the ranch again in 1906, shortly after his release from prison, before moving on to California where he lived out the remainder of his life as a respectable businessman. Herb Bassett died on July 30, 1918. Later life Ann Bassett remarried in 1928 to cattleman Frank Willis. The couple remained in Utah, where they maintained a ranch. She remained there for the rest of her life. Willis reportedly loved her dearly, and the two worked closely together in their business. Before she died, she requested that she be cremated, and that her remains be spread across her hometown in northern Utah. However, Willis is alleged to have grieved greatly over her death, and was unable to complete that task, keeping her ashes in his car for the remainder of his life. When he died in 1963, friends and family were the ones who buried her ashes in an undisclosed area in Browns Park. Alleged Ann Bassett‚ÄìEtta Place connection Ann Bassett and Etta Place, the girlfriend of the Sundance Kid, have often been alleged to have been the same person. In spite of enthusiastic efforts to conflate them as one and the same, evidence confirms that Bassett was under arrest for cattle rustling in Utah while Place was in South America with Cassidy and Longabaugh in 1903. Still, some speculators insist Bassett led a double life, dating Cassidy as Ann Bassett, and the Sundance Kid as Etta Place. Reports by the Pinkerton National Detective Agency provide almost identical descriptions of both women, describing them as having classic good looks, articulate speech and intelligence, the same hair color, as being good with a rifle and riding a horse, and being very promiscuous for the period, both having openly taken several lovers in a period when one did not generally flaunt such relationships. This would mean that at some point she was involved with both outlaws at the same time, apparently with their full knowledge, but by 1900, when in their company, she simply went by the name of Etta Place. Place mysteriously disappears from all public records in 1909, not long after the death of the Sundance Kid. When comparing the best legitimate photograph of Place with the best photograph of Bassett, it appears that at least, the women could have been mistaken for one another. Both are pretty, with similar facial features, hair color, and physical build. Michael Rutters' book Bad Girls details how Bassett often faked a New England accent in order to appear more cultured. Similarly, Place was said to have indicated that she was from the East Coast, though she never revealed an exact location. Stronger evidence comes from Dr. Thomas G. Kyle of the Computer Research Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory, who has previously performed many such comparisons for government intelligence agencies. He conducted a series of tests on photographs of Etta Place and Ann Bassett. Their features matched and both had the same scar or cowlick at the top of their forehead. He concluded that there could be no reasonable doubt that they were the same person. Author and researcher Doris Karren Burton indicates in her 1992 book Queen Ann Bassett: Alias Etta Place that when Bassett is absent from historical records, Place is actively traveling with Cassidy and the Sundance Kid/Harry Longabaugh, and when Place is absent from historical records, Bassett is visible. However, Burton did not account for documented instances showing Bassett to have been in the United States at the same time that Etta Place was known to have been in South America. Bassett was under arrest for cattle rustling in Utah while Place, who had departed for South America with Longabaugh in August, 1902, was there with Cassidy and Longabaugh until returning to the United States (via New York City) in the summer of 1904. In 1903 alone Bassett was married, incarcerated, tried, and released over a span of several months. Further, Bassett never claimed to have been Etta Place, even in her memoirs.

The screenplay by Hunt, Alice Arlen, and Victor Levin is very loosely based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Elinor Lipman. The film marked Hunt's feature film directorial debut. Plot Deeply religious April Epner, a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher, finds her life derailed by a series of events over which she has no control. Her husband Ben abruptly leaves her, her abrasive adoptive mother Trudy passes away the following day, and shortly after she is contacted by Alan, a representative of Bernice Graves, the flamboyant host of a local talk show, who introduces herself as her biological mother. Although intrigued by Bernice's claim that she was fathered by Steve McQueen, April initially resists her efforts to forge a relationship. At the same time, she finds herself attracted to Frank, the divorced father of one of her students, as the two get to know each other via lengthy telephone conversations. For their first date he escorts her to a party at Bernice's apartment. Complications arise when April discovers she is pregnant, the result of a quick and clumsy coupling with Ben on the kitchen floor just before he left her. April has longed to have a child all her life and is delighted with the news, but is confused and upset by Ben's sudden return, Frank's hasty departure (when he discovers April and Ben had a \\"quickie\\" after visiting the gynecologist), and Bernice's insistent attempts to create a bond between them. Not helping the situation is the discovery Bernice voluntarily put her up for adoption a full year after her birth and not three days later at the urging of her parents, according to the scenario she initially presented. When April miscarries, her brother Freddy tries to counsel her, but ultimately she must rely on her deep-rooted faith to deal with the betrayals she has suffered not only at the hands of those she trusted but by the God she worships as well. Eventually she offers reconciliation and forgiveness to Bernice, if Bernice will agree to \\"buy\\" a baby for her. Bernice agrees, and then Frank forgives April when she goes to him to apologize for her behavior. Later, the ending shows that April could not have the baby which Bernice paid for, so she adopted another child.

After first reading it she tried to interest numerous studios in the material, and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself. Longtime friend Matthew Broderick agreed to play the relatively small role of Ben for scale, and his commitment inspired Hunt to approach Bette Midler and Colin Firth, who were impressed by her passion for the project and agreed to work for minimum pay as well. Although she originally did not intend to portray April, Hunt decided that casting herself in the role ultimately would lighten her work load as a director since she would have one less performance to help mould. Janeane Garofalo and Tim Robbins make brief cameo appearances as themselves. The author Salman Rushdie portrays Dr. Masani. The film was shot on location in Brooklyn, including the waterfront community of Gerritsen Beach, and Manhattan. Interiors were filmed at Steiner Studios in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The film's soundtrack includes \\"For You\\" by Duncan Sheik, \\"In The Red\\" by Tina Dickow, \\"I'll Say I'm Sorry Now\\" by Shawn Colvin, \\"Naked As We Came\\" by Iron & Wine, and \\"Cool, Clear Water\\" by Bonnie Raitt.

Critical reception Critical response to the film was mixed, and it received a 50% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Whereas some critics praised the film for having strong performances, others felt the film was bogged down by a weak script and technical issues. Fans of the book took issue with the substantial differences between the book and the movie. Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle observed, \\"You would think that frontloading Then She Found Me with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera. But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways. First she turns in a touchingly real performance, the best of her big-screen career. Forget that As Good as It Gets won her an Oscar. She's eons better and more realistic in this one . . . By directing Then She Found Me, Helen becomes its savior as well . . .

Inbound trains stop at the west end of the platform to unload passengers, before pulling forward to the east end to allow boarding. Once trains are ready to depart, they do so via a mid-platform cross-over onto the northern track. The station has no above ground buildings, save for concrete shelters offering some weather protection to the staircases linking the platform to the street. Alternative access is provided via an underground shopping mall, which connects the station to Warszawa Centralna and the street-level tram stops.

It is known only from a handful of specimens collected from the cold oceanic waters of the Southern Hemisphere, between the surface and a depth of . Reaching in length, this diminutive shark is characterized by a slender, dark brown body with a very long, bulbous snout. In addition, it has two spineless dorsal fins of nearly equal size, with the origin of the first lying over the pectoral fin bases. The longnose pygmy shark does not appear substantially threatened by fisheries, and has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Taxonomy The longnose pygmy shark was described by American zoologist Henry Weed Fowler in a 1934 volume of Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, based on a long female collected off Point Ocean Beach in Durban, South Africa. Fowler had originally thought the shark to belong to the genus Heteroscymnus (a junior synonym of Somniosus), and thus he created for it the new genus Heteroscymnoides from the Greek oidos (\\"resemblance\\"). He gave it the specific epithet marleyi in honor of Harold Walter Bell-Marley, and his contributions to the study of South African fishes. The relationship between Heteroscymnoides and the rest of its family is uncertain. Distribution and habitat The longnose pygmy shark has been caught in the western Indian Ocean off eastern KwaZulu-Natal, in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean near the Walvis Ridge, and in the southwestern Pacific Ocean off Chile. These records suggest that it may have a circumglobal distribution in the Southern Hemisphere, inhabiting subantarctic waters and cold ocean currents, including the Benguela and the Humboldt. This species occurs in the open ocean between the surface and a depth of , in water deep. Description The largest known specimen of the longnose pygmy shark is a male long. Its body is slender and moderately compressed from side to side. The long, bulbous snout comprises about half the head length, and comes to a blunt, conical tip. The eyes are large, lack nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids), and are followed by large spiracles. The nostrils are long and angled, with a very short flap of skin on their anterior rims. The mouth is transverse and surrounded by thin, smooth lips. The upper teeth number 22 rows and are small and upright with a single narrow cusp. The lower teeth number 23 rows and are much larger, broader, and knife-like, and interlock to form a continuous cutting surface. The five pairs of gill slits are tiny and of uniform width. The two dorsal fins lack spines. The first dorsal originates over the pectoral fin bases; the second dorsal is slightly larger than the first but is about equal in base length, and originates over the middle of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are short and somewhat paddle-like. There is no anal fin. The caudal fin is broad, with a well-developed lower lobe and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The small dermal denticles have sharp wedge-shaped crowns bearing median ridges, and are placed on stalks (pedicels). This species is dark brown, with prominent blackish, then light bands at the fin margins. The underside is covered by minute light-producing photophores. Biology and ecology The natural history of the longnose pygmy shark is poorly known. It probably feeds on pelagic fishes and invertebrates, and is presumably aplacental viviparous with a small litter size like other members of its family. The long type specimen had an umbilical scar, suggesting that it was close to the birth size. Males and females attain sexual maturity at under long respectively. Human interactions Only six specimens of the longnose pygmy shark are known to science. Its small size and oceanic habits appear to preclude its capture by most fisheries. Coupled with its wide distribution, this species does not seem threatened by human activity and has been listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

It may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and civilians under military command, and is presented to the recipient by the Governor-General of New Zealand during an investiture held at Government House, Wellington. As the highest award for gallantry in New Zealand it takes precedence over all other postnominals and medals. The Victoria Cross for New Zealand was established in 1999 when New Zealand created a new award system that replaced several Commonwealth honours with New Zealand awards. It has been awarded once, on 2 July 2007 to Corporal Willie Apiata for actions in 2004. The original British Victoria Cross was introduced in 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War. That medal had been awarded 25 times to 24 individual military personnel from New Zealand; Captain Charles Upham receiving a bar. Only 14 medals have been awarded since the end of the Second World War. The medal is made from the gunmetal of a weapon supposedly captured at the siege of Sevastopol, but several historians have since questioned the true origin of the gunmetal. Originally all Commonwealth recipients were issued with the same award, but over the last 50 years, some Commonwealth countries have introduced separate award systems; three of these retain \\"Victoria Cross\\" as part of the name of the highest award for gallantry.  Origin   Victoria Cross  The original Victoria Cross was created by Queen Victoria in 1856 to recognise incidents of gallantry that were unconnected with a man's lengthy or meritorious service. She signed a Royal Warrant on 29 January 1856 that officially instituted the VC.VCH, Ashcroft, Introduction The order was retroactive to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the Crimean War.Ashcroft, Michael, pp. 7‚Äì10 The Australian and New Zealand Victoria Crosses are made from the same gunmetal as the originals. It was originally intended that the VCs would be cast from the bronze cascabels of two cannon that were captured from the Russians at the siege of Sevastopol.Beharry, p.359 The historian John Glanfield has since shown that the metal used for VCs is in fact from Chinese cannon not Russian, and their origin is a mystery. The barrels of the cannon in question are stationed outside the Officers' Mess at the Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich. The remaining portion of the only remaining cascabel, weighing 10 kilograms (385 oz), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps at MoD Donnington. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, Hancocks of London, has been responsible for the production of every VC.  Separate Commonwealth awards  Victoria Cross plaque, Queens Gardens, Dunedin. Showing the addition (lower right) of the only Victoria Cross for New Zealand yet given. In the last 60 years several Commonwealth countries have introduced their own honours systems, separate from the British Honours System. Australia, Canada and New Zealand have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such as the Military Cross with their own awards. Most Commonwealth countries, however, still recognise some form of the VC as their highest decoration for valour. The Gazette containing the most up-to-date Order of Precedence Australia was the first Commonwealth nation to create its own VC, on 15 January 1991. Although it is a separate award, its appearance is identical to its British counterpart. Canada followed suit when in 1993 Queen Elizabeth signed Letters Patent creating the Canadian VC, which is also similar to the British version, except that the legend has been changed from FOR VALOUR to the Latin PRO VALORE. The New Zealand and Australian awards are still made by the jewellers Hancocks from the gunmetal used for the originals. The Canadian Victoria Cross also includes metal from the same cannon, along with copper and other metals from all regions of Canada. New Zealand was the third country to create the VC as part of its own honours system. On 21 September 1999, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced that the Queen had approved the formal institution of a new range of Royal awards to recognise acts of gallantry and bravery performed by New Zealanders. The awards were designed to be the final major element in the development of a distinct New Zealand Royal honours system. The start of the process came with proposals released in 1995 by the Honours Advisory Committee that reviewed the honours system. Until May 1996, New Zealand made recommendations for various British awards for acts of gallantry performed during military operations and acts of bravery by civilians including the Victoria Cross and George Cross. However, the British Government's review and simplification of their awards system provided an ideal opportunity for New Zealand to also develop a unique and simplified system.  Appearance  The Victoria Cross for New Zealand is identical to the original design. The decoration is a cross patt√©e, high, wide, bearing a crown surmounted by a lion, and the inscription FOR VALOUR.Original Warrant, Clause 1: \\"Firstly. It is ordained that the distinction shall be styled and designated \\"The Victoria Cross\\", and shall consist of a Maltese cross of bronze, with our Royal crest in the centre, and underneath with an escroll bearing the inscription 'For Valour'.\\" This was originally to have been FOR BRAVERY, until it was changed on the recommendation of Queen Victoria, who thought some might erroneously consider that only the recipients of the VC were brave in battle. The decoration, suspension bar and link weigh about 27 grams (0.87 troy ounces).Ashcroft, Michael, p.16 The cross is suspended by a ring from a seriffed \\"V\\" to a bar ornamented with laurel leaves, through which the ribbon passes. The reverse of the suspension bar is engraved with the recipient's name, rank, number and unit. On the reverse of the medal is a circular panel on which the date of the act for which it was awarded is engraved in the centre. The ribbon is crimson, 38 millimetres (1.5 inches) wide. Although the warrants state the colour as being red it is described by most commentators as being crimson or \\"wine-red\\".  Conferment  The Victoria Cross for New Zealand is awarded for The power of awarding the medal officially resides with the Queen of New Zealand. The Royal Warrant states that the \\"Awards of a New Zealand Gallantry Award and of a Bar to an Award shall be made by Us, Our Heirs and Successors, only on a recommendation by Our Prime Minister of New Zealand or a Minister of the Crown acting for Our Prime Minister.\\" As with the original Victoria Cross any recommendations pass through the New Zealand Defence Force chain of command to the Minister of Defence. The original Victoria Cross had been awarded to 24 New Zealanders.Some recipients were serving with purely British units at the time of their award. Thirteen of these awards were for action in the First World War. The Victoria Cross for New Zealand has been awarded once. It was officially announced on 2 July 2007 that Corporal Willie Apiata of the NZ SAS was awarded the Victoria Cross for New Zealand for his actions in saving the life of a \\"comrade under heavy fire from opposing forces\\" during the Afghanistan conflict in 2004. Apiata received his medal from Governor-General Anand Satyanand at a ceremony held at Government House, Wellington on 26 July 2007.

Built sometime before 1763, it is one of the few houses in Florida to survive from the first period of Spanish Florida. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on April 15, 1970. The house is now managed by the St. Augustine Historical Society as an event venue.  Description and history  The Llambias House is located in a residential area south of downtown St. Augustine, on the south side of Saint Francis Street between Charlotte and St. George Streets. It is a two-story structure, built mainly out of plastered coquina limestone and covered by a dormered hip roof. The street-facing facade has two windows on the ground floor, and an overhanging wood-frame balcony on the second floor, with symmetrically placed entrances at the center flanked by windows on the outside. The property includes a kitchen located in an outbuilding, which is also built of coquina. The house's initial construction date is not known. When Florida was turned over the Great Britain by the Spanish in 1763, this house, then a single-story structure, was already standing. That structure's plan is a common variant of the so-called \\"St. Augustine plan\\", a house design that the Spanish developed to deal with Florida's heat and humidity. A typical house of this plan has an open loggia chamber at one end, whereas this house has a wood-frame veranda instead. The building was enlarged in 1777-78 Juan Andreu, who added the second floor, and installed windows into previously unglazed window openings. The house was acquired by Catalinas Llambias in 1854, in whose family it remained until 1919. It was given to the city in 1954, at which time it underwent a major restoration.

Location and interchanges The entire length of Allen Parkway is considered a limited-access parkway and closely follows the south bank of Buffalo Bayou. Memorial Drive, another limited-access parkway, closely follows the north bank of the bayou. Allen Parkway passes under Studemont Street/Montrose Boulevard, Waugh Drive, and Shepherd Drive. At the Waugh Drive and Studemont/Montrose interchanges, which have exit and entrance ramps and feeder roads on each side, Allen Parkway is below grade. The south side (eastbound) has continuous feeder roads, the north side (westbound) has discontinuous feeder roads. Access is not controlled at Dunlavy Street, where traffic to or from Allen Parkway can cross the median. A continuous green T-intersection at Taft Street, allowing controlled access for westbound traffic, with a stoplight for eastbound traffic existed prior to 2015 where the conversion of the westbound lanes to parking spaces (east of Montrose Boulevard) eliminated the intersection where the Taft and Gillette Street intersections have traffic signals.

One oddity of the metered parking spaces is that the meters operate on Sundays - same with the Washington Avenue Parking Management District (Downtown Houston (including those in Midtown) parking meters are not operational on Sundays).

The Financial Services Forum is an American, non-partisan economic policy and advocacy organization whose members are the chief executive officers of the eight largest and most diversified financial institutions headquartered in the United States. Recent News On September 20, 2017, the Forum announced the appointment of Kevin Fromer as its new President and Chief Executive Officer.https://financialregnews.com/fromer- picked-lead-financial-services-forum/ In January 2019, the Financial Services Forum announced that Morgan Stanley Chairman and CEO James Gorman would serve as the Chairman of its Board, a position previously held by Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America. Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat assumed the Board's Vice Chairman role in 2019. Mission and Leadership The Financial Services Forum represents the interests and views of the eight largest and most diversified financial institutions headquartered in the United States. The Forum members are Bank of America, BNY Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, State Street Corporation and Wells Fargo. These internationally active institutions are a leading source of lending and investment in the United States and serve millions of consumers, businesses, investors and communities throughout the country. The Forum works to advance policies that promote savings and investment, deep and liquid capital markets, a competitive global marketplace, and a sound financial system. It also develops evidence-based information on the value of its members to the U.S. economy and communities. Forum members employ 755,000 people in the United States. Since the financial crisis, the eight members of the Forum have taken significant steps to enhance the safety and resilience of their institutions and, as a consequence, the financial system as a whole. Forum members doubled their liquidity and increased their capital, which acts as a cushion against losses, by more than 40 percent from 2010 to 2020. Forum members have actively worked to support customers, communities and the economy during the COVID-19 crisis. Through the Forum, the members announced in March 2020 that they were suspending share buybacks and were accessing the Federal Reserve‚Äôs discount window. The Forum also joined other trade groups in advocating for support for U.S. businesses and consumers, such as supporting additional funds for the Paycheck Protection Program to support small businesses. Origin of the Forum The Financial Services Forum was established in 2000 by a core group of financial institution chief executive officers (CEO) following the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (GLBA). The Forum‚Äôs membership expanded and changed over time and in 2017, the Forum was reconstituted to represent solely the interests and views of the CEOs of the eight U.S.-based banks that had been designated as Global Systemically Important Financial Institutions.

With a construction history dating to about 1723, it is believed to be the oldest surviving house in St. Augustine. It is also an important example of the St. Augustine's Spanish colonial architectural style, with later modifications by English owners. It was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1970. The house is now owned by the St. Augustine Historical Society and is open for public tours as part of the Oldest House Museum Complex. Evidence can be seen of the Spanish, British, and American occupations of St. Augustine. Description and history The Gonz√°lez‚ÄìAlvarez House is located in a residential area south of downtown St. Augustine, on the north side of St. Francis Street between Charlotte and Marine Streets. It is a two-story structure, its first floor built of coquina and its upper level framed in wood with a clapboarded exterior. It is covered by a hip roof finished with wooden shingles. The building is reflective of multiple periods of alteration and enlargement, during different periods of colonial administration. The land on which this house stands has been occupied since the 17th century, when a building is documented to have been standing here. The present house's earliest period of construction dates to about 1723, when the first floor was built, and it was documented as being occupied by Tom√°s Gonz√°lez y Hern√°ndez, an artilleryman at the Castillo de San Marcos, and his family. The design of this house is one that was adopted by Spanish colonial settlers to deal with local living conditions and available building materials. It was built of readily available coquina limestone, with its main thick walls oriented east‚Äìwest, and has an open covered loggia on the east side. The latter allows prevailing southeasterly winds to cool the structure, while the thick walls provide insulation from hot weather. The interior floors are made of tabby concrete. After the British took over Florida in 1763, the Gonz√°lez family left for Cuba. In 1774 the house was purchased by Major Joseph Peavett, an Englishman, who added the wood-frame second story, and put glass windows into openings previously only enclosed by wooden shutters. It was further enlarged by the third owner, Geronimo Alvarez, who added a two-story wing built of coquina. The house was taken over by the St. Augustine Historical Society in 1918, which undertook its restoration to a late 19th-century appearance in 1959-60, reversing a number of intervening alterations.

He made a profession of faith when he was 17 and was then prepared for the Presbyterian ministry at Phillips Academy (1825‚Äì27), Andover Theological Seminary (1827‚Äì29), and Princeton Theological Seminary (1829‚Äì30). In 1846, Jones received an honorary doctor of divinity degree from Jefferson College, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Career While in the North, Jones agonized over the morality of owning slaves,Erskine Clarke, Dwelling Place: A Plantation Epic (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005),82-96. but he returned to Liberty County to become a planter, a fervent missionary to the slaves, sometimes called the \\"Apostle to Slaves,\\" and a somewhat reluctant defender of the institution of slavery.

Besides many tracts and papers, Jones published several books including The Religious Instruction of the Negroes in the United States (1842), an appeal to slave owners and ministers to provide religious instruction to slaves. Jones's Catechism of Scripture Doctrine and Practice (1837) was translated into Armenian and Chinese, and he also wrote History of the Church of God (1867).

When using the scale to diagnose depression according to ICD-10, there are the following possibilities: * Mild depression: A score of 4 or 5 in two of the first three items. Plus a score of at least 3 on two or three of the last seven items. * Moderate depression: A score of 4 or 5 in two or three of the first three items. Plus a score of at least 3 on four of the last seven items. * Severe depression: A score of 4 or 5 in all of the first three items. Plus a score of at least 3 on five or more of the last seven items. * Major depression: The number of items is reduced to nine, as Item 4 is part of Item 5. Include whichever of the two items has the highest score (item 4 or 5). A score on at least five items is required, to be scored as follows: the score on the first three items must be at least 4, and on the other items at least 3.

According to the legendary Sanskrit epics of India, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, there was once a dense forest area named Dandakaranya, in the region where Kanker is located. According to myth, Kanker was also a land of monks and sages. Many Rishis (monks/sages) such as Kank, Lomesh, Shringi, Angira were said to have lived here. The influence of Buddhism on the region started in the sixth century BC. The ancient history of Kanker records that it always remained an independent state.http://planningonline.gov.in/data/report/DP2010-2011_381Merge.pdf In 106 AD, the Kanker state was under the rule of the Satvahana dynasty and the king was Satkarni, This fact is also described by Chinese visitor Whensaung. After Satvahana rule, the state was under the control of the Nags, Vakataks, Gupt, Nal and Chalukya dynasties. The Som dynasty was founded by the king Singh Raj, and this dynasty ruled the state from 1125 to 1344. After the downfall of the Som dynasty, Dharam Dev founded the Kandra dynasty which ruled the state up to 1385. After the downfall of the Kandra dynasty, the Chandra dynasty came.

Because the British government gave the adoption to Narhari Dev, he acknowledged fealty to the British. In 1882, the control of Kanker State was handed over to Commissioner Raipur. The rule of Narhar Deo saw the construction of many buildings, including a palace near Gadiya Mountain, a printing press, a library, Radhakrishna Temple, Ramjanki Temple, Jagannath Temple and Balaji Temple. Narhar Deo made a plan termed 'Ratna Bhandar' for keeping grain in stock for his people. He established a new town named Narharpur near Kanker. In 1904, Komal Dev became the king of Kanker.

In 1999, Kanker received its identity as an independent district. It is now surrounded by five other districts of Chhattisgarh state: Kondagaon District, Dhamtari District, Balod District, Narayanpur and Rajnandgaon District. It is currently a part of the Red Corridor, the region in the eastern, central and the southern parts of India that experience considerable Naxalite‚ÄìMaoist insurgency. General Information Demographics According to the 2011 census Kanker district has a population of 748,941, roughly equal to the nation of Guyana or the US state of Alaska. This gives it a ranking of 493rd in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 15%. Kanker has a sex ratio of 1007 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of only 70.97%. Climate The climate of the district is of predominantly a ‚ÄúMonsoon type‚Äù. May is the hottest month and December is the coolest month. Annual average rainfall in the district is 1492 mm, 90% of which falls during the period from June to October. The average annual rainfall has fluctuated greatly over the last six years. Within the district, the Kanker and Charama blocks have a predominantly dry climate, whereas that of Bhanupratappur is of the wet type. Geography The district headquarters of Kanker is 140 kilometers from Raipur and 160 kilometers from Jagadalpur. In 2018, the district got its first railway station in the form of Bhanupratappur railway station. Daily DEMU services connect Keoti and Bhanupratappur to Raipur. The Mahanadi River, Doodh River, Hatkul River, Sondur River and Turu River all flow through small pockets of hills in the district. Topography The physical area of Kanker is heterogeneous and is a mix between flat land and undulating hills. Most of the land is between 300 and 600 meters above sea level, and about 80% of the area of Kanker is flat. These flat lands can be divided into two parts, the Mahanadi Plane and the Kotri Plane. The northeastern part of Kanker is on the Mahanadi Plane. The majority of this plane lies at an elevation less than 500 meters above sea level. The main river in that area is the Mahanadi River. Hatkul, Chinar, Doodh, Sondur, Nakti, and Toori are the other rivers of the area. Bhanupratappur is located on the Kotri Plane. The majority of this plane lies at an elevation less than 400 meters above sea level. Korti and Valler are the main rivers of this area. The topography of Kanker district is also dotted with a multitude of hilly regions. These can be divided into the following three groups: A. Vindhyana Hill Group: These hill groups are spread in the south eastern part of Kanker district, where the soil constitutes six phases of quartile and sand. B. Archian Hill Groups: 95% of the area of Kanker is covered by Archian Hill Group. In this area, granite and gneiss rocks are spread over almost all the geographical area of the district. C. Dharwar Hill Group: This hill group is very crude and broken in shape and form. These hills are spread all over the northern region of the district, in the areas close to Sambalpur and Bhanupratappur. Soil The soil in Kanker originates from granite, gneiss, sand and khedar. Most of the area is covered with red soil. The soil is faintly coloured in the higher regions of the hilly tract, while in the river valleys, the soil is smooth and fertile. The soils of this district can be divided into four types. A. Kanhar: This type of soil is black and oily. The capacity of water absorption by this soil is great, and this is very useful in growth of Kharif and Rabi crops in the region. This type of soil is found in the planes of Kotri and Mahanadi. B. Dorsa: This type of soil is medium in nature and it is very similar to Matasi and Kanhar type soil. This type of soil is found in north east Kanker and in the Bhanupratappur region. C. Matasi: This type of soil is found at an elevation higher than Kanhar and less than Bhata. This soil is appropriate for growing rice. This type of soil is found in most of the Kanker region. D. Bhata: This soil-type is affected by a late rating process. It can be red or yellow, having a mixed shape/condition. This soil is found in uplands of the area. It is appropriate for the cultivation of crops like Kodo, Kulthi, Maize and Kutki. Administrative divisions There are 7 blocks/tehsils in Kanker district. They are: * Kanker * Charama * Narharpur * Bhanupratappur * Durgukondal * Antagarh * Pakhanjore/Koylibeda. There are 389 Gram Panchayats and 995 villages in the Kanker district. Economy Agriculture is the mainstay of people in the district. Even though large numbers of them are tribal, it is agriculture that sustains them for most of the year. Non-timber forest produce is another major source of income, as large tracts of the land are still forested. The tribes in many places practice Marham or Dippa. The farmers who live in the forest cut the trees before the rainy season and use the land for agriculture. After every two years they prepare a new farm and leave the old one fallow for some time. On the planes, the land is farm every year. Rice is the main crop but wheat, sugar cane, Gram, Kodo, Moong, Tilli, and maize other important crops. People also grow varieties of vegetables. Varieties of fruits such as mangoes, and bananas are also produced. About half of rural Kanker is below the poverty line, according to official estimates. The entire district is drought prone. Over 80 percent of the working population is already dependent on marginal agriculture and allied activities, with low incomes and stagnant productivity. Thus, in addition to providing a livelihood for the unemployed, it is a challenge to make the existing the livelihoods of the nearly 295,000 (2.95 lakh) workers more productive. This would be beneficial, since persons engaged in agriculture could then earn an adequate income to meet their basic needs. Thus, the only feasible option in the short to medium run is to increase employment in the main livelihood sector, which is agriculture. Diversification, intensification and stabilisation of agriculture are at the core of the challenge of livelihood promotion in the district. Minerals Kanker is rich in minerals. Iron ore, quartzite and garnet deposits are found in southern regions of the district, but mining of these minerals on a commercial scale has not been attempted. About 100 million tons of iron ore deposits have been identified in the Hahaladdi region of the Bhanupratappur Tehsil. Chhattisgarh's second biggest iron ore deposits, Rowghat Mines, is in Antargarh tehsil in this district. Its reserves are assessed at 1.343 billion tons. Rowghat Mines will supply iron ore to the Bhilai Steel Plant of SAIL. Black and white granite is plentiful in the district, where it is used as a building material. In the Markatola and in Barchhegondi region aluminium-bearing Sillimanite/Kinite deposits have been identified. Some deposits of gold have been found in Sona Dehi, Michgaon and in certain other regions of Bhanupratappur Tehsil. At present some bauxite- based (aluminium) industries are functional in the district. Flora Most of the forest in Kanker district is of dry deciduous type. In Kanker district Sal, teak and mixed forests are found. Sal forests are found in the eastern part of the district, teak forests are found in the Bhanupratappur region and mixed forests are found in most of the area. In the mixed forest varieties of medicinal plants and other economically important plants such as Saja, Rendu, Dhaura, Bija, Harra and Mahua are found in abundance. Socio-cultural Aspects About half of the total population is Kanker district is tribal. Accordingly, most of the culture of Kanker district is tribal, even though an interplay/fusion with other cultures is clearly visible. Languages At the time of the 2011 Census of India, 66.77% of the population in the district spoke Hindi, 17.06.% Gondi, 13.10% Bengali, 1.71% Halbi and 0.40% Kurukh as their first language.2011 Census of India, Population By Mother Tongue The chief languages or dialects used in the Kanker district are Hindi, Bengali, Chhattisgarhi, Gondi and Halbi. There were times when Halbi was an important language; at one time all of the administrative work was done in that language. Halbi is a compound form of Hindi. Bhatri is the main branch of Halbi language. There are a lot of words taken in this language from other languages including Sanskrit, Hindi, Arabic, and Farsi. Like Hindi, Halbi also has two genders, masculine and feminine, but the feminine is used more. The other languages such as Bengali, Telugu and Odia are also spoken in some parts of the district. Religion Until the end of the Nal dynasty, the people were divided into four different castes, namely: Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. After the downfall of the Nal dynasty, many people came from outside and the main castes divided into sub-castes. There were around 62 castes in Bastar state and Kanker state. The tribes Maria, Gond, Ojha, Muria, Bhatra are divided into sub-caste San Bhatra, Pit Bhatra, Amnit Bhatra Amnit. These castes hold highest status. Parja, Gadva, Halba, Ganda, Mahra, Chandal, Ghuruva, Dom, Lohar, Matrigond, Rajgond, Dorla, Nahar, Naikpod, Kuduk, Andkuri, Kumhar, Kosta, Chamar, Kenvat, Dhakad, were important and in other castes Brahmin, Vaishya, Kayasth, Teli, Kalar, Kshtriya, Kunbi, Dhobi, Marathi, Mohammedan, Pathan, Telanga, Orria, Rohilla and others were important. About half of the population is tribal, although in this modern era the culture has slightly changed. Family structure In all castes, people live as a joint family. All the families are male dominant. The oldest person is the head of the family and all other members obey his authority. The oldest person of the family has full authority on all financial matters. All sons have the same share in the family assets, however daughters have no share. In tribes, the women play an important role. Marriage Like all other cultured castes, the marriage ceremony is very important to the tribes of Kanker. * Among Halbas, two types of marriages are popular, namely brief marriages and detailed marriages. * Among Bhatras, four types of marriages are popular namely arranged marriage, love marriages, widow marriages and dhariya marriage. * Among Murias, arrange marriage, love marriage and kidnapping marriages are popular. * Among all types of Gonds, arranged marriages, love marriages and kidnapping marriages are popular. Among the tribes, if any woman chooses a new husband, then the new husband gives money to the old husband as 'compensation allowance'. This compensation is settled by the leader of caste. Re-marriage of widows is also popular among tribes. In Halbas no widow may be married with any unmarried person. In some tribes, there is a tradition named Ghotul. Ghotul is a cultural centre of Gonds and Murias. Customs at death The tribal customs of death are complex. The Maria bury dead bodies. If a woman dies during her pregnancy, her body is buried. If a child who is younger than 5 years dies, then their body is also buried beneath a Mahua tree and their head is placed facing an easterly direction. They construct a little tomb in that place in memory of the dead person. The Gonds place the legs facing the south, in tombs. In some tribes they place a wooden pole in memory of the dead person. Madai and other Festivals Among the tribes of Kanker and Bastar districts there is an important festival celebrated called Madai. This festival is a moving festival and moves throughout the Kanker, Bastar and Dantewada regions from December to March. The celebration of the festival starts in Bastar Region in December. On Poornima people celebrate the Madai festival in respect of the goddess Kesharpal Kesharpalin Devi. In January, the people of Kanker, and the adjoining areas of Charama and Kurna, celebrate the Madai festival. In the month of February, the festival is celebrated in Bastar district and there the festival is celebrated in the respect of Cheri-Chher- Kin. At the end of February, the Madai festival goes to Antagarh, Narayanpur and Bhanupratappur, and in March it is celebrated in Kondagaon, Keshkal and Bhopalpattanam. The festival is celebrated in the respect of local Gods and Goddess. This festival is celebrated in a big ground where thousands of peoples gather simultaneously. The festival starts with a procession of local God or Goddess; after that the worship is done and then the festival starts. A lot of shops, restaurants, crafts, dances and other cultural program can be seen in this festival. Although the festival is tribal, all the communities have faith, celebrate and enjoy the festival. Other important festivals are Mati-tihar, Gobar-boharani, Rama Navami and Navakhani. The standard Hindu festivals of Dusshera, Diwali, and Holi are celebrated also, as in other parts of India. Handicrafts The tribal societies of Kanker are known for their handicrafts prepared with a variety of designs and shapes. These handicrafts include wood-carvings, bell-metal items, terracotta items, and bamboo items, among others. Kanker is a forestry district containing good quality woods from which wooden-carving crafts and various types of furniture are made by skilled artisans. These items attract locals as well as outsiders. Wood and bamboo crafts This is one of the most distinctive arts of tribal wooden carving. These wooden crafts are made out of the finest teak wood and white wood. These wooden crafts include models, idols, wall panels and furniture items. These handicrafts are generally exported to different parts of India, and there is also demand from foreign countries. The tribes make bamboo crafts also. Bamboo crafts include wall hangings, table lamps, and table mats among other items. Noteworthy locations Kanker District has the following attractions: Kanker Palace This place is very renowned for its royal palace including the tribal villages and the deep forests. The palace was owned by the esteemed 12th century royal family. The family of the late Maharajadhiraj Udai Pratap Deo resided here, since 2002. Now some section of the palace are being converted into a hotel. The Gadiya Mountain The Gadiya Mountain came into light at the time of Kandra dynasty. When the Kandra king Dharma Dev won the Kanker, he declared his capital on Gadhiya Mountain, which is a natural form of a fort. On the mountain there is a natural reservoir which never dries and which is filled by water throughout the year. One part of this reservoirs is called 'Sonai' and the other part is called 'Rupai'. Sonai and Rupai were the two daughters of the Kandra king Dharma Dev. On the southern part of this reservoir there is a cave named 'Churi pagar'. The entrance to this cave is very narrow. During any attack the King and his family lived safely in this cave. The space of the cave is sufficient to accommodate 500 people inside. The exit door of this cave is towards west direction. In the south east part of Gadiya mountain there is another cave called Jogi cave. The length of this cave is 50 meters. In ancient times, it is said that many monks lived and meditated here. There is a small pond in this cave. The water of this cave flows on the rock like a waterfall. The Doodh river flows at the bottom of Gadiya mountain, . Legend Years ago, it is said, a King lived in the Gadhiya Mountain. He had two daughters named \\"Sonai\\" and \\"Rupai\\". Both were playing near the lake over the hilly area. Suddenly they both fell in the lake; that lake was later named \\"Sonai Rupai Talab\\". It is said that the water of that lake never dries and there are two fish on very bottom of that Lake. One fish is of gold and another one is of silver. According to the legend, both fish are remain alive even to this day. Many people in Kanker claim that they have seen both fish. On the mountain there are two rocks behind the main \\"Sheetla Temple\\" and the door between those mountain is very thin. Only slim persons can enter there, but after entering the middle there is a Big Hall in which about 300 people can be seated. People say that the King used to stay with his soldiers during any war on that particular place. On the occasion of Navratri, a cultural fest known as Gadhiya Mahotsav is celebrated beneath the Gadhiya Mountain. Malanjhkudum Waterfall About 15 kilometres away towards south form Kanker, there is a small mountain. On this mountain there is a spot named Neele Gondi from where the Doodh river takes its shape. After crossing the 10 kilometres there is a place named as Malanjhkudum from where the river produces three waterfalls. The heights of these waterfalls are 10 meters. 15 meters and 9 meters respectively. The slope of this water fall is like a ladder. The wave of this waterfall is very attractive and challenging. This is an ideal place for picnic. The road is available to reach this spot. Charre-Marre Waterfall This is another waterfall situated in Kanker district. This waterfall is situated 17 kilometers away from Antagarh block of Kanker district. There is a place named Charre-Marre on the way from Antagarh to Aamabera. The waterfall produces by the river named Jogidahara which flows in Matla valley. The height of this waterfall is 16 meters. The slope of this water fall is jig jag. Shivani Temple This temple is situated in Kanker city. This temple is called Shivani Maa temple. The statue of goddess is excellent. According to a myth this Goddess is a combination of two Goddess name Kali Maa and Durga Maa. The vertically half part is of goddess Kali and the remaining half part is of goddess Durga. There are only two of this type of statue in the world (the other one is in Kolkata).

Tubing can be found in such equipment as boilers and heat exchangers. To carry out an examination in situ (i.e. examination of the tubes in position, where they are installed), a manhole cover is usually removed to allow a technician access to the tubes. Alternatively, a tube bundle may be removed from a heat-exchanger and transported by forklift to a maintenance area for easier access. The usual means of examination is to insert some type of probe into the tubes, one at a time, while data is recorded for later interpretation. The technologies listed below (ECT, RFT, IRIS, and MFL) are all able to detect defects on the outside of the tube from the inside. The tubes must be clean enough to allow passage of the probe: deposits of debris, rust, or scale may have to be removed by chemicals or pressure washing. In water-tube boilers, the tubes may be examined from the outside when the boiler is shut down, often using ultrasonic testing. Common methods * Eddy- current testing (ECT) is commonly used on non-[ferromagnetic] metals and alloys such as copper, brass, and copper nickel. Variations on ECT are partial saturation ECT and magnetic biased ECT, both of which use magnets to allow ECT to operate in lightly ferromagnetic materials or in thin-wall ferromagnetic tubes. * Remote field testing (RFT) is used on [ferromagnetic] materials such as carbon steel. * IRIS (Internal rotary inspection system) can be used on all types of metal tubes. IRIS is very slow, but very accurate, and is often used as a back-up to a remote field examination. * Magnetic flux leakage (MFL) testing is used on carbon steel tubes, although it tends to be less accurate than remote field testing.K.

She was also known to excel at drawing, painting and sculpting. Known as one of the most influential Cuban poets, her work is focused upon love, the role of women in society, and herself. Oliver Labra received numerous national and international prizes including the National Poetry Prize (1950), National Literature Award (1997) and the Jos√© de Vasconcelos International Prize (2002). Me desordeno, amor, me desordeno might be her most famous poem. Other works such as Discurso de Eva (\\"Eve's Discourse\\") also show a profound literary technique. Her debut collection in 1943, Lyric Prelude (Preludio lirico) immediately established her as an important poetic voice. At the South of My Throat made her famous: the coveted National Prize for poetry came to her in 1950 as a result of the popular and notorious book, At the South of My Throat (Al sur de mi garganta) 1949. In honor of the tri-centennial of Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz in a contest sponsored by The Latin American Society in Washington D.C., in 1950, she had also received the national Cuban First Prize for her poems. Her work was highly praised by Gabriela Mistral, the Chilean poet and first Latin American woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1945. In 1958, Oliver Labra published Feverish memory (Memoria de la fiebre) which added to her notoriety as a blatantly erotic woman. The book concerned a theme which has dominated her poetry -- lost love, as it was written after the untimely death of her second husband.

It is located at 38 Cathedral Place between Charlotte and St. George Streets. Constructed over five years (1793‚Äì1797), it was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark on April 15, 1970. Its congregation, established in 1565, is the oldest Christian congregation in the contiguous United States. History A historic image of the Basilica In the mid-1560s, as the Spanish Empire expanded northward from the Caribbean to unexplored Florida, it founded the colony of St. Augustine, which has become the oldest continuously occupied European settlement on the United States mainland. Spanish settlers immediately established a shrine of the Catholic Church, the religion essential to the Spanish monarchy throughout its history. From the mid-1500s to the mid-1600s, the kingdom was undergoing a Catholic Revival in opposition to the Protestant Reformation. As the early colonists were mostly sailors or soldiers with little expertise in architecture, the first church of St. Augustine was simply designed and rapidly built of disparate materials. The original parish was short-lived, burning to the ground in a 1586 attack on the town by the Englishman Sir Francis Drake. As two decades previously, the colonists hastily built a new church of straw and palmetto, which deteriorated quickly in the humid climate and burned down in 1599. A tithe was raised in Spain, and in 1605 a third church was built, this time more permanently of timber by experienced architects and builders who had begun to make their way to the New World. For 95 years it stayed intact, though in disrepair, before again burning down in 1702 during a failed English attempt on the city by South Carolina colonist James Moore. The church vanished for over ninety years, despite an attempt to rebuild in 1707, with royal rebuilding funds misspent on provisions, soldiers' pay, and graft by public officials. During the first half of the 18th century, priests held mass in St. Augustine's hospital, which became too small for the congregation and embarrassed it before the Native American converts to Catholicism. From 1763 to 1784, Florida fell under British rule, and reconstruction was forgotten. After Spain regained the colony in 1784, a new sense of pride in the citizenry led to large-scale construction of the Cathedral of St. Augustine from 1793 to 1797. Architecture Neoclassical elements surrounding the doorway and Spanish mission styling at the gables The cathedral's eclectic facade is a combination of Spanish mission and Neoclassical styles. Spanish mission features include curving bell gables, limited fenestration, clay roof tiles, a semicircular tympanum, prominent statuary niche, and comparatively unadorned walls. Neoclassical details surround the entry door; an entablature embellished with triglyphs is topped with a broken pediment above and supported by pairs of Doric columns below. View of the Cathedral of St. Augustine and the Slave Market after the fire of 1887 destroyed most of downtown On April 12, 1887, with Florida a part of the United States, the old Spanish structure burned once again, but the coquina blocks and cement masonry of the exterior was still salvageable. Reconstruction was begun with donations from Henry Flagler and funds raised in a national appeal. The congregation hired the visiting New York City architect James Renwick, Jr., who rebuilt and enlarged the church with a rectangular-cruciform layout and a European-style transept. Renwick devised an elegant roof truss system that exposed the decorated timbers, and he added a Spanish Renaissance-style bell tower, its exposed bell typical of older Spanish mission churches in the west. Four bells were placed in the tower, one salvaged from a previous church and inscribed: \\"Sancte Joseph. Ora Pro Nobis. D 1682.\\"; another taken from a British cathedral. Cathedral interior The coquina stone walls, which had saved the old structure from the flames, were of an unusual material apparently inspired by Native American building techniques. Coquina is a sedimentary rock from the deposition of seashells on ancient shorelines, and could be cheaply quarried and transported to the town. The wet quarry stone hardens when exposed to air, but remains soft enough to be easily worked, serving as a very convenient material. However, the new walls, including the bell tower, were made of modern cast-in-place concrete.

Plot Involved from early childhood in the theatre, the Athenian-born Nikeratos grows into a successful actor through his performances in tragedies. During his formative period, he meets the philosopher Plato and Dion, a respected politician from Syracuse and brother-in-law to the city's tyrannical ruler Dionysios the Elder. Nikeratos frequents Plato's Academy and grows to appreciate his wisdom, though he also discerns that Plato and Dion are somewhat more idealistic than practical in their views on humanity and government. Nikeratos sails for Syracuse as a member of a theatre troupe, but upon arrival receives the news that Dionysios, their patron, has just died. Nikeratos chooses to remain in Syracuse despite the dangerous political climate, and meets and makes a favourable impression upon the city's new ruler, Dionysios the Younger. While Dionysios is not the brutal tyrant his father was, he is dissolute and politically inept, and Dion invites Plato to serve as a teacher to Dionysios; the two hope to mould him into a philosopher- king ruling according to Platonic ideals. While Dionysios wants Plato's approval, he makes only half-hearted efforts to reform either his own luxurious lifestyle or the Syracusan government. Part of this is due to his own nature, but other factors also inhibit reform, such as Syracuse's large and oppressive mercenary force, who are necessary to counter Carthaginian aggression, and the Syracusan people themselves, who have become politically enfeebled under Dionysios the Elder's long rule. Dion is eventually exiled due to the machinations of his rival Philistos, a loyal but corrupt supporter of Dionysios. During these years Nikeratos enjoys a prosperous and successful career acting in Syracuse and mainland Greece. He becomes a lifelong friend and mentor to a promising young actor named Thettalos while keeping informed about events in Syracuse and Plato's life there. After Dionysios confiscates Dion's estates and gives his wife to another man, Dion returns with an army and captures most of Syracuse while Dionysios' loyalists hold out in the island citadel of Ortygia. In the ensuing fighting Syracuse is brutally ravaged before Dion gains the upper hand. Philistos is killed by the vengeful citizenry and Dionysios flees to live out his remaining years in exile. Dion is initially welcomed as a liberator by the Syracusans, but his attempts at reform prove unpopular and he is eventually assassinated. He is succeeded by Callippus, an ambitious and unscrupulous pupil of Plato. In the novel's final chapter, a dozen years after Dion's downfall, Nikeratos encounters the young Alexander the Great and wistfully regrets that Plato never had the chance to tutor Alexander, who might have pursued Plato's social ideals with far greater success than Dionysios the Younger did.

At the dawn of the 19th century, a small log cabin stood on a hill overlooking Catoctin Creek and Taylor Town, a tiny settlement in northern Loudoun County, Virginia. The cabin, which has been expanded several times, was owned by distillers and their families into the 20th century. Its current owner named it Whiskey Hill.Frederick Bittle Kegley Kegley's Virginia Frontier: The Beginning of the Southwest Page 87 - 1938 \\"March 18, 1758, James Simpson from Robert Breckenridge, MS, 242 acres on south side of Buffalo Creek opposite Long Berch, top of Whiskey Hill. Au. D. Bk. 8, 8.\\" 1700s Archaeologists from Mount Vernonhttp://www.mountvernon.org/ visited Whiskey Hill in 2004 while conducting research for the reconstruction of George Washington's distillery; they confirmed that the house dates to the late 18th century. However, no signs of the distillery operation remain, though a spring on the property features stone walls consistent with a spring house. Relatives of previous residents report that they were not allowed into the bottom level of the spring house where whiskey was reportedly stored. In the early 1790s, the land where the cabin is located belonged to Charles Bennet, 4th Earl of Tankerville, and his brother, Henry Astley Bennett. Neither Englishman ever set foot on it. Their father had purchased the land from John Colvill, who once owned in the dominion. In 1792, the brothers used the Alexandria law firm Hooe and Little to sell to Joseph and Henry Taylor, two sons of Thomas Taylor. The elder Taylor owned on the east side of Catoctin Creek and built a mill there; both the area and the mill would take Thomas Taylor's name. Henry bought out Joseph's interest in the land five years later for the price of 77 pounds in the then-current money of Virginia. 1800s Henry Taylor died in 1812, but his estate was not settled until 17 years later. It appears that Taylor's cabin on the west side of the Catoctin was rented during part of this time by a tenant named Andrew Collins, whose name appears on a deed dated 1819. This document is the first written reference to the house now called Whiskey Hill. Andrew Collins and Levi Collins may have had a life estate on the house. By 1829, it was occupied by Jacob Carnes; Henry Taylor's family officially sold it to him in 1832. Carnes' descendants would own it until 1962. In the inventory of Henry Taylor's assets made after his death, a still and a still were listed, as were a wheat fan, oats, barrels, funnels and of barley. All of these items were essential in the making of beer, ale, and whiskey. In the early 19th century, the two most important cash crops going from the Piedmont to Tidewater were wheat flour and whiskey. Because food storage was always an issue for people of this time, any surpluses could be converted to whiskey and then used as currency. The operation on the hill overlooking the Catoctin was well sited for distilling spirits and sending them to market via Catoctin Creek and the Potomac River. The 1816 inventory of Jacob Carnes' late father, Abraham, lists debts to John Hamilton, who built a mill further south on Catoctin Creek. The area around Taylorstown featured enough harvesting and enough water power from the creek to support two mills, Hamilton's and the older Taylor's Mill. Jacob Carnes died in 1832, shortly after his purchase of the log cabin, and his estate was proven by three men, including John Hamilton's son. This suggests a relationship between Carnes, the owner of a distilling operation, and the Hamilton family, which operated a mill that rendered the ingredients for whiskey. After Jacob Carnes' death, his son, Samuel, owned the property. In 1851, tax records recorded the value of the Carnes property, including its outbuildings and improvements, at $500. In 1856, there is a reference to the Carnes family having livestock (Daniel had 10 cattle and one horse). They also all had watches. All of them were likely in trades or were merchants. In 1860, Abram E. Carnes (possibly a son of Samuel) was listed as the only white man living on the property; women and children were not taxed, and Carnes did not have slaves. His was valued at $45 an acre. He owned a $20 watch, his furniture was worth $35, and the house was worth $500. He did not own cattle, hogs or a carriage. He was likely a merchant. 1900s By 1920, the tax descriptions of the house begin to refer to it as \\"Near Taylorstown,\\" not near Catoctin Creek. The value of the Carnes land dropped to $24 an acre, a decrease that may reflect market conditions that made non-flat land less valuable. Flatter land was easier to farm with mechanized equipment, such as tractors. Abram died in 1908, but the property remained within his estate until at least 1936. Charles R. Carnes, his son by his first wife, took ownership of the house and lived in it until his death in 1937. His estate, which included bonds in Brazil, Poland, and Bolivia, suggested he had unusual liquidity than was typical of a merchant non-farmer. Some of the bonds had maturation dates in the 1960s. Ownership of the house passed to Charles' half-brother, Edgar, by 1938. He sold off two pieces of property by 1944, when the remainder was valued at $974. The pieces that were sold likely featured buildings, which may have been remnants of a distilling operation. Because of the introduction of government regulation by this time, it was unlikely any distilling occurred. Edgar worked as a painter. By 1950, Edgar had of land left after a series of small land sales, including one sale of for $3. The value of his holdings dropped from $974 to $660; this value would hold steady until at least 1959. Edgar and his wife, Sarah, sold the house and property to Alonza B. West and Colleen Gile West for $3,000 in 1962. Brad and Lynn Curl purchased the home in 1980 and installed indoor plumbing and a kitchen. 21st century Richard Weaver purchased the house in December 2003 and subsequently named it Whiskey Hill. Since then, the structure has been completely renovated. A new wing, including a library, was completed in January 2009.

Not able to defend the fortress against the Teutonic Order, Margiris and other defenders decided to commit a mass suicide, burning the castle and leaving no loot for the enemy. This episode from the Lithuanian Crusade was popularized during the 19th-century wave of romantic nationalism and Margiris is treated as a national hero in Lithuania.  Biography  Very little is known about Margiris' life. In primary written sources his name is mentioned only twice, in 1329 as Margalis by chronicler Jean d'Outremeuse in Ly myreur des histors and as Marger in 1336 by Caspar Sch√ºtz in Historia Rerum Prussicarum. Duke Margiris defending Pilƒónai against the Teutonic Order by (1817‚Äì1874) In early 1329, John of Luxemburg, King of Bohemia, joined the Teutonic crusade against Lithuania and captured Medvƒógalis. During the campaign, King John was challenged to a duel by a Lithuanian. This incident is briefly mentioned in several contemporary chronicles, including those by Francis of Prague and Peter of Zittau, but described in detail only by Jean d'Outremeuse. After the rules of the duel were broken, Margiris had to pay a ransom. He did so with coins minted by Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, which were most likely stolen during the 1326 Lithuanian raid into Brandenburg. Chronicler d'Outremeuse further briefly mentions Margiris' son who went to France and married a countess of Clermont. Based on this information, Lithuanian historian Alvydas Nik≈æentaitis concluded that Margiris held a high position in the Lithuanian society or King of Bohemia would not have accepted him as an equal and would have refused to duel him, and Margiris would not have obtained a share of the spoils of war. Nik≈æentaitis further stipulated that Margiris might have been a son of Butvydas and brother of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. However, other historians noted that d'Outremeuse's work resembles more a work of literary fiction than a historically accurate chronicle and expressed doubts whether this Margalis is identical to Margiris. In February 1336, Teutonic Order organized another large campaign into Lithuania. Their force included Louis, Margrave of Brandenburg, counts of Henneberg and Namur, and other nobles from France and Austria. In total, according to Wigand of Marburg, there were 200 nobles. Another German chronicle, known as Der Chronist von Wolfenb√ºttel, counted a total of 6,000 soldiers. This force attacked Pilƒónai fortress (its location is not known). Wigand of Marburg mentioned that the fortress held 4,000 people. They attempted to organize defense, but the Teutonic force was too strong. Seeing no hope, the defenders decided to burn their property and commit mass suicide. Wigand described a Lithuanian duke (his name was skipped in the surviving Latin translation of Wigand's chronicle) who continued to resist until the end. He then killed his wife and his loyal guards. Caspar Sch√ºtz, who used Wigund's original, elaborated on the battle, adding more dramatic and heroic details. Sch√ºtz specified the duke's name (Marger or Margiris) and that he killed himself. Margiris and his heroic tale of desperate defense and sacrifice has spread, inspired other works, including the Polish epic poem Margier by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Syrokomla in 1855, and became popular in Lithuania.

Methuen & Co.) Chance is a novel by Joseph Conrad, published in 1913, following serial publication the previous year. Although the novel was not one upon which Conrad's later critical reputation was to depend, it was his greatest commercial success upon initial publication. Chance is narrated by Conrad's regular narrator, Charles Marlow, along with other narrators, who take up the complex narrative at different points. The novel is also unusual among its author's works for such strong emphasis on a female character: the heroine, Flora de Barral. The narrators attempt to interpret various episodes in the life of Miss de Barral, the daughter of a convicted swindler named Smith de Barral. Miss de Barral leads a sheltered life for as long as her father is prosperous, but at other times must rely on the generosity of others, who resent her or have agendas for her, before she escapes by marrying one Captain Anthony. Much of the book involves the musing of the various narrators over what she and the Captain expected from this union, and what they actually got from it. When her father is released from prison, he joins them on the ship, and the book heads towards its denouement. Breaking away from tradition, Chance deals with social issues surrounding feminism and financial speculation, involving Mrs. Fyne and Flora de Barral, as presented by the various narrators. The storyline oscillates between human will and purposeful activity and an opposing \\"apathetic\\" force which nullifies the importance of human action. Reception Chance opened a path to commercial success for Conrad after years of slow progress and obscurity. This success could be measured by the record sales of the book in 1914, which outsold all his previous publications and shot him to fame. The complex style of Conrad's narrative in this novel invited widespread criticisms from peers and readers alike.

Gurney that was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The play centers on two characters, Melissa Gardner and Andrew Makepeace Ladd III. Using the epistolary form sometimes found in novels, they sit side by side at tables and read the notes, letters and cards ‚Äì in which over nearly 50 years, they discuss their hopes and ambitions, dreams and disappointments, victories and defeats ‚Äì that have passed between them throughout their separated lives.Thomas M. Disch: Love Letters. (Promenade Theatre, New York). In: The Nation. The Nation Institute. 1989. Via HighBeam Research (requires login). Retrieved 25 Dec. 2013. The play is a performance favorite for busy name actors, for it requires little preparation, and lines need not be memorized. It was first performed by the playwright himself with Holland Taylor at the New York Public Library, then opened in 1988 at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut, with Joanna Gleason and John Rubinstein.  Plot  Andrew Makepeace Ladd III and Melissa Gardner, both born to wealth and position, are childhood friends whose lifelong correspondence begins with birthday party thank-you notes and summer camp postcards. Romantically attached, they continue to exchange letters through the boarding school and college years‚Äîwhere Andy goes on to excel at Yale and law school, while Melissa flunks out of a series of \\"good schools\\". While Andy is off at war Melissa marries, but her attachment to Andy remains strong and she continues to keep in touch as he marries, becomes a successful attorney, gets involved in politics and, eventually, is elected to the U.S. Senate. Meanwhile, her marriage in tatters, Melissa dabbles in art and gigolos, drinks more than she should, and becomes estranged from her children. Eventually she and Andy do become involved in a brief affair, but it is really too late for both of them. However Andy's last letter, written to her mother after Melissa's untimely death, makes it eloquently clear how much they really meant, and gave to, each other over the years‚Äîphysically apart, perhaps, but spiritually as close as only true lovers can be.

Plot Axel Heyst, the novel's protagonist, was raised by his widowed father, a Swedish philosopher, in London, England, and never knew his mother. The atmosphere of Heyst's home, with his father's ruthless pursuit of truth and pessimistic view of humanity, warps Heyst's mind, and after his father dies, he leaves England and becomes a rootless wanderer. This eventually leads him to the Southeastern Asia, especially to what is now Indonesia, including Surabaya‚Äîa port in the then- Dutch colony of Java. Eventually, however, human feelings are awoken in Heyst by the plight of Captain Morrison, who faces the confiscation of his ship, and loss of his livelihood, because he cannot pay a fine levied by the Portuguese authorities. Heyst intervenes with a loan for a paltry sum, which establishes a relationship, and Heyst is unable to break this bond. This eventually leads to the establishment of The Tropical Belt Coal Company, of which Heyst becomes the manager, although he has no interest in this enterprise. Morrison subsequently visits England where he dies. Soon after the coal company goes bankrupt. Heyst however, remains at the site of the derelict coal mine, on the island of Samburan. There he lives the life of a hermit, with his Chinese servant, Wang. Later Heyst's compassion is aroused again when he encounters the young woman Lena in Sourabaya on the Island of Java, where she is playing in an all-woman orchestra. Lena is being mistreated by the orchestra's conductor and his sadistic wife, and threatened with sexual violence by Schomberg, the owner of the hotel, where the orchestra plays. Heyst, with the aid of Schomberg's down-trodden wife, absconds with Lena, to Samburan. Schomberg's jealous rage at losing Lena, along with his fear of a mysterious trio of visitors, Mr Jones, Martin Ricardo, and Pedro, lead him to suggest to this trio that Heyst caused the death of Morrison, and has great wealth hidden on Samburan. Taken in by Schomberg's lies, the trio set out for Samburan, but get lost at sea and barely make it to the island. They plan to kill Heyst after they discover where his money is hidden. Only Ricardo is aware of Lena's existence and Jones has a pathological hatred of women. Soon after they arrive, Martin Ricardo attacks Lena, but she is stronger than him, causing Ricardo to fall in love with her. In order to try and protect Heyst, Lena encourages this infatuation. This eventually leads to her accidental death, when Jones realizes that Ricardo is double-crossing him and attempts to kill Ricardo. In despair, Heyst commits suicide. Jones kills Ricardo and then drowns after being shot by Wang.

(BNI) was incorporated in December 1998, absorbing Summit Publishing and New Brunswick Publishing Ltd., two newspaper publishing companies already owned by members of New Brunswick's Irving family. The two companies controlled all the daily newspapers in New Brunswick's three major cities. Brunswick News Inc. was created as subsidiary of Otter Brook Holdings, which had been incorporated in 1997. Corporate history and ownership 1936 to 1968 In 1936 the New Brunswick industrialist K. C. Irving purchased the Saint John weekly Maritime Broadcaster, which he used as the basis to start a daily newspaper, the Citizen. After three years he sold the paper to Howard P. Robinson, the owner of the New Brunswick Publishing Co. Ltd. Robinson closed the Citizen and employed some of its staff on his two Saint John daily papers, the Telegraph-Journal and the Evening Times-Globe. In 1944 Robinson sold his New Brunswick Publishing company to Irving. As well as the two newspapers, Irving acquired a radio station by this purchase. In 1948 Irving bought the two daily newspapers in Moncton, the Times and the Transcript. In May 1968 Irving bought the Fredericton Daily Gleaner from Michael Wardell. With this purchase Irving became the owner of all five daily newspapers published in New Brunswick. The sale of the Gleaner was not made public by either party, and was only revealed by Senator Charles McElman in a speech on the floor of the Canadian Senate in March 1969. 1969 to 1998 McElman's revelation prompted hearings by the Special Senate Committee on the Mass Media, chaired by Senator Keith Davey. Its mandate was to look at \\"problems surrounding media concentration, particularly in print media ownership. K. C. Irving testified in December 1969 about his newspaper and other media holdings. At that time he owned 25% of K.C. Irving Ltd., while members of his family owned the remaining 75%. A subsidiary company, New Brunswick Publishing Ltd., owned the two Saint John newspapers, the Telegraph-Journal and the Evening Times Globe. New Brunswick Publishing Ltd. in turn had subsidiaries, one of which was Moncton Publishing, which published the two Moncton papers, the Times and the Transcript. Another subsidiary owned the Saint John radio station CHSJ. K.C. Irving Ltd. had also recently acquired control of the University Press of New Brunswick, which owned Fredericton's Daily Gleaner newspaper. In 1971 K.C. Irving Ltd. was charged under the Combines Investigation Act because it owned all five of New Brunswick's English language daily newspapers. In R. v. K.C. Irving Ltd., Moncton Publishing Co., New Brunswick Publishing Co. and University Press of New Brunswick Ltd., the four companies were charged with \\"running a de facto monopoly\\". In 1972, before the case went to trial, K.C. Irving moved to Bermuda and the newspaper and radio holdings were divided among his three sons. Jack, the youngest son, became sole owner of the Moncton and Fredericton papers, while James K. and Arthur each acquired 40% of New Brunswick Publishing, which published the two Saint John papers. K.C. Irving Ltd. kept a 20% stake in New Brunswick Publishing. The trial judge ruled that the Irving family did have too much control of the New Brunswick media, and that the Moncton papers should be sold. He also ordered K.C. Irving Ltd. to pay a fine of $150,000. However, the ruling was overturned, first by the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick and then by the Supreme Court of Canada, on the ground that \\"public detriment\\" as a result of the monopoly had not been established \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\". Brunswick News Inc. was incorporated in December 1998 as a subsidiary of Otter Brook Holdings, which had been incorporated the previous year. Brunswick News absorbed New Brunswick Publishing Ltd., which owned the two Saint John dailies, and Summit Publishing, owner of both the Fredericton and Moncton papers. The two Moncton dailies had merged in 1983 to form the Times & Transcript, so Brunswick News owned a total of four daily newspapers. Brunswick News also owned Acadia Broadcasting, CHSJ's parent company. After restructuring the three Irving brothers held equal shares in the company and Jack Irving's son John was named president of Brunswick News Inc. 21st century In the 21st century Brunswick News expanded by buying weekly and community newspapers in both French and English. By 2004 it owned 12 weeklies, 6 English and 6 French, and had purchased an alternative weekly distributed in Moncton, Fredericton, and Saint John. Meanwhile, the Saint John evening paper, the Times-Globe, had been closed in 2001. The company was restructured in 2005 with the transfer of Acadia Broadcasting from BNI to Jack Irving and the departure of Jack's son John, who had been BNI's president. He became head of Acadia Broadcasting. Also in 2005, Otter Brook Holdings, BNI's parent company, removed two of the Irving brothers, Jack and Arthur, and their sons, from its list of directors, leaving only James K. and his two sons Jim and Robert as owners of Brunswick News. Jamie Irving, the son of Jim and grandson of James K., had worked at the Telegraph Journal as a summer student while in university, and studied journalism at Carleton University and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. In 2002 Jamie Irving became publisher of the Kings County Record, a weekly newspaper in which BNI had acquired a minority stake. He was later made responsible for all the weeklies. In November 2004 he was named publisher of the Telegraph Journal. In 2009 he became vice-president of Brunswick News. In 2017 BNI began delivering packages for Amazon in an expansion of its existing newspaper and flyer delivery network. Newspapers Brunswick News employs more than 600 people and operates nearly all of the major print publications in New Brunswick, including three daily newspapers and several French and English language weeklies throughout the province. Brunswick News operates the following newspapers: Daily * Telegraph- Journal (Saint John; distributed throughout the province) * Times & Transcript (Moncton) * The Daily Gleaner (Fredericton) Weekly Brunswick News owns 14 English-language weeklies (6 paid subscription, 5 free) and 7 French- language weeklies (4 paid subscription, 3 free). * The Tribune (English language) (Campbellton and Restigouche County) * La Voix du Restigouche (French Language) (Campbellton and Restigouche County) * The Bugle-Observer (Woodstock) * Le Journal Madawaska (French Language) (Edmundston) * L'√âtoile (French Language) ** √âdition provinciale ** √âdition La Cataracte (Grand Falls) ** √âdition Chaleur (Chaleur region) ** √âdition Dieppe (Dieppe) ** √âdition Kent (Kent) ** √âdition P√©ninsule (Acadian Peninsula area) ** √âdition R√©publique (Edmundston) ** √âdition Restigouche (Restigouche) ** √âdition Sh√©diac (Shediac) * Kings County Record (English language) (Sussex, Kings County area) * Miramichi Leader (English language) (Miramichi) (Three times a week) * The Northern Light (English language) (Bathurst) * Here (English language urban alternative weekly distributed to Saint John, Moncton and Fredericton) * KV Style (Kennebecasis Valley) Criticism Brunswick News has faced scrutiny due to its concentration of the print media market in New Brunswick. As it is part of the Irving Group of Companies, Brunswick News has faced accusations that its papers are reluctant to publish stories that are critical of the Irving Group. In light of this affiliation, many citizens accuse newspapers owned by Brunswick News of bias, and of failing to cover stories that depict subsidiaries in the Irving Group of Companies in a negative light. The Irving media concentration of New Brunswick was investigated by the 1969 Special Senate Committee on the Mass Media (the Davey Commission) and the Kent commission (1981)Joseph Jackson, Newspaper Ownership in Canada- An Overview of the Davey Committee and Kent Commission Studies, PWGSC - Political and Social Affairs Division, 17 December 1999 during an era before extensive media concentration took place across Canada in the 1990s; at that time, the Irving concentration in New Brunswick was considered unique in the country's media landscape. The Kent Commission recommended (in section 2.a) the creation of new legislation that would \\"require the break-up of regional monopolies, such as that of the Irving family in New Brunswick, by prohibiting the ownership of two or more newspapers having 75% or more of the circulation, in one language, in a defined geographical area\\". A 2006 Senate report on media ownership in Canada also singled out New Brunswick because of the Irving companies' ownership of all English-language daily newspapers in the province. Senator Joan Fraser, co-author of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications Final report on the Canadian News Media stated, \\"We didn't find anywhere else in the developed world a situation like the situation in New Brunswick.\\" The report went further, stating that \\"the Irvings' corporate interests form an industrial-media complex that dominates the province\\" to a degree \\"unique in developed countries.\\" At the Senate hearing, journalists and academics cited Irving newspapers' lack of critical reporting on the family's influential businesses. In late June 2019, BNI made news for terminating the contract of political cartoonist Michael de Adder, who created a cartoon unflattering to U.S. President Donald Trump. BNI claimed they had planned to replace de Adder with a reader favourite before the controversial cartoon surfaced. Support of journalism studies In 2005, with a donation of $2 million, Brunswick News Inc. endowed two chairs of journalism in New Brunswick: the Irving Chair in Journalism at St. Thomas University in Fredericton and the Rom√©o LeBlanc Chair in Journalism at Universit√© de Moncton. In 2016 the Moncton chair was replaced by the Rom√©o LeBlanc Scholarship Fund for the Advancement of Excellence in Journalism, which provides $15,000 annually to a journalism student in his or her third and fourth years.

The Statkraft Group is a generator of renewable energy, as well as Norway‚Äôs largest and the Nordic region‚Äôs third largest energy producer. Statkraft develops and generates hydropower, wind power, gas power, district heating and solar power, and is also a player in the international energy markets. The company has some 3600 employees and their headquarters is located in Oslo, Norway. History The Norwegian state acquired its first ownership rights to a waterfall when they bought Paulenfossen in Southern Norway in 1895. In 1921 The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) was created to operate the nation's power plants. From 1950 to 1960, the state constructed large hydropower plants across the country. In 1986 the power plants and central power grid were split off as Statskraftverkene, which was divided again in 1992 into Statkraft and Statnett. Statkraft SF was created as a government enterprise. Through the 1990s and 2000s Statkraft acquired a number of local power plants in Norway in addition to expanding internationally. In 2004 Statkraft was reorganized as a limited company, Statkraft AS, still wholly owned by the state. International expansion Statkraft has expanded internationally over the beginning of the 21st century, opening plants in Nepal (1993), Peru (2003), Chile (2004), India (2004), UK (2006), Albania (2007), Germany (office 1999, power generating from 2007), Brazil (2008), Netherlands (office from 1998, power generation from 2018), Ireland (2018) The group has also opened offices in France (2009) and the United States In 2007 Statkraft and E.ON signed a letter of intent to swap Statkraft's shares in E.ON Sweden in exchange for flexible power production assets and shares in E.ON. The total value of the asset swap was ‚Ç¨4.4 billion. The transaction made Statkraft Europe's largest producer of renewable energy in 2018.  Statkraft today  Hydroelectric power provides the majority of Statkraft's renewable energy. The total annual power production was 62.6 TWh in 2018. In 2013, Statkraft began constructing the Devoll Hydropower project In south eastern Albania. It consists of two hydropower plants, Banja and Moglic√´ in the Devoll valley, with an installed capacity of roughly 256 MW. Banja power plant was completed in 2016,Statkraft: Banja HPP, visited March 24 2019 with the third being completed by 2019.Statkraft: Moglic√´ HPP, visited March 24, 2019 The total project is expected to cost more than 600 million euros. Production takes place in more than 300 hydropower plants in Norway, Sweden, Germany, UK, Turkey, as well as several countries in South America and Asia. Statkraft is involved in other hydropower projects in the Nordic region and Southeast Europe. The company is developing new production capacity in selected countries in South America and Asia.  Wind power  Wind power is a renewable and emission free energy resource. EU has set ambitious goals for the reduction of CO2 emissions and the development of renewable energy.  Solar power  Solar power will be an even more important energy source in the future. Statkraft has worked with solar energy since 2010 and has solar power plants in India and the Netherlands.  District heating  District heating is a separate energy system that forms a natural part of the energy supply for towns and cities and densely populated areas. District heating based on renewable energy sources has a positive environmental effect. Through the subsidiary Statkraft Varme, the Statkraft Group owns and operates a number of district heating plants in Norway and Sweden.

The building is locally significant as one of 30 remaining houses within the historic district that pre-date 1821. It was once the site of a Minorcan Chapel. Today, the building is home to the St. Photios Greek Orthodox National Shrine.  Description and history  The Avero House is a two-story rectangular block with an open loggia on the southeastern portion of the lot. The walls are made of coquina stone laid in roughly horizontal courses with lime mortar, which are plastered both inside and outside. At the flat roof, there is one coquina masonry chimney with two flues. Although the house was apparently built around 1749, the first detailed information on its layout does not appear until a map from 1763, which depicts it as having a U-shaped floor plan. The Greek Orthodox Diocese of North America purchased the building in 1966 and restored the house to its 1730s appearance. Today the house is open to the public as the St. Photios Greek Orthodox National Shrine, dedicated to the first colony of Greek people who came to America in 1768. The Shrine includes the St. Photios Chapel which features Byzantine decorations, and a museum with exhibits about the life of early Greek settlers and the development of the Greek Orthodox Church in America. It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 13, 1972.

Cell elimination by apoptosis occurs when UV-induced cell damage which cannot be repaired by the intracellular repair system exceeds at it certain limit (lethal damage). Through apoptosis, the cells are self- disassembled into compartments with their subsequent utilization (mainly by neighboring cells). The first time sign of the beginning of the apoptosis system is working in a UV damaged cell is the activation of restriction enzymes, which divide cell DNA into fragments convenient for utilization. But too large a dose of UVR can lead to breakdown (inactivation) of the energy- dependent mechanism of apoptosis (super lethal damage). In this case, cell destruction occurs randomly, not orderly, and during a significantly longer (compared with apoptosis) time interval. UV-irradiated cells do not change their appearance for a long time [1, 6], as a result of which the researchers may make the erroneous conclusion that ‚Äúrevealed an unexpected response to a dose at which a higher dose of UV increased the viability of keratinocytes‚Äù [2]. The fact that UV-induced apoptosis at high doses of UVR begins to be replaced by necrosis was established in 2000 [3]. For keratinocytes, the proportion of cells that have elimination by help apoptosis, with an increase in UVR dose can reach to achieve 45%, but with a further increase in the dose of UVR (due to the shutdown of the mechanism of apoptosis), destruction of damaged cells by help necrosis and the part of cells that eliminated by apoptosis begins to decrease (non-monotonous dose dependence of UV-induced apoptosis) [4, 11]. In the dose range of UVR from ‚Äúlethal‚Äù to ‚Äúsuper-lethal‚Äù, ‚Äúpro-inflammatory‚Äù apoptosis can be manifested, which was experimentally discovered in 2003 [5]. This may be the result of partial damage to the apoptosis mechanism by UV radiation [1]. If at moderate doses ‚Äúpure‚Äù apoptosis does not cause an inflammatory reaction, then at sufficiently large (but lower than superlethal) doses, an inflammatory reaction arises due to pro- inflammatory apoptosis, which leads to the appearance of ‚Äúfast‚Äù erythema for UV irradiated skin keratinocytes. Kinetic of ‚Äúfast‚Äù erythema is much faster by the time of development of UV erythema caused by necrosis of UV damaged keratinocytes [6]. The most erythemogenic is UVB (UVB, 280 - 320 nanometers) the spectral range of UVR, since radiation in this range is less absorbed by the outer layers of the skin, which allows UVB radiation, in contrast to UVC (UVC, 200 - 280 nm), to reach more deep layers skin and act on keratinocytes of the deep-lying basal layer of the epidermis of the skin. The ability to induce apoptosis for UVB and UVC radiation is due to the fact that the DNA of the nucleus [7] and / or mitochondria [8] of the cell absorbs UVR well in the UVC and UVB spectral range. Keratinocytes of the skin (regardless of UVR exposure) are in a state of programmed apoptosis, during which the keratinocytes of the basal layer are removed from it and during the transition through all layers of the epidermis within 28 days turn into flakes of the outer stratum corneum, which are subsequently desquamated. It is clear that the keratinocyte response to UV exposure will depend on what phase of programmed apoptosis (at what distance from the basal layer) the keratinocyte experienced UV exposure, and this is the main reason for the difference of the UV effect for UVC and UVB on the skin. There are also differences in the initiation of mitochondrial (internal) and caspase-dependent (external) apoptosis for the UVC and UVB spectral ranges [9]. Sunburn cells (SBS) are the keratinocytes in the process of UV-induced apoptosis (both ‚Äúpure‚Äù and pro- inflammatory). The appearance of SBC may not be associated with an inflammatory reaction, but the role of UV-induced apoptosis of skin keratinocytes in the development of UV erythema (hyperemia, redness) of the skin has been established, which allowed the development of a patent-protected METHOD FOR QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF APOPTOSIS SYSTEM [10], in which ‚Äúthe brightest lamp of skin display \\"(photoerythema) is used (as an indicator of the manifestation of strictly dosed sterile inflammation) to diagnose the state of the body systems involved in the elimination of UV-induced damage. Such systems (except apoptosis) include the immune system, the intracellular repair system, the microcirculation system and not only.

Establishing mechanism of development skin erythema induced by ultraviolet radiation in interests of dynamic UV erythemal diagnostic. √ñsterreichisches Multiscience Journal (Innsbruck, Austria) VOL 1, No22 (2019) p. 12 - 23 UVB- induced apoptosis is the programmed cell death of cells that become damaged by ultraviolet rays. This is notable in skin cells, to prevent melanoma. Some studies have shown that exercise accelerates this process. Apoptosis is a physiological process, that promotes the active suicide of cells, resulting in an advantage, unlike necrosis which occurs from trauma. In the average human adult it is estimated that 50 to 70 billion cells die each day from apoptosis. One of the largest promoters of apoptosis is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. While UV light is essential to human life it can also cause harm by inducing cancer, immunosuppression, photoaging, inflammation, and cell death. Of the various components of sunlight, ultraviolet radiation B (UVB) (290-320 nm) is considered to be the most harmful. This type of radiation acts primarily on the epidermis, and in particular the keratinocytes. Keratinocytes are known to form a barrier to provide a layer of protection within the skin against environmental hazards. Within the epidermis, in addition to the keratinocytes, there are melanocytes (melanin producing cells). These cells produce pigment that provides the keratinocytes with protection against UVB radiation. Once the keratinocytes have been damaged irreparably as a result of UVB radiation, they are marked for destruction by apoptosis to eliminate them as they are potentially mutagenic cells. Failure of the body to remove DNA damaged cells increases the risk of skin cancer.Free Radical Biology and Medicine, Vol 52, Issue 6, 15 March 2012, Pages 1111-1120. Skin mild hypoxia enhances killing of UVB-damaged keratinocytes through relative oxygen species- mediated apoptosis requiring Nova and Bim. Kris Kys, Hannaelore Maes, Graieia Andrei, Rober Snoeck, Maria Garmyn, Partiizia Agostinis One consequence of acute UVB exposure is the occurrence of sunburn cells, keratinocytes, within the epidermis. It has been found that when exposed to UVB radiation the DNA in an epidermis cell undergoes fragmentation, which could result in the growth of tumor cells. To prevent this the cell undergoes a morphological change into keratinocytes. These keratinocytes exhibit the capacity to release TNF-Œ± (tumor necrosis factor - alpha) that stop the growth of the tumor by promoting the death of the cell. If keratinocyte cells have been damaged by UVB radiation, the term \\"sunburn cell\\" or \\"SBC formation\\" is used. It is thought that when keratinocytes have been damaged by UVB radiation, this triggers a series of processes, caused in part by damage to the DNA. A study indicates that it may be at the mitochondria where the various processes (ligan- dependent receptor activation and cytosolic signaling) pathways are activated by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may direct the destruction of keratinocytes through apoptosis by activating caspase. As a result of increased exposure to an oxygen-reduced environment, this promotes the development of ROS thereby linking the incidence of ROS with keratinocytes and making these cells more sensitive to UVB radiation. A study by Tobi et al., in 2002 has linked ROS with cytotoxicity, apoptosis, mutations, and carcinogenesis. Mild hypoxia (1-5%) sensitized keratinocytes to UVB-induced apoptosis, while protecting melanocytes from environmental stresses. A study by Mark Schotanus, et al., has demonstrated that in addition to potential damage to keratinocytes and melanocytes, exposure to UVB radiation may also produce a loss of potassium ions, which may then cause the activation of apoptotic pathways in lymphocytes and neuronal cells as opposed to keratinocytes and melanocytes. It has been demonstrated that incubation of lymphocytes and neuronal cells in elevated concentrations of potassium ions provides protection from apoptosis. This phenomenon was demonstrated in tears, which have higher levels of potassium ions, and bathe cells of the eye and therefore provides protection from UVB radiation. Reduction of potassium ions promotes apoptosis and the synthesis of initiator caspase-8 and the effector caspase-3.Experimental Eye Research, Vol 93, Issue 5, November 2011, pages 735-740. Stratified Corneal timbal epithelial cells are protected from UVB- induced apoptosis by elevated extracellular potassium ions. Mark Schotanus, Leah R. Koetje, Rachel E. Van Dyken, John L.

Hall, Clay M. Winterford and Kay A.O. Ellem, that while caspase may play a role in apoptosis, it is specifically not as a result of caspase-3. It was reported in that study that the process of apoptosis includes: \\"detachment from the substrate, followed by loss of specialized membrane structures such as microvilli. The cell then undergoes rounding, shrinkage and blabbing before condensation of chromatin is observed in the nucleus. After a period of time the cell fragments into apoptotic bodies, which in vivo are engulfed and degraded by phagocytic cells such as macrophages\\" Methods 2008; 44; pages 205-221, Apoptosis and necrosis, detection, discrimination and phagocytosis, Krysko D.V. Berghe T.V. D. Herde, K., Vandenabeele P. Caspase I is involved in the aforementioned cell membrane activity but not caspase-3. UVB-induced apoptosis pathway The sequence of events that leads to apoptosis is multifaceted and complex. Despite the simple concept of apoptosis, the sequence of events that leads to it and other conditions that attempt to counter act it can be very cumbersome. Since apoptosis is a last resort alternative, it takes the initiation of multiple other genes (ING2, p53, or Ras subfamily) expressed before the cell is finally programmed for death. In addition, genes like Survivin can attempt to suppress apoptosis. References *Free Radical Biology and Medicine, Vol 52, Issue 6, 15 March 2012, Pages 1111-1120.

Form 144 is notification to the SEC of this intention to sell and must take place at the time the sell order is placed with the broker-dealer. The securities may be sold within the 90-day period after Form 144 is filed. On December 6, 2007, the SEC published final rules revising Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, which regulates the resale of restricted securities and securities held by affiliates. The amendments to Rule 144, among other things: #Shorten the holding period for affiliate and non-affiliate holders of restricted securities of SEC-reporting companies to six months, subject to certain conditions. # #Permit unlimited resale by non-affiliate holders of restricted securities by complying only with the current public information condition for resale of restricted securities issued by SEC reporting companies made after the six-month holding period and without complying with any Rule 144 conditions for resale of restricted securities issued by both SEC reporting and non-reporting companies made after a one-year holding period. # #Permit resale of equity securities by affiliates that meet certain conditions through riskless principal transactions and brokers' transactions in which the broker has published bid and asked quotations for the security in an alternative trading system. # #Eliminate the manner of sale conditions and ease the volume limitations for resale of debt securities by affiliates. # #Increase the thresholds that trigger the Form 144 filing requirement to 5,000 shares or $50,000. The SEC did not adopt previously proposed provisions relating to the tolling of holding periods in connection with hedging transactions. The amendments became effective on February 15, 2008, and will apply to securities acquired before or after that date. Background Rule 144 regulates the resale of \\"restricted securities\\" and \\"control securities\\" by establishing certain conditions that must be satisfied in order for the resale to be exempt from the Securities Act registration requirements pursuant to Section 4(1) of the Securities Act‚Äîa safe harbor from \\"underwriter\\" status for the selling security holder. The conditions include the following: *There must be adequate current public information available about the issuer; *If the securities being sold are restricted securities, the security holder must have held the security for a specified holding period; *The resale must be within specified sales volume limitations; *The resale must comply with the manner of sale requirements of the rule; and *The selling security holder must file Form 144 with the SEC if the amount of securities being sold exceeds specified thresholds. Amendments to Conditions for Resale of Restricted Securities Restricted Securities of SEC-Reporting Companies. The SEC has reduced the holding period under Rule 144 for restricted securities of SEC- reporting companies held by both affiliates and non-affiliates from one year to six months. Affiliate holders of reporting company securities may now resell their restricted securities after six months, subject to the other Rule 144 requirements. Non-affiliate holders of reporting company securities (who have also not been affiliates during the prior three months) may now resell their restricted securities held between six months and one year subject only to Rule 144's current public information requirement. Any such resale by a non-affiliate after one year will be exempt from all Rule 144 requirements. Restricted Securities of Non-Reporting Companies. There is still a one-year holding period for affiliate and non-affiliate holders of restricted securities in non-reporting companies under amended Rule 144. After the one- year holding period, non-affiliates may now resell their restricted securities without having to comply with any other Rule 144 requirements; affiliates seeking to resell their restricted securities must still meet all Rule 144 requirements. The manner of sale requirements of Rule 144 require securities to be sold in \\"brokers' transactions\\" or in transactions directly with a \\"market maker.\\" The rule includes restrictions on (1) soliciting or arranging for the solicitation of orders to buy the securities in anticipation of, or in connection with, the Rule 144 transaction or (2) making any payment in connection with the offer or sale of the securities to any person other than the broker who executes the order to sell the securities. The SEC amended these rules to also permit the resale of restricted equity securities by affiliates through riskless principal transactions in which trades are executed at the same price, exclusive of any explicitly disclosed markup or markdown, commission equivalent or other fee, and the rules for a self- regulatory organization permit the transaction to be reported as riskless.3 The amended rule also expands the definition of a \\"brokers' transaction\\" for purposes of such resale by permitting a broker to insert bid and ask quotations for the security in an alternative trading system, provided that the broker has published bona fide bid and ask quotations for such security on each of the last 12 business days. Resale of Restricted Debt Securities The SEC has eliminated the manner-of-sale requirements for affiliate resale of debt securities, including non-participatory preferred stock (which have debt- like characteristics) and asset-backed securities. The SEC also raised the volume limitations for the resale of debt securities to permit resale in an amount that does not exceed ten percent of a tranche (or a class with respect to non-participatory preferred stock), together with all sales of securities of the same tranche sold for the selling debt security holder within a three- month period. Form 144 Filing Triggers The sales thresholds for filing Form 144 have been increased from 500 shares or $10,000 worth of securities to 5,000 shares or $50,000. Codified SEC Staff Interpretations The SEC has also codified various staff interpretations relating to Rule 144, including the following: #Stating that securities acquired by accredited investors pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act are considered restricted securities # #Permitting tacking of holding periods when a company reorganizes into a holding company structure # #Permitting tacking of holding periods for conversions and exchanges of securities # #Deeming the acquisition dates for securities acquired pursuant to the cashless exercise of options and warrants as the dates the options or warrants were acquired # #Permitting a pledgee of restricted securities to sell the pledged securities without having to aggregate the sale with sales by other pledgees from the same pledgor (as long as there is no concerted action by those pledgees), for purposes of the Rule 144 volume limitation condition # #Permitting the Form 144 representations required from security holders relying on Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 to be made as of the date the holder adopted a trading plan or gave trading instructions # #Confirming the unavailability of Rule 144 for the resale of securities by reporting and non-reporting firms Analyst Use of Form 144 Filings Insiders have access to information not generally available to the public, so investors may benefit from monitoring how insiders transact in their own shares. Form 144 filings reflect an insider's intention to sell, but do not indicate the motivations for selling. While some studies have shown that insider purchases and sales may be good predictors of future stock performance, insiders may sell for reasons unrelated to non-public information they have. Investors and analysts can find Form 144 filings on EDGAR on the SEC web site.

While Jaunius published very little, his major achievements include a well regarded Lithuanian grammar, systematization and classification of the Lithuanian dialects, and descriptions of Lithuanian accentuation. Though most of his conclusions on etymology and comparative linguistics were proven to be incorrect, his works remain valuable for vast observational data. Jaunius studied at the Kaunas Priest Seminary and Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy. He was ordained a priest in 1875 and earned his Master of Theology in 1879. He taught several subjects, including moral theology and homiletics, at the Kaunas Priest Seminary from 1880 to 1892. His class notes on the Lithuanian language became a well regarded Lithuanian grammar book first published in 1897. After disagreements with Bishop , Jaunius became a dean in Kazan in 1893. However, he experienced severe mental health issues and returned to Lithuania to recuperate in 1895. He obtained a teaching position at the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy in 1898. He was of poor health and developed graphophobia (fear of writing). In 1902, Kazimieras B≈´ga was hired as Jaunius' personal secretary to help collect and publish Jaunius' work. Jaunius retired from teaching in 1906 and died in 1908. B≈´ga published two of his major works already after Jaunius' death. Biography Early life and education Jaunius was eldest of five children born to a family of Lithuanian peasants in the village of near Kvƒódarna. His parents worked about 60 dessiatins of land. His father was illiterate, but he decided to send Jaunius to school. He attended a primary school in Rietavas, progymnasium in Tel≈°iai in 1860‚Äì1864, and (former Kra≈æiai College) in 1866‚Äì1869. He did not complete the gymnasium education and withdrew in 1869 but continued to study the languages translating various texts from Latin, German, Polish. In November 1871, he enrolled into the Kaunas Priest Seminary where he became a student of Antanas Baranauskas who taught homiletics in Lithuanian and studied the different dialects of the Lithuanian language. Baranauskas asked students to write down samples of local dialects and Jaunius turned in a tale in the dialect of Endriejavas residents. This tale was published by Czech linguist in 1875. Baranauskas mentored Jaunius and introduced him to other linguists, including Jan Niecis≈Çaw Baudouin de Courtenay, , . As a gifted student, Jaunius was sent to the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy even prior the completion of the priest seminary, but he failed exams in Russian language, geography, and history. He graduated from the seminary in June 1875 and was ordained a priest. He then successfully retook exams for the Theological Academy and continued to study theology. Several noted linguists and philologists, including Lucian M√ºller, Franz Anton Schiefner, Daniel Chwolson, and , taught at the academy. By the time he graduated from the academy, he knew eight languages (Lithuanian, Russian, Polish, Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit, German, French). In 1879, the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences asked Jaunius to review a collection of Lithuanian folk songs compiled by Antanas Ju≈°ka. After defending two thesis (one on morals in comedies of Nikolai Gogol and another on theology De conservatione mundi per Deum), he was awarded the Master of Theology in summer 1879. Teacher in Kaunas and illness After the graduation, Jaunius was offered a teaching position at the academy in Saint Petersburg, but Bishop did not approve it and appointed Jaunius as vicar of Kaunas Cathedral in December 1879. In September 1880, he became teacher of Latin, catechism, and moral theology at the Kaunas Priest Seminary. In September 1883, he became secretary of Bishop Paliulionis and had to leave the seminary. Jaunius returned to the priest seminary in October 1885 as teacher of moral theology, homiletics, and Lithuanian language. He was a popular professor and his Lithuanian lectures inspired several priests, including Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas and Maironis, to join the Lithuanian National Revival. His lectures were often impulsive and disorganized; for example, he would often catch a word from a student and start analyzing its etymology. Therefore, his students often did not finish the full grammar in two years. Jaunius devoted his time to linguistic studies and published several articles on the dialects of the Lithuanian language. In 1892, Bishop Paliulionis dismissed Jaunius from the priest seminary because he was not following the strict rules of the seminary. As he was no longer welcome in the Diocese of Samogitia, Jaunius searched for another posting and considered Dorpat (Tartu). He finally found a vacant deanery in Kazan in March 1893. Jaunius possibly targeted Kazan because it had a university where , who had written on the Lithuanian language, was a professor. However, the ordeal with the bishop negatively affected Jaunius' mental health. He was plagued by homesickness and loneliness and suffered from hallucinations and paranoia. When he could not hold a mournful mass for Tsar Alexander III of Russia due to his poor health, Tsarist authorities suspected political motives and wanted to exile him to Siberia. Instead, they put him in a psychiatric hospital. In 1895, brought Jaunius back from Kazan to Lithuania where he lived with friends and acquaintances trying to improve his health and recover, but had no means of earning a living. He petitioned the Governor of Kaunas for a monthly disability pay and was hoping to get a teaching job at the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy. He frequently visited Saint Petersburg where he reestablished academic contacts. He helped Eduards Volters with the publication of the postil of Mikalojus Dauk≈°a and delivered three lectures on Lithuanian word endings to the Neo-Philological Society in 1898. Professor in Saint Petersburg In December 1898, Jaunius finally managed to get a teaching position at the Theological Academy. Initially, he taught Ancient Greek for an annual salary of 400 rubles but at the start of the 1899/1900 school year, he was promoted to a professor of Latin and Ancient Greek with a salary of 1,000 rubles. In 1902, he transitioned to teaching Biblical Hebrew. He was also active in philological societies and continued his linguistic research. In 1903, the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w offered him chairmanship of the newly formed Lithuanian language section but Jaunius refused possibly due his deteriorating health ‚Äì he complained of poor eyesight, weak heart, pain in legs, auditory issues, etc. He spent considerable amount of time searching for treatments and visiting sanatoriums abroad. Towards the end of his life, he also developed graphophobia (fear of writing). When Jonas Basanaviƒçius asked him why he made so many notes in book margins instead of writing them down in a notebook, Jaunius replied that he was afraid of white paper and almost never used blank sheets. Therefore, he avoided writing down his thoughts or publishing his research. Afraid that his knowledge was wasting, professors and Aleksey Shakhmatov organized funding for a private secretary. Kazimieras B≈´ga, then a gymnasium student, was hired in 1902 and became a student of Jaunius. Jaunius' reputation as an expert on the Lithuanian language grew. In late 1903, Vyacheslav von Plehve, Minister of the Interior, asked Jaunius' expert opinion on whether the Cyrillic script was suited for the Lithuanian language (publication of Lithuanian texts in the Latin alphabet was banned since 1864). According to memoirs of Pranci≈°kus B≈´ƒçys, Jaunius delayed his response and insisted on correcting, rewriting, and reediting the response multiple times ‚Äì B≈´ƒçys had to rewrite the letter several times and mail it out before Jaunius could point out any further corrections. His reply that the Lithuanian language used a Latin‚ÄìLithuanian alphabet (and not Latin‚ÄìPolish) was added the case file during government debates that led to the lifting of the ban in early 1904. In 1904, Jaunius received an honorary doctorate in comparative linguistics from the Kazan University (that year the university celebrated its 100th anniversary). In 1907, he was one of the founding members of the Lithuanian Scientific Society and was elected its honorary member. Jaunius health forced him to resign from the Theological Academy in spring 1906. He received a monthly pension of 50 rubles and continued to live in Saint Petersburg. For a year, he lived in a room at the Theological Academy and then rented a cramped one-room apartment in the city. He died of a heart attack in March 1908 alone and in poverty. Jan Niecis≈Çaw Baudouin de Courtenay and wrote articles about Jaunius' life that were published as separate booklets. His body was transported and buried in Kaunas. Lithuanian magazines Draugija and Viltis devoted entire issues to his memory. Lithuanian activists started a fundraising campaign to erect a monument (built in 1913 by sculptor Antanas Aleksandraviƒçius) and to publish his works. In 1991, a granary was reconstructed at the birthplace of Jaunius and turned into his memorial museum. Works Catechism of Martynas Ma≈ævydas Jaunius published very little. His two major books were published by his secretary Kazimieras B≈´ga already after his death. Most of Jaunius research was focused on etymology. Jan Niecis≈Çaw Baudouin de Courtenay praised Jaunius' deep knowledge of multiple languages and his ability to take in this vast information, systematize it, and arrive to broad conclusions. His conclusions were often incorrect which some attribute to his lack of specialized linguistic education. Lithuanian grammar His major work, the Lithuanian grammar, was based on his teaching notes from the Kaunas Priest Seminary. At the time, there was no published Lithuanian grammar that Jaunius could have used. His students copied and recopied his notes which circulated widely. They were first published (hectographed) by a group of Lithuanian students without Jaunius' knowledge or input in Dorpat (Tartu) in 1897. It was a 338-page work in four parts: spelling, phonetics, case inflection, and verb conjugation. In 1905, professor agreed to finance a proper publication of the grammar. However, Jaunius managed to review and correct only 48 pages of the manuscript. Therefore, B≈´ga finished preparing the grammar based on the hectographed copy from 1897. The final 216-page book was published in 1911. B≈´ga further worked on preparing a Russian translation which was published in 1916. While the grammar was written as a practical textbook for Lithuanian clerics, it contained new and deep insights into the living language and was praised by Jonas Jablonskis for its wealth of knowledge. Jablonskis used Jaunius' grammar extensively when preparing his own publication that became the key work in creating the standard Lithuanian language. Nevertheless, its coverage was inconsistent and not comprehensive. For example, verbs were analyzed in 80 pages while syntax only briefly described in 10 pages. Jaunius did not prioritize one Lithuanian dialect over another and did not attempt to standardize pronunciation of the different dialects. Instead, he attempted to modify spelling to accommodate different pronunciation. Therefore, he introduced ten new letters that each dialect could pronounce based on its needs. That made the spelling cumbersome and impractical and it was not adopted by anyone else. Jaunius provided examples from different dialects and thus developed a more comprehensive picture of the Lithuanian language and its most common features. In his work, Jaunius had to develop Lithuanian terminology for various linguistic terms. He was not very successful in this area as he often used awkward compound words or simply translated Latin terms without fully adapting them to the Lithuanian language. Nevertheless, some of his terms were adopted and are widely used, including linksnis for grammatical case, veiksma≈æodis for verb, priesaga for suffix, etc. Dialectology Jaunius studied Lithuanian dialects and grouped them into sub-dialects. His classification was later improved by . Their classification is known as Jaunius‚ÄìSalys or traditional classification when compared to the newer classification of Zigmas Zinkeviƒçius and . In 1891‚Äì1898, he wrote and published descriptions of dialects in six uyezds ‚Äì Ukmergƒó in 1890, Kaunas in 1891, Raseiniai in 1892, Zarasai in 1894, ≈†iauliai in 1895, Panevƒó≈æys in 1897 and 1898. In 1900, he also published an article on Lithuanian pitch-accent in 1900. All of these articles were written in Russian and published in an annual publication Memorial Book of the Kovno Governorate (), the yearbook of the Kaunas government. Jaunius wrote about the dialect classification in his Lithuanian grammar book. Jaunius identified the two major dialects ‚Äì Samogitian and Auk≈°taitian ‚Äì based on pronunciation of certain sounds. He then subdivided each dialect into three sub-dialects ‚Äì Samogitians based on the pronunciation of diphthongs ie and uo and Auk≈°taitians based on diphthongs am, an, em, en and letter l before ƒó. Jaunius did not separate out the Dz≈´kian dialect. While he was not always consistent in his classification, he clearly identified the criteria for separating local variations into sub-dialects. His observations and rules for accents remain relevant and authoritative. Other works B≈´ga wrote down 3,043 pages in six volumes of Jaunius' teachings on Lithuanian, Latvian, and Prussian languages and their Baltic proto-language. Since Jaunius could not work on getting them published, B≈´ga wrote and prepared the first volume of Aisti≈°ki studijai (Baltic Studies) for publication in May 1906, but after delays it was published only in May 1908. B≈´ga also had the second volume prepared in 1906‚Äì1907, but after his own linguistic studies B≈´ga realized that many of Jaunius' theories were incorrect and amateurish. For example, when explaining etymology of a certain word, Jaunius often searched for equivalents in the trendy Greek or Armenian languages instead of closer neighbors. He often grouped semantically similar but phonetically different words and attempted to find their true original form. While the conclusions are often incorrect, the notes are still valuable for their observational data. Jaunius studied the relationship between Indo- European languages and Finno-Ugric languages or Semitic. He left notes for Lithuanian‚ÄìEstonian (446 words) and Lithuanian‚ÄìFinnish (474 words) etymological dictionaries. He also prepared a dictionary of loanwords of Baltic origin in the Finnish language (222 words). He likely became interested in Finno-Ugric languages after reading a work of August Ahlqvist in 1878. He claimed to have discovered equivalents of consonants in Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Semitic languages. In his last decade, Jaunius was interested in many different topics and started many projects, but was unable to finish them. A collection of his previously unpublished manuscripts was published in 1972.

It is located at 8 Carrera Street. Built within a one-year span (from 1886 to 1887), it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on November 29, 1979, for its architectural significance and as an example of community planning.  History  Henry Flagler set his sights on building the Hotel Alcazar across the street from the Hotel Ponce de Leon, but this site was already occupied by Olivet Methodist Episcopal Church, built in 1884. Flagler offered the trustees of the church a new plot of land and to pay the construction costs for a new church structure, which they accepted. Flagler gave them a plot of land behind his first hotel, the Hotel Ponce de Leon, at the northwest corner of Carrera and Cordova Streets. Construction on the church and an attached parsonage began in 1886 and was completed the following year. On January 1, 1888 the first service was held in the new church, named Grace Methodist Episcopal Church, and it was dedicated later in January by Bishop W.F. Mallelieu. In total, the church's construction cost about $85,000. Just like the Hotel Ponce de Leon, the church was designed by John M. Carrere and Thomas Hastings, of Carrere and Hastings architecture firm in New York, and constructed by contractors James A. McGuire and Joseph E. McDonald. It was built of poured concrete, an underused building material and process at the time, and was designed to complement the other Flagler buildings in St. Augustine with a Spanish Renaissance Revival architectural style. The concrete also contained shell aggregate and sand in order to withstand the sometimes harsh physical environment of coastal Florida. The red Spanish tile and terracotta designs that appear on the door and on the church's tower are consistent with Spanish Renaissance style. The sanctuary was adorned with Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows, just like the Ponce de Leon. In 1947, a home across the street was purchased to serve as the church's parsonage, and the old parsonage was converted into an educational building for Sunday school classes and other church activities. Much of the interior was remodeled in the late 1950s. Some of the updates undertaken at this time included refinishing the walls and woodwork, remodeling the chancel and choir loft, rewiring and adding new light fixtures, installing a heating and air conditioning system, and installing new pews. The Tiffany windows remain. In 2011, Grace UMC merged with Christ Church, another Methodist church in St. Augustine.

Family History The Hemings emigrated from Bognor (Regis) England in the top half of the 19th century. Edward Francis Heming left Bognor and settled just outside Guelph, Ontario. on the Eramosa Line in 1832. He called the farm 'Bognor Lodge' and it is still there today in Heming ownership. The northern half of the farm was expropriated and flooded to make Guelph Lake. The Heming family traces its ancestors back to King Harold Heming of Denmark, the last Viking king of Denmark, and the one who brought Christianity to Denmark. They eventually travelled through France and settled there having the town named 'Heming' after them. When France became Roman Catholic, they were/are Protestants, they emigrated again just across the English Channel to the seaside spa of Bognor. Edward Heming had five sons in Canada West. One of them was Charles Heming and he became the postmaster of the small village of Sydenham. Because there was another growing town near Ottawa with the same name, Charles was asked to change the name of Sydenham. He changed it to 'Bognor' and it is there today. A tribute to the pioneering Canadian Heming family.

It was where the Callander and Oban Railway was joined by the Comrie, St Fillans & Lochearnhead Railway from Crieff.  History   Opening and development  When opened as part of the Callander and Oban Railway on 1 June 1870,Butt (1995) Balquhidder station was called Lochearnhead. The station was laid out with two platforms, one on either side of a crossing loop. There were sidings on the east side of the station. The station was renamed as Balquhidder on 1 July 1904. Balquhidder station was relocated slightly further south on 18 December 1904 in preparation for it becoming a junction with the Comrie, St Fillans & Lochearnhead Railway. Upon the opening of the junction on 1 May 1905, the station boasted two signal boxes and an engine shed. Closure  When the line to Crieff closed on 1 October 1951, the station ceased to be a junction. The crossing loop was taken out of use on 21 March 1965. This station was closed with the Callander and Oban line on 28 September 1965, six weeks before the scheduled closure on 1 November 1965 due to a landslide in Glen Ogle.  Routes   Current status  The site is now a holiday park with log cabins, caravans, camping etc. Recently the station steps were repainted and repairs were undertaken to the crumbling wall of the remains of the waiting room. The pedestrian tunnel can still be accessed though is blocked half way through. Across the road, the old post office is now the site of the Golden Larches Restaurant.

The farcical plot concerns a house-guest who mistakes his hostess's husband for an intruder. The opera's first run in London was under the management of Michael Gunn, but the piece was played by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in the 1880s and 1890s as a curtain raiser to full-length Savoy operas, both on tour and later in London. Background and productions The fashion in the late Victorian era was to present long evenings in the theatre, and so producer Richard D'Oyly Carte preceded his Savoy operas with curtain raisers such as Quite an Adventure.Lee Bernard. \\"Swash-buckling Savoy curtain-raiser\\", Sheffield Telegraph, 1 August 2008 W. J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers: :This was a one-act play, seen only by the early comers. It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ... [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen- Pope, Walter James.

The score contains music only, no dialogue. A copy of the libretto is in the Lord Chamberlain's collection (filed September/October 1880). Synopsis In its review of the London premiere, The Era gave this summary of the plot: :It appears that a young married lady, Mrs. Wallaby, living at Croydon, and always in great fear of burglars, is left alone meditating upon a little adventure she has had at Victoria Station. She had been to an entertainment, and from excitement or fatigue had felt faint, when a benevolent young gentleman, a stranger, came to her assistance. Arriving safely at Croydon, however, she is rather startled at receiving a visitor, no other than the gentleman who had so kindly rendered assistance. The stranger, after an apology for troubling her so late, ultimately explains that he cannot get into his rooms, and is locked out, the fact being that in his desire to hasten her recovery he had put his latch key down the lady's back. With many apologies the gentlemen requests Mrs. Wallaby to shake herself a little in order to discover if she is carrying the latch key about her, and with some confusion the lady consents, and after much comic gesticulation the key eventually falls on the floor. Meanwhile, poor Mr. Fraser, the benevolent owner of the key, hears the shriek and roar of the last train to London, and the rain is coming down in torrents. What is to be done? Mrs. Wallaby has not the heart to turn him out, and so, anticipating her husband's speedy return, she supplies the stranger with brandy and water, cigars, her husband's slippers and dressing gown, and leaves him. Mr. Fraser accordingly makes himself comfortable, takes off his wet coat, and wetter boots, mixes a stiff glass of brandy and water, and waxes enthusiastic respecting the charming young wife. He, however, first hangs up his dripping clothes in the hall, but is speedily startled at hearing footsteps, and presumes this must be the burglar whose appearance Mrs. Wallaby so much dreaded. It is no burglar, but her own husband, who, discovering a man in the house is terribly alarmed. Both the men are desperately afraid of each other, and the situation serves for the introduction of an amusing duet. In the height of their excitement a policeman enters. He has been waiting for an interview with the cook, and wonders that the siren of the kitchen is so long in coming to meet him. Curious to ascertain the cause of the delay, he comes cautiously into the house through the French windows opening on the garden, and immediately pounces upon the two men. Mr. Fraser, the owner of the latch key, at once gives the husband in charge; but Mrs. Wallaby enters, and explains, and all ends happily, the stranger being invited to spend the remainder of the night with them.The Era, 10 September 1881, p. 6 Cast ;Original 1881 London cast *Mr. Wallaby ‚Äì Charles Ashford *Mr. Fraser ‚Äì Arthur Williams *Policeman ‚Äì Fred Solomon *Mrs. Wallaby ‚Äì Edith Blande ;1883 Touring cast *Mr. Wallaby ‚Äì A.

He came to national attention when a television documentary was made of how he continued his work in the parish after telling his Bishop and parishioners he had AIDS - the first British priest to do so. Childhood Simon Bailey was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, one of five children - Rosemary, Simon, Martin, Jacqueline, and Caroline. His father, the Reverend Walter Bailey, was a Baptist minister who combined conservative evangelical theological convictions with social radicalism. He bought his first television in order to be able to watch the funeral of Sir Winston Churchill in 1965. Walter Bailey supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and actually died while distributing leaflets for the Labour Party. The socialist historians E. P. Thompson and Dorothy Thompson as well as the writer J. B. Priestley were regular visitors to the family home in Halifax. The family moved first to Birkenhead and then to Stoke-on-Trent, following Walter Bailey as he was called to different churches. Eventually he became so idiosyncratic that he ran his own church from home. http://www.rosemarybailey.com/?page_id=5 Oxford and Cambridge Simon Bailey continued his education at Regent's Park College, the Baptist Permanent Private Hall of the University of Oxford, where he read English Language and Literature under John F. Kiteley (himself once the pupil of J. R. R. Tolkien). He gained a First Class degree. (biographical note, rear cover) Despite having chosen to study at the Baptist Regent's Park, Simon Bailey was by now unhappy in the Baptist tradition. He received the sacrament of confirmation in the Church of England, embracing Anglicanism as more \\"aesthetic and sensual\\". After Oxford, Simon Bailey studied theology at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and was influenced by the writer and religious philosopher Don Cupitt, Fellow and erstwhile Dean of the college. Bailey subsequently did his theological training for the Ministry at Westcott House, Cambridge. Norton Simon Bailey's first experience of pastoral work was as a curate in the parish of Norton, Sheffield, where he stayed four years. Unusually, he chose to live not in the more middle-class suburb of Norton itself, but on a rough part of a council estate on the edge of the parish. In an article he wrote for The Guardian, he humorously described this experience.Bailey, Simon; The Guardian (Apr 19, 1986), p. 20. The then Bishop of Sheffield, David Lunn, put it in stronger terms: > ‚ÄúIt was unspeakable, you picked over the lads demolishing their motorbikes > in the corridor, the debris, the row going on outside, the unbelievable > neighbours, the violence. then Simon‚Äôs flat was like going into a don‚Äôs room > at Cambridge, elegant, beautiful, with lots of books. Simon maintained his > distinctiveness and yet had a readiness to share that without any pretence > he liked Top of the Pops or whatever, and they recognised in him his care > for them. I don‚Äôt know if the parish ever recognised the significance of > that ministry.‚Äù quoted in (p.21) A major event for the parish and the wider community, conceived and executed by Simon Bailey, was a large-scale community venture involving the production and performance of a play written and directed by him. It built on the mediaeval tradition of mystery and miracle plays, and was performed with dancing, acting and music in the churchyard of the ancient parish church of St. James. The play, ‚ÄúChad. A Miracle Play for Norton‚Äù was written largely in blank verse. The Miracle Play, performed on 1‚Äì6 July 1985, was a contribution to Sheffield's Year of Mission in 1984‚Äì5. This year had also involved a mission by the American evangelist Billy Graham and Bailey sought to offer an alternative to the individualism stressed in evangelical Christianity. > ‚ÄúThe play‚Ä¶ is an attempt to‚Ä¶ concentrate on faith as fullness of life, as > community, and as deepened spirituality rather than on personal ‚Äúsalvation‚Äù. > (Self-published by Simon Bailey and St James Church, Norton)(p.9) Therefore, he involved people from the wider community in the project and performance, including the local schools. In fact the cast alone came to more than 100 people. The play's narrative is an imaginary depiction of how Chad and his followers attempted to bring Christianity to the region in the 7th century. (p.28-30) Dinnington Simon Bailey was inducted as Rector of St. Leonard's parish church, Dinnington in South Yorkshire on 20 December 1985. Dinnington was a South Yorkshire mining community, whose colliery closed in 1991.http://www.achurchnearyou.com/dinnington-st-leonard/ Simon Bailey was a gay man and contracted HIV from a sexual partner. He learned that he had the virus only a month before his induction as Rector of Dinnington.Bailey, R.: Scarlet Ribbons, p.31, p.35 For several years he worked in the parish without obvious symptoms, but when he became too unwell to conceal his condition from the people around him he informed the diocesan authorities and from 1992 on, gradually introduced the news to his own parishioners. Though not the only Anglican priest at that time to be HIV-positive, and eventually to develop AIDS, he was the first to stay in parish ministry, continuing to celebrate the Eucharist until only a few weeks before his death. One of the most remarkable features of his time at Dinnington was the love and care that he received from his parishioners. National publicity Simon Bailey became well known to a wider public as a result of a BBC Everyman documentary programme, Simon's Cross,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1808892/ which was broadcast on 15 January 1995. His sister Rosemary Bailey wrote a lengthy article for the Independent on Sunday (\\"A Parish Learns to be Positive\\"), which was published on the same day. The making of the programme led to Rosemary Bailey (author) writing the biography, Scarlet Ribbons: A Priest with AIDS. AIDS BOOK REVIEW JOURNAL A new edition was published in 2017 to considerable acclaim including the BBC Radio 4 broadcast A priest with AIDShttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08ylr4n#play on 23 July 2017. Writing Simon Bailey wrote a biographical study of the liturgical scholar Gregory Dix, A Tactful God: Gregory Dix: Priest, Monk and Scholar (Leominster: Gracewing, 1995. ). He also wrote pastoral works, *Stations: places for pilgrims to pray (Sheffield: Cairns Publications, 1991. ) *Still with God: a new way of praying (London: National Society, Church House, 1986. . Revised edition: 1993) *The well within: parables for living and dying (London: Darton, Longman and Todd, 1996) His biography, Scarlet Ribbons: A Priest with AIDS (see above) contains extracts from his unpublished writings. These hint at considerable literary gifts and it is to be hoped that a full publication will appear eventually. Interests, influences and causes Simon Bailey's literary influences were varied. He was particularly interested in the poetry of R. S. Thomas and of John Milton, whose blindness Bailey identified with his own illnesses.http://www.rosemarybailey.com/?page_id=11 He himself acknowledged that the Miracle Play he wrote for Norton owed a debt to Christopher Fry. (p.28) There was an overlap between his interest in drama and his interest in liturgy. In one article he wrote for the journal Theology, he drew a comparison between the role of the priest and actors and stressed the importance of the theatrical dimension, celebrating the symbols: > ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the symbols are the only way in. It is rediscovering the Story, the Myth, > reawakening it, drawing life from it, discovering it alive in our midst to > invigorate us, right in the middle of the community.‚Äù (p.96) His spirituality was very much inspired by Celtic Christianity, its holy places and saints. Among the sacred places most important to him was the small island of Bardsey, off the coast of Wales, which had been a great centre of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages. It became a place he returned to often. (p.24-25) He also acquired a significant collection of icons. Bailey was a strong advocate of women priests and an active member of the Ministry for the Ordination of Women (MOW).See for example, his article written for the MOW magazine Chrysalis. He also became involved in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

It was found in 1924 in Murfreesboro, Arkansas at the Prairie Creek pipe mine, which later became known as the Crater of Diamonds State Park. The diamond was named \\"Uncle Sam\\" after the nickname of its finder, Wesley Oley Basham, a worker at the Arkansas Diamond Corporation. The rough diamond as originally discovered weighed 40.23 carats (8.046 g). It was faceted twice by Schenck & Van Haelen of New York, which specialized in Arkansas diamonds, handling over 14,000. The company described those diamonds as being so hard that they could only be cut using powder of other Arkansas diamonds. The final result was a 12.42-carat (2.484 g) emerald-cut gem. It was characterized as M on the diamond color scale; this nominally corresponds to a faint yellow color, but the visual impression of Uncle Sam has been variously described as white or slight pink. Judging from the color, the diamond is most likely of pure IIa diamond type meaning the amount of impurities it has is below a few parts per million. The clarity of the stone was assessed as VVS1, which stands for Very Very Slightly Included and means the stone has minute non-diamond inclusions that are difficult for a skilled grader to see under 10x magnification. The diamond was owned by the Peikin Jewelers of Fifth Avenue, New York. It was lent by Peikin to the American Museum of Natural History for temporary display and storage. In 1971 it was acquired by a Boston dealer, Sidney de Young, and sold for $150,000 to an anonymous private collector. The discovery of Uncle Sam arguably rescued the Arkansas Diamond Corporation, which had a debt over US$276,470 by that time and was going to be shut down in the winter of 1924. The number of diamonds found on the surface was decreasing, and the cost of digging operations was estimated as higher than the expected diamond recovery. Not that the value of the diamond was sufficient to cover the debts, but the discovery lifted the spirits enough to keep the surface operations. Currently, the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas is the only public diamond mine in the world. Over 33,000 diamonds have been found there since the opening of the park in 1972. The place where Uncle Sam was discovered is marked, and many additional diamonds have been found there.

In June 2006 (less than three months before the 2006 general election) the commission issued its report, entitled Making Sweden an Oil-Free Society (). The report cited four reasons to reduce oil dependence: *The impact of oil prices on Swedish economic growth and employment *The link between oil, peace and security throughout the world *The great potential to use Sweden's own clean renewable energy resources in place of oil *The threat of climate change resulting from the extensive burning of fossil fuels As of 2005, oil supplies provided about 32% of the country's energy supply, with nuclear power and hydroelectricity providing much of the remainder. Although the report did not propose to end the use of oil entirely, the 2020 date was suggested as a marker on a continuing process of the \\"oil phase-out in Sweden\\". Following defeat of the incumbent government coalition in the 2006 general election, the proposals were not included in the energy policy or in any law. ‚ÄúSweden‚Äôs energy policy, in both the short and the long term, is to safeguard the supply of electricity and other forms of energy on terms that are competitive with the rest of the world. It is intended to create the right conditions for efficient use of energy and a cost efficient Swedish supply of energy, with minimum adverse effect on health, the environment or climate, and assisting the move towards an ecologically sustainable society.‚Äù Commission on Oil Independence Housing in Angered. To make recommendations on how dependency on oil should be broken, the government created a Commission on Oil Independence (Kommissionen f√∂r att bryta oljeberoendet i Sverige till √•r 2020), headed by the then Prime Minister G√∂ran Persson, which reported in June 2006. In their report, the Commission proposed the following targets for 2020: *consumption of oil in road transport to be reduced by 40-50 per cent; *consumption of oil in industry to be cut by 25-40 per cent; *heating buildings with oil, a practice already cut by 70% since the 1973 oil crisis, should be phased out; *overall, energy should be used 20% more efficiently. Power plant in Malm√∂, 2006. Replacing oil with renewable energy sources and energy conservation measures to cut total energy use was envisioned. This is also expected to result in cuts in carbon emissions and to strengthen the country's role in sustainable development technologies as well as increasing its international economic competitiveness. Energy sources Technical solutions under consideration include the further development of domestically grown biofuels, solar cells, fuel cells, wind farms, wave energy, a major increase in district heating schemes and greater use of geothermal heat pumps. It is expected that research, development and commercialization of such technologies should be supported by government. The Commission also recommended that the government should not sanction the creation of a national natural gas infrastructure, on the belief that this would inhibit the development of biofuels and encourage the use of gas in place of oil. Energy use Gothenburg tram system, 1999. To cut energy use, the commission anticipated that by 2020 at least 75% of all new housing would use low-energy building techniques similar to the German Passive house standard, and that it will also be necessary to modernize the existing housing stock, including replacing direct electric heating systems (with systems heated by district heating, biofuels or heat pumps). They also expect there to be a greater use of teleworking, video conferencing and web conferencing, public transport, sea transport, hybrid vehicles, and smaller, lighter, biodiesel cars. As part of reducing industrial consumption, it is proposed that carbon allowances issued in Sweden under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme should be cut to 75% of their initial levels by 2020. The taxation system is also likely to be used to influence energy choices, together with education and public awareness initiatives. Progress On their release, the Commission's proposals were supported by the national automotive industry association, BIL Sweden. It was, however, opposed by the timber industry, who fear that land producing profitable exports may become used for low-income domestic biofuel production. As of 2008, 43% of the Swedish primary energy supply comes from renewable sources, which is the largest share in any European Union country. In September, 2015, the Swedish government announced its plan to drastically cut its reliance on fossil fuels by 2020. This plan also includes the goal of having the capital, Stockholm, 100% powered by renewable resources by 2050. Though the goal is to have the entire country run on renewable resources, there is no temporal goal yet.  Ban of fossil fuel- driven vehicles  In 2008, Swedish political party Centerpartiet proposed to ban gasoline fossil fuel-driven vehicles by 2025-2030.

History  The first station was a terminus opened by the Dunblane, Doune and Callander Railway on 1 July 1858. It was closed on 1 June 1870 when the second station was opened along with the first section of the Callander and Oban Railway, between Callander and Glenoglehead (originally named 'Killin'). The original terminal station of the Dunblane, Doune and Callander Railway become a goods yard. The station underwent expansion in 1882. Closure came on 1 November 1965, when the service between Callander and Dunblane ended as part of the Beeching Axe. The section between Callander and Crianlarich (lower) had been closed on 27 September that year following a landslide at Glen Ogle. The track through the station was lifted in late 1968 and some demolition work was carried out; the track to the west of the station had been lifted in early 1967. The station building itself was demolished in Spring 1973, and the station site is now a car park, though a small section of the down platform still exists. The cast iron road bridge to the east of the station was infilled in 2012. The impressive iron-work on the bridge was refurbished at the same time as the infilling. The site of the original Dunblane, Doune and Callander terminal station (latterly goods yard) is now occupied by housing.  Signalling  The enlarged layout of 1882 was controlled from two signal boxes that opened on 1 August of that year. Both boxes stood on the north side of the line. The East box had 45 levers, while the West box had 27. Both signal boxes closed on 30 October 1965.  Callander & Oban Junction  Callander & Oban Junction was situated three quarters of a mile east of Callander station. This location marked the beginning of the Callander and Oban Railway, being where it diverged from the older Dunblane, Doune and Callander Railway. Callander & Oban Junction signal box opened on 1 June 1870. The box was replaced on 2 November 1902 when the line was doubled to Callander station. The replacement box had 27 levers. On 10 April 1938, the double track line between Callander station and C&O; Junction was converted to two single lines. One line became the main single line, and the other was retained as a siding for access to the goods yard. All connections between the two lines at C&O; Junction were severed and the signal box there was closed. All the mileposts on the C&OR; were measured from Callander & Oban Junction, including the branch line to and the surviving section of the line, between Crianlarich and Oban.

His parents were Marino Caracciolo, 4th Prince of Santo Buono and his wife, Donna Giovanna Caracciolo dei Principi di Torella (both were members of the Caracciolo family by birth). Carmine Caracciolo was a descendant of an old noble family of Naples and was a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. He was exiled from Naples in 1707 when it passed to the Crown of Austria, because he was a supporter of the Bourbons. His property was confiscated. A cultured man of letters, he was ambassador in Rome and Venice (1702). He married Donna Giovanna Costanza Ruffo dei Duchi di Bagnara. He was the first Italian to be named viceroy of Peru. This occurred in 1713, although he delayed some time in traveling to America. He arrived in Cartagena de Indias on the warships of the Count of Vega Florida, where he became aware of the corruption in the politics and commerce of the viceroyalty. He brought with him orders from the Crown to end the French contraband, something that had been protected and encouraged by his immediate predecessors. He entered Lima and took up his office on October 5, 1716. In celebration of his arrival, the poet Peralta published a panegyric in his honor, as did Berm√∫dez de la Torre, \\"El sol en el zod√≠aco\\". Both are extravagant in their praise for the new viceroy. In 1717 the Viceroyalty of New Granada was created in northern Peru, from the Audiencias of Bogot√°, Quito and Panam√°. However this establishment lasted only until 1724, when the territories were returned to the Viceroyalty of Peru. (The Viceroyalty of New Grenada was reestablished on a more permanent basis in 1734.) Among the notable events of his administration were the following. He was unable to halt the contraband. During his administration missionaries made many converts in the mountains, and the College of Ocopa was founded. An epidemic affected 60,000 of the Indigenous. A royal order prohibited the branding of black slaves. Because of abuse by encomenderos of the system of mita, Caracciolo solicited its abolition. However, the king did not act on his recommendations. On August 15, 1719 the first total eclipse of the sun recorded in Lima since the Spanish conquest occurred, just before noon. It was necessary to light house lights, and the eclipse inspired processions of penitents. He served as viceroy until 1720. He died in Madrid, on July 26, 1726.

Making up about one dozen genera,See references in Haaramo (2008) they occur primarily throughout the Northern Hemisphere, both temperate and tropical, and South America. They are sizeable Megaloptera, with a body usually larger than 25 mm (1 inch). They often have long filamentous antennae, though in male fishflies they are characteristically feathered. Ocelli are present; the fourth tarsal segment is cylinder-shaped. The four large wings are translucent, smoky grey, or mixed, and the anterior pair is slightly longer than the posterior one. Acanthacorydalis asiatica The eastern dobsonfly, Corydalus cornutus, is the most well-known North American species among the dobsonflies. These genera have distinctive elongated mandibles in males and form the subfamily Corydalinae. The genera in which the males have normal mandibles, called fishflies, form the subfamily Chauliodinae. The summer fishfly, Chauliodes pectinicornis, is perhaps the best-known of these in North America; its immense mating swarms in the Upper Mississippi River region fill the air on a few summer nights each year much like mayflies in certain regions of Europe, leaving millions of carcasses to be cleaned up the next day. The larvae are aquatic, active, armed with strong sharp mandibles, and breathe by means of abdominal branchial filaments. When full sized ‚Äî which can take several years ‚Äî they leave the water and spend a quiescent pupal stage on the land, in chambers dug under stones or logs, before metamorphosis into the sexually mature insect.

Mobile, Alabama during the American Civil War was an important port city on the Gulf of Mexico for the Confederate States of America. Mobile fell to the Union Army late in the war following successful attacks on the defenses of Mobile Bay by the Union Navy. Early war years Mobile had grown substantially in the period leading up to the Civil War when the Confederates heavily fortified it. The 1860 U.S. Census reported that Mobile had 29,258 residents, making it the 27th largest city in the country. When the Confederacy was formed after the secession of eleven Southern slave-holding states, Mobile became the 4th largest city in the breakaway nation. Statistically, Mobile in 1860 was 69 percent whites, 3 percent free blacks and 28 percent slaves.U.S. Census of 1860. One observer described the city in 1861, \\"With a population of thirty thousand the city contains many pleasant residences, embowered in shade trees, and surrounded by generous grounds. It is rendered attractive by its tall pines, live oak, and Pride-of-China trees.\\"Bergeron, p. 3. Military activities As war erupted, military fervor in Mobile was high, and hundreds of able-bodied men responded to recruitment drives and signed up for service in the Confederate army. In addition, several antebellum militia companies formally volunteered their services and enrolled. The Creole Guard and the Southern Guard were among those new troops that manned Mobile's defenses, as did the Mobile Cadets (Co A of the 21st Alabama became part of the 3rd Alabama Infantry, while Co K, Mobile Cadets, remained with the 21st Alabama). The Pelham Cadets (1st Battalion Alabama Cadets) served at Mobile and in various parts of Alabama in 1864 and 1865.The War For Southern Independence in Alabama With secession and the creation of the Confederate States Navy came the need for warships. Mobile's shipmakers responded by hastily constructing a series of vessels for naval usage, among them the CSS Gaines and the CSS Morgan, both partially armored wooden ships with 2-inch armor plating over unseasoned wood.Friend, Jack, West Wind, Flood Tide: The Battle of Mobile Bay, Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 2004. Early in the war, Union naval forces established a blockade under the command of Admiral David Farragut. The Confederates countered the blockade by constructing \\"blockade runners;\\" fast, shallow- draft, low-slung ships that could either outrun or evade the blockaders, maintaining a trickle of trade in and out of Mobile. The CSS Hunley, the first submarine to sink an enemy vessel in combat, was built and tested in Mobile before being shipped to Charleston, South Carolina. Hunley was ready for a demonstration by July 1863. Supervised by Confederate Admiral Franklin Buchanan, The innovative boat successfully attacked a coal flatboat in Mobile Bay, suggesting that the relatively new concept of submarine warfare might be viable. Mobile was the site of several Civil War hospitals for wounded and ill soldiers. Mobile City Hospital treated a significant number of civilians who became sick during the war from yellow fever and other diseases. The Marine Hospital cared for Confederate soldiers, and later in the war, for Union troops as well.Historic Markers of the City of Mobile The civilian front Food and others shortages were common in Mobile as the blockade tightened and cut the city off from external sources of raw materials, cloth, and other sundries. In April 1863, a riot erupted as angry citizens demanded bread to feed their families. The outbreak was short-lived, but lingering discontent and anger simmered through the spring and summer, finally boiling over in September. More than 100 frustrated women gathered on Spring Hill Road, some carrying banners that read \\"Bread or Blood\\" on one side and \\"Bread and Peace\\" on the other. Several had brought brooms and even a few axes as weapons. They stormed up Dauphin Street, demanding satisfaction for their bread shortage. A local militia force was mobilzed with orders to stop the mob, but they refused to march out of sympathy with the women's cause. The rioters reached the office of Mayor R. H. Slough and demanded relief from the food shortage. When Slough promised to get them food, the mob broke up and the ladies returned to their homes. The fall of Mobile In August 1864, Union Navy Admiral David Farragut's warships fought their way past the two forts (Gaines and Morgan) guarding the mouth of Mobile Bay and defeated a small force of Confederate gunboats and one ironclad, the CSS Tennessee, in the Battle of Mobile Bay. It is here that Farragut is alleged to have uttered his famous \\"Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead\\" quote. The Union action did not force the surrender of the city of Mobile, but it did effectively close off the city's access to Mobile Bay and eliminate the residual traffic of the local blockade runners.NPS: Fort Morgan and Mobile Bay On April 12, 1865, three days after the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Courthouse, the city of Mobile surrendered to the Union army to avoid destruction following the Union victories at the Battle of Spanish Fort and the Battle of Fort Blakely.Thomason, p. 113. Ironically, on May 25, 1865, the city suffered loss when some three hundred people died as a result of an explosion at a federal ammunition depot on Beauregard Street. The explosion left a deep hole at the depot's location, sunk ships docked on the Mobile River, and the resulting fires destroyed the northern portion of the city.Delaney, pp. 144-46. Notable leaders from Mobile Among the more notable Civil War personalities from Mobile were Rear Admiral Raphael Semmes (an antebellum attorney in Mobile following his U.S. Navy service) and Brig. Gen. Zachariah C. Deas (a Mobile merchant and cotton broker whose brigade fought at the Battle of Chickamauga, where they routed the Union division of Philip H. Sheridan and killed Brig. Gen. William H. Lytle).NIE Mobile resident Augusta Jane Evans was a staunch states' rights activist who became a leading pro-Confederacy propagandist during the war. The novelist nursed sick and wounded Confederate soldiers at Fort Morgan on Mobile Bay. She also sowed sandbanks for the defense of the community, wrote patriotic addresses, and set up a hospital, Camp Beulah, near her residence. Augusta's propaganda masterpiece was Macaria, a novel that promoted national desire for an independent national culture and reflected Southern values as they were at that time.*Riepina, Anne Sophia, Fire and Fiction: Augusta Jane Evans in Context, 2000. Robert H. Slough served as the Mayor of Mobile throughout most of the Civil War, serving from 1862 until the war's end in 1865. His tenure was wrapped by that of former U.S. Minister to Mexico and Alabama state legislator John Forsyth, Jr., who preceded Slough in 1861 and then succeeded him in 1865.Political Graveyard Dr. Josiah C. Nott of Mobile was a leading researcher into the causes of yellow fever. During the war, he was a surgeon and staff officer in the Confederate Army, and in charge of inspecting the military hospitals in Mobile. Two of his sons died in the war while serving in Alabama regiments.Alabama Healthcare Hall of Fame See also * Alabama in the American Civil War References  Bergeron Jr., Arthur, Confederate Mobile, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1991. * Delaney, Caldwell.

Crawshaw served in the Royal Navy during the First World War before becoming a professional footballer. His nephew, Dick Duckworth, was also a footballer who played for several Football League clubs including Chesterfield, Rotherham United and York City. Crawshaw died in Manchester on 23 October 1965, at the age of 67.Dykes, p. 30 Playing career Crawshaw was a youth player with Stockport County. He joined Manchester City in 1919 and in his first season with the club he scored six goals in 21 league appearances. In the following two seasons he played just four league games, before signing for Football League Third Division North side Halifax Town in the summer of 1922. He appeared seven times for Halifax Town, but failed to get on the scoresheet. Crawshaw moved to Nelson in February 1923 for a transfer fee of ¬£100 as a replacement for the previous inside-left Mike McCulloch. He made his debut for the club on 24 February, scoring the only goal in a 1‚Äì0 win against Wigan Borough. During his first part-season with Nelson, he scored five goals in 13 matches as the side achieved promotion to the Football League Second Division.Dykes, p. 76 On the club's summer tour of Spain in 1923, Crawshaw scored the opening goal in the defeat to Racing Santander, before netting two goals in the 4‚Äì2 victory over Real Madrid. In the next campaign, he played 19 times and scored five goals but could not prevent Nelson being relegated after finishing 21st in the division.Dykes, p. 77 At the end of the 1923‚Äì24 season, he left Nelson and retired from professional football, having scored 16 goals in a total of 64 league matches.

The company of the staple may perhaps trace its ancestry back as far as 1282 or even further.G B Hotchkiss, Notes on A Treatise of Commerce by John Wheeler, New York University Press, 1931 Etymology In medieval Latin documents the common expression for staple is stabile emporium, a staple (fixed mart), where such wares had to be brought; hence the assumed derivation of staple from stabile. But the word is current in various allied meanings in the Germanic languages, as in O. Eng. stapol, stapul, a prop or post, from stapa, a step; Dutch stapel, a pile; Low Ger. stapel, a heap, a warehouse; whence also O. Fr. estaple, estape (N. Fr. √©tape), a station, a stage, generally a town or mart where certain wares were brought on sale, and hence called 'staple wares', or simply 'staples.' The original idea, therefore, appears to be, not so much a staple or fixed place, as a post or raised platform approached by steps, and arranged for a convenient sale of goods.George Cawston, A. H. Keane, Early Chartered Companies: A.D. 1296-1858. Arnold, London. 1896 History From 1314, the Crown required all wool for export to be traded at a designated market, called 'The Staple'. This allowed the Crown to monitor the trade and levy tax on exports. The staple was first fixed at Antwerp then successively moved to Saint-Omer, Bruges, Brussels, Louvain, Mechelen and Calais. In 1353 the staple was fixed at Westminster which drew so much business it was raised to the dignity of a town, in 1378 it was removed to Staple Inn, Holborn where it continued.Sholto Percy, Reuben Percy, The Percy Anecdotes, Volume XVIII, London, Boys, 1823. The staple at Calais After Calais was conquered in 1347 by the English, Calais was the staple from 1363, after that right had been assigned in turns to Bruges and Antwerp in the first half of the 14th century. A group of twenty-six traders was incorporated as the Company of the Staple at Calais. In exchange for its cooperation in the payment of taxes, the company was granted a total monopoly on wool exports from England. The company was important to the English crown, both as a source of revenue, and through its role in the defence of Calais against the French. As domestic cloth production increased, raw wool exports were less important, diminishing the power of the Merchants. In 1558, with the loss of Calais to the French, the staple was transferred to Bruges where the Merchant Staplers continued to enjoy their monopoly on exports. However, in 1614, export of raw wool was banned entirely during the Cockayne Project under the direction of William Cockayne and wool was traded only in domestic staples. The project failed however, because the States-General of the Netherlands banned the import of cloth from England. In 1617 the English lifted their ban, but the Dutch ban remained in place. The Merchant Staplers continued to exist, but only in local markets. 21st century The Company still exists, based in Yorkshire, and makes charitable contributions through bursaries and awards to charities involved in the wool business such as the Nuffield Trust, and to educational travel. Notable staplers Richard Whittington, Lord Mayor of London, was simultaneously Mayor of the Calais Staple, an office also held by William Browne (1410-1489); Sir Henry Keble, Lord Mayor of London under Henry VIII; Thomas Davenport, Mayor of Leicester, was also a Stapler, as was Henry Plankney (c. 1480-1535) from Grayingham, Lincolnshire.http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6r59v04 See also *List of Merchants of the Staple *Statute of the Staple References  External links  * The Company of Merchants of the Staple of England website Category:Defunct companies of England Category:Economy of medieval England Category:Economic history of England Category:Trading companies established in the 14th century Category:14th-century establishments in England Category:Hanseatic League Category:Staple ports Category:Trading companies of England ","title":"Merchants of the Staple"},{"id":"7112246","text":"Lateral cutaneous branch can refer to: * Lateral cutaneous nerve of forearm * Lateral cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves * lateral cutaneous branches of torso, of ventral primary ramus of thoracic spinal nerves From the 12 pairs of thoracic spinal nerves, an anterior and a posterior primary rami will supply motor and sensory innervation to the thoracic region.

The grating is actually drifting downwards and to the right at 45 degrees, but its motion is captured by the elongated axis of the aperture. The barberpole illusion is a visual illusion that reveals biases in the processing of visual motion in the human brain. This visual illusion occurs when a diagonally striped pole is rotated around its vertical axis (horizontally), it appears as though the stripes are moving in the direction of its vertical axis (downwards in the case of the animation to the right) rather than around it.  History  Figure 2: A barber's pole. The barber's pole is commonly found outside barber shops. In 1929, psychologist J.P. Guilford informally noted a paradox in the perceived motion of stripes on a rotating barber pole. The barber pole turns in place on its vertical axis, but the stripes appear to move upwards rather than turning with the pole.Guilford, J.P. (1929) \\"Illusory Movement from a Rotating Barber Pole.\\" American Journal of Psychology 41: 686‚Äì687. Guilford tentatively attributed the phenomenon to eye movements, but acknowledged the absence of data on the question. In 1935, Hans Wallach published a comprehensive series of experiments related to this topic, but since the article was in German it was not immediately known to English-speaking researchers. An English summary of the research was published in 1976Wallach, H. (1976). On perception. Quadrangle/New York Times Book Company. chap. IX.1 and a complete English translation of the 1935 paper was published in 1996.Wuerger, S., Shapley, R., & Rubin, N. (1996). \\"'On the visually perceived direction of motion' by Hans Wallach: 60 years later.\\" Perception-London, 25: 1317‚Äì1368. Wallach's analysis focused on the interaction between the terminal points of the diagonal lines and the implicit aperture created by the edges of the pole.  Explanation  Figure 3: In this example the motion of the grating is identical to that in Figure 1, but the aperture is isotropic. This illusion occurs because a bar or contour within a frame of reference provides ambiguous information about its \\"real\\" direction of movement. The actual motion of the line has many possibilities. The shape of the aperture thus tends to determine the perceived direction of motion for an otherwise identically moving contour. A vertically elongated aperture makes vertical motion dominant whereas a horizontally elongated aperture makes horizontal motion dominant. In the case of a circular or square aperture, the perceived direction of movement is usually orthogonal to the orientation of the stripes (diagonal, in this case). The perceived direction of movement relates to the termination of the line's end points within the inside border of the occluder. The vertical aperture, for instance, has longer edges at the vertical orientation, creating a larger number of terminators unambiguously moving vertically. This stronger motion signal forces us to perceive vertical motion. Functionally, this mechanism has evolved to ensure that we perceive a moving pattern as a rigid surface moving in one direction. Individual motion-sensitive neurons in the visual system have only limited information, as they see only a small portion of the visual field (a situation referred to as the \\"aperture problem\\"). In the absence of additional information the visual system prefers the slowest possible motion: i.e., motion orthogonal to the moving line.Hoffman, Donald D. 2000. Visual Intelligence: How We Create What We See. W. W. Norton. The neurons which may correspond to perceiving barber-pole-like patterns have been identified in the visual cortex of ferrets.

After previously being rejected by the band's label Lookout Records, it was finally released in January 1989 in Germany on Musical Tragedies. The first 1,000 copies of the album featured a yellow cover, while a later pressing of 500 was released with blue. Although the majority of the songs were recorded specifically for the album, Lame Gig Contest also contained tracks from previous sessions.Lame Gig Contest liner notes. Retrieved 2015-10-26 The songs \\"Rearranged\\" and \\"Another Day\\" were originally featured on the Maximumrocknroll compilation Turn It Around! in 1987, while \\"Concrete Lawns\\", \\"MSFMB\\" and \\"2nd Generation Junkies\\" were unreleased recordings from the sessions of their Sleep, What's That? EP. Having stayed out of print after its second pressing, the album was widely bootlegged by fans for several years. In 1992, a number of the tracks were featured on the posthumous Lookout compilation album Duct-Tape Soup, while most of the others were released on The Sound of a New World Being Born in 1998. The only songs from the album not to see release in the United States were \\"New Scenery\\" and \\"Concrete Lawns\\". Since the closure of Lookout in 2012, both compilations have gone out of print. Background and recording Shortly after the release of Crimpshrine's debut EP Sleep, What's That?, the group recruited friend Idon Bryant as their rhythm guitarist. Although the group was not searching for a second guitarist, Bryant had been previously considered the \\"unofficial fourth member\\" for some timeSleep, What's That? liner notes (second pressing).

The band decided to record its debut full-length in April, and set out to Dancing Dog Studios in Emeryville, California with Kevin Army. However, when the band attempted to release the album, it was rejected by Lookout Records so they scrapped the recordings and decided to release it on a cassette tape later. Despite this, one song from the session, \\"Summertime\\", was featured on the Lookout compilation The Thing That Ate Floyd later that year.The Thing That Ate Floyd liner notes. Retrieved 2015-10-26 Crimpshrine later embarked on its only United States tour in September and, due to tensions, Bryant and bassist Pete Rypins left the band abruptly after a show in Texas. Ott and Elliot then hired Paul Curran as their new bassist, and he and his brother drove out to finish the tour. After the tour ended in December, the band was approached by Florian Sch√ºck, owner of German label Musical Tragedies, who wanted permission to release a Crimpshrine album. The group accepted and gave him the rejected Lookout recordings, along with other previously-unreleased songs, and Lame Gig Contest was released on Musical Tragedies in January 1989. Lyrical themes and song origins \\"Safely Wasting Away\\", track 2, was written by Elliot about how he felt isolated from the world due to his nocturnality. According to Elliot, he slept during the day because \\"when the sun is out I can see all the ugliness in the world, but the night is quiet and calm and peaceful, and the ugliness is shadowed.\\" He further stated that when he wrote the song, he realized that his sleeping pattern had \\"taken its toll on me, I felt so far removed from the rest of the human race that I could hardly imagine what happened during the daytime.\\" However, he said that he \\"still sleep[s] during the day, but I've learned that too much alienation can be damaging to your mental health, so I try to be careful.\\" The title of track 5, \\"R.D.C.\\", came from an abandoned building on the Richmond Waterfront in Richmond, California that Elliot and a friend found. The building said \\"Richmond Distributing Company\\", but the two called it \\"Rancid Death Caf√©\\" as a joke and began hanging out there. A few months later, the building was demolished and Elliot was inspired to name the song \\"Rancid Death Caf√©.\\" According to Elliot, the song is about a number of things. He stated that the song is partially about \\"friendship in a time of desperation\\" and \\"the need to have a place to call your own\\" but also said that the beginning is about \\"love, frustration and dealing with the pain of rejection.\\" \\"I don't know what all that is doing in one song, but it seemed to tie in together at the time,\\" he said.

Geography  New York lies at the intersection of FM 804 and FM 607 in a stereotypically hilly portion of East Texas, surrounded mostly by farm land. It is 87 miles east of Dallas.  History  New York was first settled around 1856 by James C. Walker, Davis Reynolds, Jesse M. Forester, and A. M. Otts at a location south of the present site. The present site was settled in 1873. The community was reportedly named either by T. B. Herndon as a joke or by Reynolds because of his hopes for the town's future.Handbook of Texas Online, s.v. http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hrn19 (accessed September 22, 2006). By 1884 New York had two steam gristmills and cotton gins, two churches, a district school, and a population of 60, which rose to 100 by 1892. A post office operated there from 1876 to the first decade of the 1900s. The town declined after it was bypassed by the railroad in 1901. Its school was consolidated with the Poynor system in 1936. In 1986,NYTXCCC nearby Dunsavage Farms (a restaurant, antique shop, and bed and breakfast) began to market \\"New York, Texas, Cheesecake\\", which became nationally known by 1992. The company is now located in Athens, Texas.  Demographics  In 1992 the town included the Reynolds store, a Baptist church, and a population of 20.

Ghisleri was born in the comune of Persico Dosimo (in today's province of Cremona). A well known geographer by profession, he created numerous maps of Africa. As a journalist, he was part of a wave of philosophically positivist and politically progressive writers who carried the mantle of Mazzini's republican nationalism in the late 19th century. From 1887 to 1890 he founded and edited the review 'Cuore e Critica' which, together with the journals La rivista repubblicana and L'educazione politica, was important in defining the republican ideology of the times. Politically, Ghisleri was close to the revolutionary movements of his time: in 1895 he was one of the founders of the Italian Republican Party. His friend and fellow radical and Freemason Filippo Turati took over the journal in 1891 and renamed it Critica Sociale, moving it quickly into a socialist direction. In 1867, Ghisleri founded the Societ√† di Liberi Pensatori (Society of the Free Thinkers) in Cremona, on behalf of the Grand Master Giuseppe Garibaldi, together with Mauro Macchi and Ausonio Franchi.Laura Demofonti, La riforma nell'Italia del primo Novecento: gruppi e riviste di ispirazione evangelica, Rome: Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura, 2003, series Centro Alti Studi in Scienze Religiose (vol. 1), p. 27, footnote 5.

Tourism was on the increase in the area, and there were ambitious ideas that imported goods traffic at Oban would be routed to the eastern Scotland towns and cities over the line. The route was opened in stages between 1901 and 1905; raising finance was a serious difficulty, but in the end the Caledonian Railway took over. The through goods traffic never materialised and the tourist trade never provided enough income for the line to be profitable, and it closed in 1951. History Before the railway The large tract of country in the Western Highlands of Scotland was penetrated by the Callander and Oban Railway which intended to open up the area and regenerate the port of Oban. They found the cost of construction stretched their financial resources much further than they imagined, but the line was opened in stages, reaching a Killin station at Glenoglehead in 1871, and finally reaching Oban in 1880. As well as the ordinary commercial traffic of the districts served, tourism became a significant seasonal source of income, and the attractive scenery became the focus of great interest. To the east of Strathearn, Crieff had been reached much earlier by the Crieff Junction Railway, in 1856, connecting the town, which was the second most populous in Perthshire, in 1856. A second rail connection from Perth via Methven, the Crieff and Methven Junction Railway, opened in 1867. The line was extended a few miles west to Comrie when the Crieff and Comrie Railway opened in 1893. This improved the commercial activity of Comrie, and encouraged tourist exploration of Strathearn by road, using Comrie as a railhead. However the remaining gap of 15 miles (22 km) between Comrie and Lochearnhead proved an attraction to those who proposed railways, and a number of ideas that foresaw extraordinary business potential if the Callander and Oban line were connected to Crieff: transatlantic goods traffic would, it was claimed, be landed at Oban and conveyed to the eastern side of Scotland over such a line.Bernard Byrom, The Railways of Upper Strathearn, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2004, Authorisation The railways of Strathearn in 1904The proposals came to fruition when the Lochearnhead, St Fillans and Comrie Railway was authorised by Act of Parliament on 6 August 1897. The share capital was ¬£165,000. the Caledonian Railway subscribed half the money on the basis that it would later have the option of absorbing the company. The Caledonian was concerned by the possibility of the rival North British Railway building a penetrating line into the area, or even taking over the unbuilt St Fillans line, and this motivated their provision of funding. The new company was slow to take action on its new powers, and it was not until February 1899 that a prospectus, inviting investment, was issued. The prospectus emphasised the potential of through traffic from the West Highlands to Perth and other central and eastern destinations; cattle was a particularly dominant traffic to be expected. Considerable attention was given to the environmental impact of the line through high amenity landscape: a Parliamentary committee considered the matter.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15: North of Scotland, David & Charles (Publishers), Newton Abbot, 1989, Construction The work proceeded to construct the railway from Comrie to St Fillans. By 8 June 1901 it was ready for Colonel von Donop of the Board of Trade to examine the line for approval of opening. This was satisfactory and on 12 September 1901 there was a ceremonial opening of the line. However all the money the company had for construction had been exhausted. There still remained the major part of the line to be built. The Caledonian Railway had advanced a large part of the capital of the company, and independent subscriptions were minimal. The company appealed to the Caledonian to take over the construction, and while this was an unwelcome situation, the Caledonian Railway agreed to do so.David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, Meanwhile, the ordinary public train service commenced on 1 October 1901, over two weeks after the opening ceremony. There were three trains daily. Absorbed by the Caledonian The deed of agreement to sell the Company to the Caledonian Railway was executed on 7 May 1901, and it took effect (after Parliamentary approval) on 1 August 1902. During the period awaiting the final approval, a contract was let for the extension to Lochearnhead, with Caledonian money. Unfortunately the contractor died suddenly during the construction, throwing the progress of the work into confusion. At length a new contractor was found to resume the works. Finally on 15 June 1904 an inspection train was run from St Fillans to Lochearnhead, and the line opened for public passenger traffic on 1 July 1904. Goods trains started running on 18 July. Balquhidder When the Callander and Oban line had opened in 1870 there was a station named Lochearnhead. It was a considerable distance from the settlement after which it was named; in fact the line passed closer to Lochearnhead but high above it on the hillside, and remote from any public road. On the opening of the St Fillans line, a new Lochearnhead station was provided in the village, and the C&OR; station was renamed Balquhidder. At this stage there was still a gap from the new Lochearnhead to Balquhidder, and work continued in constructing that section of the line. It was announced that the final link would open on 1 May 1905, and an inaugural train from Aberdeen to Oban was planned, reflecting the continuing hope that a new east-west traffic would be generated. In fact the Board of Trade inspection was not able to be carried out until 2 May and the special passenger train could not be run.Byrom's text is confusing on this point: \\"The final stretch of line did not open until 1st May 1905, the day before the official Board of Trade inspection... There was no formal opening ceremony and, because the line had not yet been inspected, a planned inaugural excursion train from Aberdeen to Oban ... had to be re-routed via Dunblane and Callander.\\" Thomas and Turnock give 1 May 1905 (on page 315). The junction station at Balquhidder was relocated about 170 yards (155 m) west of its former location; it was provided with 800 feet (244 m) long platforms. The branch faced south here; this was considered a disadvantage in the light of the intended Oban traffic. An 1897 plan prepared for the line had shown the line from St Fillans turning north and joining the Oban line nearer Killin Junction station, but this was abandoned. World War I In common with numerous stations on the Caledonian Railway system, Lochearnhead station was closed as an economy measure between 1 January 1917 and 1 February 1919. Closure and current use The thinly populated area brought little traffic to the railway and tourist traffic declined also in the middle decades of the twentieth century. The rise of motor buses accelerated the loss of passenger business, and on 1 October 1951 the line closed between Balquhidder and Comrie. However the track remained in situ until 1959 as the line was used sporadically throughout the 1950s to transport materials to the Glen Lednock hydro-electric schemes under construction in the area. A short section of the line between Balquhidder station and Lochearnhead has been converted into part of the Rob Roy Way; a cycle path that runs between Drymen and Pitlochry, (using much of the old Callander and Oban Railway trackbed along its route). In 2001, the Kendrum viaduct was refurbished in connection with improvements to the cycle path, including the replacement of a missing steel span over the river. Most of the stations along the route have now been converted into caravan parks, with the exception of Lochearnhead station, which has been restored by Hertfordshire Scouts.Sanders & Hodgins, page 32 Topography The line was constructed with the expectation of handling heavy through traffic and the structures were designed accordingly. Some of the shorter and moderate span bridges were constructed with in-situ concrete, then popular as a building material in the remoter areas. The line climbed steadily from Comrie to St Fillans with a stiff section of 1 in 60 approaching that place. After St Fillans the route was undulating, but with equally severe ruling gradients, and the final section from Lochearnhead to Balquhidder also had a section of continuous 1 in 60 rising. The line opened from Comrie to St Fillans on 1 October 1901, and from St Fillans to Lochearnhead on 1 July 1904; finally from Lochearnhead to Balquhidder on 1 May 1905. The line closed on 1 October 1951 except for the subsequent intermittent use for the Glen Lednock catchment scheme. The stations were: * Comrie; opened by the Crieff and Comrie Railway on 1 June 1893, and closed 6 July 1964; * Dalchonzie Platform; opened 1 September 1903, later renamed Dalchonzie Halt; * St Fillans; * Lochearnhead; closed 1 January 1917; reopened 6 January 1919; * Balquhidder; station on the Callander and Oban section, originally named Lochearnhead and opened on 1 June 1870; renamed Balquhidder in 1904; relocated and extended station was opened on 1 May 1905; remained open after closure of the St Fillans line and finally closed 28 September 1965.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002  References  Notes  Sources    Railscot on the Lochearnhead, St Fillans and Comrie Railway Category:Pre-grouping British railway companies Category:Caledonian Railway Category:Closed railway lines in Scotland Category:Early Scottish railway companies Category:Railway companies established in 1897 Category:Railway lines opened in 1901 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1902 ","title":"Lochearnhead, St Fillans and Comrie Railway"},{"id":"7112461","text":"Giovanni Conti Giovanni Conti (17 November 1882 - 1 March 1957) was a deputy of the Kingdom of Italy and a senator in the Italian Republic.

History At 12:30 am (0030 UTC) on Sunday 4 March 2001, the Real IRA, a dissident Irish republican group, detonated a car bomb outside the BBC's main news centre within BBC Television Centre, on Wood Lane in the White City area of West London. Between ten and twenty pounds of high explosive had been placed in a red taxi that had been purchased on the morning of 3 March in Edmonton, north London, and abandoned yards from the main front door of BBC Television Centre at 11 pm. Police officers were attempting to carry out a controlled explosion on the bomb with a bomb-disposal robot when it went off. Staff had already been evacuated after police received a coded warning that had been given to a London hospital and charity one hour before the explosion. There were no fatalities, though one London Underground worker suffered cuts to his eye caused by glass debris. BBC cameras caught the moment of the explosion and the resulting damage‚Äîwhich included numerous smashed windows in the front entrance‚Äîwas seen as day broke. As the explosion happened just after midnight, some reports of the incident say that it happened on 3 March rather than 4 March. Conviction The bomb was part of a Real IRA bombing campaign which would also include the Ealing bombing of 3 August 2001 and an attempted bombing in Birmingham city centre on 3 November 2001. Later in November, three men‚ÄîNoel Maguire, Robert Hulme, and his brother Aiden Hulme‚Äîwere arrested in connection with all three bomb attacks. They were convicted at the Old Bailey on 8 April 2003, together with two other men‚ÄîJames McCormack, of County Louth, and John Hannan, of Newtownbutler, County Fermanagh, both of whom had already admitted the charge at an earlier hearing. The Hulme brothers were both jailed for 20 years; Maguire, who the judge said played \\"a major part in the bombing conspiracy\\", was sentenced to 22 years; McCormack, who the judge said had played the most serious part of the five, also received 22 years; and Hannan, who was 17 at the time of the incidents, was given 16 years' detention.

He was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the 1976 NFL Draft. Early life Jiggetts was born in Brooklyn, but grew up in on Long Island when his parents moved there soon after he was born. Excelling in both academics and athletics at Westhampton Beach High School, Jiggetts ranked in the top 10% of his class academically, earning a Rotary scholarship for college and was elected class president each of his four years of high school as well as earning eleven varsity letters in three different sports. He was extremely popular, noted a high school friend from Quogue, former United States Congressman Michael P. Forbes, who graduated a year earlier in 1971. Jiggetts was named a high school All-American defensive end, and also won the New York state regional championships in both the discus and shot put. Jiggetts was heavily recruited out of high school for football. He signed a national letter of intent to go to Ohio State and play for their coach Woody Hayes, but eventually changed his mind and decided to enroll in Harvard instead in order to keep a promise he made to his mother who died four days after his high school graduation. Collegiate playing career Playing offensive tackle for Harvard, Jiggetts was named All-Ivy League three times and All-East twice as well as All-American by both the AP and UPI during his senior year in 1975. Named captain of Harvard's 1975 football team, he was not only the first African American to be honored as such, but he also helped lead the team to its first undisputed Ivy League Championship. Considered to be one of the finest lineman in the history of the league, Jiggetts was named to the Ivy's Silver Anniversary All-Star Team and was inducted into the Harvard Varsity Hall of Fame. After graduating, Jiggetts was drafted in the sixth round of 1976 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears. Professional playing career Jiggetts played 98 games as a backup offensive lineman for the Bears from 1976 to 1982. Released by the team during the 1983 preseason, Jiggetts went on to play one season each for the Chicago Blitz and San Antonio Gunslingers in the USFL before retiring in 1985. During his playing career, Jiggetts was active in player-management labor relations in both the NFL and USFL. He served as a player representative for the Bears and was the vice-president of the National Football League Players Association at the time of the 1982 strike. Jiggetts was also involved in attempts to unionize USFL players as a member of the Blitz. Sportscasting career Jiggetts joined NFL on CBS as an analyst in 1985. In 1987, 1990, 1991, and 1993, he has split play-by-play partners with James Brown and Brad Nessler. He co-hosted \\"Monsters and Money in the Morning\\" with Mike North on CBS 2 Chicago from February 1 to August 27, 2010. He started working with North on their \\"Monsters of the Midday\\" radio program in 1992 as part of the launch of Chicago's WSCR sports radio station, known as \\"The Score,\\" which is now at 670-AM. They co-hosted Monsters of the Midday for eight years. The Monsters and Money show was not considered a news program by station management but was added to the lineup as an attempt to increase its advertising revenue earning potential, its experimental format of combining sports talk by Jiggetts and North with news headlines, weather and discussions of financial matters never really caught on with viewers.

Origin  Alha and Udal were children of the Dasraj, a successful commander of the army of Chandel king Parmal. They belonged to the Banaphar community, described as of mixed Ahir and Rajput background. and fought against Rajputs such as Prithvi Raj Chauhan and Mahil. Purana states that Mahil a Rajput and an enemy of Alha and Udal said that Alha has come to be of a different family (kule htnatvamagatah) because his mother is an Aryan Ahir. According to the Bhavishya Purana, a text with several interpolated sections that cannot be reliably dated, Alha's mother, Devaki, was a member of the Ahir caste. The Ahirs are among the \\"oldest pastoralists\\" and were rulers of Mahoba. The Bhavishya Purana further adds that it is not only the mothers of Alha and Udal who are Ahirs, but their paternal grandmother from Baksar are also Ahir, who entered the family with a blessing of Devi chandika that come not from wrestling buffaloes but from her nine-year vow to the nine Durgas and hence the Ahirs were natural relatives of the family. Some of this checks out with the Elliot's Alha, where the gopalaka (Ahir) King Dalvahana is called Dalpat, King of Gwalior. he is still the two girls' father, but merely gives them to Dasraj who was an Ahir and Bachraj when Parmal requested him. The Queen Malhna insists that King Parmal reward Dashraj and Bachraj with brides from within the Chandel land. King Dalpat of Gwalior volunteers his daughters Devi (Devaki, Alha's mother) and Birma Udal's mother. Queen Malhna welcomes Devi to Mahoba by placing the nine lakh chain (Naulakha Haar) around her neck and also gives Birma a necklace. King Parmal then gives new Banaphar families a village where they bear and raise their sons named Alha and Udal. Alha is one of the heroes of the Alha-Khand poem, popularly recited in the Bundelkhand region of India. It may be based on a work Mahoba Khand which has been published with the title Parmal Raso.  Folklore  Alha is an oral epic, the story is also found in a number of medieval manuscripts of the Prithviraj Raso and the Bhavishya Purana. There is also a belief that the story was originally written by Jagnik, bard of Mahoba, but no manuscript has yet been found.

It was a fort of strategic importance situated on the Satpura hill range. After the death of Sher Shah, Shuja'at Khan captured Malwa and was succeeded by his son Baz Bahadur in 1556. After ascending to the throne, Baz attacked Rani Durgavati but the attack was repulsed. In the year 1562, Akbar vanquished the Malwa ruler Baz Bahadur and conquered Malwa, made it a Mughal dominion. Consequently, the state boundary of the Rani touched the Mughal Empire. The Rani's contemporary was a Mughal General, Khwaja Abdul Majid Asaf Khan, an ambitious man who vanquished Ramchandra, the ruler of Rewa. The prosperity of Rani Durgavati's state lured him and he invaded the Rani's state after taking permission from Mughal emperor Akbar. This plan of Mughal invasion was the result of expansionism and imperialism of Akbar. When the Rani heard about the attack by Asaf Khan she decided to defend her kingdom with all her might although her Diwan Beohar Adhar Simha (Adhar Kayastha) https://byjus.com/pdf/Medieval-India-Satish- Chandra.pdf pointed out the strength of Mughal forces. The Rani maintained that it was better to die respectfully than to live a disgraceful life. To fight a defensive battle, she went to Narrai, situated between a hilly range on one side and two rivers Gaur and Narmada on the other side. It was an unequal battle with trained soldiers and modern weapons in multitude on the Mughal side and a few untrained soldiers with old weapons on the side of Rani Durgavati. Her Faujdar Arjun Das was killed in the battle and the Rani decided to lead the defence herself. As the enemy entered the valley, the soldiers of the Rani attacked them. Both sides lost some men but the Rani lost more. At this stage, the Rani reviewed her strategy with her counselors. She wanted to attack the enemy in the night to enfeeble them but her lieutenants did not accept her suggestion. By next morning Asaf Khan had summoned big guns. The Rani rode on her elephant Sarman and came for the battle. Her son Vir Narayan also took part in this battle. He forced Mughal army to move back three times but at last, he got wounded and had to retire to a safe place. In the course of battle, the Rani also got injured badly near her ear with an arrow. Another arrow pierced her neck and she lost her consciousness. On regaining consciousness she perceived that defeat was imminent. Her mahout advised her to leave the battlefield but she refused and took out her dagger and killed herself on 24 June 1564. Her martyrdom day (24 June 1564) is even today commemorated as \\"Balidan Diwas\\". Rani Durgavati preparing for the battle of Narrai; fresco by Beohar Rammanohar Sinha in Jabalpur's Shaheed-Smarak Legacy In the year 1983, the Government of Madhya Pradesh renamed the University of Jabalpur as Rani Durgavati Vishwavidyalaya in her memory. Government of India issued a postal-stamp commemorating her death, on 24 June 1988. The train between Jabalpur Junction and Jammutawi is known as Durgavati Express (11449/11450) after the name of the Queen.

Located on a paddock at the eponymous village in North Kesteven south of Lincoln it is one of the many tall brick-tower mills of Lincolnshire with stage, now disused. The mill was equipped with a complete iron gear, six Sutton patent sails which drove her four pairs of millstones, and a mill house nearby, but was never prosperous. She later lost up to four of her sails, which were not replaced. The remaining sails were juggled around for balance. Having started with 6 sails, she later ran with four, then two, and finally with three, finishing her sixty years of work around 1930. Until 1942, the mill could be viewed with its unique three sails design. In the following years the remaining sails went, and after 1961 cap and windshaft followed. The tar coating is now wearing off the tower, giving a free view of the unusual banding in her brickwork of 205 courses. Remains of the iron stage can still be found on the mill on the second floor (third floor all in all), but in a bad condition because of the damage done by sail crashes. There is no public right of access to the mill, so any remains of machinery inside the mill can't be examined.

Canada In Canada, liquor licences are issued by the legal authority of each province to allow an individual or business to manufacture or sell alcoholic beverages. Usually several types of liquor licences are available to apply for within each certain province. There are many regulations which apply to all types of liquor licences. For example, each licence must indicate the time, place and the maximum amount of sale. These licences also apply to special events, which may occur outside of the normal setting in which alcohol is served. Licence holders must strictly follow all the terms and rules to avoid suspension, fines for non-compliance or revocation. Most provinces also specify identification regulations in determining eligibility of patrons. It is also law in 2 provinces (Ontario and Quebec) that all individuals under 25 years of age must provide sufficient photo ID upon request. Alberta The Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (AGLC) licences liquor activities in Alberta, pursuant to the Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Act (formerly Gaming and Liquor Act), other provincial and federal legislation, and AGLC policies. The AGLC regulates Alberta's liquor industry, which was privatized in 1993 enabling the private sector to retail, warehouse, and distribute liquor in the province. In Alberta, five classes of general licences (and a variety of limited, special ones) are issued for the sale or other distribution, manufacture, storage, and other uses of alcoholic beverages: * Class A licences (for restaurants, lounges, etc.) * Class B licences (for recreational facilities, etc.) * Class C licences (for private clubs, canteens, etc.) * Class D licences (for retail liquor stores, hotel 'off-sales', etc.), and * Class E licences (for hard-liquor manufacturing) * Class F licences (for breweries) * Several special, limited licenses (private or public events, non-commercial competitions and tastings, industrial use and storage, and on-premises sampling at a manufacturer's site) What is now Class F (brewing of beer, wine, and cider) was originally part of Class E, originally a general alcoholic-beverage manufacturing license. British Columbia The British Columbia government regulates and monitors the liquor industry to protect the public from the harm that may be caused by making and selling liquor or products that contain liquor. The B.C. Liquor Control and Licensing Branch (LCLB) regulates liquor service in bars and restaurants, private liquor stores, liquor manufacturers and importers, Ubrews and UVins (for personal liquor manufacturing) as well as liquor service at special occasion events. The Liquor Distribution Branch is responsible for the importation and distribution of liquor in B.C. and also operates government liquor stores, it is against the law to provide liquor that has not been certified by the Liquor Distribution Branch. Inspectors will visit establishments unannounced and if the establishment fails to comply with laws and regulations, sizure of liquor, fine or suspension of licence may follow. Manitoba Established in 1923, the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission (MLCC) serves as a regulating agency of alcohol sales and distributions in Manitoba. Its licensing board provides 12 types of liquor license applications, including Dining Room License, Cocktail Lounge Licence, Spectator Activities Licence, etc. Beside basic requirements for licensed premises such as proper seating capacities, the licensing board also reviews criminal record check and security plans before issuing a liquor licence. Nova Scotia Established in 1930, and headquartered in Halifax, the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation is the sole distributor and runs all retail outlets selling alcohol except for four private wine specialty shops and, in rural areas where there is not an NSLC location, 23 private \\"agency\\" liquor stores. In the former Liquor Commission was restructured as a Crown corporation and became the Liquor Corporation. Ontario The Liquor Licensing Board of Ontario (LLBO) was the regulatory agency responsible for issuing liquor permits and regulating the sale, service and consumption of alcoholic beverages in Ontario to promote moderation and responsible use within the province. Established in 1947 under the Liquor Licence Act (Ontario), the agency is not to be mistaken with the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), an alcohol retailer. The LLBO was replaced by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario in 1998 under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation and Public Protection Act (Ontario) passed in 1996. The LLBO name lives on in many eateries and entertainment establishments which display official certification to indicate the location is legally licensed to serve alcohol. Quebec The province of Quebec has its own special laws concerning selling liquor and acquiring a liquor licence. The R√©gie des alcools, des courses et des jeux is in charge of liquor distribution and sets the laws on liquor consumption. The permits authorizing the sale or service of alcoholic beverages within the territory concerning liquor permits concluded between the Government and a Mohawk community are determined in the agreement and issued by the authority designated in the agreement. For example, in Quebec all places that are able to receive a liquor licence except grocery stores (available but until 11pm ) are able to operate every day, from 8 o‚Äôclock in the morning to 3 o‚Äôclock in the morning in selling liquor. In Quebec, strong liquors and spirits (generally over 15%-20% abv.) are restricted for sale only in SAQ outlets (provincially-owned liquor retailers) as well at bars and other establishments with the requisite permit. All other types of liquor, as well as beer, shooters and other alcohol-derivative beverages are permitted to be sold at gas stations as well as supermarkets. Saskatchewan The Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority (SLGA) is the corporation responsible for the distribution and regulation of alcohol in the province of Saskatchewan. Types of personal use permits issued in Saskatchewan include: * Sale sermit: These permits last for 12 hours and are authorized for charitable, educational, religious or community service functions. Prices for the alcoholic beverages served are set by the permit holder. * Non-sale permit: These permits are used to authorize the serving of alcohol at functions outside a private dwelling, including weddings, staff parties, or reunions. Alcoholic beverages are not allowed to be sold with this permit. * Cost-recovery permit: These permit are issued to private individuals for private functions such as weddings and reunions that are not eligible for a regular sale permit. Alcoholic beverages can be sold with this permit, but the price is limited to $2 per drink or the cost of the beverage (whichever is greater). Due to the price limit, these are often referred to as \\"toonie bars.\\" Businesses seeking authorization to serve alcoholic beverages must complete the Commercial Liquor Permit Application Types of commercial liquor licences issued in Saskatchewan include: * Tavern licence: Issued primarily for the purpose of selling alcohol in public establishments including bars, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs. * Special-use licence: Issued for restaurants that do not primarily focus on alcoholic beverages but are served on special occasions. * Manufacturer licence: Issued to authorize applicants with establishments primarily based on the manufacturing of alcoholic beverages. Germany Germany does not require any licenses for the production, wholesale, or retail sale (off-license) of alcoholic beverages. A is required when alcoholic beverages are sold for consumption on the premises (on-license). Sweden In Sweden retailers are not allowed to sell alcoholic beverages above 3.5% alcohol by volume. Only Systembolaget, the government-owned alcohol monopoly, is allowed to sell these products. Liquor licenses (Swedish: serveringstillst√•nd or utsk√§nkningstillst√•nd) for restaurants, bars, and similar premises are issued by the local municipality. There are some basic provisions in the Alcohol Act to take into account, for example: * Serving of alcohol must not be carried out before 11:00 * The premises must also serve food to serve alcohol * Serving of alcohol is not allowed to people below 18 years of age * Alcoholic beverages are not allowed to be served to a person that is visible intoxicated Most licenses allow liquor service between 11:00‚Äì01:00, but there are exceptions. Some restaurants have limited hours on weekdays but are allowed to serve longer on weekends. Many dance venues are allowed to serve until 03:00 or 05:00, often combined with the condition that the restaurant has doorman or similar control. United States In the United States, liquor licenses are issued separately by each individual state. Majority licenses are often specified by each state and localities that have laws and regulations in acquiring such a license. Otherwise, general categories that are covered under license laws include when and where liquor may be served, the amount that can be served, how much it may be served for, and to whom it may be served. Across the United States it is very common to have further specified protocols in restaurants such as limits on drinks per customer, zero discounts on drinks, and to have unfinished bottles of wine to remain in the restaurant. Furthermore, there may be several choices of license classes depending on how one intends to sell the alcoholic beverages. The most common overall types of licenses required for bars and restaurants include: *Beer-and-wine license: Depending on jurisdiction, this may be the most common or second most common type. It does not include any strong alcohols or spirits, and typically permits sales of beer, wine, cider, and malt liquor beverages up to the alcohol-by-volume range of wines. *Restaurant liquor license: Also known as the all-liquor or general license, it is the most or second-most generally used license, depending on jurisdiction. Some states, counties, and municipalities permit most or all restaurants only to have beer-and-wine licenses (see below), or may limit restaurants to such a license for a period of time (such as six months to two years). Some states (e.g., New Mexico) issue so few all-liquor licenses that newer restaurants can only obtain a beer-and-wine license unless a full license becomes available and the venue can afford the high price for which it will sell (or, technically, transfer). *Tavern (bar) liquor license: This license is commonly required for businesses with 50% or more of their sales in liquor, and this may include many restaurants that serve alcohol as well as food. Not all jurisdictions separate this license from the all-liquor restaurant license. Most US jurisdictions also divide licenses by on-premises consumption (bar and restaurant) and off- premises (bottle) sales. Certain venues can sometimes have both license types, e.g. a craft brewery that both operates as a tavern and sells bottled beer to go. It is important for wholesale liquor vendors in the United States to verify authenticity and validity of liquor licenses before selling, because insurance companies do not cover claims related to alcohol if there is no valid liquor license involved. In addition, some states have mandated \\"server permits\\" for those who serve alcoholic beverages. California The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) in California was established in 1955. California ABC has the power to issue, deny, suspend, or revoke any specific alcoholic beverage license. The department has three divisions: administration, licensing and compliance and each division has specific responsibilities. The types of retail licenses in California are: * On-sale general: licensing the sale of all types of alcoholic beverages. * Off-sale general: licensing the sale of all types of alcoholic beverages in sealed containers for consumption off the premises. * On-sale beer and wine: licensing the sale of all types of wine and malt beverages. * Off-sale beer and wine: licensing the sale of all types of wine and malt beverages in sealed containers for consumption off the premises. * On-sale beer: licensing the sale of malt beverages. Each license require a different application process. California ABC has departmental investigators with police authority, who are responsible for investigating and making arrests for violations. New York The New York State Liquor Authority (SLA) and the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) are responsible for regulating and controlling the manufacture and distribution of alcoholic beverages within New York State. Established in 1934 under New York State law, they are controlling all liquor related activities to this day. The main responsibilities of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control include reviewing and investigating applicants to determine eligibility, issuing and limiting the number and type of licenses and regulating trade of alcoholic beverages at wholesale and retail. The SLA and the ABC state that the minimum requirements for liquor license eligibility are: * The age of 21 or older * No records of conviction * Not a police officer with arresting powers Oregon In the state of Oregon, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) regulates and controls the distribution, sales, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. Texas The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC) previously known as Texas Liquor Control Board is the agency responsible for enforcing regulations and laws concerning the sales of alcoholic beverages within the state of Texas. Introduced in 1935 and headquartered in Austin, the agency has followed the basic laws of the Alcoholic Beverage Code while issuing nearly 100,000 permits and liquor licenses per year. The basic requirements to be authorized with a liquor license include citizenship, 21 years of age or older, and successful completion of specified application forms. The types of liquor licenses issued in Texas include: * BG permit: Authorizes a restaurant or bar to sell beer and wine that can be consumed on and off site. * MB permit: Authorizes a restaurant or bar to sell beer, wine, mixed drinks and other hard liquors only to be consumed on site. * Q permit: Authorizes a retailer to sell wine which may be consumed off the premises of the store. * BF permit: Similar the Q permit, the BF permit allows a retailer to sell beer instead of wine which can be consumed off premises. United Kingdom Throughout the United Kingdom, the sale of alcohol is only authorized for pubs, restaurants, shops, and other premises that are officially licensed by the local authority. The individual responsible for the premises must also hold a personal licence. Premises licences can be categorized into two different kinds: * On-licences: allowing consumption of alcohol on the premises. * Off-licences: alcohol must be removed from the vendor's premises and consumed elsewhere. New Zealand New Zealand has laws similar to those of the United Kingdom, but it further separates two other licences. Sale of Liquor Act (1989) * On-licences: allowing consumption of alcohol on the premises. * Off-licences: alcohol must be removed from the vendor's premises and drunk elsewhere, but must not be a dairy (suprette is exempt, but not advisable in a school zone) and petrol station. * Club licences: effectively an on-licence inside a club house for club members, club members with reciprocal rights (e.g. all Returned Servicemens Association clubs in the country), and guests of members that are registered by members for the day. * Special licences: for extending liquor selling hours past the normal times (3 am in a pub because of a live coverage of sport events overseas, increasingly uncommon after the Sale and Supply of Liquor Act 2012 came into effect), or for granting on- or off-licences for a site that normally does not sell alcohol for the purpose of a series of events or a one-off event (e.g., a beer festival at a convention centre, or selling holiday mulled wine in an otherwise unlicensed cafe). It is also used for exemptions from the days in which it is forbidden to sell alcohol ‚Äì e.g., Christmas Day, Easter Sunday (except for vineyards from 2004 amendment), Good Friday, and before 1pm on ANZAC Day.

The lower limit of the pyramids is marked when the fibers cross (decussate). Structure The ventral portion of the medulla oblongata contains the medullary pyramids. These two ridge-like structures travel along the length of the medulla oblongata and are bordered medially by the anterior median fissure. They each have an anterolateral sulcus along their lateral borders, where the hypoglossal nerve emerges from. Also at the side of each pyramid there is a pronounced bulge known as an olive. Fibers of the posterior column, which transmit sensory and proprioceptive information, are located behind the pyramids on the medulla oblongata. The medullary pyramids contain motor fibers that are known as the corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts. The corticospinal tracts are on the anterior surface of the pyramids. These tracts transport motor signals that originated in the precentral gyrus and travelled through the internal capsule to the medulla oblongata and pyramids. Extrapyramidal tracts are those motor tracts that do not traverse the medullary pyramids. At the pyramids' most caudal end, the corticospinal axons decussate (or cross over) the midline and continue down the spinal cord on the contralateral side. The fibers that decussated will go down the lateral corticospinal tract while the fibers that did not decussate will travel down the anterior corticospinal tract. Nearly 90 percent of the fibers decussate and travel down the lateral corticospinal tract while the other 10 percent travels down the anterior corticospinal tract. Decussation The two pyramids contain the motor fibers that pass from the brain to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. These are the corticobulbar and corticospinal fibers that make up the pyramidal tracts. About 90% of these fibers leave the pyramids in successive bundles and decussate (cross over) in the anterior median fissure of the medulla oblongata as the pyramidal decussation or motor decussation. Having crossed over at the middle line, they pass down in the posterior part of the lateral funiculus as the lateral corticospinal tract. The other 10% of the fibers stay uncrossed in the anterior corticospinal tract. The pyramidal decussation marks the border between the spinal cord and the medulla oblongata. Function The medullary pyramids contain the motor fibers of the pyramidal tracts ‚Äì the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts. Clinical significance Whiplash as a result of a car accident can lead to brainstem injuries that affect the pyramids at the medulla oblongata. These pyramid injuries are usually a result of a dislocation at the occiput or spinal level C1. Injuries to the pyramids of the medulla oblongata can also be caused by the quick hyperextension of the neck (cervical region of the spine). Hyperextension of the neck can pull and tear the pyramids, leading to a variety of symptoms such as weakness in all four limbs, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty speaking. A bilateral infarction in the pyramids of the medulla can result in motor quadriplegia. This is rare, however, as there have only been four cases of this reported.

Patients with an IGE subtype are typically otherwise normal and have no structural brain abnormalities. People also often have a family history of epilepsy and seem to have a genetically predisposed risk of seizures. IGE tends to manifest itself between early childhood and adolescence although it can be eventually diagnosed later. The genetic cause of some IGE types is known, though inheritance does not always follow a simple monogenic mechanism. Types Benign myoclonic epilepsy in infancy This form of epilepsy is very rare, representing less than 1% of cases, and is twice as prevalent in boys compared to girls. Age of seizure onset is between 5 months and 5 years of age. Children with this disorder often present with head drops and brief arm jerks. Although there is believed to be a genetic basis for this disorder, no genetic linkage has been shown. Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is an umbrella for many other syndromes that share causative genes. Patients experience febrile seizures early in childhood and grow to experience other types of seizures later in life. Known causative genes for GEFS+ are the sodium channel Œ± subunit genes SCN1A and SCN2A and the Œ≤ subunit gene SCN1B. Mutations in the GABAA receptor Œ≥ subunit GABRG1 are also causative for this disorder. Epilepsy with myoclonic absences This rare epilepsy has a wide age range of presentation (from the first year of life through the early teens). This epilepsy is characterized by absence seizures concurrent with myoclonic jerks, typically occurring several times daily. The genetics of this disorder have not been delineated. Seizures from this disorder often cease within 5 years. Epilepsy with myoclonic-astatic seizures Originally called Doose syndrome, epilepsy with myoclonic-astatic seizures accounts for ~2% of childhood epilepsies. Children with this disorder have incredibly brief (<100ms) myoclonic jerks followed by equally brief loss of muscle tone, sometimes resulting in dangerous falls. Some patients have much longer lasting seizures of this type. Many patients with this disorder also have absence seizures. This is believed to be a polygenic disorder. Childhood absence epilepsy Also known as pyknolepsy, childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) represents up to 10% of all childhood epilepsies. It first manifests in childhood between the ages of 4 and 8 as brief periods of unconsciousness (absence). Mutations in the calcium channel Œ± subunit encoding gene CACNA1H and the GABA receptor Œ≥ subunit encoding gene GABRG2 yield susceptibility for CAE. Juvenile absence epilepsy Juvenile absence epilepsy is similar to CAE but has an onset between ages 9 and 13. Other differences are that patients with this disorder have less frequent but longer absence seizures than those with CAE. There are a number of possible genetic loci for this disorder, though no causative genes have been demonstrated. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy Also known as Janz syndrome, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a common form of epilepsy, accounting for ~10% of all cases and ~25% of cases of idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Many children with CAE go on to develop JME. JME first presents between the ages of 12 and 18 with prominent myoclonic seizures. These seizures tend to occur early in the morning. Patients with JME may also have generalized tonic-clonic seizures and absence seizures. Linkage of this disorder has been shown to mutations in the genes GABRA1, CACNB4, CLCN2, GABRD2, EFHC1, and EFHC2. Epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures only This type of IGE can present at almost any age and is poorly characterized. Because of its loose definition, it is impossible to supply an accurate estimate of its prevalence. As implied by its name, patients with this disorder present only with tonic-clonic seizures.

It was the home of current North West Counties League Division One side Nelson F.C. from 1905 until 1971. During their tenure at Seedhill, Nelson were members of the English Football League between 1921 and 1931. Nelson's last game at Seedhill was a Lancashire Combination fixture on Sunday 28 March 1971 against local rivals, Clitheroe F.C. Local newspaper, the Nelson Leader, reported that a crowd of over a thousand gathered to see Clitheroe beaten by five goals to three in what was not only the last game but also the first Sunday game at the stadium. Nelson then moved to their current Victoria Park ground on Lomeshaye Holme for the start of the 1971-72 season. Seedhill football ground was demolished in 1980 to make way for the M65 motorway. The ground was situated next to the Seedhill Cricket Ground, currently the home of Lancashire League cricket team Nelson Cricket Club. Most of the land, on which the ground stood, is still undeveloped and the perimeter red brick wall is still visible on the Cricket Ground and Victoria Park sides. The land is currently used for the annual travelling fun fair which previously used the recreation ground on the opposite side of Carr Road until that was built on in the 1980s. In April 2009, the football club announced plans to return to the Seedhill site although this is yet to happen. During the 1912-13 season, a two-storey brick-built pavilion was constructed at the town end of the ground which housed the changing rooms on the ground floor with the boardroom and an office on the upper floor. The pavilion had a centre gable and a balcony overlooking the pitch. On 2 August 1913, the Burnley Express newspaper reported that, according to Nelson's annual financial statement, the cost of building the pavilion was ¬£649.19s.7d. On 7 November 1932, the pavilion came close to burning down when a fire broke out in the boardroom. No-one was in the building at the time however heat from the fire burst a water pipe which put the fire out. In 1921, with the help of volunteers, the covered terrace on the cricket field side was completed and was able to accommodate 3,000 people. In the same year, a wall was built around the park end and on the Carr Road side of the ground at a cost of ¬£3,000. The cover over the cricket field side was blown down during a severe gale on the evening of 9 January 1936. The Burnley Express newspaper reported that the main gateway to the field on the Carr Road side was also blown down and damage was done to the fence on that side of the ground. At the end of the 1922‚Äì23 Football League season, Nelson finished top of the Third Division North and were promoted to the Second Division, now known as the EFL Championship. Seedhill needed to be upgraded for the forthcoming season so, in 1923, a new wooden grandstand was built behind the existing stand on Carr Road. The new stand cost ¬£5,000 to build and was able to accommodate 2,000 people on wooden bench seating. The old stand was dismantled and sold to Barnoldswick Town F.C. leaving a standing area in front of the new stand. Seedhill now had a capacity of 20,000. Work started on the park end roof in September 1929 and was completed by November that year at a cost of ¬£690 which was raised by the supporters' club. The cover provided accommodation for 5,000 people standing on a shallow-raked earth and cinder bank. This end of the ground became known as 'The Scratting Shed.' Concrete terracing was laid on the standing area in front of the main stand in June 1952. There was a spectator bank on each corner of the town end of the ground - the one nearest Carr Road had a wooden building at the top which was called the 'Alpine Bar'. The highest attendance at the stadium was 14,143 for the Third Division (North) match between Nelson and Bradford Park Avenue on 10 April 1926. The stadium was also used for Speedway and Stock Car racing from 1967, promoted by Mike Parker Promotions. The corner of the ground between the main stand and the park end served as the pits area for both speedway and stock cars. The speedway team, Nelson Admirals, eventually moved to Odsal Stadium, Bradford in 1970, though the stock cars remained until the stadium was demolished. The site is currently undeveloped and accommodates the annual Nelson travelling fun fair. There is currently an all weather athletics track known as the Seedhill Athletics and Fitness Centre however this is on Surrey Road on the opposite side of the cricket field and has never been home to Nelson Football Club.

History The quiet community of Meadowview was called Meadow View (two separate words) until the 1930s. Native American trails passed near the later site of the town. The first settler was James Glenn, who purchased land in 1783. Different theories exist regarding the origin of community's name. Some believe the name may come from an early name of Meadow Mountain, the name for nearby Whitetop Mountain on the 1749 Peter Jefferson Map. Another explanation is that William Edmondson named his house Edmondson's Meadow and enjoyed looking at the numerous green meadows surrounding his house. Until the railroad's arrival in 1856, the town was small and remote. After the train arrived, stockyards and a transportation center were established in Meadowview to ship livestock, produce and goods to all over the eastern US. The town remained busy and active until the 1950s. The area is now mainly a residential community.

Early life Bartholomew Roe was born in 1583, in Suffolk. He was brought up a Protestant and with his brother James converted to Catholicism; both became Benedictine monks. Details of Roe‚Äôs life are scant. He was not typically monastic, but of an explosive and unpredictable temperament.Benedict‚Äôs Disciples, ed.D.H.Farmer, 1980, , p255; chapter \\"Three Seventeenth Century Martyrs\\" by Dom Geoffrey Scott of Douai Abbey. It has been said that the outstanding characteristics of his life were cheerfulness and tenacity, and that his sanctity was unquestionable.Blessed Alban Roe, Dom James Forbes of Ampleforth, 1960, p3. The disruption caused by the dissolution of the monasteries deprived Benedictine monks of a key aspect of their life: lifelong stability within a community. Large monasteries had disappeared and those houses which remained consisted of small fragmented groups or even isolated individuals. Inevitably for monks at this time, this type of community led some to focus on contemplation, becoming withdrawn mystics whilst others out of necessity were more practical and individual, and focussed on the missionary aspect.Scott, p246-247. Conversion Roe's conversion experience was unusual: he tried to convert an imprisoned Catholic to Protestantism, but found himself defeated in argument. From this time, according to Challoner, \\"Mr. Roe was very uneasy in mind upon the score of religion; nor did this uneasiness cease till by reading and confessing with Catholic Priests he was thoroughly convinced of his errors and determined to embrace the ancient faith. Having found the treasure of God‚Äôs truth himself, he was very desirous to impart the same to the souls of his neighbours.\\"Memoirs of Missionary Priests, Bishop Challoner, 1878, p129. Consequently, in 1607 he entered the English College at Douai to study for the priesthood. Roe was not only content to rub people up the wrong way, but to make sure that they noticed. When the Prior had some cupboards removed from near to his bed, Roe declared: \\"There is more trouble with a few fools than with all the wise; if you pull down, I will build up; if you destroy, I will rebuild.\\"Scott, p256. He was expelled from the college in 1610 due his temperament, records stating that \\"we consider the said Bartholomew Roe is not at all fitted for the purposes of this College on account of his contempt for the discipline and for his superiors and of his misleading certain youths living in the College and also of the great danger of his still leading others astray, and therefore we adjudge that he must be dismissed from the College.\\"Scott, p256. Roe did not leave quietly, but used his considerable skills to organise a campaign against the authorities. A significant body of monks seem to have seen him as some sort of hero and backed his appeal to the President.Forbes p5. This allowed him later in 1613 to join the English Benedictine Community of St.Lawrence at Dieulouard in Lorraine, being ordained in 1615. There is no record of him being at all troublesome at Dieulouard. He became a founder member of the new English Benedictine Community at St. Edmund, Paris, hence his religious name Fr. Alban of St. Edmund. Ministry and arrest Roe was professed in 1612 and after ordination in 1615 joined the missions and worked in London, being arrested and deported shortly after his arrival. He returned in 1618 and was imprisoned until 1623, whereby his release and re-exile was organised by the Spanish Ambassador, Gondomar. He returned two years later and was incarcerated for 17 years in the Fleet prison. Conditions in the Fleet were relaxed and he was able to minister to souls during the day provided he was back in his cell at night.Scott, p257, and Forbes p11. He was zealous for the conversion of souls and lacking a church could be found in ale houses playing cards with the customers. This was permitted under the Constitutions of the English Benedictine Congregation at the time; the stakes were not monetary, but short prayers.The English Benedictine Congregation, Dom Bernard Green of Ampleforth, , p13 Of course, this behaviour scandalised the Puritans, but as he was already a prisoner, there was little more they could do against him. He was also allowed to receive visitors in prison where in addition to strengthening his resolve through private prayer he taught visitors prayers and made many converts. Richard Challoner notes him translating \\"several pious tracts into English, some of which he caused to be published in print, others he left behind him in manuscript.\\" Challoner, p132 Name Sake in the United States St. Alban Roe Catholic School and Parish was founded in 1980 in the city of Wildwood, Missouri. It is located off of highway 109. It is a small Catholic school supported by the Archdiocese of St. Louis. Trial In 1641 he was transferred to close confinement within the strict Newgate prison. In his trial in 1642 he was found guilty of treason under the statute 27 Eliz c.2 for being a priest.Bartholomew Roe, quoted in 1919 Online Catholic Encyclopaedia, www.newadvent.org/cathen/13109d.htm Challoner details his initial refusal to enter a plea.Challoner, p132-134 It then transpired that the chief witness against him was a fallen Catholic who he had formerly helped. Thinking he could win him round again, he pleaded not guilty, but objected to being tried by \\"twelve ignorant jurymen\\", who were unconcerned about the shedding of his innocent blood. The judge was intimidated by Roe making a mockery of the proceedings, and took him aside for a private conversation. This went badly with, Roe declaring \\"My Saviour has suffered far more for me than all that; and I am willing to suffer the worst of torments for his sake.\\" The judge sent him back to prison where he was advised by who Challoner describes as \\"some grave and learned priests\\" to follow the example of those before him and consent to being tried by the court. The jury took about a minute to find him guilty. He then, in mockery, bowed low to the judge and the whole bench for granting him this great favour which he greatly desired. The judge suspended the sentence and sent him back to prison for a few days. Roe's fame led to a constant stream of visitors, one of whom smuggled in the necessary items for him to say mass in his cell. Execution On the morning of 21 January 1642, Roe together with fellow priest Thomas Reynolds was drawn on hurdles from Newgate Prison to the place of execution. At Tyburn, Roe preached in a jovial fashion to the crowd about the meaning of his death. He was still playing to the crowd, holding up the proceedings by asking the Sheriff whether he could save his life by turning Protestant. The Sheriff agreed. Roe then turned to the crowd declaring \\"see then what the crime is for which I am to die and whether religion be not my only treason?\\" His remark to one of his former gaolers was \\"My friend, I find that thou art a prophet; thou hast told me often I should be hanged.\\" He created quite an impression by his death and when his remains were quartered there was a scramble to dip handkerchiefs into his blood and pick up straws covered in his blood as relics. The speech he made is said to have been sent to Parliament and stored in their archives.Challoner, p134. Canonisation Roe was declared venerable on December 1929 by Pope Pius XI and beatified one week later on 15 December. Blessed Alban Roe was canonized nearly 40 years later on 25 October 1970 by Pope Paul VI as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales with a common feast day of 25 October. His feast day is also celebrated on 21 January, the day of his martyrdom. The communities of St. Lawrence and St. Edmund returned to England at the end of the 18th century, during the upheavals of the French revolution. St. Lawrence settled in Yorkshire at what was to become Ampleforth Abbey. St. Edmund settled at Douai Abbey, Reading.

Lodovico Guicciardini, in Descrittione di tutti i Paesi Bassi altrimenti detti Germania inferiore (1567): \\"Stapula est locus publicus quo principis auctoritate et privilegio, lame, vina, coria, frumenta, ali√¶que merces exotica vendendo causa convenunter.\\" derived from stabulum.du Cange, Glossaire, s.v. \\"stapulum: \\"a voce latina stabulum designating a system that Hadrianus Junius considered to be of Gaulish origin.Junius, Batavia, 1588:248: \\"gallic√¶ originis creditur\\". Under this system, the government or the ruler required that all overseas trade in certain goods be transacted at specific designated market towns or ports, referred to as the \\"staple ports\\". The antiquary John Weever, quoting the 16th-century Tuscan merchant Lodovico Guicciardini, defined a staple town \\"to be a place, to which by the prince's authority and privilege wool, hides of beasts, wine, corn or grain, and other exotic or foreign merchandize are transferred, carried or conveyed to be sold\\".Weever, Antient Funeral Monuments, section \\"Within the Diocese of Rochester: Deptford\\" (1767 ed. p 134) At these specified privileged places, which were invariably towns, accredited merchants, later to become organized in England as Merchants of the Staple, were required to submit their goods to inspection. In England they were obliged to pay a levy to the Crown on goods for export to the continent of Europe. The system made it easy for local and regional governments to monitor the overseas trade and to levy taxes and derive income and revenue from it. Scotland Map of Veere, known in Scotland as Campvere, the staple port for Scotland between 1541 and 1799 Joan Blaeu, 1652In the 15th century, Bruges was the Scottish staple port. As the harbour at Bruges silted up, the focus of Scots trade moved north to the Dutch ports of Middleburg and Veere, with Veere gaining staple status in 1541. There is some evidence of Dordrecht being used in 1670. England Under the Staple, the designated port was often overseas. It was at Dordrecht in 1338, and at Bruges in 1343. For a time after 1353, staple ports were established in England, under the Statute of the Staple: thus various English localities named \\"Stapleton\\" or \\"Stapleford\\". However, from 1363, Calais was designated the staple port for wool and leather exports. All wool sold overseas was taken first to Calais, then under English control. Under this system, Calais itself was called \\"the Staple\\". The trade was dominated by the Merchants of the Staple who, from 1363, had been granted the exclusive right to trade raw wool in Calais. The English system remained in place for nearly two centuries, though it would decline in importance as exports of finished cloth were substituted for exports of raw wool. With the fall of Calais to the French, in 1558, the staple moved again to Bruges. From 1617, wool exports were stopped entirely, and only domestic staples would remain in England.

The SAFER campaign was initially launched in Colorado on the campuses of the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU) and Colorado State University (CSU) in response to the alcohol overdose deaths of CSU sophomore Samantha Spady, 19, and 18-year-old CU freshman Lynn \\"Gordie\\" Bailey. SAFER, led by Mason Tvert, argued that students should not be punished more severely for using marijuana ‚Äì which is incapable of causing death by overdose‚Äîthan for using the potentially fatal (and for many college students legal) drug alcohol. The pilot project took off quickly. Within months, organizers had coordinated and passed student referendums at both campuses. These referendums called on the universities to make the penalties for the use and possession of marijuana no greater than the penalties for the use and possession of alcohol. Under Colorado state law prior to 2013, having an ounce of marijuana or less is punishable by a $100 fine but no jail time. In the summer of 2005, SAFER leaders decided to run a citywide marijuana legalization initiative in Denver, Colorado called the Alcohol-Marijuana Equalization Initiative. The proposed initiative (I-100) would have made the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana legal for individuals 21 and older under city ordinances. After a campaign in which the relative harms of marijuana and alcohol were repeatedly highlighted, the initiative passed November 1, 2005 by a 53.5% to 46.5% margin.Denver votes to legalize marijuana possession.

In December 2005, the SAFER Voter Education Fund announced that it would be supporting a statewide campaign in Colorado to make the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana legal under state law. Again, the main argument of the campaign was to be that Colorado residents should not be forced to use alcohol rather than marijuana when they want to unwind or have fun. In August 2006, the Colorado Secretary of State announced that the campaign had collected enough signatures to qualify for the November 2006 ballot. The Alcohol-Marijuana Equalization Initiative Committee is the issue committee in Colorado coordinating the initiative campaign. Across the country, new SAFER campaigns are sprouting up on college campuses and in cities and towns. In the spring of 2006, students passed \\"marijuana-and- alcohol equalization\\" referendums at numerous schools, including the University of Texas at Austin, Florida State University, and the University of Maryland. In these campus efforts, SAFER often works with campus NORML and SSDP chapters. The SAFER campaign has even gone international, with a group taking form in an appropriate venue ‚Äì Dublin, Ireland. SAFER has modeled its campaigns after People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, pulling publicity stunts such as a \\"Drug Duel\\" in which Mason Tvert challenged Mayor John Hickenlooper and beer baron Pete Coors to drink beer while he smoked cannabis, to see who would be the last man standing.

The Minster has existed for over 1300 years and is recognised for its unusual chained library (one of only a few surviving chained libraries in the world). The Minster is a former monastery and Benedictine nunnery, and King √Üthelred of Wessex is buried there. History Wimborne Abbey The Minster is dedicated to Saint Cuthburga (sister to Ine, King of Wessex and wife of Aldfrith, King of Northumbria) who founded a Benedictine abbey of nuns at the present day minster 705. Saint Walpurga was educated in the monastery, where she spent 26 years before travelling to Germany, following the missionary call of her mother's brother Saint Boniface. Leoba was also educated in this place. A monastery for men was also built around this time, adjacent to the abbey. Over the next hundred years the abbey and monastery grew in size and importance. The West Tower In 871 King Ethelred I of Wessex, elder brother of Alfred the Great, was buried in the minster. Alfred was succeeded by his son Edward the Elder in 899, and Ethelred's son, Ethelwold, rebelled and attempted to claim the throne. He seized a nun, probably of Wimborne, and made a stand there, probably because of its symbolic importance as his father's burial place, but he was unable to gain enough support to fight Edward and fled to the Vikings of Northumbria. Collegiate church The women's monastery was destroyed by the Danes in 1013 during one of their incursions into Wessex and never rebuilt, though the main abbey building survived. In 1043 Edward the Confessor founded a college of secular (non-monastic) canons, consisting of a dean, four prebends, four vicars, four deacons, and five singers at the minster. The minster was remodelled and rebuilt by the Normans between 1120 and 1180, to support that institution. The pulpit In 1318 Edward II issued a document that made the minster a Royal Peculiar which exempted it from all diocesan jurisdiction. The choir used to wear scarlet robes, a legacy of this peculiar. Similar robes of this type are worn in Westminster Abbey and St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. In 1496 Lady Margaret Beaufort, great-granddaughter of John of Gaunt and mother of Henry VII, founded a small chapel in the minster. With the reign of Henry VIII the remaining parts of the monastery were adopted into part of the minster to avoid being destroyed. However much of the wealth of the minster was confiscated by King Henry VIII. In 1562 a grant was obtained from Queen Elizabeth I by which part of the property formerly belonging to the college, together with all ecclesiastical rights and prerogatives was returned to Wimborne and vested in twelve governors. The charter was surrendered to James I and a new charter was obtained from Charles I at a cost of ¬£1,000 with the addition of an organist and singing men. During the Civil War, when Charles I was beheaded, his coat of arms was painted out from the wall of the minster, but on the restoration of Charles II the arms were speedily replaced and have now been restored. In 1846 the Royal Peculiar was abolished, and now all that remains of the old order is the control by 12 governors of some of the minster affairs. The church was renovated towards the end of the 19th century and its last addition, a vestry was added at the same time. Today the church is a place of visit and worship for the local community and visitors. Deans of Wimborne Architecture Sun dial outside the church The central tower and nave were founded in Saxon times, but the surviving building is predominantly Norman in design and construction, with Gothic components from various periods. One of its more famous architectural features include a working astronomical clock, which rings every hour and is represented in the form of a colourful quarterjack. The minster is built in a combination of Dorset limestone and New Forest stone. The central length of the minster is . The width, except the transepts, varies from in the nave to in the choir. The western tower of the minster is high. The smaller tower of the minster, above the transepts, is . The 13th-century spire which once topped this tower fell down in a storm around 1600. It is a Grade I listed building. The chained library Until it was confiscated during Henry VIII's reign, the old Treasury held the wealth of the minster and numerous artefacts such as (reputed to be) a piece of the true cross, wood from The Manger and cloth from The Shroud. Since 1686 it has housed an important chained library. The chained library was one of the first public libraries in the UK, and it remains the second- largest. Some of the collections of the library include a manuscript written on lambskin in 1343, a book bound for the Court of Henry VIII, an incunabulum printed in 1495 on the works of Saint Anselm, and a Paraphrase of Erasmus printed in 1522 with a title page designed by Holbein. The library is run by volunteers and remains open to the public on week days 10.30-12.30 & 2-4 (closed in winter season).  The bells  Since 1911 the west tower at the minster has been home to a ring of ten bells. The original tenor bell was housed in the central tower and was cast in 1385. The central tower was considered too structurally weak to add much more additional weight, so in 1464 the west tower was constructed in order to house five bells. In 1629 the tenor bell was recast. Besides the tenor, the minster at this time was home to the 'Bell of St. Cuthburga', 'The Fyfer Bell', 'The Jesus Bell' and 'The Morrow Mass Bell'; presumably all housed in the west tower. In 2012, the bells were augmented to 12 by Whitechapel Bell Foundry, with an additional semitone bell cast to make a total of 13 bells.http://www.wmscbr.org/wmscbr/TheNewBellsPage/TheNewBellsPage The organ The organ was originally built in 1664 by Robert Hayward, of Bath. There are a number of ranks of pipes, still functioning in the present instrument, which date from this time. Originally, the organ stood upon a screen which separated the nave from the choir. However, in 1856 the organist at that time (Mr. F. Blount) removed the instrument and resited it in the south choir aisle. J. W. Walker & Sons rebuilt and enlarged the organ in 1866 and carried out further work in 1899, when a new case to house the Choir Organ was provided. This was designed by Walter J. Fletcher, F.R.I.B.A. In 1965, a major rebuilding and re-designing of the instrument took place, the work again being undertaken by J. W. Walker & Sons. Perhaps the most striking feature of the present instrument is the Orchestral Trumpet, which is mounted horizontally above the front pipes. The current specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

(See also Salisbury, Wells, Exeter, and Ottery St Mary.) The clock's case was built in the Elizabethan era, but the face and dial are of a much greater age; the first documents relating to the clock concern repairs carried out in 1409. The face utilizes a pre-Copernican display, with a centrally placed earth orbited by the sun and stars. It is currently maintained by Wimborne resident Bruce Jensen. Tombs The most important tomb in the church is that of King Ethelred, the brother of Alfred the Great. Ethelred was mortally wounded in a battle at Martin, near Cranborne. The exact location of the tomb however is unknown, though sources and legend indicate that it resides somewhere near the altar. A 14th-century metal brass memorial next to the altar states that the former king is buried in the wall and is the only brass to mark the burial site of an English monarch. Two other important tombs are also in the minster: they are those of John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, and his duchess, the maternal grandparents of King Henry VII of England, constructed out of alabaster and Purbeck Marble.

It is analogous to the bottling companies Pepsi Beverages Company and Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottlers of its main competitors. History By 1998 Dr Pepper/Seven Up, a subsidiary of Cadbury Schweppes, was hindered by its bottling and distribution systems; owning no private bottling plants, it was dependent on independent bottlers or those controlled by Coca-Cola or Pepsi to bottle its beverages, and those two giant competitors also had better distribution systems and more influence with retail and fast-food chains. In February 1998 Cadbury Schweppes and U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group formed a joint venture named the American Bottling Company, initially consisting of the merger of two leading independent bottling groups in the Midwest: Beverage American and Select Beverages. In 1999 the American Bottling Company was combined with the Dr Pepper Bottling Company; the consolidated company, renamed Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group (DPSUBG), was designed to give Dr Pepper/Seven Up greater control over the distribution of its brands. Several other regional bottlers were acquired by DPSUBG between 1999 and 2006. Cadbury Schweppes fully acquired the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, the largest independent bottler in the U.S., from the Carlyle Group in 2006, and at that time the bottler was renamed the Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group.Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group official website in July 2006 (archived) The full ownership allowed the beverage company to established its own bottling and distribution network for its U.S. soft drink brands, which included Dr Pepper and Snapple. The Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group and the other beverage operations of Cadbury Schweppes were spun off in 2008 to form Dr Pepper Snapple Group, which resulted in the bottling company being renamed Dr Pepper Snapple Bottling Group. In 2008, the Dr Pepper Snapple Bottling Group merged with its own subsidiary, The American Bottling Company, and renamed itself The American Bottling Company.

Williams' writing is rooted in the American West and has been significantly influenced by the arid landscape of Utah and its Mormon culture. Her work focuses on social and environmental justice ranging from issues of ecology and the protection of public lands and wildness, to women's health, to exploring our relationship to culture and nature. She writes in the genre of creative nonfiction and the lyrical essay. Early life, education, and work Terry Tempest Williams was born in Corona, California, to Diane Dixon Tempest and John Henry Tempest, III. Her father served in the United States Air Force in Riverside, California, for two years. She grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah, within sight of Great Salt Lake. Atomic testing at the Nevada Test Site (outside Las Vegas) between 1951 and 1962 exposed Williams' family to radiation like many Utahns (especially those living in the southern part of the state), which Williams believes is the reason so many members of her family have been affected by cancer. By 1994, nine members of the Tempest family had had mastectomies, and seven had died of cancer. Some of the family members affected by cancer included Williams' own mother, grandmother, and brother. Williams met her husband Brooke Williams in 1974 while working part-time at a Salt Lake City bookstore, where he was a customer. The two married six months after their first meeting and began their life together working at the Teton Science School in Grand Teton National Park. In 1976 Williams was hired to teach science at Carden School of Salt Lake City (since renamed Carden Memorial School). She often clashed with the conservative couple that led the school over her unorthodox teaching methods and environmental politics, but she respected their gift of teaching through storytelling and prized her five years there. \\"Teaching helped me find my voice,\\" she later wrote. \\"The challenge was to impart large ecological concepts to young burgeoning minds in a language that wasn't polemical, but woven into a compelling story.\\" In 1978, Williams graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in English and a minor in biology, followed by a Master of Science degree in environmental education in 1984. After graduating from college, Williams worked as a teacher in Montezuma Creek, Utah, on the Navajo Reservation. She worked at the Utah Museum of Natural History from 1986‚Äì96, first as curator of education and later as naturalist- in-residence. Williams has testified before Congress on women's health, committed acts of civil disobedience in the years 1987‚Äì1992 in protest against nuclear testing in the Nevada Desert, and again, in March 2003 in Washington, D.C., with Code Pink, against the Iraq War. She has been a guest at the White House, has camped in the remote regions of the Utah and Alaska wildernesses and worked as \\"a barefoot artist\\" in Rwanda. Williams was featured Stephen Ives's PBS documentary series The West (1996) and in Ken Burns' PBS series The National Parks: America's Best Idea (2009). In 2003, the University of Utah awarded Williams an honorary doctorate. That year she also co-founded the University's acclaimed Environmental Humanities master's degree program, where she taught for thirteen years and was the Annie Clark Tanner Teaching Fellow. In February 2016, the University approached Williams about contract revisions days after she and her husband successfully bid on a 1,120 acre oil and gas lease to protest federal energy policies in environmentally sensitive areas of Utah. According to The Salt Lake Tribune, the Williams' \\"gesture ... angered Utah's political brokers\\". The University denied that the contract issue was related to the oil and gas lease or Williams' other activism. Nevertheless in an April 25, 2016, letter to the University's associate vice president for faculty she wrote: \\"My fear is that universities, now under increased pressure to raise money, are being led by corporate managers rather than innovative educators.\\" Williams resigned from the University of Utah in late April 2016, after six weeks of contract negotiations she described as \\"humiliating\\". Terry Tempest Williams is currently Writer-in-Residence at the Harvard Divinity School. Her courses that she is teaching include \\"Finding Beauty in a Broken World\\" and \\"Apocalyptic Grief and Radical Joy.\\" She is working with the Planetary health Alliance and the Center for the Study of World Religions in establishing The Constellation Project where the sciences and spirituality are conjoined. She has been a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College where she served as the Provostial Scholar from 2011 to 2017. She divides her time between Castle Valley, Utah, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her husband Brooke is a writer of creative nonfiction and teaches classes at Colby College. Writing career Williams published her first book, The Secret Language of Snow, in 1984. A children‚Äôs book written with Ted Major, her mentor at the Teton Science School, it received a National Science Foundation Book Award. Over the next few years, she published three other books: Pieces of White Shell: A Journey to Navajo Land (1984, illustrated by Clifford Brycelea, a Navajo artist); Between Cattails (1985, illustrated by Peter Parnall); and Coyote‚Äôs Canyon, (1989, with photographs by John Telford). In 1991, Williams' memoir, Refuge: An Unnatural History of Family and Place was published by Pantheon Books. The book interweaves memoir and natural history, explores her complicated relationship to Mormonism, and recounts her mother's diagnosis with ovarian cancer along with the concurrent flooding of the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge, a place special to Williams since childhood. The book's widely anthologized epilogue, The Clan of One-Breasted Women, explores whether the high incidence of cancer in her family might be due to their status as downwinders during the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's above-ground nuclear testing in the 1950s and 60s. Refuge received the 1991 Evans Biography Award from the Mountain West Center for Regional Studies at Utah State University. and the Mountain & Plains Booksellers' Reading the West Book Award for creative nonfiction in 1992. In 1995, when the United States Congress was debating issues related to the Utah wilderness, Williams and writer Stephen Trimble edited the collection, Testimony: Writers Speak On Behalf of Utah Wilderness, an effort by twenty American writers to sway public policy. A copy of the book was given to every member of Congress. On 18 September 1996, President Bill Clinton at the dedication of the new Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, held up this book and said, \\"This made a difference.\\" Williams' writing on ecological and social issues has appeared in The New Yorker; The New York Times; Orion magazine; and The Progressive. She has been published in numerous environmental, feminist, political, and literary anthologies. She has also collaborated in the creation of fine art books with photographers Emmet Gowin, Richard Misrach, Debra Bloomfield, Meridel Rubenstein, Rosalie Winard, and Edward Riddell. Williams was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2019. Activism Williams wrote and spoke about the impact of the BP oil spill. On 13 June 2014, Williams posted an open letter to the leadership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints expressing \\"solidarity with Kate Kelly and her plea to grant women equal standing in the rights, responsibilities and privileges of the [LDS Church], including the right to hold the Priesthood.\\" Affiliations * Governing Council of The Wilderness Society (1989‚Äì1993) * President's Council for Sustainable Development, western team member (1994‚Äì1995) * National Parks and Conservation Association, advisory board member * Round River Conservation Studies, board member * The Nature Conservancy ‚Äî Utah Chapter * Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (1985‚Äìpresent) * Thoreau Society, honorary advisor * American Academy of Arts and Letters (2019‚Äìpresent) Honors and awards * 1993 National Wildlife Federation's Conservation Award for Special Achievement * 1995 Utah Governor's Award in the Humanities * 1996 Inducted into the Rachel Carson Honor Roll * 1997 John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellow * 2004 One of the \\"Utne Reader's\\" \\"Utne 100 Visionaries\\" * 1997 Association for Mormon Letters Lifetime Achievement Award * 1999 Honorary Degree, College of the Atlantic, Bar Harbor, Maine * 2000 Honorary Degree, Chatham College, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania * 2002 Honorary Doctor of Humanities, Utah State University, Logan, Utah * 2003 Honorary Doctor of Humanities, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah * 2004 Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters, Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College * 2005 Wallace Stegner Award for the Center for the American West, 2005 * 2006 Distinguished Achievement Award from the Western American Literature Association * 2006 Robert Marshall Award from The Wilderness Society * 2008 Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters, Lesley University, Cambridge, Massachusetts * 2008 John Wesley Powell Award, The Grand Canyon Trust * 2008 Spirit of the Arctic Award, Alaska Wilderness League * 2010 Honorary Doctor of Humanities, Wooster College, Wooster, Ohio * 2011 International Peace Award, Community of Christ Church, 2011 * 2013 Robin W.

One of the historical properties includes Doris Duke's Rough Point which was built in 1891 and then added on to in 1924. Rough Point is a Newport mansion with a collection of European and Asian fine arts with works by Renoir, Thomas Gainsborough, Joshua Reynolds, and Sir Anthony Van Dyke. The property list also includes the Samuel Whitehorne House which was built in 1811, the William Vernon House built circa 1708 and added on to in 1759, and the Christopher Townsend House, built in 1728. In addition, the foundation runs Prescott Farm, an outdoor history site in Middletown, RI, as well as the Buloid-Perry House, King's Arms Tavern, and The Cotton House, which are rental properties. Recent Projects The Newport Restoration Foundation has been actively restoring and preserving historic buildings, a collection of the arts of cabinetmaking and building trades of the Newport region, and the art and artifacts from Doris Duke‚Äôs life in Newport. NRF also utilizes these collections for museum tours and educational programs that are open to the public. In regard to preservation, their most recent project (2015) was that Dayton-James House from 1757. In 2005 the Foundation assisted in conducting the first dendrochronology survey of tree rings in several early buildings in Rhode Island to determine their construction dates, including the Wilbour- Ellery House. In addition in 2013, the NRF led an effort to create a new park in Queen Anne‚Äôs Square by artist and architect Maya Lin, entitled ‚ÄúThe Meeting Room‚Äù. Preservation advocacy and environmental concerns such as climate change are other areas in which NRF works in. For example, they held the Keeping History Above Water Conference in an attempt to protect historic properties from being affected by rising sea levels. Their next initiative is the establishment of The Research Center at the Newport Restoration Foundation, a program to advance scholarship and public knowledge in historic preservation, art history, architectural history and decorative arts.

On March 15, 2005, Johnson was appointed to his state's Supreme Court by Governor Rick Perry to fill a vacancy created by the appointment of Michael H. Schneider to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas by U.S. President George W. Bush. Johnson won voter approval in 2006 to serve the remainder of Schneider's term, and was then reelected in 2008 to a full six- year term. Johnson's term on Place 8 would have run through December 31, 2020. Two days after the November 6, 2018 elections, in which numerous Republican appellate justices and trial court judges were defeated, Johnson announced his resignation effective December 31, 2018. This created a vacancy to be filled by Governor Greg Abbott, who had won reelection on November 6, 2018 along with three of Johnson's fellow members of the Supreme Court, notwithstanding the heavy Republican losses in metropolitan appellate districts, which flipped majority control of the appellate courts in Austin, Dallas, and Houston to Democrats. The Texas Supreme Court however remains solidly Republican. Governor Abbott had a rich array of highly qualified conservative appellate jurists to choose from. He appointed J. Brett Busby, who had lost his 2018 re- election bid as an incumbent on the Fourteenth Court of Appeals in Houston, to succeed Phil Johnson. Johnson won renomination in the Republican primary election held on March 4, 2014, by defeating an intraparty challenger, Sharon Sue McCally (born 1960) of Houston, the Place 2 judge of the Texas Fourteenth District Court of Appeals. Johnson polled 731,275 votes (64 percent) to McCally's 410,870 votes (36 percent). Johnson previously served as Chief Justice of the Texas Seventh District Court of Appeals, which sits in Amarillo. Johnson was elected to the Seventh COA in 1998 and became its chief in 2002. Johnson received his law degree from the Texas Tech University School of Law in Lubbock. He is a \\"distinguished alumnus\\" of Texas Tech Law School and a member of the Order of the Coif. He practiced law from 1975 until 1998 with the Lubbock firm of Crenshaw, Dupree & Milam, L.L.P. His specialization was civil trial and personal injury law. Prior to this legal career, he was served as a pilot in the United States Air Force from 1965 to 1972 and is a veteran of the Vietnam War. He received the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross twice, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, and multiple Air Medals. He and his wife, Carla, reside in Lubbock.They have five children. A lifelong Republican, Johnson carries the support of Texas Right to Life, Governor Perry, twelve former state Supreme Court justices, including former Chief Justices Tom Phillips and Wallace B.

It was produced at the Savoy Theatre from 10 August 1896 to 17 February 1897 as a companion piece to The Mikado, and from 2 March 1897 to 24 April 1897 with His Majesty, for a total of 209 performances. Copies of the libretto and the vocal score (published in 1896 by J. Williams) are found in British Library. There are five musical numbers, including three duets and a solo for each character. Background When the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership disbanded after the production of The Gondoliers in 1889, impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte filled the Savoy Theatre with a combination of new works and revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The fashion in the late Victorian era was to present long evenings in the theatre, and so producer Richard D'Oyly Carte preceded his Savoy operas with curtain raisers.Lee Bernard. \\"Swash-buckling Savoy curtain- raiser\\", Sheffield Telegraph, 1 August 2008 W. J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers: :This was a one-act play, seen only by the early comers. It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ... [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain- raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen-Pope, Walter James. Carriages at Eleven (1947), London: Robert Hale and Co., p. 23 One of the writers of Weather or No, Adrian Ross, would go on to become one of the most prolific and successful lyricists of Edwardian musical comedies. Synopsis The story concerns two figures who come in and out of a toy weather house according to whether it is wet or dry, and so they cannot meet. Nevertheless, the couple fall in love and eventually wrench themselves away from their supports so that they may be together. Cast information The original cast was: *She. Emmie Owen for the first week, then Beatrice Perry *He. Scott Russell Critical reception A review in The Musical Times of 1 September 1896 stated, :The book, by Messrs. Adrian Ross and W. Beach, is bright and smartly written, and the music, by Mr. B. Luard Selby, is graceful, refined, and by no means lacking in point and humour. The characters, impersonated with fair success by Miss Emmie Owen and Mr. Scott Russell, are the \\"He\\" and \\"She\\" of a toy weatherhouse, who emerge alternately from their respective doors in obedience to the vagaries of our fitful climate. The funny little couple fall in love, but find courtship so difficult under the circumstances that they wrench themselves away from their supports and leave the weather to take care of itself.

Forgiveness Day) is the last day of Paryushana Shwetambar sect of Jainism. It falls on Shukla Panchami each year in the Jain calendar month of Bhadrapada, somewhere between the middle of August and September in the Gregorian calendar. On this day, Jains forgive and seek forgiveness for their mistakes committed knowingly or unknowingly from all the living beings. A yearly, elaborate penitential retreat called \\"samvatsari pratikramana\\" is performed on this day. After the pratikramana, Jains seek forgiveness from all the creatures of the world, including friends and relatives by uttering the phrase ‚Äî Micchami Dukkadam or its variants like \\"Khamau Sa\\", \\"Uttam Kshama\\" or \\"Khamat Khamna\\". Etymology Samvatsari is derived Sanskrit language. Samvatsara refers to a \\"year\\" in Vedic literature such as the Rigveda and other ancient texts. Thus, Samvatsari literally refers to a day that comes annually. Customs and Traditions As a matter of ritual, they personally greet their friends and relatives Micchami Dukkadam. No private quarrel or dispute may be carried beyond Sa·πÉvatsarƒ´ and messages, telephone calls are made to the outstation friends and relatives asking their forgiveness.Hastings, James (2003), Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Part 10, Kessinger Publishing p.876 Being the holiest day of the Jain calendar, p. 212 many Jains observe a complete fast on this day.  Samvatsari and Kshamavaani  While Samvatsari and Kshamavaani are typically associated with Shwetambar sect and Digambara respectively, there is no major difference between the two days and both are observed as Forgiveness Days. Rather, the two are usually used interchangeably. However, a major difference between the two is that despite both Samvatsari and Kshamavaani falling on the last day of Paryushan, they are in fact two different days. This is because the Paryushan festival for the two sects itself commences on different dates and is of varying duration. As a result, while Samvatsari is observed on Shukla Panchami of Bhadrapada month by the Shwetambars, the Digambaras celebrate it on the first day of Ashvin Krishna month of the lunar-based Jain calendar.

It is commonly isolated from the bark of birch trees. It forms up to 30% of the dry weight of silver birch bark. It is also found in birch sap. Inonotus obliquus and red alder also contain betulin. The compound in the bark gives the tree its white color which appears to protect the tree from mid-winter overheating by the sun. As a result, birches are some of the northernmost occurring deciduous trees. It can be converted to betulinic acid (the alcohol group replaced by a carboxylic acid group), which is biologically more active than betulin itself. History Betulin was discovered in 1788 by German-Russian chemist Johann Tobias Lowitz. Chemistry Chemically, betulin is a triterpenoid of lupane structure. It has a pentacyclic ring structure, and hydroxyl groups in positions C3 and C28. Biological activities In vitro studies have shown that betulin was effective against a variety of tumors. Betulin causes some types of tumor cells to start a process of self-destruction called apoptosis, and can slow the growth of several types of tumor cells. Another study has shown that betulin inhibited the maturation of sterol regulatory element- binding protein (SREBPs). Inhibition of SREBP by betulin decreased the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. In vivo, betulin ameliorated diet-induced obesity, decreased the lipid contents in serum and tissues, and increased insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, betulin reduced the size and improved the stability of atherosclerotic plaques. Native Americans used red alder bark to treat poison oak, insect bites, and skin irritations. Blackfoot Indians used an infusion made from the bark of red alder to treat lymphatic diseases and tuberculosis.

Members of this genus are either annuals or perennials and some are popular as ornamental plants. Endemic to southern Africa, the majority of the approximately 80 species grow in South Africa, particularly the Cape Floristic Region, while a few extend into the Namib Desert. Taxonomic history The first recognised published description of Heliophila appears in the second edition of Species Plantarum by Carl Linnaeus, printed in 1763. He attributes his description, however, to Nicolaas Laurens Burman, a Dutch botanist. The generic name Heliophila is Latin but originally derived from the Ancient Greek words hƒìlios (·º•ŒªŒπŒøœÇ), meaning \\"sun\\", and ph√≠los (œÜŒØŒªŒøœÇ), meaning \\"dear\\" or \\"beloved\\", and refers to the blooms opening in sun and closing at night or in overcast conditions, a habit of many of the species within the genus. In general, contention abounds regarding phylogenetic relationships in the family Brassicaceae. In the past, using morphological characters to establish tribes and genera was misleading and created dissension among systematists. The classification of species within Brassicaceae is gradually resolving through molecular phylogeny investigation, using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) data and other new-found sequencing knowledge. Previously there were six genera within the tribe Heliophileae, all endemic to southern Africa: Heliophila, Cycloptychis, Schlechteri, Silicularia, Thlaspeocarpa, and Brachycarpaea. The latter five genera contained among them only seven species, having been differentiated from the genus Heliophila mainly on morphological differences in the fruits they bore. Following extensive analysis of molecular evidence (nuclear (ITS) and plastid (trnL-F) DNA sequence data), Heliophileae was found to be monophyletic and the five small genera were reduced to synonymy with Heliophila. Distribution Heliophila is one of only two genera of Brassicaceae endemic to southern Africa. The majority of the species grow in the winter-rainfall Cape Floristic Region and the more arid Namaqualand, while a smaller portion extend to the rest of South Africa, Namibia, Swaziland, and Lesotho. None of the members of this genus are listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Description and habit Heliophila is regarded as one of the most diverse genera in the family Brassicaceae. Flower size, for example, varies greatly, with this genus containing both the largest of petals within the family (H. juncea) to the smallest (H. pectinata). There is a range of flower colour, with blue, white, and pink being the most common. Blue is an unusual colour for Brassicaceae, being known in only one other genus, the unrelated Solms-laubachia from the Himalayas. Within the genus are mainly herbs and subshrubs, although shrubs and lianas appear as well. They may be annual or perennial and the majority of the fruits produced by species in this genus are dehiscent, not woody, and lack a carpophore. The plants are generally either glabrous or possess simple hairs. Leaves are variable; they are narrow or broad, but usually simple, and may be entire, lobed, or pinnatipartite. The inflorescences are usually the raceme type. Species Accepted species: * Heliophila acuminata (Eckl. & Zeyh.) Steud, 1840 * Heliophila adpressa O.E.

History In historical records the village was first mentioned in 1219. The Hungarian State Archives record that the village was granted by King Bela IV to his son Nata and the name became Natafalva. (Village of Nata) The Natafalusi family were the nobles who controlled the town for hundreds of years, many of them moving after the Kuruc Wars in the early 18th century. In the late 19th century, records indicate that this was a \\"toth falu\\" (Slovak village) with a majority Slovak population, but with a sizeable Hungarian minority. After Hungary was partitioned in 1920, Natafalva found itself in the newly created Czechoslovakia. Many Hungarian residents of the town left, immigrating to North America or back to what was left of Hungary.

In the second half of the twentieth century railway business declined sharply, and despite economy measures the line closed in 1964. History The Scottish Central Railway System map of the Crieff Junction RailwayThe Scottish Central Railway (SCR) was authorised by Act of Parliament on 31 July 1845. It was to build a main line from the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway near Castlecary to Perth. Early on it allied itself with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway and the Caledonian Railway, as it was dependent on one or both of them for access to Glasgow and Edinburgh. For some years Parliament refused to allow amalgamation of the SCR with either of the other lines. The authorising Act included a branch line to Crieff from \\"a location east of the summit near Greenloaning\\". This was the later Gleneagles, but at that time there was no settlement in the area, and the station at the junction was to be simply for exchange purposes. The SCR found that construction of its main line was more demanding, of time and of money, than it anticipated, and it allowed the Crieff branch to be put into abeyance. The Crieff Junction Railway is formed Crieff was the second largest town in Perthshire,John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15: North of Scotland, David & Charles (Publishers), Newton Abbot, 1989, and the branch line to Crieff had to be built. The SCR arranged for a nominally independent company, the Crieff Junction Railway (CJR) to be formed; it obtained its authorising Act of Parliament on 15 August 1853. The Scottish Central was to work the line at cost, with one-third of the feeder business brought to the SCR allowed to the Crieff Junction company. The engineer Thomas Bouch was appointed as Engineer of the line. However at this time he had many other commitments and he was unable to devote much time to the Crieff Junction line. In consequence the construction process was very slow; promised dates for opening were repeatedly missed. Staff had been engaged for the earlier opening dates, and were then stood down when it was obvious there would be nothing for them to do. As completion day neared there was a serious dispute over payments with the contractor for the line, and further delay followed from that cause.David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, Muthill station had three station masters in succession before the opening of the line.Bernard Byrom, The Railways of Upper Strathearn, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2004, Opening of the line Opening day was finally set for 13 March 1856, but the troubles were not over yet. The SCR refused to allow its locomotive to traverse the pointwork at Crieff Junction station on the grounds that it was unsafe. The matter was resolved by a modification, but the first trains did not run until the following day. The SCR considered Crieff Junction to be an interchange point only, and this led to a dispute with the CJR, as they wished to allow travellers to make round trips to the junction without alighting. This was finally agreed to by the SCR, but measures were put in place to ensure that no illicit onward travel from the junction took place. Gleneagles hotel To encourage a wealthy tourist trade, the Caledonian Railway decided to construct a luxury hotel at Gleneagles; it was to be built with an associated golf course. A subsidiary company called Gleneagles Limited was set up in 1913 to manage the construction, but the outbreak of World War I caused suspension of the project during hostilities. The hotel was opened in 1924; during the construction process the railways of Great Britain had been \\"grouped\\" under the Railways Act 1921 and the Caledonian Railway was a constituent of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS); the Gleneagles Hotel passed to the ownership of the LMS. During World War II the hotel closed and became a military hospital and subsequently rehabilitation centre for miners. It reopened as a hotel in May 1947.Gleneagles Hotel website at The hotel had a siding connection for goods transfer throughout the lifetime of the Crieff branch line. Absorption The Crieff Junction Railway was absorbed by the Scottish Central Railway on 29 June 1865. Closure There were attempts to make the line more profitable, specifically with the introduction diesel railcars in the late 1950s; two additional halts were opened on the line, at Pittenzie and Strageath. Nonetheless the line was heavily loss-making, and it was closed as part of the process of rationalisation of the railways known as the Beeching Axe; the closure took effect on 6 July 1964. The track was lifted the following year. Since closure The impressive station building at Crieff was demolished in 1965, and the site was subsequently occupied by a Health Centre and Cottage Hospital. The station buildings at Muthill were also demolished shortly after the closure of the line. The remaining station buildings along the route were altered to use as private housing. Topography The line opened on 14 March 1856, and closed on 6 July 1964. * Crieff; * Pittenzie Halt; opened 15 September 1958; * Highlandman; open from July 1856; closed 1 January 1917; reopened 1 February 1919; * Strageath Halt; opened 15 September 1958; * Muthill; * Tullibardine; open from May 1857; * Crieff Junction; trailing junction into main line towards Stirling; renamed Gleneagles on 1 April 1912; it was reconstructed in its present form in 1919; the station is still open, serving trains on the main line.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 References Sources  * Category:Pre-grouping British railway companies Category:Closed railway lines in Scotland Category:Early Scottish railway companies Category:Beeching closures in Scotland Category:Railway lines opened in 1856 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1865 ","title":"Crieff Junction Railway"},{"id":"7113517","text":"Michalovce District in the Kosice Region Zempl√≠nske Kopƒçany (; ) is a village and municipality in Michalovce District in the Kosice Region of eastern Slovakia.

Description Hedysarum occidentale is a herbaceous subalpine to alpine species of western North America. Species within genus Hedysarum may be herbaceous plants or deciduous shrubs. They have odd-pinnate leaves, with entire leaflets (no notches or indentations). These leaves resemble the leaves of sweet peas. The stipules may be free or connate, and stipels (secondary stipules) are absent. The inflorescences are peduncled racemes or heads. Bracts are small, with bracteoles below the calyx, and calyx teeth subequal. The petals may be pink, purplish, yellow, or whitish. Vexillum is longer than the wings, with an obtuse keel longer or rarely shorter than the wings. Stamens are diadelphous, 9+1, and anthers uniform. Ovary is 2-8-ovuled. Fruit is a lomentum, with segments that are glabrous, pubescent, bristly, or spiny, and break into single-seeded sections on ripening.Tropicos Uses Hedysarum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (moth and butterfly) species including Coleophora accordella. Some species, such as Hedysarum alpinum also known as Alpine sweetvetch or wild potato, were eaten by the Inuit to help ward off the effects of scurvy due to it being rich in vitamin C, containing about 21 mg/100g.Vitamin C in the Diet of Inuit Hunters From Holman, Northwest Territories Charles Darwin also called the telegraph plant a Hedysarum. In his book Into the Wild, Jon Krakauer speculated that Christopher McCandless may have died from eating seeds of H. alpinum, which Krakauer thought might contain swainsonine. This theory was later debunked by experts in the field of botany. Krakauer subsequently postulated that the seeds were stored wet in a plastic bag, which may have created a toxic by-product. Krakauer was later validated, to a certain extent. Krakauer explains that he came across the research of Ronald Hamilton, who had concluded that the neurotoxin oxalyldiaminopropionic acid (ODAP) in the wild potato seed was responsible for a degenerative disease known as lathyrism. In August 2013, Krakauer sent a modest sample of the seeds for testing, discovering that they contained \\".394 per cent beta-ODAP by weight, a concentration well within the levels known to cause lathyrism in humans.\\" Krakauer concludes that \\"Had McCandless's guidebook to edible plants warned that Hedysarum alpinum seeds contain a neurotoxin that can cause paralysis, he probably would have walked out of the wild in late August with no more difficulty than when he walked into the wild in April, and would still be alive today.\\"Jon Krakauer How Chris McCandless Died Later, a more detailed mass spectrometric analysis showed, that the poison in Hedysarum alpinum is L-canavanine instead of ODAP.

The popliteal artery may be compressed behind the knee, due to congenital deformity of the muscles or tendon insertions of the popliteal fossa. This repetitive trauma may result in stenotic artery degeneration, complete artery occlusion or even formation of an aneurysm. Classification Love and Whelan proposed a classification of this pathology into four types, according to the various relationships between the popliteal artery and the muscles of the popliteal space. Rich and Hughes described popliteal vein compression, thus adding a fifth type into the former classification. The functional type of the popliteal vessel compression was first described by Rignault et al. in 1985 and labeled by Levien as type VI of the popliteal vessels entrapment syndrome. Cause Diagnosis Differential diagnosis Exercise induced lower leg pain includes chronic exertional compartment syndrome,Bong MR, Polatsch DB, Jazrawi LM et al. Chronic exertional compartment syndrome: diagnosis and management.Bull Hosp Jt Dis. 2005;62(3-4):77-84. unresolved muscle strain (this classically occurs at the musculotendinous junction of the medial head of gastrocnemius), medial tibia stress syndrome, fibular and tibial stress fractures, fascial defects, nerve entrapment syndrome, vascular claudication (atherosclerotic or popliteal artery entrapment syndrome) and referred pain from lumbar disc herniation.Locke S. Exercise related chronic lower leg pain. Aust Fam Physician 1999; 28:569‚Äì573.  Epidemiology  In the general population, popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) has an estimated prevalence of 0.16%. It is most commonly found in young, physically active males. In fact, sixty percent of all cases of this syndrome occur in athletically active males under the age of 30. The predilection of this syndrome presents in a male to female ratio of 15:1. This discrepancy in prevalence may be partially attributed to the findings that males are generally found to be more physically active than females or because a large portion of the data accumulated for PAES is from military hospitals that treat mostly male populations. The prevalence of PAES varies through different populations; it increases in those who participate in running, soccer, football, basketball, or rugby. During embryonic development, the medial head of gastrocnemius migrates medially and superiorly. This migration can cause structural abnormalities, such as irregular positioning of the popliteal artery, and can account for the rare instances of entrapment caused by the popliteus muscle. Less than 3% of all people are born with this anatomical defect that progresses into PAES, and of those who are born with the anatomical defect, the majority never develop symptoms. Bilateral presentation of PAES is found in approximately 25% of cases. History The syndrome was first described in 1879 by Anderson Stuart, a medical student, in a 64-year-old male. Hamming and Vink in 1959 first described the management of the popliteal artery syndrome in a 12-year-old patient. The patient was treated with myotomy of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle and concomitant endarterectomy of the popliteal artery. They later reported four more cases and claimed that the incidence of this pathology in patients younger than 30 years old with claudication was 40%. Servello was the first to draw attention to diminished distal pulses observed with forced plantar- or dorsiflexion in patients suffering from this syndrome. Bouhoutsos and Daskalakis in 1981 reported 45 cases of this syndrome in a population of 20,000 Greek soldiers. During recent years the increasing frequency with which popliteal artery entrapment is reported, strongly suggests a greater awareness of the syndrome.

At age two, he won eight out of his nine starts and was voted both the Sovereign and Eclipse Awards for Champion 2-Year-Old in Canada and the United States respectively. He also received Canada's Sovereign Award for Horse of the Year. Although his three-year-old campaign was restricted by injury, Deputy Minister rebounded at age four with several major wins. Retired to stud in 1984, Deputy Minister became an outstanding sire, leading the North American sire list in 1997 and 1998. His most famous offspring were Hall of Fame fillies Go For Wand and Open Mind, Belmont Stakes winner Touch Gold and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Awesome Again. Deputy Minister was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1988. Background Deputy Minister was a dark bay horse with a small white star on his forehead. He was bred in Ontario by Centurion Farms, owned by Mort and Marjoh Levy. He was sired by Vice Regent, a full brother to Canadian Champion Viceregal. Although Viceregal was the better racehorse, Vice Regent proved to be the better sire, leading the Canadian sire list 13 times. Both horses were by leading sire Northern Dancer and out of the talented racemare Victoria Regina, who was closely related to several Canadian champions including Victoria Park and Canadiana. Deputy Minister's dam Mint Copy was claimed by the Levys for only $6,250 and went on to become a stakes- placed racehorse. She also came from a distinguished female family. Deputy Minister originally raced for the Levys, who sold a half interest to Kinghaven Farms during the colt's two-year-old campaign. Due Process Stables purchased a half interest in the colt in January 1982 for a reported $6 million, then became the horse's sole owner during 1983. Deputy Minister was trained by Bill Marko for his first six races as a two-year-old before he was moved to the barn of John J. Tammaro Jr. In 1983, Reynaldo Nobles became his new trainer. Deputy Minister stood high. He had an excellent shoulder and good hips but according to Tammaro was \\"unsound in the feet and ankles at all times.\\" Fred Seitz, the owner of Brookdale Farm where he stood as a stallion, said, \\"He was a tough, masculine horse. He was a handful, but in a good sense.\\" Racing career 1981: Two-year-old campaign At age two, Deputy Minister won eight of nine starts, including two Grade I wins in the United States. His only loss that year came in the Champagne Stakes where he finished fourth. He won his first start in a maiden special weight race at Woodbine Racetrack on May 10, 1981. He then won his next five races, all stakes races: * the Victoria Stakes on May 18 at Woodbine over a distance of 5 furlongs, setting a new track record of :57 * the Youthful Stakes on June 8 at Belmont Park over furlongs * the Clarendon Stakes on June 21 at Woodbine over furlongs * the Colin Stakes on July 11 at Woodbine over 6 furlongs * the Bull Page Stakes on August 2 at Woodbine over 6 furlongs A part interest in Deputy Minister was sold to Kinghaven Stables, for whom Tammaro was the private trainer. Marko was supposed to remain in charge of the colt with Tammaro acting as the overseer, but Marko reportedly resented the situation. After Marko did not get the necessary visas for the horse to race in the Hopeful Stakes in the United States in August, Deputy Minister was formally moved to the Tammaro's stable. Tammaro planned to enter him in the Arlington-Washington Futurity but the colt came down with a virus, causing a short layoff. He returned to racing on October 10 in the Grade I Champagne Stakes, finishing fourth. He quickly rebounded with two Grade I stakes wins: * the Laurel Futurity on October 24 at Laurel Park over furlongs, and * the Young America Stakes on November 5 at the Meadowlands over furlongs Deputy Minister was named the Canadian Horse of the Year and also received Sovereign and Eclipse Awards as the Champion Two-Year Colt in Canada and the United States respectively. On the Experimental Free Handicap, he was the co-highweight with Timely Writer at 126 pounds, the first Canadian-bred horse to achieve this honor. 1982: Three-year-old campaign Deputy Minister started 1982 as one of the early favorites for the Kentucky Derby. He made his first start of the year on January 27 in the Bahamas Stakes at Hialeah Park as the even money favorite, but finished a well beaten fifth behind the lightly regarded Aloma's Ruler, who later went on to win the Preakness Stakes. After the race, Deputy Minister was diagnosed with a severely bruised and wrenched right front ankle. Trying to stay on target for the Derby, Deputy Minister returned to racing on February 24 in a $25,000 prep race for the Flamingo Stakes but finished ninth. His jockey Don MacBeth said the colt felt sound, but Tammaro subsequently withdrew him from the Flamingo. Deputy Minister would not return to racing until October 28 when he won an allowance race at Woodbine. He finished the year with a seventh place finish in the Sports Page Handicap at Aqueduct on November 21. 1983: Four-year-old campaign In 1983 and now trained by Nobles, Deputy Minister won three straight races: * the Gulfstream Park Sprint Championship at Gulfstream Park on January 29 at a distance of 7 furlongs * the Donn Handicap at Gulfstream on February 12 at a distance of 9 furlongs, and * the Tom Fool Handicap at Belmont Park on July 7 at a distance of 7 furlongs \\"You wouldn't believe what this horse's foot looked like in February,\\" said Nobles after the Tom Fool. \\"He only had half a foot. He'd gotten it all infected with a piece of gravel, and we had to cut half his foot out. But it grew back, and he's all recovered from all his physical problems right now. He's the best he's ever been.\\" The Tom Fool proved to be Deputy Minister's last win. In his last six starts, Deputy Minister finished second twice (in the Meadowlands Cup and the Stuyvesant Handicap), third twice (in an allowance race and the Vosburgh Stakes) and was unplaced twice. In his final start in the Meadowlands Cup, he broke slowly and encountered traffic problem was still beaten by just a neck. Sportswriter Steven Crist called him \\"game and gallant in defeat.\\" Retirement Deputy Minister was retired to stand at stud at the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he sired future U.S. Hall of Famer Go for Wand. In 1989, Windfields closed down its Maryland branch after the retirement of Northern Dancer. As a result, Deputy Minister was moved to Fred Seitz's Brookdale Farm in Versailles, Kentucky, where he spent the rest of his life. A career sire of 90 Graded stakes race winners, Deputy Minister was the leading sire in North America in 1997 and 1998. Several sons went on to become successful stallions while his daughters also became successful producers, causing Deputy Minister to be the leading broodmare sire of 2007. His stud fee reached $150,000 for the years 1999 to 2002. In 1988, he was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. Deputy Minister died of a malignant tumor at the Ohio State University veterinary hospital in Columbus, Ohio, and was buried at Brookdale Farm. Selected progeny Deputy Minister was the sire of 90 stakes winners, 17 of whom were Grade I winners, including: * Go For Wand : Champion Filly at ages two (1989) and three (1990) with seven GI wins, U.S. Racing Hall of Fame (1996) *Open Mind : won seven Grade I stakes including Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly (1988) American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly (1989), Hall of Fame inductee (2011) * Awesome Again : Queen's Plate (1997), Breeders' Cup Classic (1998), Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame (2001) * Touch Gold : Belmont Stakes (1997), Haskell Invitational Handicap (1997) * Deputy Commander : Travers Stakes (1997), Super Derby (1997) * Dehere : U.S. Champion 2-Year-Old-Colt (1993) * Mane Minister : won Santa Catalina Stakes (1991), third in all three American Triple Crown races * Keeper Hill : Las Virgenes Stakes (1998), Kentucky Oaks (1998) * Yarrow Brae : won Illinois Derby, placed in Derby Trial Stakes, Jim Beam Stakes, and Golden State Mile Stakes (all in 1998) Several of Deputy Minister's sons went on to become successful sires themselves.

It introduced the villain Apocalypse to the series. Synopsis In a cabin, Warren Worthington III and a woman sit by a fireplace. The woman wonders why Warren always tries to push her away. Cable, meanwhile, sleeks in the shadows of a different room, until Warren opens the door and enters the room himself. A battle ensues, and Cable is eventually able to blast Warren off the balcony. Warren's wings tear his jacket and he flies back up to the house. The woman, noticing the commotion, enters and is confronted by Cable. He asks where Dr. Adler is, and she replies Scotland. Before he can get anymore information out of her, Warren attacks. Cable manages to use a blinding explosive and escapes, but the woman blindly shoots Warren with Cable's gun, and he flees, leaving the woman in her sorrow. Meanwhile, in Scotland, Professor X and Moira MacTaggert talk about Dr. Adler as they go to visit him. As Professor X scans Dr. Adler's mind, he gets warped visions and slips unconscious. Later, Professor X wonders if Dr. Adler is a mutant himself, which Moira states might suggest why he wants to create a cure for mutants. Professor X decides to tell the X-Men about the cure. The X-Men, rebuilding the X-Mansion after Juggernaut's destruction, bicker as Wolverine tries to help the others. Gambit and Wolverine get at each other's necks, but are stopped by Rogue and Cyclops. Jubilee comes rushing in, stating that Professor X wants to talk to them. Professor X explains the cure to the X-Men, and Rogue in particular seems interested, as she longs for the feeling of companionship that Cyclops and Jean Grey have. The other X-Men seem to think that it would be betrayal to take the cure. Later that day, Jean shares her wariness with Cyclops over Rogue. Rogue plans to go to Muir Island, but is interrupted by Gambit. She throws him out, but he catches up with her and flirts some more. He recommends a kiss before she goes, but she flies off. In a bar, Avalanche and Pyro play a game of darts, bored while waiting for their \\"friend,\\" Mystique. Rogue flies in, and Pyro flirts with her, thinking she's Mystique. She throws him against a wall, which angers Avalanche. The two fight, and she knocks him off a cliff and into the ocean. Avalanche notices a boat speeding by with Cable on it. Rogue visits Dr. Adler and tells him how she is considering the treatment. Dr. Adler sends her on her way, and Apocalypse appears. Dr. Adler reverts to Mystique and they discuss Rogue's powers. Apocalypse plans on turning her into his slave. Rogue, while sitting by the ocean, remembers how she kissed Cody and had him slip into a coma. She walks away, while Pyro searches for Avalanche but finds Cable, who is looking for Dr. Adler. He instantly attacks Cable, but Cable blasts him into the water. Avalanche picks him up and Pyro schemes over kidnapping Dr. Adler. Dr. Adler tells Rogue about the changes she will experience during the treatment, but the entire facility is destroyed by Avalanche. He rushes in and kidnaps Dr. Adler, then flees with Pyro. Cable, watching from afar, chases after them, while Rogue gets out of the rubble. Moira and Professor X rush to the scene, but are too late. Pyro and Avalanche set Dr. Adler down, who changes into Mystique. They talk about Apocalypse, and Mystique threatens them if they interfere on her plans. Rogue appears and Mystique turns back into Dr. Adler. Rogue, Avalanche, and Pyro battle, but the latter are disoriented when Avalanche destroys rocks that are hurled at them. Cable finds Dr. Adler, who was retreating. Cyclops and Jean Grey find Professor X and they plan to find Rogue. Meanwhile, Pyro and Avalanche are finally knocked out by Rogue, who goes back to searching for Dr. Adler. Cable has him at gunpoint on an edge of a cliff. They talk about the collars that were used to enslave mutants. Rogue finds them and attacks Cable. He throws a grenade at her, which takes her out. Mystique shapeshifts and tells Cable that Dr. Adler is already dead. The Blackbird flies up and drops Cyclops and Jean Grey out. They battle Cable, but Jean is knocked off the cliff. Rogue rushes to save her, but Cable escapes. Deciding not to take the cure, Rogue rebuilds Dr. Adler's machine and leaves, but crashes into Warren Worthington III. He tells her she's lucky she doesn't have to have wings to fly, and Warren goes into Dr. Adler's lab. Later, Mystique finds Apocalypse and tells him of Warren, and he replies that he is planning on destroying the world. Cast * Cedric Smith -- Professor Charles Xavier * Cathal J.

He was a prolific author of Latin religious works, one of which, Dei immortalis in corpore mortali patientis historia, was widely popular, and was translated into many languages. Life William was the younger son of the Dublin-born poet and historian Richard Stanyhurst and his second wife Helen Copley, who died during his infancy, and was born at Brussels on 15 June 1601.Alfred Poncelet, \\"Stanyhurst (Guillaume)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 23 (Brussels, 1924), 601‚Äì607. After studying at the Jesuit college in Brussels, he entered the Society of Jesus at Mechelen on 25 September 1617. His older brother Peter had joined the Jesuits a year before him, and died while serving as a chaplain to the Flemish fleet on 22 April 1627. After making his profession, William taught Latin composition and rhetoric at the Jesuit college in Kortrijk. He was ordained priest on 30 March 1630. He went on to head a sodality for students and masters of the faculties of Law and Medicine at the University of Leuven, of which Ferdinand III and Wladislaw IV became honorary members. During this period Stanyhurst gained a reputation as an eloquent preacher in English, Dutch and Latin, and as a discerning confessor. In 1654 he was transferred to Antwerp, where he taught at the Irish College while residing in the Professed House, and headed the city's Latin Sodality. During an epidemic in the city in 1657 he insisted on ministering to the afflicted, and contracted the disease himself. He was expected to die, and received the last rites, but made a recovery. In the autumn of 1662 he was sent to Brussels to recuperate his health in his native air but he died there on 10 January 1663. Works Stayhurst was a voluminous writer of religious works, many of which enjoyed a European vogue. His Dei Immortalis in corpore mortali patientis Historia, which appeared at Antwerp in 1660, was repeatedly reprinted, both in the original Latin and in French, Spanish, Flemish, Dutch, German, Polish, and Hungarian translations. His Veteris Hominis . . . quatuor novissima metamorphosis et novi genesis, dedicated to James van Baerlant, Antwerp, 1661 (Prague, 1700; Vienna, 1766), was translated into French, German, Italian, and Spanish. Others of his works, all of which passed through many editions, are: *Album Marianum, describing God's beneficence to Austria (Louvain, 1641) *Regio mortis sive Domus infelicis aeternitatis (Antwerp, 1652) *Quotidiana Christiani Militis tessera (Antwerp, 1661) - parts of this reappeared in Selectissima moralis Christianae praecepta harmonicis metris ac rythmis expressa (Antwerp, 1662) *Ecclesia Militans, Antwerp.

It opened in 1858. A line onwards to Crieff was built from a junction on the line south of Methven; that line opened in 1866. The Methven end of the line closed to passengers in 1937, but the trains to Crieff continued over the first part of the line and then the Crieff extension. The entire line closed to passengers in 1951, and completely in 1967.  History  System map of the Methven linesAs the Scottish railway network developed, the Scottish Central Railway opened its line from Castlecary, near Falkirk, to Perth in 1848. It was linked with the Caledonian Railway, giving a continuous line of railway from Carlisle, Glasgow, and London. The Scottish Midland Junction Railway (SMJR) was authorised by Parliament at the same time and opened its main line in 1848, between Perth and Forfar, connecting there with other lines to connect to Aberdeen. Towns that were not on the line of railway saw that they were at a disadvantage as the price of minerals brought in was high, and local manufacturers could not compete against connected towns' produce, because of the cost of transport to market. Local interests in Methven promoted a railway connection to the SMJR; the route would be easy, following the valley of the River Almond and a Parliamentary Bill was submitted. It obtained the Royal Assent on 29 July 1856, as the Perth, Almond Valley and Methven Railway; authorised capital was ¬£25,000 with borrowing powers of ¬£8,000. The SMJR had amalgamated with the Aberdeen Railway, forming the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER) in 1856, and the SNER inherited the obligation undertaken by the SMJR to contribute ¬£7,000 to the shareholding.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 The line opened on 1 January 1858.Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, The railway was worked by the SNER, and it was taken over by the larger company on 1 January 1864, although Parliamentary authorisation of the acquisition was not obtained until the following year. For a time Crieff was reached from Perth over the railway to Methven and then by a connecting road coach; this continued until the Crieff and Methven Junction Railway was opened in 1866, running from a junction near Methven, effectively extending the Almond Valley line. In LMS days the branch passenger service was light, and it was operated by a steam railcar produced by the Sentinel Waggon Works. The cars had a chain drive and did not have buffers. Thomas and Turnock quote a traveler's narrative of an evening journey; there was an air of self-consciousness in the unaccustomed intimacy of the saloon accommodation; > We seemed very near the ground and the small wheels made an unusual tapping > noise as they almost sank into the rail joints. The Sentinel did well enough > but we did wonder what would happen if the chain drive failed as, quivering > with energy, she made the final steep hill into Methven.John Thomas and > David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume > 15: North of Scotland, David & Charles (Publishers), Newton Abbot, 1989, The town of Methven declined considerably towards the end of the nineteenth century, and the Methven section beyond the junction for the Crieff line was eventually closed to passengers on 27 September 1937. The remaining section from Almond Valley Junction ran as a continuous route to Crieff until that too closed on 1 October 1951. Goods traffic continued to serve Methven until 25 January 1965, and the entire route closed on 11 September 1967.

One of the earliest and most significant continental jazz groups in Europe, the Quintette was described by critic Thom Jurek as \\"one of the most original bands in the history of recorded jazz.\\" Their most famous lineup featured Reinhardt, Grappelli, bassist Louis Vola, and rhythm guitarists Roger Chaput and Joseph Reinhardt (Django's brother) who filled out the ensemble's sound and added occasional percussion. History According to Grappelli, the group evolved from a series of backstage jams originated by Django Reinhardt, with Stephane Grappelli, at the Hotel Claridge in Paris, where the two were engaged as members of a band led by bassist Louis Vola. After a series of informal jam sessions at the Hotel Claridge, concert promoters Pierre Nourry and Charles Delaunay (leaders of the \\"Hot Club de France\\", a society chaired by Hugues Panassi√© devoted to the appreciation of jazz) urged the formation of a permanent group.Delaunay, p66 With the addition of Reinhardt's brother Joseph on second rhythm guitar, the quintet popularized the gypsy jazz style. The group began its recording career in September 1934, releasing two titles on the Odeon label under the name \\"Delaunay‚Äôs Jazz\\". A December 1934 session produced the first recordings released under the name \\"Django Reinhardt et le Quintette du Hot Club de France, avec St√©phane Grappelly\\" (with Django's name misspelled as \\"Djungo\\"). Throughout 1935, the group recorded both under this name and as \\"St√©phane Grappelly and His Hot Four featuring Django Rheinhardt\\". Grappelli and Reinhardt maintained active schedules as freelance musicians during the early years of the Quintette, recording and performing with French pop artists such as Jean Sablon, Le Petit Mirsha, and Nane Cholet, and with jazz artists such as Coleman Hawkins, Benny Carter, Rex Stewart, Larry Adler, Alix Combelle, and Andr√© Ekyan. Between 1934 and 1948, the Quintette du Hot Club de France recorded more than 130 titles in the studio for the Decca, Swing, HMV, Ultraphone, and Odeon labels. A series of European tours were very successful, with the group enjoying particular popularity in the UK. Several bassists and rhythm guitarists rotated in and out of the group, with Django and Grappelli remaining the sole constants. In 1937, the American jazz singer Adelaide Hall opened a nightclub in Montmartre along with her husband Bert Hicks and called it 'La Grosse Pomme.' She entertained there nightly and hired the Quintette du Hot Club de France as one of the house bands at the club. As World War II broke out in September 1939, the Quintette was on a concert tour of England. Reinhardt, who spoke virtually no English, immediately returned to France, where he thought he would feel safer than in the UK. Grappelli, meanwhile, stayed in England. Django continued using the Quintette name with a different group, featuring Hubert Rostaing as the first of several clarinetists backed by a more conventional rhythm section with drums, bass and a rhythm guitar played by Django's son Lousson Reinhardt, or his brother Joseph. This version of the Quintette often featured six, not five, players, and was usually billed as \\"Django et le Quintette du Hot Club de France\\", or sometimes as Django's \\"Nouveau Quintette\\". Due to wartime shortages of material, this version of the Quintette did not issue many recordings (some 70 titles were recorded between 1940 and 1948), although they did issue the first recording of the Django Reinhardt composition Nuages, later to become a jazz standard. In 1946, after the war, Grappelli and Django re-teamed intermittently under the Quintette banner in an all-string format, while Django continued to record and perform with his \\"Nouveau Quintette\\" and as a freelance soloist. As before the war, the Quintette cycled through a number of rhythm guitarists and bassists. This last iteration of the Quintette performed and recorded until about 1948. In early 1949, Django and Grappelli traveled to Rome to play a live engagement. While in Rome, the two made their final recordings together, a total of 70 titles, with a piano trio composed of local musicians. Legacy By the late 1940s, Grappelli's style of violin swing was out of fashion, and Django, no longer performing regularly, had become interested in playing modern jazz inspired by American bebop musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie. Django pursued modern jazz until his death in 1953, while Grappelli played and recorded mainstream swing music throughout the 1950s and 1960s when he was active on the music scene. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, a handful of European guitarists continued to play acoustic jazz guitar in the style of Django Reinhardt, largely ignored by the jazz press and with few opportunities to record or tour. Musicians such as Baro and Matelo Ferret (both of whom were sometime-members of the Quintette du Hot Club de France), Etienne Patotte Bousquet, and Tchan Tchou Vidal kept the sound of the Quintette alive, often mixing musette waltzes and traditional tunes with the American popular songs and original compositions favored by Django and Grappelli. In 1973, British guitarist Diz Disley helped persuade Grappelli to return to performing with an all-strings jazz group inspired by the Quintette du Hot Club de France, and Grappelli toured and recorded often using this format during the 1970s. Simultaneously, a revival of the Quintette's sound by a younger generation of artists was underway, with musicians like Fapy Lafertin, Rapha√´l Fa√øs, and Bir√©li Lagr√®ne helping to establish the Gypsy jazz subgenre as a popular style worldwide.

Biography Born in Edmonton, North London, Palmer first went on stage at the age of 8, and took banjo lessons from the age of 10. Around 1957 he began playing with jazz bands in Soho. He began busking with Wizz Jones in Paris in 1959‚Äì60, before moving to Edinburgh in late 1962. By now a virtuoso banjo player, he teamed up as a duo with singer and guitarist Robin Williamson in 1963, playing traditional and bluegrass songs. They became the Incredible String Band in 1965 when they decided to develop their sound and their own writing talents, and added a third member, Mike Heron. Early in 1966, he also ran \\"Clive's Incredible Folk Club\\" in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow.Adrian Whittaker (ed.), Be Glad: The Incredible String Band Compendium, 2003, After recording the first ISB album, The Incredible String Band with Williamson, Heron and producer Joe Boyd, Palmer travelled to India, where he played on national television, and Afghanistan. On his return, he decided not to rejoin the increasingly successful duo. Instead, he recorded an album of banjo music, Banjoland, which remained unreleased until 2005. He moved to Cornwall in 1968, where he worked as a woodwork teacher and became involved in trade union activities. He also formed the Famous Jug Band and played on their 1969 debut album Sunshine Possibilities, leaving before their 1970 album Chameleon. He later formed The Stockroom Five (1969) with Tim Wellard, John Bidwell and \\"Whispering\\" Mick Bennett and The Temple Creatures (1970), various line-ups including, at various times, Wellard, Bidwell, Bennett, percussionist Demelza Val Baker and singer Chrissie Quayle. He then formed another band, C.O.B. (Clive's Original Band), with John Bidwell and Mick Bennett, who released the album, Spirit of Love on CBS (1971), a single \\"Blue Morning/Bones\\" (1972) and the album Moyshe McStiff and the Tartan Lancers of the Sacred Heart both on Polydor (1972). For the Polydor records, they were augmented on percussion and vocals by Genevieve Val Baker, Demelza's sister. C.O.B. played extensively in the UK during 1972, appearing at the Lincoln Festival and the Cambridge Folk Festival and often supporting Ralph McTell. They were the support (along with Wizz Jones) for the Autumn tour by Pentangle. C.O.B. split up in early 1973, Clive keeping the name for the remaining gigs they were booked to do and forming a new version of the band with Henry Bartlett from the Famous Jug Band and guitarist Chris Newman. A solo album called Just Me followed on the German label Autogram in 1978. Palmer later moved to live in Brittany. He returned to recording music in the early 1990s, reuniting with Williamson, and then touring with Heron and (initially) Williamson in the reformed ISB towards the end of the decade. He issued a new album, All Roads Lead To Land in 2004. In 2007, he moved back to Cornwall, teaming up with former \\"Stockroom 5\\" and \\"Temple Creatures\\" member Tim Wellard to produce a new album, The Land of No Return, released on the Spanish label Quadrant Records in 2008. A biography by Grahame Hood, \\"Empty Pocket Blues- the life and music of Clive Palmer\\", was published by Helter Skelter Publishing in May 2008. Made up of Cornish musicians, including Tim Wellard and John Bickersteth, he formed The Clive Palmer Band, who toured between 2008 and 2011 and produced another two albums, Along The Enchanted Way and Live at the Acorn in 2011. Clive Palmer's death on 23 November 2014 in Penzance, after a long illness, was announced by fellow folk musician, Wizz Jones, who referred to him as \\"one of the finest musicians I have ever known... an inspiration and a well loved friend.\\" Discography * 1966: The Incredible String Band (Incredible Folk Club) * 1967: Banjoland (released in 2005) * 1969: Sunshine Possibilities (Famous Jug Band) * 1971: Spirit of Love (Clive's Original Band) * 1972: Moyshe McStiff and the Tartan Lancers of the Sacred Heart (Clive's Original Band) * 1978: Just Me ‚Äì Autogram * 1989: The Archive Tapes * 1993: Charlie Cool Goes West * 1993: House of Images (cassette-only compilation) * 1999: Suns & Moons ‚Äì Pig's Whisker * 1999: At the Pure Fountain (with Robin Williamson) * 2004: All Roads Lead To Land * 2004: Sands of Time ‚Äì Unique Gravity * 2008: The Land of No Return ‚Äì Quadrant Records * 2011: Along The Enchanted Way (The Clive Palmer Band) * 2011: Live at the Acorn (The Clive Palmer Band) References External links * Biography by Craig Harris on allmusic.com * Interview with Clive Palmer on terrascope.co.uk * Interview with his biograph Category:1943 births Category:2014 deaths Category:English pop musicians Category:English banjoists Category:People from Edmonton, London Category:The Incredible String Band members ","title":"Clive Palmer (musician)"},{"id":"7113944","text":"Augmented cognition is an interdisciplinary area of psychology and engineering, attracting researchers from the more traditional fields of human- computer interaction, psychology, ergonomics and neuroscience.

Engelbart released the report \\"Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework\\" which introduced, and laid the groundwork for, augmented cognition. In this paper, Engelbart defines \\"augmenting human intellect\\" as \\"increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems.\\" Modern augmented cognition began to emerge in the early 2000s. Advances in cognitive, behavioral, and neurological sciences during the 1990s set the stage for the emerging field of augmented cognition ‚Äì this period has been termed the \\"Decade of the Brain.\\" Major advancements in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) have been pivotal in the emergence of augmented cognition technologies which seek to monitor the user's cognitive abilities. As these tools were primarily used in controlled environments, their further development was essential to pragmatic augmented cognition applications.  Research   DARPA's Augmented Cognition Program  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has been one of the primary funding agencies for augmented cognition investigators. A major focus of DARPA's augmented cognition program (AugCog) has been developing more robust tools for monitoring cognitive state and integrating them with computer systems. The program envisions \\"order of magnitude increases in available, net thinking power resulting from linked human-machine dyads [that] will provide such clear informational superiority that few rational individuals or organizations would challenge under the consequences of mortality.\\" The program began in 2001, and has since be renamed to Improving Warfighter Information Intake Under Stress Program.National Research Council (US) Committee on Opportunities in Neuroscience for Future Army Applications. Opportunities in Neuroscience for Future Army Applications. Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2009. Appendix D, Research on Managing Information Overload in Soldiers Under Stress. Available from:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207983/ By leveraging such tools, the program seeks to provide warfighters with enhanced cognitive abilities, especially under complex or stressful war conditions. As of 2002, the program vision is divided into four phases: * Phase 1: Real-time cognitive state detection * Phase 2: Real-time cognitive state manipulation * Phase 3: Autonomous cognitive state manipulation * Phase 4: Operation demonstration and transition Proof of concept was carried out in two phases: near real time monitoring of the user's cognitive activity, and subsequent manipulation of the user's cognitive state.  Augmented Cognition International (ACI) Society  The Augmented Cognition International (ACI) Society held its first conference in July 2005. At the society's first conference, attendees from a diverse background including academia, government, and industry came together to create an agenda for future research. The agenda focused on near-, medium-, and long-term research and development goals in key augmented cognition science and technology areas. The International Conference on Human Computer Interaction, where the society first established itself, continues to host the society's activities.  Translation engines  Thad Starner, and the American Sign Language (ASL) Research Group at Georgia Tech, have been researching systems for the recognition of ASL. Telesign, a one-way translation system from ASL to English, was shown to have a 94% accuracy rate on a vocabulary with 141 signs.  Controversy   Privacy concerns  The increasing sophistication of brain-reading technologies has led many to investigate their potential applications for lie detection. Legally required brain scans arguably violate ‚Äúthe guarantee against self-incrimination‚Äù because they differ from acceptable forms of bodily evidence, such as fingerprints or blood samples, in an important way: they are not simply physical, hard evidence, but evidence that is intimately linked to the defendant's mind. Under US law, brain-scanning technologies might also raise implications for the Fourth Amendment, calling into question whether they constitute an unreasonable search and seizure.  Human augmentation  Many of the same arguments in the debate around human enhancement can be analogized to augmented cognition. Economic inequality, for instance, may serve to exacerbate societal advantages and disadvantages due to the limited availability of such technologies. Fearing the potential applications of devices like Google Glass, certain gambling establishments (such as Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas) banned its use even before it was commercially available.

As a purely local concern, the line was dependent on local traffic, and when that declined in the middle of the twentieth century, the railway became unsustainable. It closed to passengers in 1951 and completely in 1967. History System map of the Methven linesThe company received parliamentary authorisation to build the line on 14 July 1864, with the line being completed in 1867. Perth was linked to the growing Scottish railway network when the Scottish Central Railway opened its main line from Castlecary, near Falkirk, in 1848. The Scottish Central was allied with the Caledonian Railway, connecting with Glasgow and Carlisle, and the Scottish Midland Junction Railway built northwards from Perth, also opening in 1848, giving connection to Forfar and over other lines to Aberdeen.Peter Marshall, The Scottish Central Railway: Perth to Stirling, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1998, Places served by these main lines experienced an economic benefit: the prices of commodities such as lime and coal brought in fell considerably, and the cost of delivering their manufactured goods and agricultural products to market also reduced. By contrast, towns not yet connected experienced a worsening in their position, and business interests in Methven proposed a railway to their town, and the Perth, Almond Valley and Methven Railway opened from a junction north of Perth to Methven on 1 January 1858. The important town of Crieff also suffered from the lack of a railway connection, and in 1856 the Crieff Junction Railway opened, from a location then called Crieff Junction, on the main line between Stirling and Perth: it is now known as Gleneagles station. This more southerly connection was convenient for transits towards Glasgow and Edinburgh, but Perth was a major commercial and agricultural centre at this period, and passengers from Crieff to Perth preferred to travel by road coach to Methven, continuing their journey over the Almond Valley line.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15: North of Scotland, David & Charles (Publishers), Newton Abbot, 1989, A railway link was suggested and on 14 July 1864 the Crieff and Methven Junction Railway obtained Parliamentary authorisation. The company's capital was ¬£66,000.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 The line opened on 21 May 1866, from a junction with the Methven line a mile south of the Methven terminus.Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, The line ran broadly west, following the Pow Water, entering the eastern margin of Crieff alongside the Crieff Junction line, and using that company's station facilities. The Crieff Junction line was absorbed by the Scottish Central Railway in 1865, and the Crieff and Methven Junction Railway was worked by the Scottish Central Railway until absorption by the Caledonian Railway in 1868. In the latter half of the century tourism developed considerably and Strathearn became a destination of great importance. Road tours were arranged from Crieff, and in 1893 the Crieff and Comrie Railway built westward from Crieff; this involved a new and more commodious station at Crieff. The Comrie line was extended still further, eventually reaching Lochearnhead and Balquhidder on the route of the Callander and Oban Railway. The importance of the town of Methven was considerably reduced in the later years of the nineteenth century, and the decline continued in the twentieth; the section from Methven Junction to Methven terminus closed to passengers on 27 September 1937. The remaining line was continuous from Crieff to Perth (Almond Valley Junction) and was operated by the Caledonian Railway as a single route. However carryings on the line declined as well, and on 1 October 1951 passenger traffic on the line ceased. Goods traffic continued until that too was discontinued on 11 September 1967.Bernard Byrom, The Railways of Upper Strathearn, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2004, Topography Passenger stations on the line were: * Methven Junction (station); it was an unadvertised exchange station from 1889 until closure of the Methven section in 1937; * Balgowan; * Madderty; * Abercairny; certain early publications spelt the station Abbercairny and also Abercairney; * Innerpeffray; closed 1 January 1917; re- opened 2 June 1919; * Crieff; Crieff Junction Railway station; relocated on the opening of the Comrie line on 1 June 1893.Col M H Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 Connections to other lines * Perth, Almond Valley and Methven Railway at Methven Junction * Crieff Junction Railway at Crieff * Crieff and Comrie Railway at Crieff References Sources  * Railscot on Crieff and Methven Junction Railway Category:Pre-grouping British railway companies Category:Caledonian Railway Category:Closed railway lines in Scotland Category:Early Scottish railway companies Category:Railway companies established in 1864 Category:Railway lines opened in 1867 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1869 Category:British companies established in 1864 Category:British companies disestablished in 1869 ","title":"Crieff and Methven Junction Railway"},{"id":"7114020","text":"Lawnweed may refer to: * Weeds of lawns * Soliva sessilis, a weed of lawns ","title":"Lawnweed"},{"id":"7114028","text":"Soliva is a genus of South American plants in the sunflower family.Ruiz L√≥pez, Hip√≥lito & Pav√≥n, Jos√© Antonio. 1794.

He was president of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile (1948‚Äì1954) and the Chairman of the Directory prior to reforming that office into the presidential. Biography Andriy Livytskyi was born on 9 April 1879 in Lyplyavo (at the time part of the Russian Empire) into an old Cossack family. He finished the Gymnasium of Pavlo Halahana in Kyiv, and later went on to study at the mathematical and juridical faculties of the St. Volodymyr Kyiv University in 1896. In 1897 and 1899 he was held in the Lukyanivska Prison in Kyiv for participation in protests. He was expelled from the university and exiled to Poltava Governorate under the secret surveillance of police for taking part in the student's strike of 1899. After obtaining his university diploma in 1903, he served in the Lubny Circuit Court, and then, since 1905, he was a barrister of the Kharkiv Court Chamber, and in 1913‚Äì1917 an elected judge of Zolotonosha uyezd in the Poltava Governorate. In his studential years, he took part in the Ukrainian independence movement, heading one of the organization's bases in Kyiv. From 1901, he belonged to the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party (RUP), heading its regional headquarters in Lubny. He was jailed once again in connections to the revolutionary activities of 1906 and after escaping was imprisoned again in 1907. Since 1917, Livytskyi was a member of the Central Rada and the Peasant Union (Ukraine). In the period of the Hetmanate (1918), he was a member of the Ukrainian National Union, in opposition to the government of Pavlo Skoropadsky. Later during the time of the Directorate of Ukraine, he was one of the founders of the Labour Council of Ukraine - the highest governing body of Ukraine. Livytskyi also held positions as the Minister of Justice and the deputy of the Rada of National Ministers of the Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) in 1919, as well as the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the government of Isaak Mazepa in 1919. From October 14 to November 18, 1920, he served as the Prime Minister of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Since October 1919, he was in the Ukrainian delegation to Warsaw, where he was working on the formation of the Ukrainian-Polish agreement, which was signed in 1920. After the defeat of the Ukrainian national movement for independence, he was forced to emigrate. From 1920 to 1948, he served as the head of the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) in exile. After Symon Petliura's assassination, he became the head of the Directorate of Ukraine and assumed the post of the Chief Otaman of the Ukrainian People's Republic Army in exile in 1926. Since that time to the time of his death, Livytskyi served as the head of state for the government of the UPR. He lived in Warsaw under constant watch of the Polish police. After the end of World War II, Livytskyi had goals of consolidating his political activities and reorganizing the government of the UPR in exile which its first session was opened on July 16, 1948, in Augsburg, Germany. In cooperation with Isaak Mazepa, he created the Ukrainian National Rada in exile in 1948 and became the First President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile. He died on 17 January 1954 in Karlsruhe, Germany, and was later buried in a cemetery in Munich and later his ashes were transferred to Ukrainian Memorial Cemetery in Bound Brook in the vicinity of New York City, United States.

He published his first translation from Egyptian in 1906. He translated inscriptions for many important excavations and sites, including Fayum, Saqqara, Amarna, Giza and Luxor (including Tutankhamun). He was curator at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and at the University Museum at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. In 1934 he was appointed Professor of Egyptology at the University of Oxford, a chair he held until his death in 1950.  Early life and background  Gunn was born in London, the son of George Gunn, a member of the London Stock Exchange, and Julia Alice Philp. His paternal grandparents were Theophilus Miller Gunn FRCS, a prominent London surgeon originally from Chard, and Mary Dally Battiscombe, from Bridport. Theophilus's father was John Gunn, a non-conformist preacher, brother of Daniel Gunn, originally from Wick in Scotland, but who spent most of his career in Chard. Both sides of the family were non-conformist. His unusual first name came from his grandmother's maiden name. He was educated at Bedales School, Westminster School and Allhallows School, Honiton. These public schools were more liberal than the conventional Victorian Public Schools, and provided an open-minded environment. Bedales, in those days, attracted nonconformists, agnostics and liberal Jews. It had connections to Fabian intellectual circles, and to the Wedgwoods, Darwins, Huxleys and Trevelyans. At the age of 14, while still in school, he began to read hieroglyphs. He then went to a tutor in Wiesbaden, but returned to London at the age of 18, due to a change in family finances. His father expected Jack to follow him to a career in the City, but he found he hated it. He tried banking, engineering, but they did not suit him. From 1908 to 1911 he was the private secretary to Pinero, which suited him better. In 1911, he moved to Paris where he worked as a journalist for the Continental Daily Mail. He demonstrated a proficiency in languages from an early age, and began working with Egyptian hieroglyphs while still in school. While often described as entirely self-taught, the Griffith Institute Archives say that he studied hieroglyphs at University College, London, as a student of Margaret Murray.  Early career, and involvement with the occult In 1905 he played the role of \\"Priest of the Floods and Storms\\" in the Theosophical Society of London's production of The Shrine of the Golden Hawk, written and directed by Florence Farr. In 1906 his translation of \\"The Instruction of Ptah-Hotep and The Instruction of Ke'Gemni\\" (from the Prisse Papyrus in Paris) was published as part of the \\"Wisdom of the East\\" series of wisdom literature. He later considered the translation to be premature and said: \\"I entirely repudiate my translation of the Prisse Papyrus, so far as one can repudiate what is in print.\\" But it was considered a considerable improvement over previous translations, and is still in print. He also seems to have been involved with the leaders of both factions of the occult community in London at the time: Arthur Edward Waite of the magical order, the Golden Dawn, and Aleister Crowley, who created his own order, A‚à¥A‚à¥, after he left the Golden Dawn. On 10 January 1906, Gunn was inducted into Waite's \\"Independent and Rectified Rite\\". R. A. Gilbert's biography of Waite describes Gunn as \\"an artist, an Egyptologist and an oriental linguist\\", and says that, in 1910, he \\"argued at great length over the correct transliteration of Hebrew terms used in the Grade rituals.\\" Crowley based his new religion, Thelema, on the translation of the Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu, also referred to as the \\"Stele of Revealing\\". He originally (1904) had it translated by the assistant curator of the Boulaq Museum in Cairo, under the supervision of the Egyptologist √âmile Brugsch. In 1912, he arranged for another translation, by Gunn and Gardiner. Crowley's periodical, The Equinox, contained a series of parodies aimed at Waite. In two of these, Battiscombe Gunn appeared as a minor character. In Volume 1, number 8 (Sept. 1912), Gunn appears in \\"Waite's Wet\\", a fictitious account of Waite's return to Crowley's group: \\"Waite's photograph, frock-coat and all, was carried in its red plush frame shoulder high by Mr. Battiscombe Gunn...\\". In Volume 1, number 10 (Sept 1913), Gunn appears in \\"Dead Weight\\" a false description of Waite's death (he actually lived until the 1940s): \\"Mr. Battiscombe Gunn was rapidly revising the funeral arrangements of the dying saint, which he proposed to found on some unedited documents of the Second Dynasty, which showed conclusively that the sacred lotus was, in reality, a corset, and the Weapon of Men Thu a button-hook.\\" Letters from Crowley to Gunn indicate that it was more than a casual acquaintance. By 1918, Gunn had lost interest in the occult, but had become an admirer of another former member of the Golden Dawn, the British Buddhist Allan Bennett, also known as Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya. Gunn was responsible for reintroducing Bennett and Clifford Bax (Bax was also a friend of Gunn's first wife, Meena, and her son Patrick, later Spike, Hughes.). This led to Bennett delivering a series of discourses on Buddhism in Bax's studio, in 1919 and 1920. These were incorporated in Bennett's The Wisdom of the Aryas (1923). Gunn experienced a conflict between the scientific and secular aspect of his professional career, and his spiritual interests. He next turned his interest to Freudian psychoanalysis. By 1922, he was spending the summers (when he was not on excavations in Egypt) in Vienna, where Meena was studying under Freud. By the 1930s Gunn had turned completely against the occult. He was highly antagonistic to Frederic H. Wood, who claimed that a long-dead Egyptian princess spoke, in ancient Egyptian, through \\"Rosemary\\". This form of \\"speaking in tongues\\" is known as xenoglossy. Rosemary's utterances were recorded phonetically and an Egyptologist, Mr. Hulme, claimed that Rosemary's speech conformed to the ancient Egyptian tongue, and could be translated into English. In the June 1937, issue of the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Gunn claimed that Hulme had manipulated the transcriptions to fit his own expectations of what he imagined ancient Egyptian to sound like. A later examination by John D. Ray (then the Sir Herbert Thompson Professor of Egyptology at the University of Cambridge) confirmed \\"there could be no mistaking Hulme's incompetence\\". Furthermore, both Gunn and Ray pointed out that Rosemary's visions of camels as domestic transport were inconsistent, as camels were not used for transport in 18th Dynasty Egypt. Wood's book on the subject, Egyptian Miracle, makes repeated derogatory references to Gunn, including \\"Also, the passing of our opponent Battiscombe Gunn, in 1950, can be recorded with the comment, De mortuis nil nisi bonum.\\"  Professional career  Before he went to Paris in 1911, he had met Alan Gardiner. They remained lifelong friends, and Gardiner was named in his will to co-ordinate the disposition of his professional papers. In 1913 he visited Egypt for the first time, as epigrapher on the staff of Flinders Petrie's excavation at Harageh, near Fayum, working with Reginald Engelbach. The outbreak of World War I prevented him returning for the following season. Returning to England, he enlisted in the Artists Rifles, but was invalided out in 1915. From 1915 to 1920 he worked as an assistant to Gardiner, primarily in the lexicographical work which led to the 1947 publication of Ancient Egyptian Onomastica. Of this period, Gardiner said: \\"He was a real Bohemian and much of his research was carried on in his own lodgings at dead of night.\\" A series of articles written while working with Gardiner led to the publication, in 1924, of his major publication, Studies in Egyptian Syntax. In this book, he identified the unusual syntactical relationship between negation and tense, now known as Gunn's Rule. Gunn's Rule still appears in modern textbooks. In the winter of 1921 to 1922 he was a member of the team led by Thomas Eric Peet and Leonard Woolley excavating at Amarna. He was then appointed (1922 to 1928) to the staff of the Service des antiquit√©s de l'√âgypte (the Service of Antiquities of the Egyptian government). During this time he worked with Cecil Firth in the investigations of the pyramid of Teti. He assisted in the translation of ostraca from the tomb of Tutankhamun. Using field glasses, he was able to read the name Sneferu in the tomb which was eventually shown to be the tomb of Hetepheres I. He became assistant conservator of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo in 1928, the year in which his son, J. B. Gunn was born. During the time he lived in Maadi, outside Cairo, he experimented with the manufacture of papyrus, growing the plant in his garden. He beat the sliced papyrus stalks between two layers of linen, and produced successful examples of papyrus, one of which was exhibited in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. He moved to the University Museum at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1931 as curator of the Egyptian section. In 1934 he was given an honorary M.A. at Oxford, so he could be appointed Professor of Egyptology at the University of Oxford, a chair he held until his death. He was made a Fellow of Queen's College, and was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1943. While at Oxford, he devoted himself to his pupils and his classes, at the expense of his own research. He was Editor of the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology from 1934 to 1939, and was in active correspondence with a large number of other Egyptologists, all over the world. During World War II several of his students (including Alec Naylor Dakin) worked on code breaking at Bletchley Park. Other students include Ricardo Caminos, Warren Royal Dawson, Peter Lewis Shinnie, Paul E. Kahle and T. G. H. James. Agatha Christie's 1944 detective novel Death Comes as the End, set in Thebes in the Middle Kingdom, is based on a series of letters that he translated. For the book Land of Enchanters: Egyptian Short Stories from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, published in 1947, he provided the English translation of both the Ancient Egyptian and Coptic stories. A revised edition was published in 2002.  Personal life  Wendy Wood, daughter (Scottish nationalist), Meena Gunn, daughter (Freudian psychoanalyst) Third Row: Mary Barnish, granddaughter, with Meena's dog, Spike Hughes, grandson (musician, critic), Bobbie Hughes granddaughter-in-law Fourth (front) Row: J. B. Gunn, grandson (physicist), Angela Hughes, great-granddaughter. By 1915, Jack had become involved with Meena Hughes, the estranged wife of musician and Irish song collector Herbert Hughes. She was born Lillian Meacham, in Maidstone, Kent, but had spent most of her teenage years in Cape Town, South Africa, where her father, C.S. Meacham, was brewery manager and corporate chemist for Ohlsson's Brewery. She was given the nickname Meena by Orage, who said that her childhood blond plaits reminded him of Princess Wilhelmina. In her late teens, she returned to London to study piano at the Royal Academy of Music. Her younger sister was Gwendoline Meacham, who became a Scots Nationalist, and changed her name to Wendy Wood. In addition to playing piano, for which she won 2 gold medals and then stopped playing, she became part of the circle around G. B. Shaw and H. G. Wells. She was a member of the Fabian Society and attended Theosophy lectures. In 1907, not long before her marriage to Hughes, she had a brief affair with the sculptor, printmaker and typographer Eric Gill, with whom both she and Jack were lifelong friends. Jack rented a cottage in Ditchling, where Gill was located, in the summer of 1919, and Jack, Meena and Pat all stayed there. In 1915, in the midst of World War I, Meena was in Florence, Italy, visiting another suitor, a \\"rich American\\". Jack escorted her seven-year-old son, Patrick Hughes (later Spike Hughes) from London to Florence, and then returned. In his autobiography, \\"Opening Bars\\", Pat describes his part in her decision to return to England and marry Jack. Her divorce from Herbert Hughes, however, was not finalised until 1922. During the early 1920s, while Jack was working in Egypt during the season, Meena spent quite a lot of time in central Europe, and Jack spent his summers there. In 1924, Meena studied psychoanalysis with Sigmund Freud in Vienna, and S√°ndor Ferenczi in Budapest. During this time, Jack was asked to visit Freud and look at his Egyptian antiquities. He never said anything to Freud, but he was convinced that nearly all of them were fakes. Meena was a practising psychoanalyst for the following 45 years, into her 80s. While Jack was Professor of Egyptology at Oxford, Meena maintained a psychoanalytical practice on Harley Street in London. After World War II she worked closely with Anna Freud, and in the 1960s she practised in the US After she completed her psychoanalytic training, Meena accompanied Jack while he was working in Egypt, and in 1928, their son J. B. Gunn, known as Iain, (later a physicist) was born in Cairo. In 1940, Meena and Jack were divorced, as Meena wanted to marry Alex Grey-Clarke, a young Harley Street doctor. In 1948 Jack married Constance Rogers, a librarian at the Ashmolean Museum. Jack's death, early in 1950, was preceded by some characteristic last words. He sent for his son Iain and Iain's fianc√©e, and as he lay on his death-bed, delivered a wise and paternal little speech on the advantages of marriage, and gave the two youngsters his blessing. Then he turned to his wife and said: \\"I shall look a bloody fool if I don't die after that, won't I?\\", and died within a few moments.\\"  References  *Dictionary of National Biography External links  Category:1883 births Category:1950 deaths Category:Academics from London Category:People educated at Bedales School Category:People educated at Westminster School, London Category:Alumni of University College London Category:English Egyptologists Category:English philologists Category:Fellows of The Queen's College, Oxford Category:People educated at Allhallows College Category:Professors of Egyptology (University of Oxford) Category:Fellows of the British Academy ","title":"Battiscombe Gunn"},{"id":"7114101","text":"Glendalough - oil on canvas, 100cm x 100cm, 2004 Magdalena Trzebiatowska (born 1971) is a Polish contemporary painter.

The piece comes with the subtitle of \\"A Fantastic Story\\", and it chronicles the relationship between a pawnbroker and a girl that frequents his shop.Magarshack, David, The Best Stories of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, (New York: The Modern Library, 2005), xi- xxvi. The story was inspired by a news report that Dostoyevsky read in April 1876 about the suicide of a seamstress. Dostoyevsky referred to it as a \\"meek suicide\\" that \\"keeps haunting you for a long time.\\"Ludmila Koehler. Five Minutes Too Late... Dostoyevsky Studies, Vol. 6, p. 113, 115: 1985. Plot summary The story opens with the narrator in a frenzy about an apparent tragedy that has just befallen his household. His wife has apparently died, as he makes repeated references to her being laid out on a table, presumably lifeless. The narrator proceeds to make an attempt to relate the story to the reader in an effort to make sense of the situation. The narrator is the owner of a pawnshop, and one of his repeated customers was a young girl of sixteen who always pawns items to earn money to advertise as a governess in the newspaper. The narrator could see that she was in a dire financial situation, and he often gave her much more for her pawned items than they were reasonably worth. The narrator slowly develops an interest in the girl. The narrator investigates the girl's background, and finds that she is at the mercy of two greedy aunts. The aunts were arranging her marriage to a fat shopkeeper who previously beat both of his ex-wives to death. Once the shopkeeper proposed marriage to the girl, the narrator countered with his own proposal. The girl decides, after some deliberation, to marry the narrator. The narrator's marriage started out nicely, but his miserly and reserved ways are taxing to his young wife. A dearth of communication and disagreements about how the pawnshop should be run eventually result in arguments, though the narrator insists that they never quarreled. The narrator's wife begins to make a habit of leaving during the day, and eventually it is discovered that she is visiting Efimovich, a member of the narrator's former regiment. The narrator's wife eventually confronts the narrator with the details that she learned from Efimovich: details about the narrator's shameful departure from his regiment. The narrator is unfazed, at least externally, and his wife continues her visits to Efimovich. One time, the narrator follows his wife to Efimovich, bringing a revolver. He listens in delight to a verbal duel between his wife and Efimovich, at whom she laughs; and eventually he bursts in and reclaims his wife. The narrator and his wife return home. They retire for the night separately. In the morning, the narrator opens his eyes to see that his wife is standing over him with the revolver pointed at his temple. He simply closes his eyes again, and he is convinced that he conquered her with his readiness to accept death. She does not shoot, and the narrator buys her a separate bed that day. That same day, she becomes ill. The narrator spares no expense for his wife's medical care, and she slowly recovers. Throughout the entire winter the narrator watches his wife furtively, and a watershed moment happens when she begins to sing in his presence. The narrator kisses his wife's feet and promises to be a changed man. He recounts the story of his shame in the regiment, and he promises to take her to Boulogne-sur-Mer. Several days later, the narrator leaves the house to make arrangements for passports. When the narrator returns home, he is met with a crowd of people outside his house. His wife has committed suicide: she has jumped out of the window while holding an icon. The narrator is convinced that he was only five minutes too late, even though it was ultimately his narcissistic love that drove his gentle wife to suicide. Analysis The characterization of the narrator has been compared to the underground man of Notes from Underground, and of the pawnbrokers in Crime and Punishment and The Idiot that seek to empower themselves through the accumulation of wealth.Koehler, p. 113.] The characterization of the narrator and his wife's suicide are meant as a criticism of what Dostoyevsky refers to as kosnost or spiritual stagnation that results from material pursuits.Koehler, p. 121-22.

Many foreign-born composers have played a part in the French tradition as well, including Lully, Gluck, Salieri, Cherubini, Spontini, Meyerbeer, Rossini, Donizetti, Verdi and Offenbach. French opera began at the court of Louis XIV of France with Jean- Baptiste Lully's Cadmus et Hermione (1673), although there had been various experiments with the form before that, most notably Pomone by Robert Cambert. Lully and his librettist Quinault created trag√©die en musique, a form in which dance music and choral writing were particularly prominent.Orrey p. 34 Lully's most important successor was Rameau. After Rameau's death, the German Gluck was persuaded to produce six operas for the Parisian stage in the 1770s. They show the influence of Rameau, but simplified and with greater focus on the drama. At the same time, by the middle of the 18th century another genre was gaining popularity in France: op√©ra comique, in which arias alternated with spoken dialogue.Orrey p. 45 By the 1820s, Gluckian influence in France had given way to a taste for the operas of Rossini. Rossini's Guillaume Tell helped found the new genre of Grand opera, a form whose most famous exponent was Giacomo Meyerbeer.Orrey p. 153 Lighter op√©ra comique also enjoyed tremendous success in the hands of Bo√Øeldieu, Auber, H√©rold and Adam. In this climate, the operas of the French-born composer Hector Berlioz struggled to gain a hearing. Berlioz's epic masterpiece Les Troyens, the culmination of the Gluckian tradition, was not given a full performance for almost a hundred years after it was written. In the second half of the 19th century, Jacques Offenbach dominated the new genre of operetta with witty and cynical works such as Orph√©e aux enfers;Orrey p. 204 Charles Gounod scored a massive success with Faust;Orrey p. 154 and Georges Bizet composed Carmen, probably the most famous French opera of all. At the same time, the influence of Richard Wagner was felt as a challenge to the French tradition. Perhaps the most interesting response to Wagnerian influence was Claude Debussy's unique operatic masterpiece Pell√©as et M√©lisande (1902).See Orrey, p. 216: \\"A unique distillation of the essence of Wagner\\". Other notable 20th-century names include Ravel, Poulenc and Messiaen. The birth of French opera: Lully Jean-Baptiste Lully, the \\"Father of French Opera\\" The first operas to be staged in France were imported from Italy, beginning with Francesco Sacrati's La finta pazza in 1645. French audiences gave them a lukewarm reception. This was partly for political reasons, since these operas were promoted by the Italian-born Cardinal Mazarin, who was then first minister during the regency of the young King Louis XIV and a deeply unpopular figure with large sections of French society. Musical considerations also played a role, since the French court already had a firmly established genre of stage music, ballet de cour, which included sung elements as well as dance and lavish spectacle.Oxford Illustrated pp. 33‚Äì35 When two Italian operas, Francesco Cavalli's Xerse and Ercole amante, proved failures in Paris in 1660 and 1662, the prospects of opera flourishing in France looked remote.\\"Francesco Cavalli\\" in Viking Opera Guide, pp. 189‚Äì94 Yet Italian opera would stimulate the French to make their own experiments at the genre and, paradoxically, it would be an Italian-born composer, Jean-Baptiste Lully, who would found a lasting French operatic tradition. In 1669, Pierre Perrin founded the Acad√©mie d'Op√©ra and, in collaboration with the composer Robert Cambert, tried his hand at composing operatic works in French. Their first effort, Pomone, appeared on stage on 3 March 1671 and was followed a year later by Les peines et plaisirs de l'amour. At this point King Louis XIV transferred the privilege of producing operas from Perrin to Jean-Baptiste Lully.Grout p. 134Viking p. 180 Lully, a Florentine, was already the favourite musician of the king, who had assumed full royal powers in 1661 and was intent on refashioning French culture in his image. Lully had a sure instinct for knowing exactly what would satisfy the taste of his master and the French public in general. He had already composed music for extravagant court entertainments as well as for the theatre, most notably the com√©dies-ballets inserted into plays by Moli√®re. Yet Moli√®re and Lully had quarrelled bitterly and the composer found a new and more pliable collaborator in Philippe Quinault, who would write the libretti for all but two of Lully's operas. On 27 April 1673, Lully's Cadmus et Hermione ‚Äì often regarded as the first French opera in the full sense of the term ‚Äì appeared in Paris.Viking Opera Guide p. 589 It was a work in a new genre, which its creators Lully and Quinault baptised trag√©die en musique,Also known as trag√©die lyrique a form of opera specially adapted for French taste. Lully went on to produce trag√©dies en musique at the rate of at least one a year until his death in 1687 and they formed the bedrock of the French national operatic tradition for almost a century. As the name suggests, trag√©die en musique was modelled on the French Classical tragedy of Corneille and Racine. Lully and Quinault replaced the confusingly elaborate Baroque plots favoured by the Italians with a much clearer five-act structure. Each of the five acts generally followed a regular pattern. An aria in which one of the protagonists expresses their inner feelings is followed by recitative mixed with short arias (petits airs) which move the action forward. Acts end with a divertissement, the most striking feature of French Baroque opera, which allowed the composer to satisfy the public's love of dance, huge choruses and gorgeous visual spectacle. The recitative, too, was adapted and moulded to the unique rhythms of the French language and was often singled out for special praise by critics, a famous example occurring in Act Two of Lully's Armide. The five acts of the main opera were preceded by an allegorical prologue, another feature Lully took from the Italians, which he generally used to sing the praises of Louis XIV. Indeed, the entire opera was often thinly disguised flattery of the French monarch, who was represented by the noble heroes drawn from Classical myth or Mediaeval romance. The trag√©die en musique was a form in which all the arts, not just music, played a crucial role. Quinault's verse combined with the set designs of Carlo Vigarani or Jean B√©rain and the choreography of Beauchamp and Olivet, as well as the elaborate stage effects known as the machinery.French Baroque Masters p. 27 As one of its detractors, Melchior Grimm, was forced to admit: \\"To judge of it, it is not enough to see it on paper and read the score; one must have seen the picture on the stage\\".Girdlestone, p. 111General references for this section: chapter on Lully in French Baroque Masters by James R. Anthony; the chapter \\"Lulli's Trag√©die en musique in Girdlestone, pp. 104ff.; article on Lully in Viking. From Lully to Rameau: new genres A performance of Lully's opera Armide at the Palais-Royal in 1761 French opera was now established as a distinct genre. Though influenced by Italian models, trag√©die en musique increasingly diverged from the form then dominating Italy, opera seria. French audiences disliked the castrato singers who were extremely popular in the rest of Europe, preferring their male heroes to be sung by the haute-contre, a particularly high tenor voice. Dramatic recitative was at the heart of Lullian opera, whereas in Italy recitative had dwindled to a perfunctory form known as secco, where the voice was accompanied only by the continuo. Likewise, the choruses and dances that were such a feature of French works played little or no part in opera seria. Arguments over the respective merits of French and Italian music dominated criticism throughout the following century,For examples, see Orrey pp. 38‚Äì39, 46‚Äì47. until Gluck arrived in Paris and effectively fused the two traditions in a new synthesis. Lully had not guaranteed his supremacy as the leading French opera composer through his musical talents alone. In fact, he had used his friendship with King Louis to secure a virtual monopoly on the public performance of stage music.French Baroque Masters pp. 6‚Äì7 It was only after Lully's death that other opera composers emerged from his shadow. The most noteworthy was probably Marc-Antoine Charpentier,See chapter on Charpentier by H.Wiley Hitchcock in French Baroque Masters pp. 73ff. whose sole trag√©die en musique, M√©d√©e, appeared in Paris in 1693 to a decidedly mixed reception. Lully's supporters were dismayed at Charpentier's inclusion of Italian elements in his opera, particularly the rich and dissonant harmony the composer had learned from his teacher Carissimi in Rome. Nevertheless, M√©d√©e has been acclaimed as \\"arguably the finest French opera of the 17th century\\".Viking p. 204 Other composers tried their hand at trag√©die en musique in the years following Lully's death, including Marin Marais (Alcyone, 1703), Destouches (T√©l√©maque, 1714) and Andr√© Campra (Tancr√®de, 1702; Idomen√©e, 1712). Campra also invented a new, lighter genre: the op√©ra-ballet.Girdlestone pp. 321‚Äì22 As the name suggests, op√©ra-ballet contained even more dance music than the trag√©die en musique. The subject matter was generally far less elevated too; the plots were not necessarily derived from Classical mythology and even allowed for the comic elements which Lully had excluded from the trag√©die en musique after Th√©s√©e (1675).French Baroque Masters pp. 28‚Äì29 The op√©ra-ballet consisted of a prologue followed by a number of self-contained acts (also known as entr√©es), often loosely grouped round a single theme. The individual acts could also be performed independently, in which case they were known as actes de ballet. Campra's first work in the form, L'Europe galante (\\"Europe in Love\\") of 1697, is a good example of the genre. Each of its four acts is set in a different European country (France, Spain, Italy and Turkey) and features ordinary middle-class characters.Viking p. 181 Op√©ra-ballet continued to be a tremendously popular form for the rest of the Baroque period. Another popular genre of the era was the pastorale h√©ro√Øque, the first example of which was Lully's last completed opera Acis et Galat√©e (1686).Viking pp. 595‚Äì96 The pastorale h√©ro√Øque usually drew on Classical subject matter associated with pastoral poetry and was in three acts, rather than the five of the trag√©die en musique.French Baroque Masters p. 265 Around this time, some composers also experimented at writing the first French comic operas, a good example being Mouret's Les amours de Ragonde (1714).French Baroque Masters p. 266 Rameau Jean-Philippe Rameau, the eighteenth-century innovator Jean-Philippe Rameau was the most important opera composer to appear in France after Lully.Oxford Illustrated p. 64 He was also a highly controversial figure and his operas were subject to attacks by both the defenders of the French, Lullian tradition and the champions of Italian music. Rameau was almost fifty when he composed his first opera, Hippolyte et Aricie, in 1733. Until that point, his reputation had mainly rested on his works on music theory. Hippolyte caused an immediate stir. Some members of the audience, like Campra, were struck by its incredible richness of invention. Others, led by the supporters of Lully, found Rameau's use of unusual harmonies and dissonance perplexing and reacted with horror. The war of words between the \\"Lullistes\\" and the \\"Ramistes\\" continued to rage for the rest of the decade. Rameau made little attempt to create new genres; instead he took existing forms and innovated from within using a musical language of great originality. He was a prolific composer, writing five trag√©dies en musique, six op√©ra-ballets, numerous pastorales h√©ro√Øques and actes de ballets as well as two comic operas, and often revising his works several times until they bore little resemblance to their original versions. By 1745, Rameau had won acceptance as the official court composer, but a new controversy broke out in the 1750s. This was the so-called Querelle des Bouffons, in which supporters of Italian opera, such as the philosopher and musician Jean-Jacques Rousseau, accused Rameau of being an old-fashioned, establishment figure. The \\"anti- nationalists\\" (as they were sometimes known) rejected Rameau's style, which they felt was too precious and too distanced from emotional expression, in favour of what they saw as the simplicity and \\"naturalness\\" of the Italian opera buffa, best represented by Pergolesi's La serva padrona. Their arguments would exert a great deal of influence over French opera in the second half of the eighteenth century, particularly over the emerging form known as op√©ra comique.General references for this section: Girdlestone passim; chapter on Rameau by Graham Sadler in The New Grove French Baroque Masters, pp. 207 ff. The growth of op√©ra comique Op√©ra comique began life in the early eighteenth century, not in the prestigious opera houses or aristocratic salons, but in the theatres of the annual Paris fairs. Here plays began to include musical numbers called vaudevilles, which were existing popular tunes refitted with new words. In 1715, the two fair theatres were brought under the aegis of an institution called the Th√©√¢tre de l'Op√©ra-Comique. In spite of fierce opposition from rival theatres, the venture flourished, and composers were gradually brought in to write original music for the plays, which became the French equivalent of the German Singspiel, because they contained a mixture of arias and spoken dialogue. The Querelle des Bouffons (1752‚Äì54), mentioned above, was a major turning-point for op√©ra comique. In 1752, the leading champion of Italian music, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, produced a short opera, Le Devin du village, in an attempt to introduce his ideals of musical simplicity and naturalness to France. Though Rousseau's piece had no spoken dialogue, it provided an ideal model for composers of op√©ra comique to follow. These included the italian Egidio Duni (Le peintre amoureux de son mod√®le, 1757) and the french Philidor (Tom Jones, 1765) and Monsigny (Le d√©serteur, 1769). All these pieces dealt with ordinary bourgeois characters rather than Classical heroes. But the most important and popular composer of op√©ra comique in the late eighteenth century was Andr√© Ernest Modeste Gr√©try. Gr√©try successfully blended Italian tunefulness with a careful setting of the French language. He was a versatile composer who expanded the range of op√©ra comique to cover a wide variety of subjects from the Oriental fairy tale Z√©mire et Azor (1772) to the musical satire of Le jugement de Midas (1778) and the domestic farce of L'amant jaloux (also 1778). His most famous work was the historical \\"rescue opera\\", Richard Coeur-de-lion (1784), which achieved international popularity, reaching London in 1786 and Boston in 1797.Oxford Illustrated pp. 91‚Äì94, 114‚Äì18; Viking article on Gr√©try. Gluck in Paris Gluck in a 1775 portrait by Joseph Duplessis While op√©ra comique flourished in the 1760s, serious French opera was in the doldrums. Rameau had died in 1764, leaving his last great trag√©die en musique, Les Bor√©ades unperformed.Viking p. 846. The reasons why it was shelved are still unclear. No French composer seemed capable of assuming his mantle. The answer was to import a leading figure from abroad. Christoph Willibald von Gluck, a German, was already famous for his reforms of Italian opera, which had replaced the old opera seria with a much more dramatic and direct style of music theatre, beginning with Orfeo ed Euridice in 1762. Gluck admired French opera and had absorbed the lessons of both Rameau and Rousseau.Girdlestone, chapter \\"Rameau and Gluck\\" pp. 551ff. In 1765, Melchior Grimm published \\"Po√®me lyrique\\", an influential article for the Encyclop√©die on lyric and opera librettos.Larousse Dictionnaire de la musique Music and the Origins of Language: Theories from the French Enlightenment by Downing A. Thomas, p. 148. Lully Studies by John Hajdu Heyer, p. 248A History of Western Musical Aesthetics by Edward A. Lippman, p. 171King's College London, seminar 1. Music: universal, national, nationalistic Under the patronage of his former music pupil, Marie Antoinette, who had married the future French king Louis XVI in 1770, Gluck signed a contract for six stage works with the management of the Paris Op√©ra. He began with Iphig√©nie en Aulide (19 April 1774). The premiere sparked a huge controversy, almost a war, such as had not been seen in the city since the Querelle des Bouffons. Gluck's opponents brought the leading Italian composer, Niccol√≤ Piccinni, to Paris to demonstrate the superiority of Neapolitan opera and the \\"whole town\\" engaged in an argument between \\"Gluckists\\" and \\"Piccinnists\\".Viking p. 371 On 2 August 1774, the French version of Orfeo ed Euridice was performed, with the title role transposed from the castrato to the haute-contre, according to the French preference for high tenor voices which had ruled since the days of Lully.Viking pp. 375‚Äì76 This time Gluck's work was better received by the Parisian public. Gluck went on to write a revised French version of his Alceste, as well as the new works Armide (1777), Iphig√©nie en Tauride (1779) and Echo et Narcisse for Paris. After the failure of the last named opera, Gluck left Paris and retired from composing. But he left behind an immense influence on French music and several other foreign composers followed his example and came to Paris to write Gluckian operas, including Salieri (Les Dana√Ødes, 1784) and Sacchini (Oedipe √† Colone, 1786).Oxford Illustrated pp. 75‚Äì77 From the Revolution to Rossini The French Revolution of 1789 was a cultural watershed. What was left of the old tradition of Lully and Rameau was finally swept away, to be rediscovered only in the twentieth century. The Gluckian school and op√©ra comique survived, but they immediately began to reflect the turbulent events around them. Established composers such as Gr√©try and Dalayrac were drafted in to write patriotic propaganda pieces for the new regime.Oxford Illustrated pp. 122‚Äì29 A typical example is Gossec's Le triomphe de la R√©publique (1793) which celebrated the crucial Battle of Valmy the previous year.See the 2006 recording of this opera by Diego Fasolis (Chandos Records) A new generation of composers appeared, led by √âtienne M√©hul and the Italian-born Luigi Cherubini. They applied Gluck's principles to op√©ra comique, giving the genre a new dramatic seriousness and musical sophistication. The stormy passions of M√©hul's operas of the 1790s, such as Stratonice and Ariodant, earned their composer the title of the first musical Romantic.Cairns volume one, p. 220 Cherubini's works too held a mirror to the times. Lodoiska was a \\"rescue opera\\" set in Poland, in which the imprisoned heroine is freed and her oppressor overthrown. Cherubini's masterpiece, M√©d√©e (1797), reflected the bloodshed of the Revolution only too successfully: it was always more popular abroad than in France. The lighter Les deux journ√©es of 1800 was part of a new mood of reconciliation in the country.Deane, Chapter One passim Theatres had proliferated during the 1790s, but when Napoleon took power, he simplified matters by effectively reducing the number of Parisian opera houses to three.Oxford Illustrated History of Opera p. 132 These were the Op√©ra (for serious operas with recitative not dialogue); the Op√©ra-Comique (for works with spoken dialogue in French); and the Th√©√¢tre-Italien (for imported Italian operas). All three would play a leading role over the next half-century or so. At the Op√©ra, Gaspare Spontini upheld the serious Gluckian tradition with La Vestale (1807) and Fernand Cortez (1809). Nevertheless, the lighter new op√©ra- comiques of Boieldieu and Isouard were a bigger hit with French audiences, who also flocked to the Th√©√¢tre-Italien to see traditional opera buffa and works in the newly fashionable bel canto style, especially those by Rossini, whose fame was sweeping across Europe. Rossini's influence began to pervade French op√©ra comique. Its presence is felt in Boieldieu's greatest success, La dame blanche (1825) as well as later works by Auber (Fra Diavolo, 1830; Le domino noir, 1837), H√©rold (Zampa, 1831) and Adolphe Adam (Le postillon de Longjumeau, 1836).Oxford Illustrated pp. 135‚Äì37 In 1823, the Th√©√¢tre-Italien scored an immense coup when it persuaded Rossini himself to come to Paris and take up the post of manager of the opera house. Rossini arrived to welcome worthy of a modern media celebrity. Not only did he revive the flagging fortunes of the Th√©√¢tre-Italien, but he also turned his attention to the Op√©ra, giving it French versions of his Italian operas and a new piece, Guillaume Tell (1829). This proved to be Rossini's final work for the stage. Ground down by the excessive workload of running a theatre and disillusioned by the failure of Tell, Rossini retired as an opera composer.Barbier pp. 188‚Äì93 Grand opera The ballet of the nuns from Meyerbeer's Robert le diable. Painting by Edgar Degas (1876) Guillaume Tell might initially have been a failure but together with a work from the previous year, Auber's La muette de Portici, it ushered in a new genre which dominated the French stage for the rest of the century: grand opera. This was a style of opera characterised by grandiose scale, heroic and historical subjects, large casts, vast orchestras, richly detailed sets, sumptuous costumes, spectacular scenic effects and ‚Äì this being France ‚Äì a great deal of ballet music. Grand opera had already been prefigured by works such as Spontini's La vestale and Cherubini's Les Abenc√©rages (1813), but the composer history has above all come to associate with the genre is Giacomo Meyerbeer. Like Gluck, Meyerbeer was a German who had learnt his trade composing Italian opera before arriving in Paris. His first work for the Op√©ra, Robert le diable (1831), was a sensation; audiences particularly thrilled to the ballet sequence in Act Three in which the ghosts of corrupted nuns rise from their graves. Robert, together with Meyerbeer's three subsequent grand operas, Les Huguenots (1836), Le proph√®te (1849) and L'Africaine (1865), became part of the repertoire throughout Europe for the rest of the nineteenth century and exerted an immense influence on other composers, even though the musical merit of these extravagant works was often disputed. In fact, the most famous example of French grand opera likely to be encountered in opera houses today is by Giuseppe Verdi, who wrote Don Carlos for the Paris Op√©ra in 1867.Oxford Illustrated pp. 138‚Äì50Incidentally,before gas lighting was invented in 1875, the breaks between acts in operas had to be timed to allow the replacement of candles in chandeliers. Berlioz While Meyerbeer's popularity has faded, the fortunes of another French composer of the era have risen steeply over the past few decades. Yet the operas of Hector Berlioz were failures in their day. Berlioz was a unique mixture of an innovative modernist and a backward-looking conservative. His taste in opera had been formed in the 1820s, when the works of Gluck and his followers were being pushed aside in favour of Rossinian bel canto. Though Berlioz grudgingly admired some works by Rossini, he despised what he saw as the showy effects of the Italian style and longed to return opera to the dramatic truth of Gluck. He was also a fully-fledged Romantic, keen to find new ways of musical expression. His first and only work for the Paris Op√©ra, Benvenuto Cellini (1838), was a notorious failure. Audiences could not understand the opera's originality and musicians found its unconventional rhythms impossible to play. Twenty years later, Berlioz began writing his operatic masterpiece Les Troyens with himself rather than audiences of the day in mind.Viking p. 92 Les Troyens was to be the culmination of the French Classical tradition of Gluck and Spontini. Predictably, it failed to make the stage, at least in its complete, four-hour form. For that, it would have to wait until the second half of the twentieth century, fulfilling the composer's prophecy, \\"If only I could live till I am a hundred and forty, my life would become decidedly interesting\\".Cairns Vol. 1, p. 14 Berlioz's third and final opera, the Shakespearean comedy B√©atrice et B√©n√©dict (1862), was written for a theatre in Germany, where audiences were far more appreciative of his musical innovation. The late 19th century The foyer of Charles Garnier's Op√©ra, Paris, opened 1875 Berlioz was not the only one discontented with operatic life in Paris. In the 1850s, two new theatres attempted to break the monopoly of the Op√©ra and the Op√©ra-Comique on the performance of musical drama in the capital. The Th√©√¢tre Lyrique ran from 1851 to 1870. It was here in 1863 that Berlioz saw the only part of Les Troyens to be performed in his lifetime. But the Lyrique also staged the premieres of works by a rising new generation of French opera composers, led by Charles Gounod and Georges Bizet. Though not as innovative as Berlioz, these composers were receptive to new musical influences. They also liked writing operas on literary themes. Gounod's Faust (1859), based on the drama by Goethe, became an enormous worldwide success. Gounod followed it with Mireille (1864), based on the Proven√ßal epic by Fr√©d√©ric Mistral, and the Shakespeare-inspired Rom√©o et Juliette (1867). Bizet offered the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique Les p√™cheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth, but his biggest triumph was written for the Op√©ra-Comique. Carmen (1875) is now perhaps the most famous of all French operas. Early critics and audiences, however, were shocked by its unconventional blend of romantic passion and realism.Oxford Illustrated pp. 156‚Äì63 Another figure unhappy with the Parisian operatic scene in the mid- nineteenth century was Jacques Offenbach. He found that contemporary French op√©ra-comiques no longer offered any room for comedy. His little theatre the Bouffes-Parisiens, established in 1855, put on short one-act pieces full of farce and satire. In 1858, Offenbach tried something more ambitious. Orph√©e aux enfers (\\"Orpheus in the Underworld\\") was the first work in a new genre: operetta. Orph√©e was both a parody of highflown Classical tragedy and a satire on contemporary society. Its incredible popularity prompted Offenbach to follow up with more operettas such as La belle H√©l√®ne (1864) and La Vie parisienne (1866) as well as the more serious Les contes d'Hoffmann (1881).Viking pp. 735‚Äì39 Opera flourished in late nineteenth-century Paris and many works of the period went on to gain international renown. These include Mignon (1866) and Hamlet (1868) by Ambroise Thomas; Samson et Dalila (1877, in the Op√©ra 's new home, the Palais Garnier) by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns; Lakm√© (1883) by L√©o Delibes; and Le roi d'Ys (1888) by √âdouard Lalo. The most consistently successful composer of the era was Jules Massenet, who produced twenty-five operas in his characteristically suave and elegant style, including several for the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie in Brussels and the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo. His tragic romances Manon (1884) and Werther (1892) have weathered changes in musical fashion and are still widely performed today.Oxford Illustrated pp. 164‚Äì68 French Wagnerism and Debussy Mary Garden, the interpreter of the premiere, in a representation of Pell√©as et M√©lisande in 1908 The conservative music critics who had rejected Berlioz detected a new threat in the form of Richard Wagner, the German composer whose revolutionary music dramas were causing controversy throughout Europe. When Wagner presented a revised version of his opera Tannh√§user in Paris in 1861, it provoked so much hostility that the run was cancelled after only three performances. Deteriorating relations between France and Germany only made matters worse and after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71, there were political and nationalistic reasons to reject Wagner's influence too. Traditionalist critics used the word \\"Wagnerian\\" as a term of abuse for anything that was modern in music. Yet composers such as Gounod and Bizet had already begun to introduce Wagnerian harmonic innovations into their scores, and many forward-thinking artists such as the poet Baudelaire praised Wagner's \\"music of the future\\". Some French composers began to adopt the Wagnerian aesthetic wholesale. These included Emmanuel Chabrier (Gwendoline, 1886) and Ernest Chausson (Le roi Arthus, 1903). Few of these works have survived; they were too derivative, their composers were too overwhelmed by the example of their hero to preserve much individuality of their own.Oxford Illustrated pp. 164‚Äì66 Claude Debussy had a much more ambivalent ‚Äì and ultimately more fruitful- attitude to Wagnerian influence. Initially overwhelmed by his experience of Wagner's operas, especially Parsifal, Debussy later tried to break free of the spell of the \\"Old Wizard of Bayreuth\\". Debussy's unique opera Pell√©as et M√©lisande (1902) shows the influence of the German composer in the central role given to the orchestra and the complete abolition of the traditional difference between aria and recitative. Indeed, Debussy had complained that there was \\"too much singing\\" in conventional opera and replaced it with fluid, vocal declamation moulded to the rhythms of the French language. The love story of Pell√©as et M√©lisande avoided the grand passions of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde in favour of an elusive Symbolist drama in which the characters only express their feelings indirectly. The mysterious atmosphere of the opera is enhanced by orchestration of remarkable subtlety and suggestive power.Holmes pp. 56‚Äì68 The twentieth century and beyond The early years of the twentieth century saw two more French operas which, though not on the level of Debussy's achievement, managed to absorb Wagnerian influences while retaining a sense of individuality. These were Gabriel Faur√©'s austerely Classical P√©n√©lope (1913) and Paul Dukas's colourful Symbolist drama, Ariane et Barbe-Bleue (1907). The more frivolous genres of operetta and op√©ra comique still thrived in the hands of composers like Andr√© Messager and Reynaldo Hahn. Indeed, for many people, light and elegant works like this represented the true French tradition as opposed to the \\"Teutonic heaviness\\" of Wagner. This was the opinion of Maurice Ravel, who wrote only two short but ingenious operas: L'heure espagnole (1911), a farce set in Spain; and L'enfant et les sortil√®ges (1925), a fantasy set in the world of childhood in which various animals and pieces of furniture come to life and sing.Oxford Illustrated pp. 285, 311‚Äì12 A younger group of composers, who formed a group known as Les Six shared a similar aesthetic to Ravel. The most important members of Les Six were Darius Milhaud, Arthur Honegger and Francis Poulenc. Milhaud was a prolific and versatile composer who wrote in a variety of forms and styles, from the Op√©ras-minutes (1927‚Äì28), none of which is more than ten minutes long, to the epic Christophe Colomb (1928).Viking pp. 667‚Äì68 The Swiss-born Honegger experimented mixing opera with oratorio in works such as Le Roi David (1921) and Jeanne d'Arc au B√ªcher (1938).Viking p. 488. It's worth noting that Honegger was more sympathetic to German music than the other members of \\"Les Six\\". But the most successful opera composer of the group was Poulenc, though he came late to the genre with the surrealist comedy Les mamelles de Tir√©sias in 1947. In complete contrast, Poulenc's greatest opera, Dialogues des Carm√©lites (1957) is an anguished spiritual drama about the fate of a convent during the French Revolution.Viking pp. 792‚Äì95 Poulenc wrote some of the very few operas since the Second World War to win a wide international audience. Another post-war composer to attract attention outside France was Olivier Messiaen, like Poulenc a devout Catholic. Messiaen's religious drama Saint Fran√ßois d'Assise (1983) requires huge orchestral and choral forces and lasts four hours.Viking pp. 654‚Äì56 St. Fran√ßois in turn was one of the inspirations for Kaija Saariaho's L'amour de loin (2000). Denisov's L'√©cume des jours (1981) is an adaptation of the novel by Boris Vian. Philippe Boesmans' Julie (2005, after Strindberg's Miss Julie) was commissioned by the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie of Brussels, an important center for French opera even in Lully's day.

He is an independent consultant living in the U.S. He is a Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council of the United States. From 2012 to 2018 he was the managing director of the Center for Transatlantic Relations at the Paul Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington DC. He was the Hungarian ambassador to the United States between 2002 and 2007. He was also Hungary's first ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Simonyi was appointed ambassador to the U.S. in 2002 under the administration of Prime Minister P√©ter Medgyessy, and presented his credentials on 25 September 2002. He replaced ambassador G√©za Jeszenszky, who left office in August, 2002. He appeared several times on The Colbert Report, a satirical political show on American cable television. Early childhood Simonyi was born 16 May 1952 in Budapest. As a four-year-old, he witnessed Soviet tanks roll past his home during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. In 1961, Simony's father's profession as a textile engineer brought the family to Copenhagen, Denmark, where they would live for five years. In Denmark Simonyi attended British-run international-school and Danish government school, learning Danish and English. Simonyi majored in transport economics at the Karl Marx University of Economics in Budapest. He graduated in 1975, writing his thesis on Denmark's security policy in the 20th century. Career After university, Simonyi worked with many youth exchange programs, in particular the State Committee for Youth and the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY), a \\"frontline\\" organization speaking out against the imperialist practices of capitalist countries and of NATO, but with a special interest in forging ties between youth organizations of the East and the West, a result of d√©tente, to span from nato to Eastern Bloc countries. This work brought him into contact with the American Council of Young Political Leaders. From 1984 to 1989 he worked for the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party in the foreign relations department with Gyula Horn and L√°szl√≥ Kov√°cs, both architects of the changes in Eastern Europe in 1989. In 2014, Simonyi, along with Nancy Brinker of the Susan G. Komen Foundation and Ambassador David Huebner, the openly gay U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand, started \\"Ambassadors for Equality,\\" an initiative to support LGBT rights around the world. Fifty current and former ambassadors have signed the pledge. In an interview, Simonyi said \\"[Affirming LGBT rights] should not be seen as an American endeavor because the U.S. cannot and should not do it alone because then it becomes an American thing and gets tangled in the anti-American sentiments we see in other countries. But if the U.S. and other countries hold hands for LGBT rights, then that makes a difference.\\" Appearances on The Colbert Report On 9 August 2006, the character Stephen Colbert, (played by Stephen Colbert the actor) announced on his political talk show The Colbert Report (airing on the cable channel Comedy Central in the United States) that The Ministry of Transport of Hungary was soliciting suggestions for the name of a new bridge to be built over the Danube River north of Budapest, completing the M0 motorway-loop around the city. On 14 September 2006 Ambassador Simonyi appeared on the American cable television channel Comedy Central's The Colbert Report to discuss a new bridge under construction in Hungary. The since-named Megyeri Bridge, completed in 2008, spans the River Danube just north of Budapest. Colbert (a U.S. citizen) had hoped the Hungarian government would name the innovative bridge after him, leading to the ambassador's appearance on the show. Voting was taking place in an online poll on the Ministry's website. On 8 August 2006 the newswire service Reuters had reported that Chuck Norris was the leading candidate. He appeared on the 10 April 2007 episode, in response to comments Colbert claimed to have made on his supposed radio show, Colbert on the Ert, about Hungarians' lack of guitar playing talent, in a parody of Don Imus' recent comments about the Rutgers women's basketball team. After referring to the alleged scandal throughout the episode, the ambassador appeared suddenly in the tag playing an electric guitar live. After Simonyi offered Colbert the Hungarian-made eagle- headed guitar, Colbert apologized, they both agreed that the Finnish could not play guitar, and Simonyi played as the show went to credits. Literary work \\" Rocking Toward a Free World: When the Stratocaster Beat the Kalashnikov \\" (Hatchette/Grand Central, 2019) a memoir about his childhood and youth, growing up behind the Iron Curtain with Western Rock and Roll music being his defining experience. The book, published in 2019, is a testament to the power of American and British Rock and Roll and how it became a tool to break the monopoly and the monotony of Marxist ideology \\"force fed\\" to the youths of Central and Eastern Europe by Soviet dominated authorities. Listening to Rock Music on Radio Free Europe, the Voice of America or Radio Luxemburg, the British pop radio-station, was his link to the West. \\"When I listened to that station, it was as if I had once again become one with my friends in the West. I closed my eyes and the border disappeared\\", he says in the book. Academia In November 2010, Ambassador Simonyi began his tour of American university and college centers. He focused his lectures on building transatlantic relationships through innovation. At his visit with Ohio University Global Leadership Center undergraduates, Simonyi described a situation where the world has, as a positive thing, become affixed to ideas based in American innovation. He warned that the day \\"a Facebook or prominent innovation\\" comes \\"from Beijing rather than America\\" will be the day the West knows it has allowed itself to slow. Simonyi was honored by Ohio University students and faculty for his contributions to international diplomacy. Retrieved 30 April 2012. In February 2012, Johns Hopkins University announced that Simonyi joined the University as the Managing Director of the Center for Transatlantic Relations. He remained at Johns Hopkins University until May 2018. Personal life In 1968 Simonyi started his own band, The Purple Generator, a blues trio, in Budapest, Hungary. He has said that rock and roll was a key factor to loosening the tight totalitarian grip behind the iron curtain. He played the electric guitar on an April 2007 episode of The Colbert Report. His Washington-based band the Coalition of the Willing has guitarist Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter (formerly Steely Dan and Doobie Brothers) on guitar, Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman on guitar, Ambassador Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Vershbow on drums, and Ambassador Lincoln P. Bloomfield, Jr. on bass. He appeared with GoodTime Charlie Lewis on Jerry Miller's (of Moby Grape) 2006 Best of Friends CD. He is married and has two children.

As the machine lights up, Dr. Adler reverts to Mystique and cackles as Warren screams in agony. Apocalypse appears and congratulates Mystique on finding such a great mutant to be his slave. Meanwhile, mutants on Muir Island are in an uproar about waiting for Dr. Adler's cure, desperately wanting to be normal. Professor X, Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Rogue watch as two mutants playing darts, a young man named Abraham Kieros and an old woman (Plague, one of the Morlocks seen in \\"Captive Hearts\\"), bicker about the cure. Other mutants, such as a young, anorexic girl named Autumn Rolfson, are beating themselves up inside. Suddenly, Warren walks in and explains that the cure really does work. Apocalypse, meanwhile, has already turned Warren into the Horseman of Death. Abraham, Plague, and Autumn all take the treatment, and become War, Pestilence, and Famine respectively. The X-Men, playing billiards, notice a peace conference when Apocalypse and his Horsemen attack. They destroy everything, tearing Paris apart and killing numerous people. Xavier tells the X-Men that this is something he has feared for some time; an incredibly powerful mutant whose very abilities have driven him completely mad. Professor X expresses his concern to the X-Men and send them to stop Apocalypse. He sends Rogue, however, back to Muir Island to talk to Dr. Adler. All across the globe, the Horsemen lay waste to the area around them. Famine attacks the crop fields of England, War attacks a military base, and Death destroys a dam. Rogue finds Dr. Adler and discovers that Dr. Adler is really Mystique, who spills her guts about Apocalypse's plans. She then shoots Rogue in the back and destroys the machine, so that the Horsemen could never be returned to their normal selves. Pestilence is causing a commotion elsewhere, attacking several soldiers and killing them with her plagues. The X-Men appear and battle her, able to knock her off her horse. The other Horsemen appear, battling the X-Men. Wolverine is able to damage War's horse, but not without being dropped from the sky. The Horsemen flee after being overwhelmed, and report back to Apocalypse in Stonehenge. Rogue finds Apocalypse and is nearly killed by his blasts. The X-Men arrive just in time to save Rogue and battle the Horsemen once more. Famine battles Storm, while Pestilence is easily defeated by Jean Grey. Rogue eventually grabs Archangel and absorbs his memory, sucking Apocalypse's power out of him. Archangel, appalled at what he has become, blasts the other Horsemen away. Apocalypse flees in a spaceship, and the diversion allows the other Horsemen to escape also. Rogue cowers in the corner, but Archangel helps her. Filled with guilt, Archangel flies off.

The aircraft crashed during approach to Lusaka Airport, Zambia, on 14 May 1977. All six occupants of the aircraft were killed. History of aircraft The aircraft was a Boeing 707-321C that first entered service with Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) in 1963. This aircraft was also the first convertible 707 built, featuring a large freight door on the left-hand side of the forward fuselage, that permitted the carriage of main deck cargo when configured as a freighter. Dan-Air acquired the aircraft in 1976. It was the fourth 707 the UK independentthe term \\"independent\\" in this context denotes private, generally unsubsidised UK airlines that were financially and operationally independent from the crown corporations, i.e. British European Airways, British Overseas Airways Corporation and British Airways (prior to privatisation) operated, as well as the type's second turbofan-powered and second convertible example in service with the airline. At the time of the accident it had flown about 47,000 hours.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, pp. 90, 231 History of flight The flight was a three- legged originating from London Heathrow Airport to Athens (Hellinikon Airport), which was uneventful; from Athens it then proceeded to Nairobi (Jomo Kenyatta International Airport). Departure from Nairobi for Lusaka on the final leg occurred as planned at 07:17, 14 May. The 707 cruised at flight level 310 for about two hours, after which it was cleared for descent to flight level 110. Flight level 110 was reached at approximately 09:23, and clearance was granted to begin descent towards a target of flight level 70. Just before 09:30, clearance to descend to was granted, and moments later the plane was cleared to make a visual approach to runway 10. A few minutes later, witnesses saw the entire right horizontal stabiliser and elevator assembly detach from the aircraft. The aircraft subsequently lost pitch control and entered a nose-dive from about to ground level, destroying the aircraft on impact. There were no survivors among the five crew members and one jumpseat passenger on board the aircraft. There were no other fatalities on the ground. The wreckage was located approximately from the runway. Investigation A full investigation was launched by the Zambian authorities and the investigation was then delegated to the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch. The conclusions made by that investigation are as follows: It was determined that the structure of the right horizontal stabiliser failed due to metal fatigue in the rear spar structure, and due to the lack of an adequate fail- safe structure or device should such an event occur. The investigation also identified deficiencies in the assessment of aircraft designs and their certification and in the way aircraft were inspected. Cause The Boeing 707 320/420 series had an enlarged horizontal stabiliser (tailplane) assembly compared to earlier 707 aircraft, and in the redesign the increased loads on the tailplane structure had been taken by replacing some of the aluminium skinning with stainless steel. In addition, the spar attachment fittings had been redesigned, making them both stronger and stiffer. This had the unforeseen effect of changing the way the tailplane structure handled gust loads, the stiffer fittings being no longer able to help in absorbing and transferring the stresses caused by gusts and other normal aerodynamic loads, the flexure (i.e., the bending loads) of the left and right horizontal stabilizers instead having to be carried by the stabiliser spars entirely by themselves. This led over time to fatigue cracking in the right horizontal stabiliser's rear spar, which, due to the concealed (internal) nature of the tailplane construction, was not noticed by maintenance engineers. The 707 had been designed to a 'fail-safe' philosophy, and failure of the tailplane rear spar had been calculated to be insufficient to cause the loss of the aircraft, the remaining front spar being sufficiently strong to enable the aircraft to land safely, the damage then being expected to be repaired before the aircraft was re-flown. However, the accident aircraft had developed a cracked rear right spar without the fault being detected due to its location within part of the structure not normally accessible during routine maintenance, and the aircraft had been flown for a considerable number of hours with the fault present. Over time the crack grew, until it was surmised, the damaged spar was no longer capable of carrying its designed load, whereupon the load was then taken over entirely by the front spar. The accident aircraft encountered several strong gusts during the approach immediately before the accident which, while not dangerous to a structurally sound Boeing 707, exceeded the load capable of being carried by the remaining intact spar on its own, leading to the spar eventually breaking and resulting in complete structural failure of the entire right horizontal stabiliser. Tests were conducted to determine whether or not the loss of a single stabilizer was a recoverable situation, and it was determined that recovery would have been possible with action on behalf of the pilots in the form of nose up trim. The wreckage recovered revealed that the elevator trim should have been sufficient to save the aircraft, but further analysis concluded that the failure of the stabilizer was violent enough to fracture the vertical trim jackscrew, which would have resulted in the remaining horizontal stabilizer pitching into a nose down trim position. The crack found in the failed stabiliser after the accident was thought by investigators unlikely to have been detectable using normal testing means, such as fluorescent dye. It was also thought that the crack had been present for at least 6,000 flight hours before the accident, and before the aircraft had been acquired by Dan-Air from Pan Am. Inspections of the Boeing 707-300 fleet, made as a result of the crash, found another 38 aircraft with similar cracks.\\"Ageing Airplane Rulemaking\\", Blake Cheney (Acting Manager, Domestic Regulations, Regulatory Standards, Aircraft Certification, Civil Aviation, Transport Canada) retrieved 28 August 2012 Notes and citations ;Notes ;Citations References * (includes picture of accident aircraft one year prior to the accident) * \\"Aircraft Accident Report No. 9/78\\", Air Accident Investigation Branch of the United Kingdom Department of Transport ** Report file (Archive) ** Appendices (Archive) * Detailed accident description * Inspection shortcomings contributed to Lusaka 707 fatigue accident, Air Transport, Flight International, 23 June 1979, p. 2247 (Archived 2009-09-03) * The Geriatric Jet Problem, Flight International, 22 October 1977, p. 1201 * The Geriatric Jet Problem ‚Äì Summary, Flight International, 22 October 1977, p. 1207 IAS Cargo Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Zambia Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by in-flight structural failure Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Boeing 707 Category:Dan-Air accidents and incidents Category:May 1977 events in Africa ","title":"1977 Dan-Air Boeing 707 crash"},{"id":"7114226","text":"The first Hastings Open Bowls Tournament was held in the summer of 1911 at the Central Cricket Ground (which is where today the Priory Meadow shopping centre stands) in Queens Road under the title of 'The Hastings & St Leonards Open Bowls and Quoits Tournament'. It was an annual three-day event and open to bona fide gentlemen amateur bowlers. The game of quoits gradually lost popularity and was subsequently discontinued as part of the competition. Notable events On Saturday 7 September 1912, the local newspaper The Hastings Observer published a change in the rules for the singles and pairs: \\"Last year singles competition was 15 points up and the nearest wood to count. This year both competitions will be 21 ends not points up and only woods within three feet of the jack to count. There will be an extra end in the case of a tie. In both competitions the players will have two bowls each.\\" An extract of the 1925 Tournament Committee's leaves one in no doubt that the tournament was \\"acknowledged to be the largest and most successful Open Bowling Tournament in the United Kingdom.\\" The tournament venue was later changed to its present location in White Rock Gardens where there were eight greens of which only four remain today. The Main Bowls Pavilion in the gardens, used as the tournament's control centre, was completely destroyed by fire in 1968 and subsequently rebuilt later in the same year. Between October 1999 and April 2000 the Pavilion was completely refurbished in a joint effort by members of White Rock and Rosemount bowls clubs and Hastings Borough Council. Additional toilet facilities, men's and ladies' changing rooms, a kitchen and a bar were added. The total cost of the work amounted to about ¬£18,000 and involved approximately 3,000 hours voluntary work by the bowlers. The building was formally re-opened on 1 May 2000. It is now managed by the Main Bowls Pavilion Company (PAVCO) which is made up from representatives from each of the above clubs. Up until 1937 only singles, pairs and rinks were played but in that year triples were introduced to take the place of rinks. Rinks were subsequently re-introduced, in addition to the other three competitions, in 1960. The total number of bowlers participating in 1937 amounted to a near record of 1843 being 629 singles, 295 pairs and 208 triples. This compared favourably with average annual entries between 1930 and 1936 of 1724. The duration of the tournament had by this time been extended to two weeks. Due to the falling number of competitors, the tournament was reduced to one week in 2010. The men's fours and triples along with the ladies' triples were discontinued and a mixed triples was introduced which is vied for along with the men's singles and pairs and the ladies' singles and pairs. The tournament still continues to this day, but with diminishing numbers in entries, its future is firmly in the balance. Numbers Average entries were: *1940s - 1688 *1950s - 1548 *1960s - 1724 *1970s - 1415 *1980s - 1136 *1990s - 1117 Since the turn of the millennium entries have been. For the year *2000 - 716 *2001 - 676 *2002 - 539 *2003 - 747 *2004 - 733 *2005 - 696 *2006 - 526 Prize money Total prize money in 1923 amounted to 58 Guineas for the singles, 32 guineas for the pairs and 32 Guineas for the Rinks. The total prize money today is ¬£2000. Amalgamation With the significant drop in entries at the start of the millennium, in common with other Open Tournaments, it was decided to amalgamate the Hastings Ladies' and Men's Opens. To this end, a General Meeting was held on 30 January 2003 to give effect to these proposals and accordingly, a combined tournament was formed for both ladies and men called the \\"Hastings Open Bowls Tournament.\\" A new Committee was formed made up of ladies and men and a new constitution adopted. Hastings is the first town in East Sussex to stage a mixed open tournament.

It was where the Crieff Junction Railway, Crieff & Methven Railway and the Comrie, St Fillans & Lochearnhead Railway met. The first terminus in Crieff was opened in 1856 as the terminus of the line from Crieff Junction, later rebuilt as Gleneagles Station. In 1866 the construction of a further line out to Methven meant that there was now a connection all the way to Perth. This station closed when a replacement station was built immediately to the north of it, the old station being repurposed as the goods yard for the new station. The new station was a large station built to the specifications of the Caledonian Railway with two platforms and three tracks which ran through the station with the central track being a goods line. It had a signal box at either end, the western one controlling the route to Comrie and the larger, eastern box controlling access to the goods yard, the locomotive sheds and the tracks to Gleneagles and Perth. Passenger services to Perth and beyond Comrie to Balquidder ceased in 1951 but the station remained open to goods and for the stub to Comrie plus the Gleneagles line. The station closed to passengers on 6 July 1964 with the closure of the lines to Comrie and Gleneagles. Freight continued on the Almond Valley line until September 1967 and the first Crieff Station continued to be used as a goods yard until then. The site of the station is now occupied by the Crieff Community Hospital while the former goods yard now houses the Crieff Medical Centre. Immediately west of the station site was a shallow cutting which has now been filled in to create a large car park and an adjacent supermarket.

Bashar was of Persian origin; his grandfather was taken as a captive to Iraq, but his father was a freedman (mawla) of the Uqayl tribe. Some Arab scholars considered Bashar the first \\"modern\\" poet, and one of the pioneers of badi' in Arabic literature. It is believed that the poet exerted a great influence on the subsequent generation of poets. Life Bashar was blind from birth and said to have been ugly, in part a result of smallpox scarring on his face. He grew up in the rich cultural environment of Basra and showed his poetic talents at an early age. Bashar fell foul of some religious figures, such as Malik ibn Dinar and al-Hasan al-Basri, who condemned his poetry for its licentiousness. He exchanged Hija with several poets. Being anti-Mu'tazili, he criticized Wasil ibn Ata, who by some accounts is considered the founder of the Mutazilite school of Islamic thought. After the Abbasids built Baghdad, Bashar moved there from Basra in 762. Bashar became associated with the caliph al-Mahdi. Due to his libertinism, al-Mahdi ordered him not to write further love poetry. Bashar quickly violated the ban. Death Multiple stories of Bashar's end exist. Ammiel Alcalay in 1993 argued that Bashar was condemned as a heretic and executed by al-Mahdi in 783. Hugh Kennedy, on the other hand, relates al- Tabari's account that Ya'qub ibn Dawud had Bashar murdered in the marshes between Basra and Baghdad. Style Most of his Hija' (satires) are in traditional style, while his fakhr expresses his Shu'ubi sentiments, vaunting the achievements of his Persian ancestors and denigrating the \\"uncivilized Arabs\\". The following couplet from Bashar demonstrates his admiration for Zoroastrianism (the religion of his Persian ancestors) over Islam by preferring prostration (sajdah) towards fire (Shaitan like other jinn was created from smokeless fire) in lieu of soil (Adam's origin). ÿßŸÑÿßÿ±ÿ∂ ŸÖÿ∏ŸÑŸÖÿ© Ÿà ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ± ŸÖÿ¥ÿ±ŸÇÿ© ŸàÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ± ŸÖÿπÿ®ŸàÿØÿ© ŸÖÿ∞ŸÉÿßŸÜÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ± See also *Arabic literature *Ibn Gharsiya - Shu'ubi poet.

The school is also open to students of the extended french program from Bolton Academics Robert F. Hall requires students to go through four or five years of schooling. During these four or five years, a student must accumulate 30 credits to graduate. A credit may be gained by completing a course successfully with a passing mark of 50% or higher. Extracurricular activities There are multiple student groups, school clubs and sports teams that are currently active at Robert F. Hall. The school implemented the Link Crew program, which gives freshmen a chance to meet with senior students for some peer guidance. Robert F. Hall has a well formed student council consisting of an average of 10 students per grade and three teacher supervisors. Executive positions include, Secretary, Treasurer, Communications Officer, President, Vice president, and or co-presidents. Student Council meets after school weekly to discuss current issues in the school and organize fun themed, or seasonal events for students. Presidents are chosen through vote every May during their spirit week. Athletic Council is similar to student council however fund raises through buy-ins where student purchase tickets to view their fellow students play and compete against other schools in sports tournaments. Buy-ins often occur for football games over any other sport. Athletic Council also holds inter mural sports for students that occur after school where students make teams of 10 and compete against other teams in soccer. The badminton tournament is a school favorite where a student teams up with a teacher of the school and compete against another team in order to win. AV Crew is a group of students that set up and run the technical equipment for all school events such as assemblies, presentations and awards. Eco Crew is a club that welcomes members anytime of the year and were successful in getting the school recognized regionally for eco efforts in 2013. Helping out the Community with Hall Every year link crew and supervisors organize an introduction to give the freshmen students a taste of being a student at Hall. For the past few years Link Crew, supervisors and of course the grade 9s have had their retreat at Teen Ranch where students get to participate in fun activities such as horse back riding. Students end off the night with a bonfire where link leaders and the first years get to tell ghost stories and show case their talents. Student Council has been organizing the Terry Fox run at Hall for a long time. One day during the last week of school in September where students walk the local trail to honor the accomplishments and efforts made by Terry. In 2013 students donated a total of $4704 to the Terry Fox Foundation. Relay for Life was an overnight event that has inspired hundreds of people to fight back against cancer. In the years that Relay has ran at the school students have raised approximately $195,000 for the Canadian Cancer Society. It was a night where everyone comes together to raise awareness and honour loved ones who have passed away. Relay for Life was cancelled due to several abuses that occurred during the 2017 school year, and the school is currently searching for alternatives.

This disorder typically first manifests itself between the ages of 12 and 18 with sudden brief involuntary single or multiple episodes of muscle(s) contractions caused by an abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. These events typically occur either early in the morning or upon sleep deprivation. Additional clinical presentations include seizures with either a motor (tonic-clonic seizure) or nonmotor (absence seizure) generalized onset. Genetic studies have demonstrated several loci for JME and identified mutations in 4 genes. Signs and symptoms The characteristic signs of JME are brief episodes of involuntary muscle twitching. These are brief episodes of involuntary muscle contractions occurring early in the morning or shortly before falling asleep. They are more common in the arms than in the legs and may result in dropping objects. Myoclonic jerks may as well appear in clusters. Other seizure types include those with either motor or non motor generalized onset. The onset of symptoms is generally around age 10-16 although some patients can present in their 20s or even early 30s. The myoclonic jerks generally precede the generalized tonic-clonic seizures by several months. Sleep deprivation is a major factor in triggering seizures in JME patients. Cause Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is an inherited genetic syndrome, but the way in which this disorder is inherited is unclear. Frequently (17-49%) those with JME have relatives with a history of epileptic seizures. There is also a higher rate of females showing JME symptoms than males. The majority of JME cases have an onset in early childhood to puberty. Pathophysiology CACNB4 CACNB4 is a gene that encodes the calcium channel Œ≤ subunit protein. Œ≤ subunits are important regulators of calcium channel current amplitude, voltage dependence, and also regulate channel trafficking. In mice, a naturally occurring null mutation leads to the \\"lethargic\\" phenotype. This is characterized by ataxia and lethargic behaviour at early stages of development followed within days by the onset of both focal motor seizures as well as episodes of behavioural immobility which correlates with patterns of cortical spike and wave discharges at the EEG A premature- termination mutation R482X was identified in a patient with JME while an additional missense mutation C104F was identified in a German family with generalized epilepsy and praxis ‚Äì induced seizures. The R482X mutation results in increased current amplitudes and an accelerated fast time constant of inactivation. Whether these modest functional differences may be in charge of JME remains to be established. Calcium channel Œ≤4 subunit (CACNB4) is not strictly considered a putative JME gene because its mutation did not segregate in affected family members, and it was found in only one member of a JME family from Germany, and it has not been replicated. GABRA1 GABRA1 is a gene that encodes for an Œ± subunit of the GABA A receptor protein, which encodes one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors. There is one known mutation in this gene that is associated with JME, A322D, which is located in the third segment of the protein/sub>. This missense mutation results in channels with reduced peak GABA-evoked currents. Furthermore, the presence of such mutation alter the composition and reduce the expression of wild type GABAA receptors. GABRD GABRD encodes the Œ¥ subunit of the GABA receptor, which is an important constituent of the GABAA receptor mediating tonic inhibition in neurons (extrasynaptic GABA receptors, i.e. receptors that are localized outside of the synapse). Among the mutations that have been reported in this in this gene, one (R220H) has been identified in a small family with JME. This mutation affects GABAergic transmission by altering the surface expression of the receptor as well as reducing the channel ‚Äì opening duration. Myoclonin1/EFHC1 The final known associated gene is EFHC1. Myoclonin1/EFHC1 encodes for a protein that has been known to play a wide range of roles from cell division, neuroblast migration and synapse/dendrite formation. EFHC1 is expressed in many tissues, including the brain, where it is localized to the soma and dendrites of neurons, particularly the hippocampal CA1 region, pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex, and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. There are four JME-causing mutations discovered (D210N, R221H, F229L and D253Y). The mutations do not seem to alter the ability of the protein to colocalize with centrosomes and mitotic spindles but induce mitotic spindle defects. Moreover, the mutations impact radial and tangential migration during brain development. As such a theory has been put forward that JME may be the result of a brain developmental disorder. Other loci Three SNP alleles in BRD2, Cx-36 and ME2 and microdeletions in 15q13.3, 15q11.2 and 16p.13.11 also contribute risk to JME. Diagnosis Diagnosis is typically made based on patient history. The physical examination is usually normal. The primary diagnosis for JME is a good knowledge of patient history and the neurologist's familiarity with the myoclonic jerks, which are the hallmark of the syndrome. Additionally, an electroencephalogram (EEG), will indicate a characteristic pattern of waves and spikes associated with the syndrome such as generalized 4‚Äì6 Hz polyspike and slow wave discharges. These discharges may be evoked by photic stimulation (blinking lights) and/or hyperventilation. Both a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) and computed tomography scan (CT scan) generally appear normal in JME patients. However a number of quantitative MRI studies have reported focal or regional abnormalities of the subcortical and cortical grey matter, particularly the thalamus and frontal cortex, in JME patients. Management The most effective anti-epileptic medication for JME is valproic acid (Depakote). Due to valproic acid's high incidence of fetal malformations, women of child-bearing age are started on alternative medications such as Lamotrigine, levetiracetam. Carbamazepine may aggravate genetic generalized epilepsies and as such its use should be avoided in JME. Treatment is lifelong. Patients should be warned to avoid sleep deprivation. History The first citation of JME was made in 1857 when Th√©odore Herpin described a 13-year-old boy suffering from myoclonic jerks, which progressed to tonic- clonic seizures three months later. In 1957, Janz and Christian published a journal article describing several patients with JME. The name Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy was proposed in 1975 and adopted by the International League Against Epilepsy. Culture Stand-up comedian Maisie Adam has JME and her award-winning show \\"Vague\\" (2018) discussed it. The 2018 documentary film Separating The Strains dealt with the use of CBD oil to treat symptoms of JME. Currently, no scientific evidence exist to support the use of CBD oil to treat symptoms of JME.

Club career France Born in Limoges, Puygrenier began his career at Stade Rennais, Puygrenier made his Ligue 1 debut in the 4‚Äì1 defeat at Lyon in 2003. He started the next two matches, but these were to be his last games for the club before joining Nancy on loan for the 2003‚Äì04 season. After playing 27 games in Ligue 2 that season, Puygrenier spent a further season on loan at Nancy, with 20 appearances as the club won promotion. League rules prevented him from staying on loan at a rival Ligue 1 club so he was signed permanently in 2005. Puygrenier scored his only league goal to date on 28 August in the 6‚Äì0 win over his old club. He also scored Nancy's opener in the 3‚Äì0 win over Feyenoord in the UEFA Cup. He was voted Fans' Player of the Year for 2006‚Äì07, and named in the Ligue 1 2007‚Äì08 team of the year the following season, where he helped Nancy stay unexpectedly in the top 3 for most of the season. Zenit Saint Petersburg On 31 July 2008, he signed a four-year contract with Zenit Saint Petersburg. He took part in the team's victory in the 2008 UEFA Super Cup, but struggled to hold down a regular first-team berth. As Portuguese centre-halves Bruno Alves and Fernando Meira joined the club, it became increasingly evident that Puygrenier's future lay outside of Saint Petersburg, and a string of loan deals followed - firstly to Bolton Wanderers and then two spells at AS Monaco in Ligue 1. After failing to impress in France, Monaco declined the option to recruit Puygrenier permanently, and he returned to Zenit who made it known that he was instantly available for transfer, even being described as 'definitely a mistake of our scouts' by general director Maxim Mitrofanov, who also criticised the defender for refusing to lower his wage demands in order to engineer a move away from the club despite having no prospects of achieving any playing time and not being considered a part of the Zenit squad by manager Luciano Spalletti. Loan to Bolton Wanderers In January 2009, he joined Bolton Wanderers on loan for the rest of the season. His one goal for Bolton came on 31 January, in a 3‚Äì2 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur. It was Bolton's 4000th goal in the top division of English football. Loan to Monaco On 14 July 2009, Puygrenier agreed to a loan deal to AS Monaco. Nancy Puygrenier moved to AS Nancy midway through the 2011‚Äì2012 league campaign. Karab√ºkspor He signed for Turkish team Kardemir Karab√ºkspor in July 2013, agreeing to a two-year deal. Auxerre In July 2014 he signed a one-year contract with French team AJ Auxerre.

Biography Born at the village of Maskan (in the contemporary Gurage Zone), Desta Damtew was the second son of Fitawrari Damtew Ketena. His older brother was Abebe Damtew. In 1896, Fitawrari Damtew Ketena was killed at the Battle of Adwa. As boys, Lij Desta Damtew and his brother Lij Abebe Damtew served at the Imperial Palace in Addis Ababa as pages to Emperor Menelik II and Empress Taitu Bitul. Desta Damtew went on to serve in the Dowager Empress Taitu's household at the Palace on Mt. Entoto after the death of Menelik II. In 1916, Desta Damtew supported Tafari Makonnen against Lij Iyasu. Tafari Makonnen was the future Emperor Haile Selassie I. Lij Iyasu was deposed but escaped. In 1920, Desta Damtew was in the party that captured Lij Iyasu.Haile Selassie, p. 25 In 1924, Desta Damtew married Tafari Makonnen's daughter Leult Tenagnework Haile Selassie. They had four daughters and two sons.Mockler, p. 390 Anthony Mockler describes Desta Damtew as \\"something of an eccentric among Ethiopian nobles\\", who had run away in his twenties to become a monk at Debre Libanos, as well as having a reputation \\"as an entrepreneur and an enfant terrible.\\" Mockler continues that Ras Desta \\"had as little taste as the young progressives of inferior birth for the traditional amusements of the Amhara aristocracy, the feasting, the horsemanship, the boasting and the drunkenness.\\"Mockler, p. 90 According to his obituary in The Times he was \\"a tall and princelike figure, ascetically handsome in face and reserved in manner. He had the soft, almost inaudible voice of the aristocratic Amhara.

In January 1936, he was defeated by the Italian General Rodolfo Graziani at the Battle of Ganale Dorya. Desta retreated back to his administrative center at Irgalem, where with the help of Dejazmach Gabremariam, he reorganized his surviving supporters to resist the Italian advance.Mockler, p. 95 Desta continued to resist the Italians after the Emperor left the country. In 1936, after the end of the rainy season, Italian General Carlo Geloso, who had been appointed governor of the Italian province of Galla-Sidamo, advanced from the north to dislodge Ras Desta and Dejazmach Gabremariam. However, by the end of October, Geloso had not advanced very far or effectively. It was not until a month later when a second Italian column advanced from the south through the Wadara Forest that Ras Desta at last left Irgalem, which was occupied 1 December. With Dejazmach Gabremariam, Dejazmach Beyene Merid (Shum of Bale Province), and a dwindling number of soldiers, for the next few months Ras Desta eluded the Italians until they were trapped near Lake Shala in the Battle of Gogetti and annihilated. Wounded, Ras Desta managed to escape, only to be caught and executed near his birthplace.Mockler, p. 172f Following the liberation of Ethiopia from Italian occupation in 1941, the remains of Ras Desta Damtew were disinterred from the grave they were buried in by the Italians and moved to the Imperial family tombs in the crypt of Holy Trinity Cathedral.

The story was inspired by the legend of the Flying Dutchman. In this episode, a spaceship crew discovers a wrecked replica of their ship with their own dead bodies inside. Opening narration Plot The Space Cruiser E-89, crewed by Captain Paul Ross, Lt. Ted Mason and Lt. Mike Carter, is on a mission to analyze new worlds and discover if they are suitable for colonization. While orbiting a planet, Mason sees a metallic glint in the landscape. He conjectures that this might be a sign of alien life, but the pragmatic Captain Ross disagrees. Nevertheless, the Cruiser prepares to land next to the mysterious object. After landing, the men find that the gleaming comes from the wreck of a ship exactly like their own. Inside the craft, they discover their own lifeless bodies. Mason and Carter go numb with shock. Ross, struggling for an explanation, decides they have bent time in such a way as to get a glimpse of the future. He says to avoid their fate they must refrain from taking off again. Mason and Carter fiercely object to this plan, especially once they find that atmospheric interference prevents their contacting anyone for help, and that the frigid nighttime temperatures of the planet will force them to rapidly exhaust the ship's energy reserves on heat. Ross pulls rank to make them comply. While looking out the viewport, Carter is transported back to a country lane on Earth. There he encounters people from his past. He runs to the house that he and his wife shared, and finds it empty except for a telegram notifying her that he has died in the line of duty. Carter is wrenched from his vision by Ross; as Carter describes what he has just experienced, he realizes that the people he encountered are dead. Ross insists it was a delusion. The two then find Mason has vanished. He is having an emotional reunion with his wife and child. When Ross pulls him back, Mason is enraged and wants to be allowed back, maintaining that his encounter with his family was real. From Mason's pocket, Ross pulls a newspaper clipping about the death of Mason's wife and child. The captain then posits a new theory about what is going on: The planet is inhabited by telepathic aliens who are using illusions to keep them from reporting back to Earth, thus averting colonization of their home. Ross says that if they take the E-89 back up to space, that should break the spell. The men take E-89 back in orbit. Mason and Carter admit that Ross may have been right about the aliens. Ross then insists on landing the craft again to gather foreign samples to bring back to Earth. When they land again, the wreck of their craft is still present. The successive disproving of Ross's theories, combined with an intuitive knowledge of their condition, brings Mason and Carter to the realization that they already crashed and are dead. Their afterlife visits were real, and it is their current situation which is the illusion. Ross refuses to accept this. He rejects his crew's pleas to be allowed to embrace their deaths and be reunited with their loved ones, and says that they will \\"go over it again and again\\" until he figures out an alternative explanation. In compliance with Ross's order, the men are returned to the moment where Mason first spotted the E-89's wreckage, doomed to relive the past several hours of investigation over and over. Closing narration Production notes The model of the hovering spaceship is that of a C-57D Cruiser, a leftover prop from MGM's 1956 film Forbidden Planet. The crashed ship was a realistically painted model/set. The prop was also used in the 1960 Twilight Zone episodes \\"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\\" and \\"Third from the Sun\\".

She made her first appearance on screen during the episode airing on 1 December 2006 and introduced as the wife of Paul Connor (Sean Gallagher). This was King's second role in the soap as she previously played Mrs. Fanshaw for one episode in 2004. King appeared in her 1,000th episode as Carla on 22 May 2015. Carla has been referred to as \\"the new Elsie Tanner\\". She is also known for her long- standing on-off relationship with Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) which has been likened to the relationship of \\"Taylor and Burton\\" by producer Iain McLeod. King was off-screen from February 2009 until October 2009 due to her maternity leave. King later took a 6-month break in May 2012 and was offscreen from 16 July to 10 December. King quit the role in 2015 and her final scenes aired on 26 May 2016. The following year, producer Kate Oates reintroduced Carla and she returned on-screen on 22 December 2017. Carla has had relationships with Liam Connor (Rob James-Collier), Trevor Dean (Steve Jackson), Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel) and been married four times to Paul Connor, Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien), Peter Barlow and Nick Tilsley (Ben Price). Her storylines include being kidnapped in her factory by Tony and escaping when the building explodes (known as Siege Week), battling alcoholism, drink driving and running over Stella Price (Michelle Collins), being raped by Frank, attempting to commit suicide, becoming a suspect in Frank's murder, an affair and marriage with Peter, learning that Peter has been having an affair with Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan), suffering a miscarriage because of the stress, escaping a fire at her flat started by her and her brother Rob Donovan's arch-enemy Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), coping when people blame her for starting the fire, developing a gambling addiction, learning that family friend Johnny Connor (Richard Hawley) is actually her biological father, being blackmailed by Tracy and later trying to kill her which leads to two car crashes on the street, suffering from kidney failure and undergoing a kidney transplant with her half-brother Aidan Connor (Shayne Ward), dealing with Aidan's suicide, a feud with Alya Nazir (Sair Khan) over the ownership of the Underworld factory, attempting to frame Abi Franklin (Sally Carman) for arson, becoming a public enemy through her workaholism which leads to the factory roof fatally collapsing and her subsequent psychotic episode. Storylines 2006‚Äì2016 Carla arrives and is furious to discover that her husband Paul had spent all the money she needed to start her children's clothing business, though to make more money she manipulated fellow factory workers Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu) and Joanne Jackson (Zaraah Abrahams) into working weekends, early mornings and late nights in order to raise money for her business. However, Kelly and Joanne eventually refuse to continue working for Carla as they became isolated from their friends and lack in freedom. Carla begins dating catalogue boss Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien). Carla and Tony's relationship makes Liam jealous. During an argument, they kiss, confusing them both. Carla tries to stop Liam marrying Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie), so the two women feud. She ends things with Tony by admitting her feelings for Liam; however, Liam marries Maria so she and Tony reconcile; Tony proposes and Carla accepts. In May 2008, Carla supports Liam through the stillbirth of his and Maria's son, and the two sleep together. Carla's personal assistant, Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan), records the pair kissing on her mobile phone. Carla threatens Rosie to dispose of the evidence. In June 2008, Carla blackmails Liam into selling his share of the factory to Tony by threatening to tell Maria about their one-night stand. In September, she invests in Tom Kerrigan (Philip McGinley) and Liam's new T-shirt business, but they agree to keep this from Tony and Maria. Tony discovers the one-night stand after viewing Rosie's video footage. Carla sleeps with Liam again prior to her wedding to Tony, and is prepared to cancel the wedding. However, she changes her mind upon discovering that Maria is pregnant. Carla is devastated by Liam's death in a hit-and-run incident orchestrated by Tony. Needing to get away, Carla postpones the wedding and goes to Los Angeles. She returns married to Tony. Tony later confesses to Carla for being responsible for Liam's death and a horrified Carla flees to Los Angeles. When Carla returns, she is contacted by the police after Tony confesses. Carla is attacked by thugs which break into her home. Robbie Sloan (James Fleet), Tony's cellmate, is released from prison and Tony fakes a heart attack to get out of prison. Robbie bails him out of the ambulance and they go to Weatherfield, intending to kill Carla. Robbie tricks Carla into entering the factory alone with him and holds her at gunpoint. After forcing her to evacuate the building, he leaves her bound and gagged in her office while he lures Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) to the factory, who he also holds hostage. Tony appears, removes the silver duct tape from Carla's mouth, and shoots Robbie dead. He intends to burn the factory to the ground to kill Carla and Hayley, but Maria interrupts and he refuses to let her leave. Carla orders Maria to leave; she escapes. Carla manages to convince Tony to free Hayley. Tony later sets the factory on fire with petrol, whereby Carla manages to untie herself and after a struggle, she shoots Tony in the arm. She manages to flee the burning factory, however, Tony is killed when the building explodes. Carla returns to Weatherfield and is shocked when her business partner, Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), sets up a rival factory underneath the viaduct, and refuses to work with her, but before long, Underworld is eventually repaired. Carla later invites her boyfriend, Trevor Dean (Steve Jackson) to become a trainee manager in the factory, much to Nick's annoyance. Trevor finds working in the office difficult, however, and punches Nick as Carla watches on. Nick decides to leave the factory and demands that Carla buys his shares back which cost ¬£150,000, while Trevor leaves her to reunite with Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle). Carla begins drinking heavily, and is stopped by Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) getting into her car. Peter decides to support her as he is also a recovering alcoholic and understands her. After being arrested for drink-driving and being collected from the police station by Peter, Carla confesses her feelings for him. Although he admits he is attracted to her, he remains faithful to Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), his girlfriend. When Nick decides to set up a wine bar on Viaduct Street, he pressures Carla into giving him the money for his share, and she eventually remortgages her flat to get the money. Michelle later gives Carla a new idea for a product she could create in the factory. When Carla's buyer loves the idea, Carla offers Michelle a job in the office. In July 2011, Carla spends the night with her client Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel). Carla begins dating Frank, and ignores Maria when she tells her that he sexually assaulted her. Frank and Carla get engaged, however when meeting his parents Anne (Gwen Taylor) and Sam Foster (Paul Clayton), she becomes intoxicated, arguing with Frank and Anne. She then gets in her car with Frank and drives off, running over Leanne's mother Stella Price (Michelle Collins) and crashing into Peter's bookies. Frank switches places with Carla, who is unconscious, and lies that he was driving. The night before the wedding, Carla tells Frank she cannot marry him because she is in love with Peter, so Frank angrily rapes Carla. She rings Maria, who phones the police and Frank is arrested. He is released on bail, providing that he does not approach Carla or the factory. He threatens Carla, trying to make her drop the charges but she refuses, so he plans to ruin Underworld. Carla struggles to cope and becomes more dependent on alcohol, attending meetings with Peter; they begin an affair. She attempts to commit suicide by overdosing on pills, but phones Peter, who then phones an ambulance. Carla survives and agrees to begin counselling. Carla is stunned when Stella confesses that she too was raped when she was younger, and reveals that she has never told anyone about her assault. Carla's erratic behaviour at the factory, however, quickly causes many of her clients to withdraw their orders and soon her employees find themselves with no work. As the business starts to haemorrhage money, Carla is forced to sack Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly), Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) and Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor). While Becky and Eileen understand, Sally is livid and demands a reason. Carla explains that Sally, unlike many of the other workers, is in a comfortable financial situation due to her ex-husband, Kevin Webster's (Michael Le Vell), large lottery win. Frank outwits Carla by employing Sally as a supervisor at his own factory. The factory is nearly bankrupted and Carla is unable to pay any due wages, causing the entire workforce to go on strike, with some defecting to Frank's factory. As Carla reaches the depths of her despair, Michelle returns and sends Carla away on holiday. In December 2011, Peter starts drinking again. Carla goes to Peter's flat after hearing from Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) that he has taken a bottle of vodka. Peter tries to kiss Carla several times, but although she loves him, she reluctantly pulls away because of Leanne. Peter goes to leave, however, stays and sleeps with Carla, promising to leave Leanne for him. Carla spends the night and next day with Peter before he goes back to tell Leanne that their marriage is over. However, he does not, which leads to Carla feeling rejected. He is persistent and they eventually meet at Carla's flat, where they decide to reignite their affair until Peter is ready to tell Leanne. They later decide to do this after Frank's trial, since Frank was claiming as part of his defence that Carla and Peter were having an affair and plotting to falsely accuse him of rape to get rid of him. Peter and Carla are almost caught on several occasions, and Frank decides to hire a private investigator to follow Peter in the hope of catching him with Carla. The weekend before the trial, Peter arranges for them to go to a hotel in Chester, where the investigator takes pictures of them kissing outside. Peter is forced to confess to the affair when Anne, Frank's mother, hands over the photographs to Leanne in the public gallery. He comforts Carla briefly, before finding Leanne. The next day, he tells Carla, before she gives evidence against Frank, that he has left Leanne for her. Afterwards, Peter finds himself attempting to cope with his son Simon Barlow (Alex Bain), who, devastated over Leanne's departure, blames Carla and begins misbehaving for them. Carla overhears many people gossiping about her, and Stella bars her and Peter from The Rovers Return Inn. Frank offers Carla ¬£50,000 to buy her share of Underworld; she initially refuses but eventually accepts when Frank's \\"lawyer\\" Jenny Sumner (Niky Wardley) offers to double his money - Jenny is secretly Frank's girlfriend, and part of Frank's plan to con Carla. Carla is furious when Frank reveals his plan; it is already too late as she has signed the forms. Frank soon makes himself an endless list of enemies, and Carla goes to confront him at Underworld, where he admits he raped her and taunts her that he overpowered her easily. Later that night, Frank is found dead in the factory by Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) and Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh), with Sally kneeling beside him with her hands covered in blood. Several residents are in the frame for Frank's murder, including Carla, Peter, Michelle, Sally and Kevin. The whiskey bottle used to kill Frank is found by Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), and he hands it to the police. Carla's fingerprints are on the bottle and she is arrested for murder but is later released without charge. Peter confesses to Frank's murder to protect Carla, but he is eliminated when a colleague of Peter's reveals that he was at his house when Frank died. It is eventually proven that Frank raped Carla when Sally reveals that he confessed it to her. Anne attacks Carla and accuses her of stealing the contract, when it was, in fact, Michelle, and Anne is warned to stay away from Carla. The police continue with their investigation, and it is revealed that Anne murdered Frank after she overheard him taunting Carla about getting away with raping her. Anne threatens Carla with a knife, before breaking down in tears and being arrested. In April 2012, Carla is informed by Frank's solicitor that Frank has left her his 40% share of the factory to her in his will, changing it when they were engaged and never changing it back; making her the sole owner of Underworld. Carla supports Peter as he begins a custody battle against Leanne for Simon; he loses in June 2012 and Leanne wins custody. As a result, Peter begins drinking again, splitting up with Carla after a drunken row. Meanwhile, Carla's brother Rob arrives after being released from prison and begins helping her run Underworld. Carla later decides to run away with Peter after he takes Simon without Leanne's consent, however, she can see that Simon would rather be with Leanne, so Peter and Carla then leave without Simon. Carla and Peter return December 2012, just as Leanne is due to fly to Las Vegas to marry Nick. Peter is thrilled to see Simon but after Carla and Leanne get into a physical fight outside the factory, Carla admits she is struggling with being back in Weatherfield; they agree to leave again. However, Peter later admits that he cannot leave Simon again, so Carla leaves for Los Angeles alone. Carla later surprises Peter by returning on Christmas Eve, saying she could not be without him, unaware that Peter has declared his love for Leanne. Carla is furious to learn that Rob has been altering the accounts for the factory. She sacks him and he sets up his own business, stealing Carla's clients and orders. Realising that she cannot beat Rob's tricks to win over her clients, she reluctantly offers him a share of the factory. However, Carla puts him in charge of packing, angering Rob. He gives his ex girlfriend, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), a job in packing and she convinces him to pretend the van has been robbed whilst transporting expensive material, which they secretly sell on to another company. What Rob and Tracy are unaware of, however, is that Carla knows what they have done and asks a friend to claim to be interested in buying the material. An agreement is reached and Rob takes the material to the chosen location, only to be greeted by Carla and Peter. Tracy is sacked and Rob is forced to sell his share to Carla in return for her not going to the police. Peter's bookies begins to struggle financially. Carla is initially unaware of this, until Michelle tells her about Peter offering risky odds that could potentially bankrupt him. Peter accepts a large bet from Rob, including one that Peter cannot pay when Rob wins. This forces Peter to close his shop and allow Rob and Tracy to set up their own business. Carla gives Peter a share in the factory and he works in the office with her and Michelle, however, this angers Michelle, so she quits. Carla accompanies Hayley to the hospital for a scan, where she is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Throughout Hayley's illness, she confides in Carla, who becomes protective of her. Carla and Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) find Hayley deceased on her bed with her husband, Roy Cropper (David Neilson). Carla then supports Roy as he grieves for Hayley, and is shocked to learn that Hayley committed suicide. Roy and Carla subsequently become good friends. Carla and Peter hire Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) as a babysitter for Simon. Carla and Peter get married in December 2013, just as Rob discovers that Peter is having an affair with Tina. Tina tries to persuade Peter to leave Weatherfield with her. He agrees, although he feels conflicted, wanting to remain with Weatherfield with Carla. During an argument with Rob and Tracy in The Rovers, Carla announces that she is pregnant just as Tina arrives to collect Peter. Tina storms out, swiftly followed by Peter. They have an almighty argument, ending in Tina scratching Peter across his face. Peter leaves, as Rob visits Tina and attacks her, telling her not to tell Carla about her affair with Peter. Unknown to Rob, Peter tells Carla about the affair. Tina tries to escape Rob, leading to the balcony of the building yard. A scuffle ensues and as Rob pushes Tina; she loses her balance and falls from the balcony, plummeting onto the cobbles below. Rob thinks Tina is dead and leaves the flat, before hearing Tina's groans and realises she is still alive. When Tina reveals that she will lie to the police that Rob intentionally tried to kill her, Rob picks up a metal pipe and brutally beats Tina. Meanwhile, Carla is furious about Peter's affair and storms out into a busy pub, shouting that she wants to \\"kill\\" Tina. She is restrained by Michelle but eventually leaves the pub. Carla goes to Tina's flat and finds her seriously injured at the bottom of the balcony, and is seen by Leanne and Kal Nazir (Jimi Mistry), and soon finds herself prime suspect. She is arrested due to her fingerprints being on the weapon but later released without charge. At first, it is an assault investigation, but when Tina later dies from her injuries in hospital, it turns into a murder investigation. Carla confides in Roy repeatedly and slaps Peter when he tries to talk to her. Her stress finally catches up with her and she collapses in the street when Rob and Peter are fighting. She is rushed to the hospital, where she is told that she has suffered a miscarriage. Carla struggles to cope with her miscarriage and gets drunk to drown her sorrows. When Rob confesses to Tina's murder to Carla, she fights with him and ultimately chooses to tell the police; Rob is arrested and charged with Tina's murder. From this, Carla begins an intense feud with Tracy. In January 2015, Carla and her staff are involved in a minibus crash while on their way to collect a fashion award. When the minibus crashes, Carla becomes wedged in between the driver's seat and the passenger seat. Tracy notices Carla is still trapped inside and climbs into the wreckage to retrieve her. Carla has a broken leg from the accident and thanks Tracy for saving her. After hearing that Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) is selling her share of The Rovers, Carla offers to buy her half so that Michelle and Steve would still be able to live and work there. However, nobody is aware that Tracy and Liz's partner, Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard), whom Tracy is having an affair with, are attempting to con Liz, Steve and Michelle out of the pub so that they can buy it. On the day of Steve and Michelle's wedding day in May 2015, Liz confides in Carla, revealing that Tony and Tracy's affair, and that they were conning her out of The Rovers. Carla offers to look after Tracy's daughter and Liz's granddaughter, Amy (Elle Mulvaney) for the night, and confronts Tracy in the pub toilets, where Carla gives Tracy some harsh home truths. Later that night, Tracy steals the keys to Carla's flat at Victoria Court and lights a candle. She places the candle under a lampshade, and after spotting Carla asleep on the sofa, she contemplates killing her with a large ornament. After hearing Amy, Tracy quickly leaves, unaware that the lampshade has caught fire from the lit candle. When the fire is raging through the flat, Carla collapses from smoke inhalation and desperately tries to call Amy. Leanne breaks into the flat and pulls Carla out of the building. After she gets her breath back, Carla reveals that Amy is still trapped inside, so Leanne and Kal run back in to save her. Kal saves Leanne and Amy, before Carla and the other residents watch in horror as the building explodes, killing Kal. Factory worker Maddie Heath (Amy James- Kelly) is also caught up in the explosion and is also killed. As Carla was asleep when she started the fire, Tracy tells the residents that it was Carla who started the fire, leading to Leanne shouting at her in the street and everybody else hating her. Carla plays a game of poker and wins a large amount of money. This subsequently leads to Carla developing an addiction to gambling, as it eases her guilt from the fire. Carla decides to go on holiday to Madrid. Carla returns a number of weeks later, and it is revealed that she actually went on holiday to Las Vegas in order to gamble. Michelle is furious and after trying to help her, Carla throws her out. Nick later accompanies Carla to a casino and is stunned to learn how serious her addiction is. Realising the extent of her financial troubles, Carla decides to move away and later tries selling the factory to Sally and Kal's daughter Alya Nazir (Sair Khan). However, before any contracts are signed, her old friend, Aidan, arrives. Carla decides to go into partnership with Aidan, while also starting a relationship with Nick. Carla becomes suspicious of Tracy, and when Tracy tells her not to keep blaming herself, Carla orders her to get in her car. To Tracy's surprise, Carla takes her to where the minibus crash occurred earlier in the year and expresses that she wishes Tracy had left her to die in the wreckage. She then flips a coin to decide her fate as she drunkenly stands on the edge of the quarry; heads she stands or tails she falls. It lands on tails, so as Carla prepares to throw herself from the cliff, Tracy screams that she was the culprit who started the fire. Carla refuses to believe her, but when Tracy tells her that she saw a photograph of Rob when she lit the candle, Carla realises that she is telling the truth. In pure anger, Carla grabs Tracy and drags her to the edge of the quarry, but Tracy pushes Carla over. Tracy pleads with Carla not to tell anybody, however, Carla is intent on phoning the police and opening an investigation to clear her name, but Tracy says she will deny everything. When Tracy tells Carla that her motive towards the fire was that she was jealous of her and that she still wishes Carla had died in the fire, Carla drives back to the street and the police arrest Tracy. However, Tracy is later released without charge. Nick proposes to Carla and she is shocked to learn that Aidan used his father, Johnny's money to buy into the factory, and thus Johnny and Aidan's sister Kate move to Weatherfield and begin working there. While in prison, Rob begins sending Johnny visiting orders, and reveals that Johnny could potentially be Carla's father. Johnny steals some of Carla's DNA to perform a paternity test behind her back. This reveals that he is Carla's biological father, and decides to break the news to her. Carla is furious and slaps Johnny, and heads for a casino where she bumps into Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill), and after gambling with him, they have sex. She instantly regrets it and confides in Michelle, who persuades Carla not to tell Nick. Carla is shocked to find that Robert plans to buy a share in the Bistro. Carla begs him to reconsider, but Robert threatens to reveal their one-night stand if she does not let him buy into the Bistro. Carla finds it increasingly difficult to keep her deceit a secret. Carla tells Nick that she cannot marry him, however after he persuades her, she changes her mind. Upon hearing that Robert is intending on going into business with Nick, Carla goes to the Bistro to confront him. As a power cut has forced the restaurant to close early, Carla and Robert engage in a bitter argument, with their one- night stand being mentioned. Unbeknown to the pair, but Tracy, who has recently reconciled with Robert, has overheard their conversation. Robert then leaves, and Carla drowns her sorrows in alcohol. However, Jamie Bowman (James Atherton), and his friend burst into the restaurant and violently attack Carla, pinning her down on the floor. Tracy, hearing the commotion, leaves Carla to the mercy of the thugs, feeling envious over Carla's liaison with Robert. After realising that there is no money in the restaurant, Jamie grabs Carla's handbag, causing her to fall over. She rises to her feet abruptly and gives chase, jumping into the van, leaving the door wide open, wrestling with the thugs for her handbag. As the van drives out of the street, Jamie pushes Carla out of the vehicle, knocking her unconscious. Months later, Tracy begins blackmailing Carla, threatening to tell Nick about her and Robert if she does not persuade Nick to sell the Bistro to Robert and leave Weatherfield. Robert and Leanne both put in matching offers for the Bistro, so Tracy demands ¬£10,000 from Carla. Carla convinces Nick to sell the Bistro to Robert; he does, but Tracy continues taunting Carla. Closer to the wedding, Robert finds out what Tracy has been doing to Carla but they stay together. Nick and Carla break up when he feels guilty after throwing a mug at Carla, causing her to cut her face. They get back together when she supports him. On the wedding day, Tracy tries to ruin proceedings by sending the flowers to the wrong address. Carla feels guilty, so she tells Nick about the one-night stand with Robert; he manages to forgive her. Tracy then announces that she has been blackmailing Carla, which Nick finds more difficult to accept. They eventually marry but Nick instantly regrets it, leaving the venue and Carla in tears. Carla asks Roy to get his car so that she can flee Weatherfield. However, she instead gets in her own car. In front of her, Tracy taunts her and Carla speeds up her car to run Tracy over. Tracy moves but a truck drove by Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) and his girlfriend Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) comes into her path and she swerves, knocking over Roy's partner, Cathy Matthews (Melanie Hill) before crashing into the postbox. Carla escapes unharmed, but Cathy lies on the ground motionless. Tyrone crashes into the Platt household, but he and Fiz also escape unharmed, with the help from Nick's half-brother David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd). Roy goes with Cathy to the hospital and as he is Carla, who is being held back by police, tries to apologise for what she has done. The next day, Carla decides to leave for Devon even though the car crashes are pending investigation. Before leaving, she visits the hospital to see Cathy. Cathy forgives her but Roy finds it more difficult to. She tells Roy she is leaving, but Cathy insists that he reconciles with Carla, however, he declares, \\"Carla is who she is, and will never change\\". Carla then says an emotional farewell to Johnny, Michelle, Aidan, and Kate. Tracy walks out of her florists and Carla declares, \\"We're done\\". She then gets in Johnny's car to depart. However, a bus comes and Roy dashes over. Johnny stops the car, with Roy and Carla sharing a final farewell. He forgives her for running over Cathy but tells her she should try to love herself. Carla then kisses Roy on the cheek before getting back in the car and leaving Weatherfield for a new life in Devon. 2017‚Äì Over a year later, Carla meets Aidan in a pub after he calls for her help in saving Underworld. However, she refuses and leaves, stating that she has a new life now. She returns on Christmas Day, with a great response from her family and Michelle. Carla refuses to drink during the day which is picked up upon numerous times. While visiting she says that she will become a partner in Underworld with Aidan. She later bumps into Tracy who calls her a goblin to which Carla replies, \\"just think of me as a Ghost of Christmas Past\\". It is declared that she must be up to something when she is seen pouring a drink down the sink in the bathroom as everyone in the pub is singing. Carla invites Roy to join her and the family for New Year's Eve in the Rover's Return. Roy wants Carla to tell her family about her kidney failure‚Äîshe has only shared with him her need for a kidney transplant. Roy has agreed to keep quiet about her condition but says she needs support and must tell them. Carla struggles with her illness and as everyone welcomes in the New Year, she breaks down; Roy witnesses this and asks her to move in with him. She agrees and goes back inside while Roy searches online \\"how to donate a kidney\\", unbeknownst to Carla. Carla also grows close to Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard), Peter and Tracy‚Äôs half-brother, upon her return. She clashes with Peter's new partner, Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor), who sees her as a threat. Carla, however, refuses to tell her family about her illness, despite numerous advice from Roy. She later collapses in the street and is found by Brian Packham (Peter Gunn) and is rushed to the hospital. At the hospital, Roy tells her that he was tested for a kidney match but was not successful, which touched Carla. She decides to listen to him and upon hearing that her situation is getting more critical, she tells Kate and Aidan who both tell her that they will get tested. On the day that Aidan and Kate get tested, Carla meets Daniel and they go round to his flat. After they establish a certain spark between them both, they have sex. Afterwards, they leave the flat and kiss on the doorstep which Daniel's ex-girlfriend, Sinead Tinker (Katie McGlynn) witnesses whilst going round to get back with Daniel as he had earlier given her a present. They later meet up for a drink later on in the Rovers Return, whom Peter is now landlord of with Toyah. Peter tells Carla that he saw them together earlier and it is obvious that Peter is jealous. Whilst there, she meets Aidan who tells her that he has been tested. Peter also talks with Daniel and pesters about what was going on that afternoon. However, Sinead's aunt Beth Sutherland (Lisa George) storms into the pub and argues with Carla about their kiss on the doorstep which everybody hears including Peter who sarcastically comments - \\"you make a great couple\\". The next day, Peter taunts Carla about Daniel suggesting that she is only doing it to get back at him. Carla disagrees by saying, \\"don‚Äôt flatter yourself\\" and says sarcastically that Toyah is lucky, clearly because he is jealous of Carla. She later meets Daniel again and they go on a date where she orders a bottle of wine - her first alcoholic drink in a while. Aidan and Kate disapprove but she goes ahead and drinks anyway before collapsing which is met by an audience of Tracy who also teases her about Daniel. Carla and Daniel later meet again in the Rovers as both Aidan and Kate find out they are donor matches. After being refused a drink by Peter and Toyah after stumbling to the bar, Carla collapses again as Roy reveals that she has kidney failure to all her family, Peter, Daniel, and Toyah. Peter worries about her as she is taken to hospital with disapproval from Toyah. Tracey later finds out and is taken aback as she too has had kidney failure. At the hospital, Aidan agrees to donate his kidney as Carla‚Äôs situation becomes even more critical with the doctors saying that she needs a new kidney quick. Aidan is praised by the rest of the family and Carla who thanks him. The next day, Peter visits her in the hospital and brings her a book where Daniel already is. Once again, Peter shows jealousy but he and Carla appear to get on with Peter saying that he still cares. After realising that she might die, Carla tells Sinead that Daniel still likes her and that she doesn‚Äôt want her last moments to be stealing somebody else‚Äôs man. Aidan later has his operation and Carla has a kidney transplant - which are both successful. Afterward, Carla tells Roy that she is renting out her house in Devon and moving back to Weatherfield for good, much to his delight. Carla later sleeps with Michelle‚Äôs biological son Ali Neeson (James Burrows) who was swapped at birth and won‚Äôt speak to his mother, after Carla tries to make amends between them. She hides this from Michelle. Carla later gives Aidan 100% of Underworld on his birthday, to which he responds nervously, which leads to Johnny suspecting that he is hiding something. Carla later discovers that Robert, who is now engaged to Michelle, is using steroids. She agrees to not tell Michelle but confides in Ali about it as he is a GP. After asking how Ali is dealing with the situation, Ali tries to kiss Carla and although she refuses at first, they share a more passionate kiss as Michelle walks out on them both. Michelle is extremely angry at Carla and they fall out. Carla then tells Ali that her friendship with Michelle will come first and won‚Äôt let him stay the night at Roy‚Äôs. Carla is left distraught when Aidan commits suicide but manages to stay strong and support her family. The day after his death, she reopens the factory which shocks the employees as it is so soon after his death. She continues to run it until Michelle finds Aidan‚Äôs will, which reveals he has left it to Alya Nazir, whom Carla doesn‚Äôt get on with and would hate for her to own the factory. Michelle and Carla seek legal advice as the will was written before Carla gave 100% of the factory to Aidan and keep it a secret from Alya. In the coming weeks, tension arises between Alya and Carla. She is told that she will have to say that Aidan was mentally unstable when he wrote his will and she later lashes out at Alya causing her to quit her job at Underworld before Carla breaks down and locks herself in her office. She tells Michelle that she feels responsible for Aidan‚Äôs suicide as she put pressure on him when giving him the factory. Unknown to Carla, Alya is later given Aidan‚Äôs will which shows that she is the sole owner of Underworld. Alya and her lawyer Imran Habeeb (Charlie de Melo) tell the Connors that she knows and Johnny finds out about Aidan‚Äôs will, telling Carla that he will disown her if she contests it. On the day of Aidan‚Äôs funeral, Carla contemplates drinking. Before the service, Alya appears and Carla threatens her. Carla is later furious when Alya changes Underworld‚Äôs locks on the same day and storms over to Alya. After calming down, Carla tells her that she can have the 18% as it is what she would‚Äôve had anyway. Despite this, Alya refuses and Carla tells her that she‚Äôll see her in court. Carla later asks Beth Tinker to get inside information about Underworld in exchange for a rent-free flat. She also gets Peter involved and they go on several dates. He helps the Connor family as they fight Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) for custody of Susie Price, as he previously believed this was his child. On the day before the mediation, he brings around a birth certificate to prove Eva lied about her parents. Carla is, however, sceptical about showing this as it would get Eva into a lot of trouble. Johnny later kidnaps Susie and Carla supports him. She shouts at Eva in the street when Johnny is arrested. Johnny is, however, later released, and the Connors forgive Eva when she leaves. A week later, Peter tells Carla that he thinks there‚Äôs still a flame between them but she shouts at him and tells him that he‚Äôs stupid. Alya later tells Carla that she is selling the factory in order to fund her family‚Äôs restaurant. Initially, it is for 18% less than the price but Alya later puts it up. Alya also gives Carla a video of Aidan doing an interview about being a kidney donor. Carla struggles with finding money for the factory but Peter rescues her by becoming her partner. Carla later breaks down over Aidan‚Äôs death saying that she blames herself but Johnny reassures her and later on Carla and Peter meet and end up kissing. The next day, they talk about the kiss and both say it didn‚Äôt mean anything, although the factory girls and her family are sceptical about Peter‚Äôs motive for helping Carla. Peter later tells Carla that he doesn‚Äôt want to be a sleeping partner and that he is to work full time at the factory, shocking her. A few weeks later, Carla and Peter interview new staff for the factory and Carla brings in someone who looks like Tina, to catch Peter out. However, he realises and she is shocked that he doesn‚Äôt want to employ her. This makes Carla realise that she might actually have feelings for him as he appears to have changed. The next day, after trying to protect Simon from a gang, she witnesses Peter shot and fears that he has died. Luckily, it was only a paint gun but she realises she has feelings for him and confesses to Michelle and is met with a cold response. A few months later, Nick returns and Carla‚Äôs feelings for Peter grow stronger. However, she finds out that he is planning to sell his share of the factory although manages to stall him. Unknown to her, Peter finds an application to buy his share from a while back, addressed to Carla and sells his share to Nick, shocking Carla when she is about to tell him about her feelings. At first, they struggle to work together but manage as Nick tells a lie to Carla about what he has been up to. Carla, however, knows it‚Äôs a lie and after doing some digging finds out that he has a wife, who spots her rummaging through his car. She later confronts her and they talk about Nick. Carla later meets with Nick and blackmails him, telling him that he either sells his share over to her or she tells his wife, Elsa (Kelly Harrison) and Leanne, who is now seeing, about the marriage and his relationship. On New Year's Eve 2018, Carla shares a game of snooker with Peter and they share a heart to heart, with them both confessing their love with each other. Carla is later upset when she sees Abi Franklin (Sally Carman) and Peter together, which he notices. Later on, he asks her about this as he can see her jealousy, although Carla rejects him when he tries to kiss her. Carla later comforts Peter when the boat sets on fire and Simon is trapped on board. Unknown to both Carla and Peter, Roy accidentally set the boat alight whilst sleepwalking, something which Carla is helping him cope with. Peter blames Abi as he broke up with her earlier in the day. She later finds out that it was Roy because of CCTV footage in the factory, although she lets Abi take the blame and destroys all evidence that Roy started it without telling him. However, Abi is later given an alibi and everyone starts to accuse Carla of starting it, including Peter, out of jealousy. Roy, however, later finds his clothes and Carla is forced to tell him the truth. He is devastated and tells Peter, who agrees to not pursue the matter further. Roy insists on going to the police but argues furiously with Carla telling her that she didn‚Äôt cover up the fire to protect him and instead did it out of jealousy, wanting Abi locked up as she is still in love with Peter, leaving Carla in tears. The following day, Roy tells Carla that she should find somewhere else to live. A week later, Carla ignores the fact the roof of the factory needs replacing and tells Gary Windass (Mikey North) that she can‚Äôt afford it. She instead focuses on starting a new business contract where workers and material would be supplied from abroad. Carla is later threatened by Robert, following his breakup with Michelle, as he is looking for someone to blame. Nick later finds out about her plans for outsourcing and Carla admits to her employees that she is planning to move production to Milton Keynes which they take badly. They go on strike and Nick swears revenge on Carla as he needs money. Peter tries to help but she tells him to back off and Gary also pesters her for repair money. She later sees that her car window has been smashed, to which Robert tells her it could be anyone as she now has a lot of enemies. The next day, Kate is due to marry Rana Habeeb (Bhavna Limbachia) but Carla finds out that Peter is leaving and manages to track him down. She breaks down in front of him and tells him she loves him and wants them to be together, but he tells her that although he loves her, she will \\"kill him\\" and he leaves anyway, leaving Carla distraught. Unknown to her, the workers have broken into Underworld in a protest. However, the factory roof collapses, leaving residents such as Sally, Rana, Sean, Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment), Paul Foreman (Peter Ash), Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell) and Emma Brooker (Alexandra Mardell) unconscious and injured. Carla later drowns her sorrows in a pub, but realises she should be at Kate's wedding. However, upon arriving on the street she finds out about the collapse and that Rana is trapped inside after going to fetch her bag. Peter arrives to comfort Carla as he finds out about the collapse and Carla breaks down to him, insisting it was her fault, as they find out that Rana has died in the incident. Carla initially wants to tell the police the truth as they want to interview her but Peter bribes Gary with ¬£10,000 to keep quiet and they say that neither of them knew that the roof needed repairing. Carla is suspicious of the health and safety inspector and Roy‚Äôs previous foster son Wayne Hayes (Adam Barlow) and leaves for a short break with Peter after he says he loves her and will be there. A week later the pair return and Carla is arrested at Rana‚Äôs memorial for manslaughter and the residents start to blame her for Rana‚Äôs death, including Kate. Upon being released from police custody, Carla visits Aidan‚Äôs grave where she is verbally attacked and starts receiving text messages from an anonymous person pretending to be Rana telling her the roof collapse was \\"her fault\\". Later on Carla rings the phone number believing it to actually be Rana and that she is still alive, showing that her mental health is deteriorating. She later finds out that it is Alya sending the messages as Kate tells her, although she starts believing everybody is plotting against her and starts hearing voices. The next day, she starts feeling trapped and Ken Barlow (William Roache) tries to help, aware of her paranoia. She runs outside barefoot and bumps into the police and Alya, who she believes has been sent to spy on her. Peter manages to find her and takes her to the medical centre where Carla tries to find Rana, whom she believes is still alive. Toyah attempts to help her but she escapes through the window when Toyah leaves to try and get professional mental health support. Peter begins to look for her and manages to get Johnny to help him. He reports her missing to the police but refuses to believe they will help and possibly arrest her when she is found. He posts an image of her online and gets a reply from a man at a squat on her old estate, which he follows up and comes to nothing. The police later tell him that she was seen drawing money out of a cash machine and returning to the squat. He goes back with Johnny and threatens the man, who makes it clear that she isn‚Äôt there. Peter and Johnny leave as Carla watches from the window. She is told to find somewhere else to go as Peter causes trouble. She acknowledges this as not being safe \\"from Peter\\". Robert later finds Carla in a hotel in town when the staff shout \\"Mrs. Donovan\\" and she panics upon seeing him. However, he later catches up with her and tries to calm her down saying he is there for her and attempts to bring her back to the street. Upon returning, she runs away as Robert tries to find her, he is stalled by a man who punches him, thinking Carla is threatened. Robert later tells the family and they run into the street shouting her, as she hides behind a wall. Throughout the search, they find that Carla has been living in a hotel room, which she has ultimately destroyed. They also find she hasn‚Äôt been taking medication for her kidney failure and may go into rejection. As the police start taking their search for her more serious, Carla panics and goes to Roy, whom she believes she can trust. However, when he rings her family to notify them that he has found her, she lashes out at Roy. An ambulance arrives as Carla breaks down. The doctor tells Roy and Johnny that her kidneys are fine but she demands to see Peter, who unknown to her, has been in rehab after a relapse. Peter visits and comforts her as she is psychologically assessed and is told she is to be discharged the following day but will need to be assessed every day and Roy lets her and Peter stay with him. Carla‚Äôs condition worsens and she floods Roy‚Äôs flat before stealing everyone‚Äôs phones. Carla later hallucinates and thinks she sees Hayley and Rana before thinking Peter is Aidan. Peter saves her from jumping from the fire escape and she is sectioned before she is sent to a mental health facility in Carlisle where Peter stays with her. A few months later, a seemingly better Carla and Peter return to Weatherfield. She insists she is recovering but Peter keeps worrying about her. Carla announces that she‚Äôs giving her share of Underworld to each of the employees and she gets a job at Viaduct Bistro. She later quits when she finds out the employees have been in a group chat that Peter has set up, wanting to check up on her. She also kicks Peter out of Roy‚Äôs but they later reconcile. They both later manage The Rovers Return for a while whilst Johnny and Jenny go away. Casting and development On 20 September 2006, it was reported that the former Dream Team actress, Alison King, had been cast as Carla Connor. A Coronation Street spokeswoman said of the new addition, \\"she will make quite an impact. The phrase 'dosh doesn‚Äôt make you posh' was made for Carla. She's a WAG on the cobbles, beautiful but tough and ambitious\\". King had briefly appeared on the Manchester soap in 2004, as a housewife named Mrs. Fanshaw, who slept with Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas). She later joked \\"I was Mrs Fanshaw - or Fanny. What a nightmare!\\" Metro also incorrectly reported she had previously played a character called Milly Webster in 1982, a part that was played by another actress with the same name. She said that she initially found the role difficult, as she \\"was uncomfortable playing a constant bitch at first. I'm getting into it now but I'm not as nasty or as cocky as Carla. She's horrible to anyone she perceives to be a rival. I couldn't be like that.\\" In November 2010, she admitted her character \\"annoys the hell\\" out of her, saying \\"I would never be her mate in a million years! Carla's a nightmare and annoys the hell out of me. She's the type of person who creates drama wherever she goes, and I'm not like that at all. Plus, she'd probably try to steal my fella!\\" She has also said she hates the voice she chose for the character. In 2010, she talked of how long she would stay at Coronation Street, and that she had no worries for her career afterwards, saying \\"I'll have done four years in Coronation Street in October but because I had more or less a year out it still feels very fresh. I'm certainly in no rush to get out of it. I'm really lucky to be in this job. But I had a great career before I came into the show - 11 years working non-stop. Hopefully I wouldn't be too scared to do a few more silly action films if I could get them under my belt. I'll know when it's time to go but I'm not there yet.\\" In January 2012, she said she would not leave soon, and would play Carla until \\"I get bored of her.\\" In July 2013, King spoke of her future on Coronation Street, saying \\"I don't know whether I'll be here forever - I'd love to have a go at different things, like an action drama or love story. But as long as I'm happy in the role and the producers will have me, I'll be staying put for now.\\" In October 2014, she said \\"I'm happy so long as I'm happy and I'm getting good storylines.\\" Backstory Carla is stated to have been born on 3 January 1975 in Manchester. She was born into a world of alcohol and drugs, which Sharon sold from Carla's pram. Sharon had plenty of boyfriends and, a few years after Carla was born, she gave birth to her second child, Rob (Marc Baylis). She went on to marry George, who mistreated Carla and Rob and was hated by them. Carla's best friends growing up were Michelle (Kym Marsh), Paul (Sean Gallagher) and Liam Connor (Rob James- Collier) who lived in the nicer part of the estate. Carla later married Paul in 1999 and left her family. Rob was later sent to Strangeways prison for armed robbery in 2004. Carla's family also used to know the Kerrigans as they were part of the Connor family. The Kerrigans included Tom (Philip McGinley) who later appeared on the street. Underworld siege In March 2010, it was reported that Carla's husband Tony Gordon portrayed by Gray O'Brien would escape from prison resulting in Carla being put in grave danger. Robbie Sloan, portrayed by Vicar of Dibley star James Fleet who is Tony's cellmate and has been bribed to aid the escape. According to The Sun newspaper: \\"Robbie is freed from jail ‚Äì having been due for release ‚Äì and meets Carla (Alison King) under the pretence that he is a trader who wants to buy lingerie cheaply. Having arranged a further meeting with Carla on the planned jailbreak day, he returns to visit jail and creates a diversion by sparking a fight with another inmate. As wardens attempt to break up the altercation, Tony feigns a heart attack and is transported to the hospital for treatment. However, Robbie is waiting for the ambulance and threatens the guards at gunpoint before securing Tony's escape.\\" In April 2010, it was revealed that Tony was to hold Carla and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) captive at Underworld after escaping from prison. Lured into the factory alone by Robbie's businessman fa√ßade, Carla was bound and gagged in a desolate Underworld with Hayley Cropper, who had also been lured to the factory. Tony arrives at the factory, and eventually lets Hayley go free before setting the building on fire. In subsequent scenes, viewers saw Carla untie herself, grab Tony's gun and fire a shot which wounds him. While Carla manages to escape the burning factory, Tony dies in the blaze. Police later examine his body and assume that the bullet killed him. It was later reported that Carla was to be wrongly charged with murder in the storyline following this Carla is later released, however, this never happened. Relationships Peter Barlow In July 2010, The Sun newspaper reported that an upcoming storyline would see Carla face a drinking problem after King was pictured filming a visit to alcoholics anonymous. An insider told the paper: \\"She sees Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) at the meeting and backs out, pretending she is meant to be in a Spanish class next door.\\" In July 2011, it was reported that Carla will drunkenly drive her car into the bookies, injuring Stella in the process. This was the result of further rejections from Peter. A source told The Sun: \\"Carla's drinking is out of control again, it's a cry for help ‚Äì and for love\\". The show's producer, Phil Collinson recently teased a storyline seeing Carla's feelings or Peter to arise once again. Collinson said: \\"I have to say, it's one of the biggest stories that we've told on Corrie for many years. She's going to have a pretty rough time across the autumn.\\" In September 2010, it was reported that Carla would fall for Peter. It was reported that the pair apparently grow closer as Peter helps Carla overcome her boozing and comes to her aid when she is arrested for drink driving. A source said: \\"Carla is feeling vulnerable and Peter is there,\\" a source told the paper. \\"They soon become more than friends. He's stunned when she tells him she hasn't felt like this about anyone since Liam.\\" Carla's best friend Leanne (Jane Danson) who is in a relationship with Peter would tell Carla that she is in love with her ex-husband Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), \\"This storyline will really put the cat among the pigeons,\\" the source added. Alison King later told Inside Soap that she wants Carla's friendship with Peter to develop even further as he helps her to battle alcohol addiction. King said: \\"I think she should definitely gets her claws into Peter. They've got a nice friendship and some good banter going on. They're equals, and I think it's the first time Carla's felt that way with someone since Liam died. They could be a great coupling ‚Äì but it would turn into a nightmare if they both fell off the wagon.\\" Upon Carla‚Äôs return in December 2017, the pair became infatuated with each other once again and they later got back together in 2019 after he supported her through her psychotic episode. In May 2020, it was revealed that Carla has a secret that will bring conflict between the pair. Speaking about what‚Äôs to come for Carla, producer Iain MacLeod teased: \\"It pertains to when she went missing during her mental health crisis. We wanted to visit that when she is back on an even keel psychologically. We saw glimpses ‚Äì with the hotel ‚Äì it was an interesting development to reveal something we didn‚Äôt know previously.\\" He stated that \\"Peter will seemingly discover said secret, which will inevitably bring with it more conflict for the two\\" Iain said: \\"Peter and Carla and the Burton and Taylor of the cobbles ‚Äì at their best at their most explosive. They have big, heartrending challenges to overcome. What he discovers is a hard thing to swallow but ultimately he will be all the more proud of her and love her all the more. But they have a rocky road ahead.\\" Frank Foster Carla was involved in a relationship storyline with Frank Foster played by Andrew Lancel (pictured).In June 2011, it was announced that Carla will reportedly be left \\"fighting for her life\\" after being attacked by her boyfriend. The factory owner, played by Alison King, would be subjected to a physical and sexual assault by Frank Foster after he suspects she is cheating on him with Peter Barlow. Carla will consider leaving Frank prior to the attack, but feels she owes him after he invested in her business and takes the blame for a car accident she is responsible for. The plot was a prominent storyline over the summer and aired after the 9pm watershed during a week of special episodes. Tracy Barlow will offer to give Frank a positive character reference in court, while Peter's marriage to Leanne suffers. On 3 February 2012, Coronation Street confirmed Frank would be killed off as part of a whodunit storyline. The news came shortly after the episode showing Frank being found not guilty of raping Carla was broadcast. A writer for the official Coronation Street website said \\"Now events will take an even more dramatic turn as tensions rise and vengeance will be on the minds of several characters, climaxing in Frank's death! And with so many residents having a motive for killing the twisted factory boss ‚Äì the list of suspects reads like a 'Who's Who' of Weatherfield.\\" Over the following weeks, Frank manages to alienate himself as he tries to get revenge on Carla for dragging him through court. Lancel said Frank's true colours would be exposed and he does not think his life is in danger for a moment. His body would be found in the factory, following \\"days of arguments and confrontations with associates, lovers and enemies alike.\\" A reporter for the Metro later announced that five regular characters would become suspects during the investigation into Frank's murder. Frank would be found dead on the floor of the Underworld factory by Sally Webster. The Metro reporter said Sally comes under suspicion when she is found standing over Frank's body with bloodied hands. Carla, Peter and Michelle are questioned by the police, while Sally's ex-husband, Kevin, will also fall under suspicion. Lancel praised his character's final storyline, calling it \\"classic Corrie\\". It was later revealed that Frank's mother, Anne, was the killer during a showdown between her, Carla, Sally and Kevin. Rob Donovan In March 2012, it was announced that Carla's brother Rob Donovan would be arriving later in the year. Carla had previously mentioned a brother. Speaking of the announcement a Coronation Street spokesperson said: \\"We are seeing lots of different actors over the next week or so. We have got some exciting storylines lined up for Carla's brother. He is a character the fans have been keen to meet for some time\\". In May 2012, it was announced that actor Marc Baylis had been cast to play Rob. Speaking of his casting Baylis said: \\"I feel incredibly honoured to be joining the very talented cast of Coronation Street. Rob is an exciting character to play and I am hoping he is going to ruffle a few Weatherfield feathers\\". Producer Phil Collinson said: \\"I'm very pleased to welcome Marc to the cast ‚Äì the latest in a long line of handsome Corrie charmers. Carla's brother Rob is sure to set hearts fluttering in Weatherfield from the minute he arrives. The audience can expect thrills and a few broken hearts when this handsome bad boy hits town.\\" Rob departed in November 2014 and returned later in December 2015 whilst he was in prison for murdering Tina. Temporary departure In May 2012, it was reported that Carla would depart with her boyfriend Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) in 2012, for four months. Speaking of her departure King said: \\"It's three years since I had a baby and I've been working for all of that time so I haven't been able to spend too much time with my family. I plan to have a nice holiday and spend time at home getting jobs done on the house, all very normal stuff. King insisted that she still enjoys playing Carla and has no plans to depart for good. King's exit scenes aired on 16 July 2012, she returned to filming on 1 October 2012 and was back on screen in December, and shows boss announced that Carla and Peter would return at Christmas with big news. Extension of the Connor family and father's identity Shayne Ward (pictured) joined the cast as Aidan Connor, who would later turn out to be Carla's half-brother. In 2015, Coronation Street introduced three new members of the Connor family, consisting of Aidan Connor (Shayne Ward), Kate Connor (Faye Brookes) and Johnny Connor (Richard Hawley). Producer Stuart Blackburn told Digital Spy that there would be a real shocker for Carla after she receives news from one of the new Connors. Blackburn commented: \\"The Connors are looking great. I think in Aidan, Johnny and Kate, we've really hit gold. One of those characters will deliver a bit of news to Carla that will change her sense of self and perception forever. It's going to be a real shocker.\\" Departure (2016) On 1 May 2015, it was reported that King would be \\"taking a break\\" in 2016. A Coronation Street spokeswoman said in a statement released to Digital Spy: \\"Alison King has indicated to producers that she would like to take a sabbatical from the show for creative reasons at some point in 2016. She wishes to try her hand at other projects before returning to the part of Carla Connor, a role she has enjoyed playing for nine years. Before Ali takes her break, Carla has much more drama to come. At the end of this month, she will be central to the explosive storyline which sees Victoria Court go up in flames, and the aftermath of that plotline will have huge consequences for the factory boss. Ali's desire to take a break from the show gives the writers the opportunity to come up with an enthralling exit for the character.\\" In September 2015, King said in an interview: \\"I have just signed till May 2016, there is a lot to do with Carla yet. I haven't had a chance to think about beyond that. On 8 January 2016, it was confirmed that King's departure was in fact permanent. King told Metro: \\"It's not actually a break ‚Äì I'm actually leaving. Because they're leaving the door open, I think people originally called it a break and people are asking 'When are you coming back?' and I'm like 'I'm not'\\". A storyline was created to build up to her departure. A special week aired from 22 to 26 May alongside the Britain's Got Talent semi-final just like in previous years. A trailer also accompanied the shows and after each episode, a preview of the next episode was shown. The episodes had to be broadcast at 9 pm because of the content within them. Two storylines were put into this week, the wedding and the discovery of Callum Logan's (Sean Ward) body. This involved the Platt family heavily and Carla caused the crash into the house where the body was hidden, finishing the storyline from his murder which had started in September 2015. King filmed her final scenes in April 2016 with them being broadcast on 26 May 2016. Reintroduction (2017) In August 2017, after numerous rumours earlier in the year, it was officially announced that King would return to her role as Carla Connor in December that year. Co- stars Kym Marsh [Michelle] and Shayne Ward [Aidan] talked of their delight that King was returning, and that they couldn't wait to work with her again. Marsh said of King's return \\"I‚Äôm extremely excited, I can‚Äôt wait ‚Äì we‚Äôve missed her and she‚Äôs missed us. I love Alison King. Me and her have been very close.\\" Coronation Street producer Kate Oates said she would \\"break new ground\\" with Carla, and doesn‚Äôt intend to force the character back into a destructive cycle of misery but will instead reinvigorate her feisty side. Carla Connor's exit storyline had been criticised for making her leave \\"powerless and in disgrace.\\" Writing in Radio Times at the time of the character's departure, David Brown criticised her leaving storyline as being \\"cruel\\" and \\"undeserved\\", saying \\"After all, this is a woman who ‚Äì during her ten years on screen ‚Äì has been held hostage, raped, suffered a miscarriage, contemplated suicide and had two husbands die on her,\\" commenting that \\"we want our soap femme fatales to exit with their heads held high.\\" Oates has said that Carla Connor will clash with her best friend Michelle Connor when she returns, saying \\"The Carla that we see is very different to the Carla who left the Street a couple of years ago. I really wanted to bring back that feisty side to the character and while it's right that she and Michelle will have some tension ahead, there‚Äôs a different ‚Äì and quite unexpected ‚Äì story which initially brings her back at the end of the year.\\" Oates has stated she would like to keep King in the show for as long as possible. A Digital Spy article stated that Carla is likely to return as \\"the fearless and feisty woman we all fell in love with way back when.\\" King returned to filming Coronation Street on 10 October 2017. On 17 October, Kym Marsh said \\"Alison King had her first week back on the Cobbles last week and it was like she's never been away. Everyone's so pleased to have her back. Ali's back sharing a dressing room with me and Faye Brookes. It's temporary as it's a tight squeeze, but it's nice to have a natter while our hair and make-up is being done.\\" In September 2017, Radio Times named King's character Carla Connor as number two in the category \\"10 soap characters who refuse to die\\", describing how \\"if soap characters got a prize for suffering, then Carla would take home the trophy\\", citing her surviving almost being burned to death twice, being kidnapped and crashing vehicles. On 20 November 2017, her return was teased when Michelle spoke to her on the phone and the next day, Sharon Marshall confirmed on This Morning that Carla's return scenes would be broadcast on 22 December 2017. Mental health breakdown and stand-alone episode In December 2018, it was reported that Carla would have a mental breakdown in 2019 after her colleagues blame her for a roof collapse at the factory. It was revealed that it would become apparent that Carla is being targeted. Producer Iain MacLeod explained that the collapse \\"will trigger a massive story for Carla because it impacts massively on her mental health\\" and that she feels \\"correctly that everybody is out to get her and she spirals off into a slightly delusional state\\". It was also confirmed that Carla would get a stand-alone episode, which has been compared to MacLeod's production at Emmerdale, in which he created an episode focused around Ashley Thomas' (John Middleton) dementia. Commenting on this, MacLeod has added, \\"We're doing something a little bit stylised, like the Ashley story I did at Emmerdale, but it won't be quite as extreme as that. It's a stand-alone episode that will be both mental health-focused and Carla focused. It will also be the reveal to the audience of who is behind the factory roof collapsing. I'd hesitate to put a diagnosis on what it is affecting Carla, but the factory collapse has lots of unexpected offshoots into areas that give our amazing cast a chance to show off their acting chops.\\" Speaking about the tone of the episode, MacLeod added: \\"We're inside Carla's head, but I'm still unsure about how far we explore what's real and what's not real.\\" In the run-up to the factory disaster, a determined Carla will be seen ploughing all her energies into making the business a market leader, but this ends up having fatal consequences for her workforce: \\"It comes from a workaholicism story for Carla. She makes the decision that her life's priority is her work. She wants to turn the factory into a world-beating business. But that leads to her making mistakes in both her personal and professional life. She ends up getting on the wrong side of a lot of people. And by the time of the collapse, many of them will wish her ill.\\" A trailer of the storyline, which shows Carla breaking down, was released on 11 March 2019. Reception Critical response Columnist Grace Dent has described Carla as \\"...an alluring vision, raven haired, classy, sultry and replete with guile\\". The episode aired on 3 December 2008, in which Carla married Tony Gordon attracted an impressive peak of 10.5 million viewers. In January 2009, the character was heralded as the new Elsie Tanner: \\"strong, dark, mouthy, pushy, full of herself and nobody's fool, ready to put the world to rights with another lashing of lipstick. Has Coronation Street finally found the new Elsie Tanner in Carla Gordon I'm starting to think that perhaps they might have\\". The return of the character on 19 October 2009, after an eight-month absence, drew large ratings for the show's episodes which were watched by 9.88m (42.2%) and 10.24m (40.5%) respectively. Radio Times soaps columnist David Brown gave mixed comments in his response to Carla's rape storyline. He made the point that while it was being treated with more sensitivity than the rape of Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor) was, back in 2001, the impression was that the writing team were placing too much pain and anguish upon Carla's character: \\"By having Carla undergo a vicious violation like rape, it begins to feel that she's being systematically targeted by the storyliners. There's no denying that the scenes in this evening's double bill are powerfully acted by Alison King, but there seems to be an underlying mission to crack open Carla's carapace and expose her vulnerability. In the wider world, rapists often choose their targets regardless of the victim's circumstance, so there's no saying that Carla wouldn‚Äôt suffer an assault of this sort. But, in a fictional setting, it does begin to look cruel when so much anguish is piled onto one person's shoulders.\\" Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap said that Carla was great to watch when she is with Peter. She added that they are \\"like a car crash waiting to happen\\". Her colleague, Laura-Jayne Tyler, called Carla's departure \\"thoroughly disappointing\\", commenting, \\"For a character who has given Corrie 10 years of top drama, we don't think Carla deserved to be 'slut shamed' out of Weatherfield.\\" A reporter writing for the Inside Soap Yearbook 2017 described Carla as a \\"soap favourite\\" and hoped she would \\"hurry home soon\\". Another reporter later named Carla and Tracy's feud as one of the \\"best bits of February\\", describing the pair as \\"sworn enemies\\". They described Tracy confronting Carla as \\"the big moment\\" in the episodes. Fans Since Carla first appeared, she has become a firm favourite by Coronation Street fans. Although King is not on social media herself, many fan base accounts have been set up on Twitter and Instagram. The character is also amongst many discussions on Twitter and often finds herself 'trending' after an episode. Examples of the fans' involvement are such things as when she left in 2016, many people were calling for her return straight after the episode. In 2018 also, when Carla began her feud with Alya Nazir, Coronation Street put out hashtags with either #TeamAlya or #TeamCarla. Over 1,000 people responded with #TeamCarla and this yet again became a discussion on social media, with many fans criticising the character of Alya just because of her attitude towards Carla. Peter and Carla's relationship also has its own nickname by fans - \\"Carter\\". The #Carter hashtag has been used numerous times since her 2017 return. Accolades In an online poll conducted by MSN Entertainment, Carla Connor was voted as 'Soapland's Sexiest Female of 2008', with more than 31% of votes. At the 2008 Inside Soap Awards, the character was voted \\"Best Bitch\\". King was awarded \\"Best Actress\\" at The British Soap Awards 2012. On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, King was nominated for \\"Best Female Soap Actor\\" and came fifth with 9.7% of the vote. King was nominated for the \\"Best Actress\\" award at The British Soap Awards 2014, and was nominated for the award again in the 2015 ceremony. She was nominated for \\"Best Actress\\" again at The British Soap Awards 2019.

Through the use of experimental and unconventional curricula and offering choice to students as to what and how they will study, such institutions distinguish themselves from traditional faculties. They often attract faculty and students who are interested in such values and are often politically liberal. Additionally, some of them expand on the concept of democratic education to integrate students in various facets of school administration. Methods of evaluation frequently favor detailed written evaluations instead of grades. Some institutions do not require an SAT/ACT, but rather ask for a series of essays.

It superseded the short lived Penny Venetian Red because the Customs and Inland Revenue Act of 1881 necessitated new stamps that were valid for use as both postage and revenue stamps, and so the Penny Lilac was issued in that year, inscribed \\"POSTAGE AND INLAND REVENUE\\". All previous stamps had been inscribed merely \\"POSTAGE\\". This stamp remained the standard letter stamp for the remainder of Queen Victoria's reign, and very large quantities were printed. The oval design of the Penny Lilac was adapted from that used for revenue stamps in Britain from the early 1860s. In that respect it represented a break with 40 years of tradition in postage stamp design. Its predecessors (the Penny Black, the Penny Red and the Penny Venetian Red) all had rectangular designs. The use of the colour lilac for low value definitives was extended in 1884 when other low-value stamps were issued in lilac, with green then being used for higher- value stamps. The Penny Lilac was a surface-printed stamp and was issued in two forms: * Die I with 14 dots in each corner from 12 July 1881 (495,984,000 issued) * Die II with 16 dots in each corner, 13 December 1881‚Äì1901 (33,600,000,000 issued) Penny Lilac stamps are often found as perfins - that is with initials or insignia added as perforations to mint stamps which meant they could not be redeemed for cash at a post office. The addition of perfins was widespread practice in Britain from the 1860s as a precaution against theft.

After receiving degrees from Oxford University (A.B. 1597, A.M. 1602), he became pastor at Leverlegkish, near Laughgaid, Armagh, Ireland. He was the first ordained minister to come to the Plymouth Colony. He arrived in 1624 aboard the Charity and pretended to be sympathetic to the Separatist movement there, while in reality he was allied with the Church of England. In the months ahead, the leaders of the colony discovered that Lyford had been writing letters to England disparaging the Separatist movement at Plymouth. Governor William Bradford seized some of these letters before they were sent, opened them, and confronted Lyford about their contents. Lyford apologized, but later wrote another similar letter that was also intercepted. After the second incident, Lyford was sentenced to banishment. Before he was banished, Lyford's wife, Sarah, came forward with further charges. Lyford had fathered a child out of wedlock with another woman before his marriage, and after his marriage, he was constantly engaging in sexual relationships with his housemaids. In his famous history, Of Plymouth Plantation, Bradford wrote that Sarah Lyford came forward and explained > how he (Lyford) had wronged her, as first he had a bastard by another before > they were married, and she having some inkling of some ill cariage that way, > when he was a suitor to her, she tould him what she heard, and deneyd him; > but she not certainly knowing the thing, other wise then by some darke and > secrete muterings, he not only stifly denied it, but to satisfie her tooke a > solemne oath ther was no shuch matter. Upon which she gave consente, and > married with him; but afterwards it was found true, and the bastard brought > home to them. She then charged him with his oath, but he prayed pardon, and > said he should els not have had her. And yet afterwards she could keep no > maids but he would be medling with them, and some time she hath taken him in > the maner, as they lay at their beds feete, with shuch other circumstances > as I am ashamed to relate.\\"Of Plymouth Plantation\\" Later, the real reason why Lyford came to New England was revealed. While giving pre-marital counseling to a girl in his parish back in Ireland, Lyford raped her; and when she later told the matter to her husband, he and his friends hunted Lyford down, which resulted in Lyford's departure to Plymouth Colony. Bradford's account of the rape and what followed is rather vivid: > some time after marriage the woman was much troubled in mind, and afflicted > in conscience, and did nothing but weepe and mourne, and long it was before > her husband could get of her what was the cause. But at length she > discovered the thing, and prayed him to forgive her, for Lyford had overcome > her, and defiled her body before marriage, after he had commended him unto > her for a husband, and she resolved to have him, when he came to her in that > private way. The circumstances I forbear, for they would offend chast ears > to hear them related, (for though he satisfied his lust on her, yet he > indeavored to hinder conception.) These things being thus discovered, the > womans husband tooke some godly friends with him, to deale with Liford for > this evill. At length he confest it, with a great deale of seeming sorrow > and repentance, but was forst to leave Irland upon it, partly for shame, and > partly for fear of further punishmente, for the godly withdrew them selves > from him upon it; and so coming into England unhapily he was light upon and > sente hither. Accordingly, Lyford was expelled from Plymouth Colony, went to Nantasket, then Cape Ann, and finally moved to Virginia, where he died. Because of his immoral behavior, Lyford is grouped with several other men that the Pilgrims considered detrimental to their project of settling a \\"godly\\" community in America; among these were Thomas Granger, Thomas Morton, and John Billington. Following Lyford's death on March 8, 1649, his widow Sarah remarried Edmund Hobart Sr., a prominent early settler of Hingham, Massachusetts.

Early life Eric Marienthal was born on December 19, 1957 in Sacramento, California to Robert Marienthal, an insurance salesman, but moved to San Mateo when he was two years old. He has credited his enthusiasm for music on being taught music while in school, and picked up the saxophone in the fourth grade after he thought it looked \\"pretty cool\\". Marienthal has also mentioned his father was a fan of music, particularly 1940s and 1950s such as Boots Randolph, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. He initially wanted to pick up the trumpet but a teacher discouraged him because of his braces. As Marienthal progressed, his father bought him a $400 Selmer saxophone and enrolled him in Corona Del Mar High School. Throughout his education, Marienthal also learned to play guitar (in grade school), flute, clarinet (both high school) and piano (college). After graduating from high school in Southern California in 1976, he studied at the Berklee College of Music, where he studied with the saxophone professor, Joe Viola. By the time he left Berklee, Eric had achieved the highest proficiency rating given by the school. Career Marienthal (right) with Ray Reach, Director of Student Jazz Programs for the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame Marienthal started his professional career in 1980 with famed New Orleans trumpeter Al Hirt. After returning to Los Angeles, Eric became a member of the Chick Corea Elektric Band. Marienthal has stated that he was a Chick Corea fan even before he started performing with him. He recorded six albums with that band and two of them won Grammy Awards. Russ Freeman Marienthal has also written instructional books, including Comprehensive Jazz Studies & Exercises, The Ultimate Jazz Play Along, and The Music of Eric Marienthal and instructional videos, including Play Sax From Day One, Modern Sax and Tricks of the Trade, all published by Warner Brothers Publications, which is now Alfred Publishing/Belwin Jazz. Every summer since 1999, he has put on an annual fundraising concert for High Hopes Head Injury Program, a non-profit organization in Orange County, California that works with people who have suffered traumatic head injuries. Marienthal occupies the lead alto chair of Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band, playing alto saxophone, soprano saxophone, flute, and piccolo. In 2012, Marienthal released the album It's Love, produced by guitarist Chuck Loeb, who also appears on the tracks. The studio band includes keyboardist Russell Ferrante, drummer Gary Novak, and bassist Tim Lefebvre.

The BCMEA currently consists of sixty-seven member companies with commercial interests based on the waterfronts of Vancouver and other seaports in British Columbia. The BCMEA is the Employer Association of companies that employ longshoremen, who in turn are represented by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union to bargain with the BCMEA on their behalf. In addition to collective bargaining, the BCMEA handles everyday labour matters, such as administering the collective agreement, payroll services, discipline, and grievance and arbitration hearings on behalf of its members. Formed after World War I to handle the rapidly growing commercial traffic on the waterfront, it was originally called the Shipping Federation of British Columbia, comprising shipping and railway companies, terminal and storage operators, and container companies. History The Shipping Federation was established during what Canadian historians have called the Canadian Labour Revolt in the period following World War I, which peaked in Canada with the Winnipeg General Strike in 1919. the Employers felt they needed to band together, not only because port operations were becoming increasingly complex, but as a bulwark against unionism generally, and union militancy in particular. Vancouver hosted the first Canadian General Strike in Canada in 1918 following the police killing of union leader, Ginger Goodwin. The following year a longer and more extensive general strike was called by the Trades and Labour Council in sympathy with the strike in Winnipeg. Longshoremen were among the first to walk out, but were quickly replaced by strikebreakers who were mainly university and high school students. By the time the next strike erupted on Vancouver's waterfront, the Shipping Federation had adopted an even more rigidly anti-union policy, influenced by its recent association with counterparts in the United States, who were following what had been dubbed the American Plan. It then set out to break the union completely and establish a company union. Again, it recruited strikebreakers both as replacement workers and as special constables. The CPR's ocean liner, the Empress of Japan, was used to house strikebreakers for the duration of the strike. The strike was quickly brought to an end after the Federation took over the duties of despatching work gangs from the union and refused to negotiate with the union, the International Longshoremen's Association. It established the Vancouver and District Waterfront Workers' Association to replace the ILA as a company union. Almost a decade of peace followed the 1923 strike. It was not a lasting peace however, and in 1933 the Shipping Federation discovered that not only had the union been transformed by Communist Party organizers into a militant union, but also that agitators were planning a general strike for the province to begin on Vancouver's waterfront in 1935. Communists were active both on the waterfront and in the government relief camps for the unemployed, as well as several other industries, organizing workers into unions affiliated with the Communist trade union umbrella, the Workers' Unity League. During this era, the Comintern, or Communist International in Moscow was prescribing a policy of dual unionism. The Shipping Federation was thus centrally positioned during what was effectively another Red Scare in 1935. The general strike never happened in 1935, and striking relief camp workers left the city shortly after the waterfront strike finally was called for the On-to-Ottawa Trek. Technically it was a lock-out. The union voted to take back control of despatching work gangs because discrimination, blacklisting, and the arbitrary allocation of work had long been a major grievance for longshoremen. According to the most recent contract however, the Federation was to handle dispatching, and therefore treated the union's action as a breach of contract. The 1935 strike had seeped into the political realm much more extensively than the 1923 strike had. The civic administration of Mayor Gerry McGeer, along with his chief constable, Colonel Foster had joined with the Shipping Federation to defeat the Communist threat. The Communists had been planning to merge the waterfront and relief camp strike, and hopefully other industrial workers into a general strike. Although these various groups of worker's were willingly under Communist leadership, they primarily were pursuing resolution to their own workplace grievances, not a proletarian revolution. The strike peaked with the July 18, 1935 Battle of Ballantyne Pier, where the police clashed with strikers and their supporters who had attempted to march down to the harbour. Three levels of police were on hand, plus a plethora of special constables, organized in part by the Shipping Federation's Citizens' League of British Columbia, a vigilante group it funded to fight the strike and generate anti- strike/anticommunist propaganda. Again, the strike was broken, and the union replaced with a company union. The Communists shifted away from the dual unionism strategy and dissolved the Workers' Union League. Agitators now put their organizing energy behind the CIO industrial union movement. The Shipping Federation stepped back from it overt anticommunism, but continued to fund a variation of the Citizens' League, the Industrial Association of British Columbia under the leadership of Colonel C. E. Edgett, former police chief, prison warden, and leading local anticommunist polemicist. Nevertheless, workers managed to establish and sustain an independent union under Harry Bridges's new International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) that still exists today.

Many definitions are available.Richard Silverman, The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, Second Edition, 2004 but the term is usually employed in the context of bioactivity and drug development. Such biologically-active compounds containing an isostere is called a bioisostere. This is frequently used in drug design:Nathan Brown. Bioisosteres in Medicinal Chemistry. Wiley-VCH, 2012, p. 237. the bioisostere will still be recognized and accepted by the body, but its functions there will be altered as compared to the parent molecule. History and additional definitions Non-classical isosteres do not obey the above classifications, but they still produce similar biological effects in vivo. Non-classical isosteres may be made up of similar atoms, but their structures do not follow an easily definable set of rules. The isostere concept was formulated by Irving Langmuir in 1919,Irving Langmuir. Isomorphism, isosterism and covalence. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1919, 41, 1543-1559. and later modified by Grimm. Hans Erlenmeyer extended the concept to biological systems in 1932.Mukesh Doble, Anil Kumar Kruthiventi, Vilas Gajanan. Biotransformations and Bioprocesses. CRC Press, 2004, p. 60. H.

Classical isosteres are defined as being atoms, ions and molecules that had identical outer shells of electrons, This definition has now been broadened to include groups that produce compounds that can sometimes have similar biological activities. Some evidence for the validity of this notion was the observation that some pairs, such as benzene, thiophene, furan, and even pyridine, exhibited similarities in many physical and chemical properties.

Sefler was originally composed of Conley, Bryan Newman, Chris Zampella and Justin Gaylord. They recorded a 3-track 7\\" entitled \\"13 Hours of Everything\\" one afternoon in a friend's basement. They then recorded a nine-track demo at Trax East Studio in New Jersey. While recording, a friend of the band (and later bassist), Sean McGrath, suggested that they change their name to Saves the Day, which they did. Saves the Day Saves the Day signed to Equal Vision Records and recorded their first album Can't Slow Down, which was released in 1998 during their first US tour alongside bands Bane and Countervail. Lyrically the album included idealistic dreams, feeling inadequate, honesty and unhappiness, which reflected Conley's life at the time. The style of music is often considered very similar to that of the band Lifetime. In 1999, the band released their second album Through Being Cool. With this album, Conley's lyrics started becoming morbid and corporeal, and the style of music changed into a more pop punk sound. Aged 19 and 20, he started listening to the Beatles and has cited them as the main influence for In Reverie. During the writing of Sound the Alarm, Conley was heavily influenced by Bad Brains, The Damned, The Misfits and The Stooges. Conley, with Saves the Day, has released four other albums. Lyrically, all are considered similar except for In Reverie, which is a more positive album. Conley cites a lack of turmoil in his life at the time as the cause of the change in tone.Change what you are, Aversion.com; accessed September 1, 2015. He commented in Rolling Stone magazine that Saves the Day's release Sound the Alarm, is \\"about the black clouds inside my mind; It was these intense fears and paranoia and diluted thoughts that were eating me alive.

Early life  Layard was born in London, son of the essayist and literary writer George Somes Layard and his wife Eleanor.https://library.ucsd.edu/speccoll/findingaids/mss0084.html He grew up first at Malvern, and in c 1902 moved to Bull's Cliff, Felixstowe. He was educated at Bedales School. In Suffolk Layard fell under the influence of his aunt, the poet and archaeologist Nina Frances Layard, who had become established in Ipswich in 1889. With his mother Eleanor he occasionally assisted Nina Layard in her searches for palaeoliths in the Ipswich area, and through her was introduced to Professor A. C. Haddon of Cambridge. She also had direct contacts with Professors William Ridgeway and McKenny Hughes, and with Wynfrid Laurence Henry Duckworth. Her companion, Mary Outram (granddaughter of Sir James Outram), was a cousin of Baron Anatole von H√ºgel, who was then setting up the University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Downing Street site, to which John later contributed largely. John studied in Germany in around 1909‚Äì10, and was provided by his aunt with an introduction to Dr Leopold Pfeiffer, the Imperial Surgeon, who had written a work of palaeoethnography and greeted him warmly in homage to Nina's work and hospitality.  University, and the New Hebrides  John attended King's College, Cambridge, and gained a degree in modern languages, but through his contacts became interested in anthropology. In 1914 he accompanied W. H. R. Rivers, one of the leading anthropologists of the day, on an expedition to the New Hebrides (what is today Vanuatu). Layard travelled with his mentor Rivers. They were accompanied by Professor A. C. Haddon and his students, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown and Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski. Layard and Rivers travelled through the New Hebrides before stopping at Atchin, a small islet off the northeastern shore of Malekula. The indigenous inhabitants gave them a rather cold reception at first, and Rivers decided to continue travelling while Layard stayed for a year immersing himself in the culture, learning and documenting the vernacular language, and recording myths, legends and oral history. This was a society in which monoliths and standing stones formed part of the cultural material, and Layard's interest clearly had some roots in his aunt's investigations. Prior to this time, anthropologists tended to survey many cultures over the course of expeditions and did not spend long periods of time staying in one place and learning about a single culture. Layard in Atchin and his contemporary Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski in the Trobriand Islands of New Guinea were the first modern anthropologists to use what is today called participant observation methods in ethnographic research.  Introduction to psychotherapy  John's brother Peter Clement Layard served in France and was killed in 1918. On his return to England, John was mentally exhausted and underwent several attempts to alleviate his troubles through psychotherapy. These were unfortunate in various ways. His first analyst, Homer Lane, was arrested for having a relationship with a female patient. Subsequent work (which served also as a training for Layard in his own exploration of his psyche, and his attempts to make sense of his experiences) took place in England, in Vienna (in 1926), and then in Berlin, where he joined the circle of David Ayerst and his English literary friends. Layard, however, reached a new crisis, and he returned to England, to Oxford, where he joined the circle of Mansfield Forbes. Stone Men of Malekula Layard returned to anthropology, producing in 1942 his magnum opus, Stone Men of Malekula. This was originally planned to be the first of three volumes on the \\"small islands of Malekula\\" (Vao, Atchin and Rano). Instead the book is the only monographic treatment of Layard's New Hebridean materials, although he continued to analyse and write about them in numerous publications in psychoanalytic journals. Layard sent many artefacts from Vanuatu to the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge, and sent others, including a penis-gourd, to his aunt Nina, who presented them to the Ipswich Museum, where they may still be seen. More than 400 glass-plate negatives of photographs taken by Layard are also held by the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge.  Depression, and work with Jung  Layard suffered from depression, was suicidal in 1929,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/margaret- gardiner-15952.html and shot himself in the head. He survived and was treated by Carl Gustav Jung, in Zurich in the mid-1940s. As well as undergoing psychotherapy, he began to study and work with Jung. This influenced his later work.  Dream analysis and archetypes  In 1944 Layard published a work of dream-analysis, The Lady of the Hare. The first half of the book is based on sessions of analytical therapy conducted with an English family in 1940. By his account, the therapy was successful in settling the disturbed relationships within the family. The second half of the book explores the images derived from the dream-work in explicitly Jungian terms, discussing \\"archetypes\\", and dealing in particular with the theme of hare and rabbit sacrifice, and its significance in various cultures and mythologies.  Personal life  In the 1920s, Layard moved in expatriate gay circles in Berlin. He became a mentor to W.H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood. Whilst in Oxford Layard met Doris, then the wife of the anthropologist and psychic investigator Eric Dingwall (c.1891‚Äì1986). John and Doris were later married. They had one son, Richard Layard.

It was founded in 1908 by a former Dean of Jersey who saw its competitive classes as a means by which the speech, presentation, and musical standards of his fellow islanders might be improved. With the exception of the years of the two World Wars, it has taken place annually ever since. It was based on the eisteddfod tradition of Wales. After its inception the festival expanded rapidly to encompass other disciplines and crafts, with dance, art, needlework, photography being early additions, which still thrive. Sections have been discarded when no longer applicable (including laundry and shorthand) but others are adopted and integrated, including youth creative arts, crafts and flower arranging. The advent of television in the 1960s had a depressing effect on entries, but this trend was reversed by the middle of the 1980s. From that time there has been a steady increase in interest. There are currently two festivals held annually: *the Festival of Creative Arts, held in March (the \\"Spring Festival\\") *the Festival of Performing Arts held in November (the \\"Autumn Festival\\"). Each attracts nearly 3,000 entries, and, via teachers, relations and supporters, it is estimated that the Jersey Eisteddfod reaches a minimum of 10 percent of the population at any one time. With its continuing growth, it has been necessary to move to larger premises for the Spring Festival, and to operate simultaneously at two venues in the Autumn. There are currently 14 autonomous sections: Arts and crafts as adult, primary school, secondary school and youth creative arts; photography, flower arranging, video, handwriting and needlework; dance, music, English speech and drama, J√®rriais and French. Each section sets its own syllabus, engages one or more adjudicators and supervises the entries and the management of the competitions; and is responsible for communications with the competitors. The management of the Jersey Eisteddfod is accomplished by volunteers who either hold office or are enrolled to assist [as in stewarding] on an occasional basis. There are currently more than 100 persons recorded as having official status. In 1998 the Jersey Eisteddfod celebrated its 90th anniversary in a day-long event held at Samar√®s Manor; the year 2008 saw its centenary.

The team currently plays in the Primera B, which is the regionalised third division of the Argentine football league system. History The 1976 team that won the Primera C title. The club was founded in 1962 under the name Club Armenio de F√∫tbol by the Armenian community in Argentina. It changed its name in 1968, and was affiliated to the Argentine Football Association two years later. The original colours were black and white, but first changed to green and white stripes and then again to red and white. Nowadays, home uniform is red, orange and blue, inspired by the flag of Armenia. The first official title won by Armenio was the 1972 Primera D championship, therefore promoting to the upper division, Primera C. Only four years later, the squad won another championship and promoted to Primera B. In the 1986‚Äì87 season of the Primera B Nacional (second division), Deportivo Armenio broke the division's record of most matches without losing, with a run of 38 games without defeat. The team's coach at that time was Alberto Parseghian (former goalkeeper of the team and of other Argentine clubs), and the captain was Miguel Gardarian. Following this successful run, the club gained promotion to the Primera Divisi√≥n (first division). Their highest ever finish in the top division was 13th in the 1987‚Äì88 season, followed by relegation the season after (the 1988‚Äì89). A notable game in the club's history was a 3‚Äì2 away win against River Plate in the 1987‚Äì88 season, after being 0‚Äì2 down. On that day, the 3 goals were scored by Ra√∫l Wensel. Another important victory was in the same season against Boca Juniors, in La Bombonera. Armenio won that day 1‚Äì0 with a goal scored by Silvano Maciel. This match was the last one in Hugo Gatti's (Boca's goalkeeper) career, as the team's coach (Jos√© Omar Pastoriza) took him out of the starting lineup for his mistake in Maciel's goal.

History The company was founded in the early 1970s by Gerry Anderson alumni Ken Turner and David Mitton, and produced television commercials as well as miniature effects for films and TV shows. Turner left the company in 1979, to be replaced by American-born director and producer Robert D. Cardona.

The company closed down on New Year's Eve 1990 because of TUGS' conclusion. When the studio closed, David Mitton became part of The Britt Allcroft Company, and Robert D. Cardona went to live in Canada. Britt Allcroft, returning home from the US, purchased the models and sets which were used for TUGS, and the show Thomas The Tank Engine and Friends remained in production by The Britt Allcroft Company and later Gullane Entertainment from 1984 until 2003, but was later produced in 2003 by HIT Entertainment.

Released on the Pye Records label, it was an expanded reworking of \\"There Ain't No Umbopo\\", a song the trio had recorded in 1969 under the guise of American bubblegum pop group Crazy Elephant. That song had emerged from an intense three-month period at Strawberry Studios in Stockport, near Manchester, writing and performing songs for American hitmakers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz of Super K Productions. Despite regular airplay on Radio Northsea, \\"Umbopo\\" did not appear on the British charts and was the sole release by Doctor Father.

The earliest form of formal education in Alberta is usually preschool which is not mandatory and is then followed by the partially- mandatory kindergarten to Grade 12. This is managed by Alberta Education (also known as the Ministry of Education) which has divided the province into 379 school authorities. Higher education in the province is guided by Alberta Advanced Education. Alberta has a well developed educational system and is known for having one of the best educational systems in Canada, and the world. It has also historically performed well on international ranking tests; however recently, scores have been declining in some areas, causing concern for alarm.  History  The first schools in what is now Alberta were parochial, that is, they were organized, owned and operated by Church clergy, missionaries, or authorities, both Roman Catholic and Protestant. A nominal fee was often charged for the attendance of students at these schools, and the fee was more often waived, as an act of charity or as an act of proselytizing, or as an act of local solidarity. The first \\"free\\" school (which would now be called a public school) in what is now Alberta, was established in the Hamlet of Edmonton, in what was then Northwest Territories, in early 1881. The school was established before the Northwest Territories had a Territorial Assembly, and before there was any law for the Territory respecting schools, or local government, or local taxation. The people of the Hamlet of Edmonton elected trustees to govern the establishment and operation of the school, and submitted to an informal local taxation entirely on the basis of local solidarity. Between 1883 and 1905 a system of education developed in Alberta by which public education was available in every community once the local population initiated its introduction; and separate school education could be provided subsequently, provided certain conditions were met. This system, by which public education was to be universally available and separate school education available under certain conditions, was the system which the federal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier enshrined in the constitution of Alberta (the Alberta Act) in 1905. The most recent significant development in the governance of education in Alberta has been the emergence of Francophone education authorities in response to the adoption of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982). There are now five Francophone authorities in Alberta. In the south a public Francophone authority and a separate Francophone authority share coterminous boundaries. In the north there are three authorities which provide both public and separate school education. The Francophone authorities, together, cover the province, but they are not required to provide Francophone education from place to place, except where numbers warrant, and it is the responsibility of the authority to decide whether numbers warrant.  Educational stages  There are often multiple terms for each level. * Early childhood education ** Pre-school ** Kindergarten (ages 5‚Äì6) * Elementary education ** Grade 1 (ages 6‚Äì7) ** Grade 2 (ages 7‚Äì8) ** Grade 3 (ages 8‚Äì9) ** Grade 4 (ages 9‚Äì10) ** Grade 5 (ages 10‚Äì11) ** Grade 6 (ages 11‚Äì12) * Junior high/middle school ** Grade 7 (ages 12‚Äì13) ** Grade 8 (ages 13‚Äì14) ** Grade 9 (ages 14‚Äì15) * High school/senior high ** Grade 10 (ages 15‚Äì16) ** Grade 11 (ages 16‚Äì17) ** Grade 12 (ages 17‚Äì18) * Higher/post-secondary education ** College: The term college usually refers to a community college or a technical, applied arts, or applied science school. These are post-secondary institutions granting certificates, diplomas, associates degree, and bachelor's degrees. ** University: A university is an institution of higher education and research, which grants academic degrees in a variety of subjects. A university is a corporation that provides both undergraduate education and postgraduate education. ** Graduate school: A graduate school is a school that awards advanced academic certificates, diplomas and degrees (i.e. master's degree, Ph.D.)  Legislation  The School Act is a provincial statue governing primary education and secondary education within Alberta. The Act authorizes the creation of and regulates public, separate, and Francophone school authorities and that Alberta Education will oversee the school authorities. Responsibility for oversight of the administration of individual schools lies with the district school authority. The ministry has the ability to dissolve school authorities, which has only happened twice in provincial history, as recently as 1999. One of the trustees who was a member of the 1999 dissolution was notable Alberta politician Danielle Smith, whom as of 2012 is the Leader of the Official Opposition. The Education Act is a newly proposed piece of legislation that received royal assent in 2012. When the NDP took power however their government decided that it would review this Act which had been passed under the previous Conservative government and that the school act would remain in place for the 2016/2017 school year. The Post-Secondary Learning Act is a provincial statue governing post-secondary education within Alberta. Government oversight for post-secondary education across the province lies with Alberta Advanced Education. This ministry provides funding to Alberta universities, colleges and other post-secondary institutions.  K‚Äì12  The ministry responsible for kindergarten to grade 12 (also known as primary and secondary education) is Alberta Education. The ministry has divided the province into 379 school authorities. The authorities are both public, private, charter, and separate. All school authorities are required to employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education under the Executive Director of Teaching & Leadership Excellence. The Ministry is also responsible for setting curriculum, or as it is officially referred to, programs of study. There are 690 844 students in K‚Äì12 enrolled in Alberta as of the 2014/2015 school year. In accordance with the School Act children are required to attend school from age 6 to 16, roughly kindergarten to Grade 11.  Funding  For many years the provincial government has provided the greater part of the cost of providing K‚Äì12 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school authorities in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property, as supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school authorities, but not for separate school authorities. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K‚Äì12 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K‚Äì12 education provided by school authorities. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities. In addition to the property tax collected, the provincial government allocates money each year from the General Revenue Fund, for the support of K‚Äì12 public and separate school education. In the case of the money drawn from the General Revenue Fund, it is also used to provide full financial support for charter schools, a type of public school that does not charge tuition (and receives the same funding per student that a public district school would receive). Private schools and homeschooling receive some funding, but parents will pay a substantial portion of the cost. Since 1994 all school authorities with a civil electorate (public, separate, Francophone) are funded almost entirely by the provincial government. School authorities may, and many do, allow the school administration to levy fees for art supplies, textbook rentals, and transportation. There is, however, an appeals process which families can undertake who cannot afford the fees.  Organisation  The school authorities are governed by trustees who are elected by the electorate of the authority. The school authorities may then appoint a superintendent who will then manage day-to-day operations of the authority while the board focuses on the organization of the system. In some cases where private schools are their essentially their own school authority they do not appoint a superintendent. Schools then operate under the management of the school authority. Students in Alberta have their courses mandated but normally after each section of schooling they are given more freedom in what they can choose to take. Then starting in high school most courses begin to be labeled with a dash, for example \\"Math 20-1\\", where \\"-1\\" is the highest level followed by \\"-2\\", etc. Courses are also labeled with a 10, 20, 30, or in some cases 31. 10, the lowest, is generally taken in grade 10 followed by 20 taken in grade 11 and so on. However, there is no rule stating that one cannot take, for example, math 20-1 in grade 10, assuming one has the prerequisites. All of the available courses can be accessed here.  Curriculum or programs of study   Changes in curriculum  Under the Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta, the government adopted a discovery/inquiry based curriculum for the 2008-2009 school year, which has been heavily criticized since then by people citing declining PISA scores. On June 15, 2016, the NDP government announced that \\"Alberta Education would begin to develop new curriculum... unlike any seen in Alberta\\" from K‚Äì12 within six years.  Western and Northern Canadian Protocol  In 1993 Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories ministers for education signed the Western Canadian Protocol for Collaboration in Basic Education (WCP). In February 2000, Nunavut also joined NWCP. Its main goal is to create frameworks with learning outcomes in mathematics, language arts and international languages. In 2014 the agreement was placed in abeyance. Therefore, the WNCP is no longer developing curriculum frameworks.  City of Lloydminster situation  The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.  Issues  Current issues for K‚Äì12 education in Alberta include, but are not limited to: # grade inflation; # the balance of power between school boards and the education ministry; # public school funding; # private school funding; # the manner in which the curriculum is taught, such as discovery learning, personalized learning and reform mathematics; # LGBT sex education; # class sizes;  Initiatives   Alberta Initiative for School Improvement  The Alberta Initiative for School Improvement (AISI) was an Alberta government initiative which sought to \\"improve student learning and performance by fostering initiatives that reflect the unique needs and circumstances of each school authority.\\" Funding for AISI was suspended as part of the 2013 Alberta Budget.2013 Alberta Budget Full text of the 2013 Alberta Budget  Inspiring Education: A Dialogue with Albertans  This was enacted in 2009 by the then Minister of Education of Alberta, Canada, David Hancock and Alberta Education to encourage discussion relating to building a long-term education framework focusing on values, goals, and processes.  Standardized testing   Provincial Achievement Tests Provincial Achievement Tests (PATs) are exams taken in grades 6 and 9 by almost all students of the province in the subject areas of mathematics, sciences, language arts, and social studies. The exams are administered in both French and English.  Diploma examinations  Diploma examinations, or \\"diplomas\\" in colloquial use, are exams taken in some 30 level courses and are administered in both French and English. The diploma examinations are worth 30% of a student's final grade as of 2015, before which the exams were weighted as 50% of a student's grade. Alberta is unique among the provinces in that it requires these exams.  International examinations  Alberta works, like many Canadian provinces, with national, international, and interprovincial organizations.  Programme for International Student Assessment  The Programme for International Student Assessment or PISA's, is a worldwide study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in member and non-member nations of 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading. Canada takes part in the studies and the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada releases reports stating the individual provinces scores. Reports can be found here. While Alberta used to have some of the highest scores in the world its scores have since been steadily decreasing. Critics like the Alberta Teachers' Association says that the tests are unfair as they do not highlight other strengths and that other countries teach to the test while Albertan teachers are required to teach the curriculum.  Higher education  Higher education in Alberta may also be referred to as post-secondary or tertiary education. Alberta's oldest university is the University of Alberta in Edmonton. The University of Calgary, once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second largest university in Alberta. The University of Lethbridge has campuses in Lethbridge, Calgary, and Edmonton. Athabasca University focuses on distance learning. In September 2009, the Government of Alberta designated two colleges as universities, creating MacEwan University in Edmonton and Mount Royal University in Calgary. There are 13 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, NAIT and SAIT.Post Secondary Education There is also a large and active private sector of post-secondary institutions, including DeVry University. Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions. One such scholarship is the Rutherford Scholarship. There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers). In 2005, Premier Ralph Klein made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.University of Alberta - Ralph Klein promises tuition freeze So far, no plan has been released by the Alberta government.

The game is played with a stone that tossed and slid on a marked off playing court. It is similar to hopscotch.  Description  Chindro is game popular in Indian Sub-Continent. Though mostly considered a rural game, it is frequently played in many urban areas as well. Primarily it is a favorite pastime of small and teenage girls, but young boys too can take part in it. Equipment and setup Diagram of Chindro playing court and motion of gameplay. The game costs nothing and requires only two small things: a small piece of chalk or coal is needed to draw a playing court and a square or round piece of a flat stone (usually not bigger than in diameter) is used as the playing object. Most of the time an empty small tin box of a shoe polish is filled with sand and is used as the playing object. One of the participants draws a playing court on a flat surface (usually the floor of alleys) with the help of a piece of coal or chalk. The size of the court depends upon the wishes of the participants and may thus vary greatly. For example, if all the participants agree to have a court of eight boxes each, then that constitutes the playing court. Gameplay Once the playing court is drawn, each participant takes turns. Initially, the player stands backwards at one side of the court and throws the stone blindly over her head so that it may land inside the farthest box of the court. If it lands successfully inside the designated box (without touching any lines) of the court, the player takes off her shoes and stands barefoot near that piece of stone with one foot in the air. Afterwards, she pushes the stone (in a single try) to attempt to slide it into the adjoining box. If successful (once again without touching any of the lines), then the player carries on doing the same until the piece of stone is successfully out of the court and the player is back at the place from where she threw the stone. Once successfully out of the court, the player may stand on both feet. Consequently, the player's turn prematurely ends when: *The player can no longer stand on one foot and both feet touch the court area, or *The stone stops on one of the lines, or *The stone slides out of the court before it reaches the last box.

He was also the guitarist and chief songwriter of new wave group La D√ºsseldorf and briefly the percussionist of Kraftwerk. 1946‚Äì1971: The No, The Smash, and Kraftwerk Klaus Dinger was born in Scherfede, Westphalia, Germany, to Heinz and Renate Dinger on 24 March 1946. He was their first child. Before he was a year old, his parents moved from the town, which had been badly damaged by an Allied siege at the end of World War II, to the economic centre of the region, D√ºsseldorf. In 1956 he attended G√∂rres Gymnasium School for the first time. During his time there he was part of an a cappella choir, which he had to leave when his voice broke. He was part of the school swing band (as a drummer) despite having no prior musical experience. He left the school with a Mittlere Reife (German equivalent of leaving school at 16), later accusing the school of misinterpreting his \\"free mindedness\\" as misbehaviour. After leaving school in 1963 Dinger began to learn carpentry from his father. He also became more interested in music, and practiced drums with spare bits of wood until he could afford a drum kit. In 1966 he formed a band with friends Norbert K√∂rfer, Lutz Bellman and Jo Maassen: The No. The band was influenced largely by English rock acts such as The Kinks and The Rolling Stones. The band sent a demo tape to EMI but the record label never replied. He also worked in a free jazz ensemble, making what he later called \\"noise\\". During a concert in D√ºsseldorf with this ensemble, he spotted Florian Schneider, with whom he would later work in Kraftwerk, sitting in the audience (Dinger said that Schneider \\"Had a face I will never forget\\"). Schneider was at that time part of a free jazz ensemble called Pissoff fronted by another future collaborator Eberhard Kranemann. In 1966 Dinger also started studying architecture at Krefeld. However, in 1968 he took 6 months leave, after experiencing LSD for the first time, in order to become more proficient as a drummer. In 1969 The No split up and he joined cover band The Smash and began touring southern Germany. During this period he realised that he could make a living as a musician alone, and never returned to his architecture studies. In Summer 1970 Dinger received a telephone call from Ralf H√ºtter. H√ºtter was bandmates with Florian Schneider in Kraftwerk and was three-quarters of the way through recording their debut album. Their previous drummer (Andreas Hohmann) had left to join sister-group Ibliss after only two of the album's tracks had been made. H√ºtter and Schneider set out to find a new drummer; in the meantime they recorded a third track without the use of a drummer. Dinger's role would be to record the drum part for the fourth and final track: \\"Vom Himmel Hoch\\". Dinger recalls: Having impressed both H√ºtter and Schneider, Dinger was installed as a permanent member of the band. The homeless drummer moved into the house of Florian's parents, Florian leaving shortly after, but Klaus was kept on as a lodger. Here he met Anita. Anita, or \\"Hanni\\", was a friend of Florian's sister (who died in 2002). Hanni would be Klaus Dinger's girlfriend for most of his time in Neu! and Kraftwerk. After touring extensively with the band, Ralf H√ºtter suddenly decided that \\"he couldn't play anymore\\" and left the group. This left Schneider and Dinger without a guitarist or bass player. They toured with what Dinger called \\"a floating line-up\\" of ever changing musicians. The line-up settled down somewhat by June 1971, and it stood as Dinger on drums, Schneider on flute and organ, Eberhard Kranemann (Florian Schneider's bandmate from Pissoff) on bass and Michael Rother on guitar, who had been poached from local band Spirits of Sound. Kranemann's talents as a bass player were not always needed and in 1972 the trio of Dinger, Schneider and Rother appeared on German TV show Beat Club. The performance was different from the Kraftwerk style and is seen by many as a transition from that towards Neu!'s style. The track had originally been titled \\"R√ºcksto√ü Gondoliero\\", but was mis-pronounced by the television announcer as \\"Truckstop Gondolero\\" and has subsequently been known as the latter. Shortly afterwards Michael and Klaus seceded from Kraftwerk to form their own group: Neu!. Ralf H√ºtter returned to Kraftwerk at the request of Schneider, who was now without a guitarist or drummer. Kraftwerk would continue, recording Kraftwerk 2 at around the same time as Neu!'s debut album. The lack of a drummer would force them to pioneer the use of drum machines and electric percussion, and, in 1974, they made their chart debut with Autobahn. In June 1971 Dinger's girlfriend moved with her family (her father, a banker, was unhappy about her being with Klaus) to Norway. Here Dinger visited her in the summer of 1971. During this holiday, Dinger recorded the \\"watery\\" sounds featuring on several of his subsequent songs (Im Gl√ºck, Lieber Honig, Gedenkminute, Lieber Honig 1981) whilst on a rowing boat with Anita. The pair would continue to see each other irregularly, and often with long intervals between meetings, through 1971, 1972 and 1973. 1971‚Äì1973: Neu! Having broken off from Kraftwerk, Rother and Dinger quickly began the recording sessions for what would become Neu!. The band was christened \\"Neu!\\" by Dinger (Rother had been against the name, preferring a more \\"organic\\" title) and a pop-art style logo was created, featuring italic capitals: NEU! Dinger later said of the logo: The pair recorded in Star Studios in Hamburg, with the up- and-coming Krautrock producer Konrad Plank, as Dinger had with Kraftwerk. Dinger describes Conny's abilities as a \\"mediator\\" between the often disagreeing factions within the band. The band were booked into the studio for four days in late 1971, according to Dinger, the first two days were unproductive, until Dinger brought his Japanese banjo to the sessions, a heavily treated version of which can be heard on \\"Negativland\\", the first of the album's six tracks to be recorded. It was during these sessions that Dinger first played his famous \\"motorik\\" beat. Motorik is a repeated drumbeat with only occasional interruptions, perhaps best showcased on \\"Hallogallo\\". Dinger claims never to have called the beat \\"motorik\\" himself, preferring either \\"lange gerade\\" (\\"long straight\\") or \\"endlose gerade\\" (\\"endless straight\\"). He later changed the beat's \\"name\\" to the \\"Apache beat\\" to coincide with his 1985 solo album Neondian. Neu! sold well for an underground album at the time, according to Dinger approximately 30,000 copies were sold. In order to promote the release the record label, Brain Records, organised a tour. Ex-Pissoff frontman Eberhard Kranemann was brought in to play bass, the trio recording a \\"practice\\" jam in preparation. The recording of this would later be released as Neu! '72 Live in Dusseldorf. Only some of the tour dates allotted were ever fulfilled, Rother later saying that he felt Neu! were not a touring band and that he and Dinger were at loggerheads over performance style: In summer 1972 Dinger and Rother went to Conny Plank's studios in K√∂ln to record a single. Dinger later said that the record company had tried to dissuade them from making it as it was not commercially viable. Nevertheless, the single Super/Neuschnee was released. The A-Side, Super, showcased the proto-punk style that Dinger would later adopt for his band La D√ºsseldorf. The following January, Neu! again entered the studio to record their second album: Neu! 2. Far more heavily produced than their debut, the first side was recorded relatively slowly in the first and second months of 1973, and was aimed more specifically at foreign markets‚Äîthe opening track \\"F≈©r Immer\\" was subtitled \\"Forever\\", an English translation. Brain's parent label Metronome Records licensed the Neu! albums and single to United Artists for release in Britain around this time, the first with an alternative cover featuring sleeve notes by Hawkwind's Dave Brock, hoping to mirror the success of other German bands, such as Faust and Tangerine Dream, but unfortunately sales failed to match their German counterparts. The second side of Neu! 2 has become notorious in the music press since its release. It features various tape manipulated versions of the two tracks from the Super/Neuschnee single released the previous summer. There have been several conflicting explanations as to why this was done, the most quoted being Dinger's assertion that: \\"When the money ran out, I got the idea of taking the single, play around with it and put the results on side 2 of the album.\\" However, this has recently been contested by Rother, who claims that the second side was made to aggravate their record label, who they felt had insufficiently promoted the original release of the Super/Neuschnee single, and not as a result of financial problems. Either way, the second side of the album was poorly received by fans who thought, according to Rother, that \\"we were making fun of them.\\" This issue contributed to the widening gap between Dinger and Rother, both creatively and personally. Dinger later said of the issue: 1973‚Äì1975: Neu! and La D√ºsseldorf Following the release of Neu! 2, Brain still expected the group to tour in support of the album, but the failure of the previous year's tour prompted Dinger and Rother to seek a new backing band and tour venues. To this end, Dinger travelled to London with his brother Thomas to try and organise a Neu! tour there. Although the visit was planned to last only six weeks or so, the Dinger brothers failed to return, staying for substantially longer. Despite this they achieved, in Dinger's words, \\"nothing,\\" having met both John Peel and Karen Townshend (wife of Pete) and presented them with copies of Neu!'s debut, but - in spite of receiving an enthusiastic response from Peel, who played several tracks from the album on his BBC Radio 1 show - failed to drum up any commercial interest in the band. Meanwhile, in Germany, Michael Rother had travelled to the famous Forst Commune, in an attempt to recruit Dieter Moebius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius of Cluster to play in an extended Neu! line-up. Rother, who unlike Dinger was interested in the Krautrock scene contemporary with Neu!, had been impressed by the track \\"Im S√ºden\\" from Cluster's second album Cluster II. He at first envisaged a Neu!‚ÄìCluster super-group, containing Dinger, Moebius, Roedelius and himself. After an initial jam between Moebius, Roedelius and Rother at Forst (captured in the track \\"Ohrwurm\\" on Harmonia's debut) Rother decided to stay at Forst and prepare a new album with Moebius and Roedelius as Harmonia, essentially abandoning his work with Dinger. Rother keeps a studio at Forst to this day. Whilst Rother was at Forst, the Dinger brothers returned from London. Whilst in London, Dinger too had come up with a solution to Neu!'s problems, hoping to expand Neu!'s line-up to contain his brother and studio engineer Hans Lampe. Lampe had worked as Conny Plank's assistant throughout much of 1972, and was keenly interested in Neu!, having engineered Neu! 2 with Plank. Dinger began taking guitar lessons, in the hope that he would be able to take up the role of frontman in a new Neu!, with Rother on lead guitar and Thomas Dinger and Lampe both on drums: \\"During the recording of NEU! 2 I realized that I had done everything that I could do with drumming [...] I wanted to be more concreted and to reach more people.\\" In anticipation of this new line-up, the Dinger brothers and Lampe played several small concerts under the name La D√ºsseldorf whilst Rother remained at Forst. Rother's continued absence was the cause of many problems, as Dinger was at this point far from proficient at guitar. That summer the trio travelled to Forst to meet Rother. Finding him entrenched in the recording of Musik von Harmonia and the Cluster album Zuckerzeit, Dinger attempted to convince his ex-bandmate of a Harmonia-La D√ºsseldorf supergroup which would include himself, Rother, Moebius, Roedelius, Lampe and Thomas Dinger, but this suggestion was rebuked by Rother, who no longer wished to have any involvement with Neu!. Dinger returned to D√ºsseldorf disheartened, and immediately began to work on projects of his own. With the help of his friends from the D√ºsseldorf commune, Dinger set up the short-lived Dingerland Records. The label, which had its logo designed by Dinger's friend, the artist Achim Duchow (who would later design the La D√ºsseldorf logo) released only one album, \\"I'm Not Afraid to Say \\"Yes\\"\\" by the Lilac Angels. Dinger remembers: Although releases by Eberhard Kranemann and Achim Duchow had been intended for the label, neither made it into print (although Kranemann's album \\"Fritz M√ºller Rock\\" was released by the \\"R√∂the Hande\\" label in 1977). The Lilac Angels did not disband, but released a further two albums, meeting moderate popular acclaim in Germany. 1974 was also the year that Dinger's relationship with Anita finally ended. He has since maintained that she was \\"the love of my life\\" and continued to write songs addressed to her well into the 1990s. Shortly after the collapse of Dingerland, Brain Records began enquiring after the third album Neu! were contracted to produce. In 1971 Dinger and Rother had agreed to a four-year contract with Brain, which specified that three albums be made, and the label, which was itself in financial difficulty, demanded that a final album be made. By late 1974 Harmonia had begun to factionalise, Rother preferring a more guitar driven sound and extensive touring, whilst Moebius and Roedelius favoured the electronic sound that characterised Cluster, and resented Rother's attempts to transform Harmonia from an art-orientated to a pop-orientated ensemble. Consequently, Rother was well placed to return to D√ºsseldorf in late 1974, to perform with the three members of La D√ºsseldorf in concert as Neu!. A live version of Hero was recorded for television, and is widely available on the internet. The performance highlights the disparity and enmity between Dinger and Rother, with Dinger playing guitar at the front of the stage, theatrically singing his lyrics, and Rother sat behind the stage machines, quietly providing the track's lead guitar parts. The recording of Neu! '75, the last of Neu!'s original studio albums, was begun in December 1974 at Conny's studio in Cologne. Like Neu! 2 the album has a definite binary nature, with the first side recorded by the original duo of Dinger and Rother, the second by the expanded four-part Neu!-La D√ºsseldorf supergroup. Dinger recognised this duality, admitting that \\"me and Michael drift[ed] apart,\\" but Rother maintains that \\"it was the combination of our two strengths which made the magic.\\" Either way, Dinger's apparent contribution to \\"Rother's\\" side of the album is limited to the drums on Isi and Seeland plus and vocals on Leb' Wohl, whilst Rother's contribution to the \\"La D√ºsseldorf\\" side is two guitar solos, on Hero and After Eight respectively. The soft-loud dynamic of the album's two sides have directly influenced many artists since, most notably David Bowie, who used the inverse of that format on his albums Low and \\"Heroes\\". Neu! '75 is considered Neu!'s best album by many. Neu! '75 was also the first album for which Dinger wrote lyrics, and the subject matter was largely his now ended romance with Anita. Hero displays her loss (\\"Honey went to Norway\\"), and Dinger's anger at the music industry following the failure of Dingerland and the insufficient promotion by their record label (\\"Fuck the company, Your only friend is money\\"), whilst After Eight's lyrics feature the repeated refrain \\"Help me through the night\\". The latter is a reference to a recurring dream Dinger had of Anita, which plagued him for many years, and manifest themselves in lyrics such as \\"Come to me\\" (Lieber Honig 1981, 1981), \\"I want to touch you tonight\\" (Touch Me Tonight, 1986) and \\"Jag √Ñlskar Dig\\" (Ich Liebe Dich, 1983). Immediately following the release of Neu! '75, Neu! disbanded. Rother returned to Forst to complete a second album with Harmonia, whilst Dinger continued to tour with La D√ºsseldorf. 1975‚Äì1983: La D√ºsseldorf Having completed his contract with Brain, Dinger left the label and signed to Teldec, a major label in Germany at the time, which specialised in pop music, unlike the more eclectic Brain. Dinger would remain signed to Teldec until he was dramatically dropped in 1984. Dinger spent the summer of 1975 improving his guitar playing and writing lyrics, intending to turn La D√ºsseldorf into a viable pop group. It was also in this period that Dinger began to use his signature Open-E tuning for the guitar, which would remain his tuning of favour for the rest of his career. Dinger's guitar playing, at first criticised as amateurish, developed in time to be as simplistic yet rhythmically advanced as his drumming, and Dinger never played a full drum kit on record again until 1998's Year of the Tiger. In September 1975, La D√ºsseldorf entered the studio to begin recording their debut album, retaining Conny Plank as producer and featuring the same line-up as played on Neu! '75 (minus Rother) with the addition of ex-Thirsty Moon bass player Harald Konietzko for the album's B-side. The album took the longest to record of any Dinger album yet made, sessions lasting until December 1975, and this is reflected in a higher quality of production, with multiple overdubs of guitar, organ and synthesiser created. The music featured on La D√ºsseldorf is far more commercial than the La D√ºsseldorf tracks that had appeared on Neu! '75. Whilst the latter can be described as proto-punk, tracks like D√ºsseldorf and Silver Cloud lean further towards the sound of post-punk and is greatly influenced by Kraftwerk's album Autobahn which had achieved commercial success worldwide in 1974. Like Autobahn, the album was very successful in Germany, but was unfortunately not marketed abroad. La D√ºsseldorf's lead single ‚Äî Silver Cloud ‚Äî reached number 2 on the German hit parade on its release in early 1976, an achievement all the more striking given that the song was instrumental. The album itself was released by Teldec in the summer of 1976, with all tracks written by Dinger. The personnel listing also featured a \\"Nicolas van Rhein\\" on keyboards, a pseudonym that Dinger would continue to use (sometimes insincerely) for the rest of his career, although more commonly spelled using the Dutch version \\"Niklaus van Rheijn\\" after Dinger's relocation to The Netherlands. La D√ºsseldorf's success turned the band members into celebrities with the band \\"logo sprayed all over D√ºsseldorf streets\\" by fans, and Thomas becoming \\"one of the most glamorous people in D√ºsseldorf.\\" All three band members began wearing White Overalls, a uniform Dinger had kept since before the advent of Neu!: La D√ºsseldorf also maintained a feeling of unity and coherence as a band which had been visibly lacking in Neu!: \\"We didn't live together but we were always together and we felt the same.\\" The commercial success of their debut album made the band wealthy enough for to be able to create their own studio in D√ºsseldorf, and from 1976 the band dispensed with Conny Plank, preferring to produce their own material, Hans being a trained studio engineer. Their new facilities were soon put to use, as the band began to record a follow up to La D√ºsseldorf. The album Viva took shape over a period of a year and a half, studio time no longer being an issue for the band. The album is markedly more commercial than its predecessor, and was specifically aimed at foreign markets‚Äîespecially Britain and America‚Äî, most of the lyrics being in English (although French, Italian and German lyrics also featured). However, the international success Teldec anticipated never materialised, as the label's foreign distributor went bust just before Viva's release. As a result, the promised release of both Viva and La D√ºsseldorf abroad only occurred in the UK (where the debut was released by Decca and its follow-up by Radar, and some foreign fans who had pre-ordered the albums were left un-refunded. Viva sold well within Germany however (over 150,000 copies), and is considered by some to be La D√ºsseldorf's finest album. It was preceded by the release of the single Rheinita, which although reached only number 3 on the hit parade, far outsold its predecessor Silver Cloud. The single was voted \\"track of the year\\" by several German radio stations, and stayed at number one on some unofficial charts for over a year. Like Silver Cloud, it was an instrumental, dominated by rhapsodic melodies played in diatonic thirds, which would become a familiar mode in Dinger's music from then on. The track's title alluded to Dinger's two great loves: the Rhein and his departed Lieber Honig Anita. The great commercial success of both the album and the single prompted La D√ºsseldorf to perform in concert, something which they had avoided up until then due to their music's heavily overdubbed nature and the fact that Klaus played all instruments except drums, making concerts a practical impossibility. Nevertheless, they made several TV appearances in which they mimed their performances. A recording of their \\"performance\\" of Rheinita at a free concert in D√ºsseldorf in 1979 is widely available on the internet. Viva also saw the first release of a song which would become a concert (and studio) staple for Dinger over the years: Cha Cha 2000. The song‚Äîtwenty minutes in length on Viva, taking up the entire of side two‚Äîexplores in its lyrics Dinger's vision of paradise \\"where the air is clean / and the grass is green,\\" although Dinger paradoxically implores his listeners to \\"stop smoking and doping;\\" activities in which all three members of the band had engaged copiously since the early 70s. The central section of the song features a lengthy piano solo by Andreas Schell; a new recruit to the band. Despite appearing on Viva far less than Harald Konietzko, Schell seems to have been adopted as the band's fourth member, appearing in publicity shoots and many of the polariods that make up the Viva gatefold photo-montage. In 1979 the \\"maxi-single\\" version of Rheinita was released, attracting the attention of EMI, who made the group a 1 million mark offer, which they subsequently refused. The increasing wealth the band was generating began to cause tensions amongst the band members: The recording sessions for a follow up to Viva: Individuellos, were soured by arguments, and the band's popularity decreased in the wake of the Neue Deutsche Welle phenomenon, with bands such as Einst√ºrzende Neubauten creating music that was drastically at odds with that of La D√ºsseldorf (although other bands such as Rheingold actively imitated La D√ºsseldorf's style). These issues were compacted by the suicide of Andreas Schell (who was due to feature more prominently on the album) in 1980, midway through the sessions. Schell's loss was heavily mourned, and the sleeve of Individuellos features a tribute to him. The album was never completed, partly as a consequence of Schell's death, and is far less professionally made as a result. As on Neu! 2, Dinger opted to recycle various versions of the same song on the album, with the melody of \\"Menschen\\" featuring on \\"Menschen 1\\", \\"Menschen 2\\", \\"Lieber Honig 1981\\", and played backwards on both \\"Sentimental\\" and \\"Flashback\\". The latter two tracks are abstract tape collages, and given that much of the album's second side was given over to overtly humorous and playful faux-oompah pieces, the content of Individuellos is often seen as slim. Despite this, the album has recently become critically popular, with Stephen Thrower commenting that: \\"[Individuellos] is equally as good as Viva, and it actually has a streak of experimentalism that takes it further out than the other two [La D√ºsseldorf albums].\\"\\"Krautrock: Cosmic Rock and its Legacy\\": Black Dog Publishing, 2010, p. 113 Released in December 1980, the album sold poorly, and the single \\"Dampfriemen\\" failed to chart. The album was the first La D√ºsseldorf album to feature songs credited to others than Klaus Dinger, with the jam \\"Das Yv√∂nchen\\" credited equally to the Dinger brothers, Lampe and Schell and Thomas Dinger receiving a co-credit with Klaus on \\"Dampfriemen\\" and a solo credit on \\"Tintarella Di...\\". The degree to which the other band members contributed to La D√ºsseldorf's output during the band's existence led Klaus to court several times in the 1980s. The production of Individuellos was immediately followed by that of a Thomas Dinger solo album: F√ºr Mich. F√ºr Mich featured both Klaus and Hans Lampe as co-producers, and Hans on drums. Stylistically similar to the Thomas Dinger-written tracks on Individuellos, it exhibits the electronic sound the band would adopt more and more in their final years. In 1983 the Dinger brothers moved their studio from D√ºsseldorf to Zeeland, on the Dutch coast. Their parents, Heinz and Renate, kept a holiday home just outside the village of Kamperland, and the adjoining barn was converted into a studio. Dinger would keep a studio there for the rest of his life, first christening it Langeweg Studios after the road on which it sat, and then Zeeland Studios, which it was most commonly known as from the 1990s onwards. With the studio being built and preparations being made for a fourth La D√ºsseldorf album (which had been announced the previous year, in accordance with a renewal of the band's contract with Teldec) Hans Lampe began to take part less and less in sessions. Like the recording of Individuellos, the period was marked by arguments between band members, and by the time of the band's next record, Hans Lampe had left the group. However, La D√ºsseldorf had not split up, and the Dinger brothers continued as a duo for several months, preparing the fourth album. To this end a single was released in 1983: \\"Ich Liebe Dich\\". More electronic in feel than the band's previous singles, but along the same lines as Rheinita. It was written by Klaus alone, but the B-side, \\"Kokskn√∂del\\", was composed instrumentally by Thomas (and is similar in sound to \\"F√ºr Mich\\") with lyrics written by Klaus. This was to be the brothers' final collaboration until 1998's Goldregen, as Thomas finally left the group in late 1983. The songs written for the proposed fourth album, including a reworked version of \\"Ich Liebe Dich\\", were to be included on Klaus's debut solo album N√©ondian. The acrimony of the split was reflected in a series of legal battles fought between band members until a settlement was finally reached in 1997. 1984‚Äì1987: N√©ondian, Neu! 4 and Blue In the wake of Thomas' departure, Dinger fled to Zeeland, where he began recording what he envisaged to be a fourth La D√ºsseldorf album alone. All of the album's songs had already been written, and one, \\"Ich Liebe Dich\\", was already released as a single under the La D√ºsseldorf name. The basic tracks for the upcoming album were recorded by Dinger in early 1984, to be mixed and overdubbed by other musicians later on. The album's subject matter is largely darker than Dinger's previous three albums, mirroring changes in German culture. Like contemporary bands such as D.A.F., Dinger wrote of America's political and cultural hegemony over the western world, often comparing the policies of Ronald Reagan to those of the Nazis (\\"Heil Ronald!\\" is a lyric from the song Pipi AA). Dinger also criticises the commercialism and inhumanity of society (\\"Businessmen verkauft die Welt / Tod und Leben gegen Geld\\" ‚Äî Businessmen sell the earth / Death and life versus money). By far the most famous (and inflammatory) song to come from N√©ondian is America, an anti-US pop song, which Warner refused to print the lyrics of in the album's official CD re- release. Perhaps the most striking lyrics are \\"Don't say you fight for freedom / You stole all your land from Indians / In a holocaust / And you still do!\\" This reflects Dinger's outrage at the Reagan administration's treatment of Native American Indians, and issue which he was passionate about, and for which the album is named (N√©on = Neon (urban), -dian = Indian (Dinger felt himself persecuted by popular culture)). The album cover art features visual representations of many of these themes, Dinger having a white feather stuck to his head with a sticking plaster, and the lid of a Coca-Cola bottle stuck to the photo. The absence of Dinger's usual studio engineer, Hans Lampe, meant that a substitute had to be found, and as a result Conny Plank was welcomed back to produce the album (having last worked with Dinger in 1976). The studio musicians brought in to overdub Dinger's basic recordings included ex-Kowalski guitarist Rudiger Elze (known as \\"Spinello\\"), Belfegore bassist Raoul Walton and drummer Charly Therstappen, who would all collaborate with Dinger for the next four years (and longer in the case of Elze). Jaki Liebezeit of Can also featured briefly, being credited with \\"percussion\\" on Mon Amour. The album is arguably the most electronic Dinger would ever make, a fact that has earned it a bad reputation. Dinger later said (somewhat paradoxically) that: \\"...I find mechanical music unacceptable, there must be something human and tangible about recorded music.\\" By 1985 the N√©ondian material was ready for release, but the process was stimied by the intervention of Thomas Dinger and Hans Lampe. Dinger's ex-bandmates objected to the new album being released under the La D√ºsseldorf name, and took him to court over the matter. Teldec was eager to make the release quickly, and so put the LP out before the court case was heard, under the name \\"Klaus Dinger + Rheinita Bella D√ºsseldorf\\", hoping to attract La D√ºsseldorf fans by the obvious allusion to Rheinita. The single Mon Amour/America was also released, and jointly they were the first releases by Dinger to appear on CD. Like Ich Liebe Dich and Dampfriemen, the new single failed to chart, but more worryingly for Teldec, the album sales were the lowest of any of Dinger's album's to date, undoubtedly harmed by the name change. In reaction to this, the album was withdrawn from production after only a week, much to Dinger's outrage. As few music retailers had bought up stocks of the record, first-printing copies of the album are extremely rare. The music videos which had been recorded for both America and Ich Liebe Dich were never released, although Dinger incorporated stills into the CD booklets of both Blue (released 1999) and the re-release of N√©ondian ‚Äî Mon Amour (released 2006). With the La D√ºsseldorf name blocked, Dinger turned back to his first successful project: Neu!. Since the group disbanded in 1975, Michael Rother had recorded a further two albums with Harmonia and five solo albums. The recording of the last of these, Lust, had coicided with the recording of N√©ondian. Conny Plank had worked with Rother on his first three studio albums, as had Jaki Liebezeit, and both had also appeared on N√©ondian. As a result, Dinger was well connected with Michael Rother in 1985, and an arrangements were made for a Neu! reunion album, and supporting tour. Dinger and Rother were unable to secure the help of Conny Plank‚Äîvital as a \\"mediator\\"‚Äîwho was engaged with Dieter Moebius in a world tour as Moebius & Plank. Recording thus began in Dinger's D√ºsseldorf studios (named \\"Im Gr√ºnd\\" here and elsewhere) in late 1985. Sessions were troubled, not least by the difficult relationship Dinger and Rother maintained. Dinger also disliked Rother's new style of music, exhibited on Lust, which forwent guitar for synthesizers: \\"One of the reasons the spark did not jump during the recordings with Michael Rother in '85 [was that] he had to search so long to find a guitar, so in the end he stuck to his Fairlight [synthesizer].\\" After several weeks of recording, sessions began to break down, and by early 1986 the project had been abandoned. The album was partly finished, with the songs \\"Good Life\\", \\"Crazy\\", \\"D√§nzing\\" and \\"La Bomba (Stop Apartheid World Wide!)\\" being complete. However, this amounted only to half of a potential album, with the remainder of material being unfinished and fragmentary, lacking vocals, instrumental overdubs, or both. Dinger and Rother sealed the master reels with wax, intending to resume sessions at a later date. Dinger moved back to Zeeland with M√¢ri and her children, decorating and furnishing the old farmhouse as a permanent family home. Here, Dinger worked on a number of tracks he had roughly recorded alone after the release of Neondian. These tracks would eventually come to constitute the album Blue, which was released in 1999 on Captain Trip Records. La! Neu? La! Neu? is a later project that Dinger headed. Through the mid-1990s, the group released albums on Captain Trip Records, the label that also issued the \\"semi-official\\" recordings Neu! 4 and Neu! '72 Live! (both of which were released without Rother's consent). Death Dinger died on 21 March 2008, three days before his 62nd birthday, of heart failure.

He was a monk of Trois- Fontaines Abbey in the diocese of Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne. He died after 1252. He wrote a chronicle describing world events from the Creation to the year 1241. Life and works Alberic was likely from a noble Liege family which could afford a good education for him. He became a monk of Trois-Fontaines Abbey no later than 1230.

His sources also included the universal chronicle of Sigebert of Gembloux and Books 45-49 of Helinand of Froidmont's Chronicon. Alberic's chronicle describes world events from the Creation and contains original writing starting from 674, when (according to the chronicle) the relics of St. Benedict were moved from a monastery in Monte Cassino to the Fleury Abbey on the banks of the Loire. The chronicle ends abruptly with a description of the transfer of the body of Jacques de Vitry (d. 1240) to the Oignies Abbey in 1241.

At the time, American cowboys had to work long hours in the saddle and often over rough terrain, sometimes having to rope a cattle using a lariat, also known as a lasso. Because of the necessity to control the horse with one hand and use a lariat with the other, western horses were trained to neck rein, that is, to change direction with light pressure of a rein against the horse's neck. Horses were also trained to exercise a certain degree of independence in using their natural instincts to follow the movements of a cow, thus a riding style developed that emphasized a deep, secure seat, and training methods encouraged a horse to be responsive on very light rein contact. Though there are significant differences in equipment, there are fewer differences between English and Western riding than appear at first glance. When comparing Western riding or English riding, the first, and biggest difference is the saddles used. The Western saddle is designed to be larger and heavier than an English saddle, which is designed to be smaller and lighter. The western saddle allows the weight of the rider to be spread over a larger area of the horse's back which makes it more comfortable, especially for long days chasing cows. The English saddle, however, is designed to allow the rider to have closer contact with the horse's back (Wilson, 2003). Another difference is that English riding involves the rider having direct contact with the horse's mouth via reins and the reins are used as part of an ‚Äúaid.‚Äù In western riding, however, horses are mainly ridden with little to no contact with the riders using their seat, weight and neck reining to give aid or instructions in direction, etc., to the horse. In both Western and English riding, however, involve the rider sitting tall and straight in the saddle with their legs hanging naturally against the horse's sides as well as their arms relaxed and against their side, but not flapping, which is frowned against (Wilson, 2003). \\"Western Riding\\" is also the name for a specific event within western competition where a horse performs a pattern that combines trail and reining elements. Tack and equipment A western-style bridle with a browband and decorative snaffle bit A western saddle A horse wearing a bosal hackamore Detail of a western curb bit breast collar, used to help keep the saddle from slipping. This refined design is suitable for show, working horses wear a heavier design A set of romal style reins A set of split reins Today's western saddles have been greatly influenced by the Spanish Vaquero who were Cowboys. When the first saddle was developed, it didn't have a horn which was later invented by the Spanish and Mexican vaqueros (Kelly, 2011). The needs of the cowboy's job required different tack than was used in \\"English\\" disciplines. Covering long distances, and working with half-wild cattle, frequently at high speeds in very rough, brushy terrain, meant the ever-present danger of a rider becoming unseated in an accident miles from home and support. Thus, the most noticeable equipment difference is in the saddle, which has a heavy and substantial tree (traditionally made of wood) to absorb the shock of roping. The western saddle features a prominent pommel topped by a horn that came about through trial and error for developing an efficient way of towing livestock (Kelly, 2011). The horn is the easiest way to identify a western saddle. It allows the rider support and can be used for a lasso or other equipment (Gen, 2011). The western saddle also consist of a deep seat and a high cantle. Depending on the local geography, tapaderos (\\"taps\\") cover the front of the stirrups to prevent brush from catching in the stirrups. Cowboy boots have somewhat more pointed toes and higher heels than a traditional work boot, modifications designed to prevent the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall and being dragged. To allow for communication with the horse even with a loose rein, the bridle also evolved. The biggest difference between \\"English\\" and \\"Western\\" bridles is the bit. Most finished \\"Western\\" horses are expected to eventually perform in a curb bit with a single pair of reins that has somewhat longer and looser shanks than the curb of an English Double bridle or a pelham bit. Different types of reins have developed over the years. Split reins, which are the most commonly used type of rein in the western industry, Mecates, which are a single rein that are used on California hackamores, Romal reins, also known as romals, which is a type of rein that has two distinct and balanced parts which are the reins and romal connected with a short strap and roping reins which are a single rein that varies in length and is often used in roping and other speed events (Tack, 2017). Young horses are usually started under saddle with either a simple snaffle bit, or with the classic tool of the vaquero, the bosal-style hackamore. Rider attire The clothing of the Western rider differs from that of the \\"English\\" style dressage, hunt seat or Saddle seat rider. Practical Western attire consists of a long-sleeved work shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed cowboy hat. Usually, a rider wears protective leather leggings called \\"chaps\\" (from the Spanish chaparajos; often pronounced \\"shaps\\") to help the rider stick to the saddle and to protect the legs when riding through brush. Clean, well-fitting work clothing is the usual outfit seen in rodeo, cutting and reining competitions, especially for men, though sometimes in brighter colors or finer fabrics. Show equipment Some competitive events may use flashier equipment. Unlike the English traditions where clothing and tack is quiet and unobtrusive, Western show equipment is intended to draw attention. Saddles, bits and bridles are frequently ornamented with substantial amounts of silver. The rider's shirt is often replaced with a jacket, and women's clothing, in particular, may feature vivid colors and even, depending on current fads, rhinestones or sequins. Hats and chaps are often color-coordinated, spurs and belt buckles are often silver-plated, and women's scarf pins and, when worn, men's bolo ties are also ornamented with silver or even semi-precious gemstones. Western competitive events Competition for western riders at horse shows and related activities include in the following events: * Western pleasure - the rider must show the horse together with other horses in an arena at a walk, jog (a slow, controlled trot), and lope (a slow, controlled canter). In some breed competitions, a judge may ask for an extended canter and/or a hand gallop, and, less often, an extension of the jog. The horse must remain under control on a loose rein, with low head carriage, the rider directing the horse with nearly invisible aids and minimal interference. *Reining - considered by some the \\"dressage\\" of the western riding world, with FEI-recognized status as a new international discipline at the World Equestrian Games. Reining is judged based on the horse and rider's ability to perform the maneuverers in an assigned pattern. The maneuvers consist of stops, which consist of the horse staying mobile in the front while the hind legs ‚Äúslide‚Äù and the horse lowing its head and neck, spins, which consist of the horse planting one back foot and pivoting on it at a fast speed, circles, which are do be done at the lope, both large fast and small slow, rollbacks, which consist of the horse coming to a stop and then performing a 180-degree turn to the outside and loping off right away and finally, lead changes, which consist of the horse changing leads in the middle of the arena (Fabus and Hartman, 2016). *Cutting - this event highlights the \\"cow sense\\" prized in stock horses. The horse and rider select and separate a cow (or steer) out of small herd of 10‚Äì20 animals. When the cow tries to return to the herd, the rider relaxes the reins and leaves it entirely to the horse to keep the cow from returning to the herd. Depending on the level of competition, one to three judges award points to each competitor. *Working cow horse - also called Reined cow horse. A judged competition that is something of a cross between cutting and reining. A horse and rider teamwork a single cow in an arena, making the cow move in a directed fashion through several maneuvers. *Ranch horse: An event that, depending on breed sanctioning organization, tests multiple categories used by working ranch horses: Ranch riding, which is similar to western pleasure; Ranch trail, testing tasks performed during ranch work, often judged on natural terrain rather than in an arena; Ranch Cutting, judged the same as a cutting event; Working ranch horse, combining Reining, Roping, and working cow horse; and ranch conformation and is judged like a halter class. * \\"Western Riding\\" Western Riding is a class that judges horses on a pattern, evaluating smooth gaits, flying lead changes, responsiveness to the rider, manners, and disposition. *Team penning: a timed event in which a team of 3 riders must select 3 to 5 marked steers out of a herd and drive them into a small pen. The catch: riders cannot close the gate to the pen till they have corralled all the cattle (and only the intended cattle) inside. The fastest team wins, and teams exceeding a given time limit are disqualified. A related event is Ranch sorting *Trail class: in this event, the rider has to maneuver the horse through an obstacle course in a ring. Horses must cross bridges, logs and other obstacles; stand quietly while a rider waves a flapping object around the horse; sidepass (to move sideways), often with front and rear feet on either side or a rail; make 90 and 180 degree turns on the forehand or haunches, back up, sometimes while turning, open and close a gate while mounted, and other maneuvers relevant (distantly) to everyday ranch or trail riding. While speed isn't judged, horses have a limited amount of time to complete each obstacle and can be penalized for refusing an obstacle or exceeding the allotted time. * Halter - also sometimes called \\"conformation\\" or \\"breeding\\" classes, the conformation of the horse is judged, with emphasis on both the movement and build of the horse. The horse is not ridden, but is led, shown in a halter by a handler controlling the horse from the ground using a lead rope. * Halter Showmanship, also called (depending on region, breed, and rule book followed) Showmanship at Halter, Youth Showmanship, Showmanship in-hand or Fitting and Showmanship - In showmanship classes the performance of the handler is judged, as well as the cleanliness and grooming of horse, equipment and handler's attire, with the behavior of the horse also considered part of the handler's responsibility. The competitor is judged on his or her ability to fit and present the halter horse to its best advantage. The horse is taken through a short pattern where the horse and handler must set up the horse correctly at a standstill and exhibit full control while at a walk, jog, turning and in more advanced classes, pivoting and backing up. Clothing of the handlers tends to parallel that of western pleasure competition. Halters are leather ornamented with silver. Showmanship classes are popular at a wide range of levels, from children who do not yet have the skill or confidence to succeed in riding events, to large and competitive classes at the highest levels of national show competition. Western equitation Western equitation (sometimes called western horsemanship, stock seat equitation, or, in some classes, reining seat equitation) competitions are judged at the walk, jog, and lope in both directions. Riders must sit to the jog and never post. In a Western equitation class a rider may be asked to perform a test or pattern, used to judge the rider's position and control of the horse. Tests may be as simple as jogging in a circle or backing up, or as complex as a full reining pattern, and may include elements such as transitions from halt to lope or lope to halt, sliding stops, a figure-8 at the lope with simple or flying change of lead, serpentines at the lope with flying changes, the rein back, a 360-degree or greater spin or pivot, and the rollback. Riders must use a western saddle and a curb bit, and may only use one hand to hold the reins while riding. Two hands are allowed if the horse is ridden in a snaffle bit or hackamore, which are only permitted for use on \\"junior\\" horses, defined differently by various breed associations, but usually referring to horses four or five years of age and younger. Horses are not allowed to wear a noseband or cavesson, nor any type of protective boot or bandage, except during some tests that require a reining pattern. Riders are allowed two different styles of reins: 1) split reins, which are not attached to one another, and thus the rider is allowed to place one finger between the reins to aid in making adjustments; and 2) \\"romal reins,\\" which are joined together and have a romal (a type of long quirt) on the end, which the rider holds in their non-reining hand, with at least 16 inches of slack between the two, and the rider is not allowed to place a finger between the reins. The correct position for this discipline, as in all forms of riding, is a balanced seat. This is seen when a bystander can run an imaginary straight line that passes through the rider's ear, shoulder, hip, and heel. This means the rider's feet and legs must hang directly in balance so that the heel hits this line, with heels down. The rider should also be sitting as straight as possible, but with their hips under their body, sitting firmly on their seat bones, not sitting on one's crotch with an arched back. The rider should have their weight sunk into their seat and distributed through their legs. The rider's shoulders should be rolled back and their chin up to show that they are looking forward. The western style is seen in a long stirrup length, often longer than even that used by dressage riders, an upright posture (equitation riders are never to lean forward beyond a very slight inclination), and the distinctive one-handed hold on the reins. The reining hand should be bent at the elbow, held close to the rider's side, and centered over the horse's neck, usually within an inch of the saddle horn. Due to the presence of the saddle horn, a true straight line between rider's hand and horse's mouth is usually not possible. Common faults of western riders include slouching, hands that are too high or too low, and poor position, particularly a tendency to sit on the horse as if they were sitting in a chair, with their feet stuck too far forward. While this \\"feet on the dashboard\\" style is used by rodeo riders to stay on a bucking horse, it is in practice an ineffective way to ride.

Taningia danae is named after Danish fisheries biologist √Öge Vedel T√•ning (1890‚Äì1958), who often traveled on the research vessel Dana. Hunting behaviour and bioluminescence In 2005, a Japanese research team headed by Tsunemi Kubodera managed to film T. danae in its natural habitat for the first time. The video footage, shot in deep water off Chichi-jima in the northern Pacific Ocean, shows T. danae emitting blinding flashes of light from photophores on its arms as it attacks its prey. It is believed that this highly maneuverable squid uses the bright flashes to disorientate potential prey. These flashes may also serve to illuminate the prey to make for easier capture as well as a courtship and territorial display.Kubodera, T., Y. Koyama & K. Mori 2006. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 274(1613): 1029‚Äì1034. As well as a predatorial characteristic, Dana bioluminescence has also been suggested to be a defense mechanism. Juveniles of this species have been observed moving rapidly in the direction of potential predators, as if hunting, to disorientate and startle the threat with a mock attack.Young, R.E. & M. Vecchione 1999. Taningia danae Joubin, 1931. Version 1 January 1999. Tree of Life web project.

His father, Ekrem Kem√°l, was a prominent figure in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution as a \\"Sz√©na t√©r\\" revolutionary against Soviet forces. He was executed for his role in the uprising, and is widely considered a martyr amongst the Hungarian far- right. Gy√∂rgy Ekrem-Kem√°l died on June 12, 2009 after a long battle with lung cancer.Meghalt Ekrem-Kem√°l Gy√∂rgy , Index.hu, 2009-06-12 Political Activities On 20 April 1994 (Hitler's birthday), Ekrem-Kem√°l, already a well-known figure in Hungarian far-right circles (mostly due to his father), co-founded the Hungarian Hungarist Movement (, MHM) alongside Istv√°n Gy≈ërk√∂s and Albert Szab√≥. It was a largely unsuccessful attempt to unify the Hungarian far-right under the umbrella of Hungarism, a historical ideological tenet of the Arrow Cross Party, the defunct fascist party that ruled Hungary briefly in 1944 and early 1945. The MHM failed to be cohesive, and, by 1996, the movement had largely scattered due to internal disputes. Ekrem-Kem√°l speaking at a rally in September 2006 In 1996, Ekrem-Kem√°l founded the Association of Those Persecuted by Communism (), a small organization established with the objective of overthrowing the relatively new parliamentary government. The K√úSZ claimed it would undertake these actions in order to continue the legacy of the Arrow Cross Party. Ekrem-Kem√°l was also at one point the leader of the Hungarian National Freedom Party (, MNSZP), another far-right organization. Ekrem-Kem√°l was arrested in 1997 following his connection pipe bomb attacks on the offices of the then ruling Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP). He was found guilty in May 2001 for attempting to organize a coup d'√©tat against the Hungarian constitutional order. The Hungarian Supreme Court reduced his sentence to 4 years of probation on the basis of his movement having a \\"very long shot\\" to achieve its goal.Enyh√≠tett√©k Ekrem Kem√°l b√ºntet√©s√©t , N√©pszabads√°g, 2001-05-25 Ekrem-Kem√°l returned to prominence in 2006 during the 2006 protests in Hungary against the ruling Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP). He joined the Revolutionary National Committee and spoke publicly at the protests in Kossuth Square, calling for the protesters (known as the Kossuth t√©r protesters) to mobilize against the existing government order. The protesters made frequent allusions to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, further connecting Ekrem-Kem√°l, the son of a revolutionary \\"martyr\\", to the action. Ideology Ekrem-Kem√°l's ideology was guided chiefly by \\"Hungarism\\", which traces itself back to the Arrow Cross Party and its leader, Ferenc Sz√°lasi. Hungarism is a fascist ideology characterized by a unique conception of racial superiority (advantageous to Ekrem-Kem√°l) and a conventional fascist grounding in anti-Semitism.

The Good Schools Guide described the school as \\"a friendly school with very good academic standards - ideal for unstuffy girls who enjoy healthy competition and getting stuck into what is on offer.\\"Profile on Good Schools Guide  History  The school was founded in 1725 by a wealthy Chertsey merchant, Sir William Perkins. Originally for twenty five boys, the school extended its education to include twenty-five girls in 1736. It moved to purpose-built accommodation on its present twelve- acre site in 1819. In 1944, the school became a voluntary controlled grammar school for girls maintained by Surrey Education Authority and in 1978 became fully independent as an educational foundation administered by trustees.About When the educational institute became a girls school, there were just two houses: L and P. The girls who were perceived to be more literary from their entrance exam were put into L (Latin) and the girls more inclined towards Mathematics were put into P (Parallel). The additional houses, M and Q, were added in the later formative years of the school that stands today. In 2014, the house names were changed, from single letters to names of famous and intelligent women of Britain: Lonsdale, Montagu, Pankhurst and Quant. Each house bears its own crest and colour: Lonsdale (red), Montagu (yellow), Pankhurst (green) and Quant (blue). Curriculum The 2010 ISI inspection rated the school curriculum as \\"excellent\\". The school has had a tradition of academic excellence and is often at the top of examination result tables in the county. The school adopted the Harkness Table in 2016.

Kowalski at the Elblandfestspielen Wittenberge 2008 Jochen Kowalski (born 30 January 1954) is a German alto or mezzo countertenor, noted for his very rich timbre. Early life Jochen Kowalski was born in Wachow, a small village belonging to the city of Nauen, in East Germany, as the son of a butcher of Polish origin. His parents gave him a musical education. In 1977 he began his studies as a Heldentenor, specializing in Wagner, but when it became clear he was able to sing \\"Che far√≤ senza Euridice?\\" as a stand-in Jochen was sent to Theo Adam and switched to countertenor. Kowalski specialized in baroque and classical music. He received his training at the Hanns Eisler Music Conservatory in East-Berlin, in particular with the vocal pedagogue Marianne Kupfer-Fischer. Career Church in Wachow, where Kowalsky grew up After completing his studies in 1983, Jochen Kowalski was engaged as soloist at the Komische Oper (Comic Opera) in Berlin. In 1984 he sang the title role in Georg Frideric Handel‚Äôs Giustino, staged by Harry Kupfer. The artist drew international attention through his performance of Orpheus in Gluck‚Äôs Orfeo ed Euridice in a new staging of the work in December 1987, and in the travelling production by the Comic Opera in August 1989 in London. Kupfer's Orpheus wears a leather jacket and carries an electric guitar in this innovative interpretation. In 1984, Jochen Kowalski made his debut with the State Opera of Hamburg singing the role of Daniel in G.F. Handel‚Äôs oratorio Belshazzar in Harry Kupfer‚Äôs staged realization under the musical direction of Gerd Albrecht. Since then he has been under contract at the State Opera, where he has also distinguished himself in many solo concerts. In 1987 and 1988, Kowalski appeared at the Netherlands Opera in Amsterdam and the Grand Opera in Paris. He made his debut in the State Opera in Vienna and at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in London in 1991, both times as Prince Orlofsky in Die Fledermaus. He made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1994 in the same role. In 1995 he took part in the Salzburg Festival. He has established a reputation as a concert and oratorio singer in the major musical centres of Europe, the USA and Japan, working with such conductors as Gary Bertini, Neville Marriner, Vittorio Negri, Zubin Mehta, and Nikolaus Harnoncourt, among others. He has performed in Austria, France, Japan, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and the United States and is well received by critics. Kowalski is still a member of the Comic Opera ensemble, and performs in the Volksb√ºhne. One of his favourite singers is Lotte Lehmann; then there are Franz V√∂lker and Fritz Wunderlich.

This is in contrast to symmetric cell divisions which give rise to daughter cells of equivalent fates. Notably, stem cells divide asymmetrically to give rise to two distinct daughter cells: one copy of the original stem cell as well as a second daughter programmed to differentiate into a non-stem cell fate. (In times of growth or regeneration, stem cells can also divide symmetrically, to produce two identical copies of the original cell.) In principle, there are two mechanisms by which distinct properties may be conferred on the daughters of a dividing cell. In one, the daughter cells are initially equivalent but a difference is induced by signaling between the cells, from surrounding cells, or from the precursor cell. This mechanism is known as extrinsic asymmetric cell division. In the second mechanism, the prospective daughter cells are inherently different at the time of division of the mother cell. Because this latter mechanism does not depend on interactions of cells with each other or with their environment, it must rely on intrinsic asymmetry. The term asymmetric cell division usually refers to such intrinsic asymmetric divisions.  Intrinsic asymmetry  In order for asymmetric division to take place the mother cell must be polarized, and the mitotic spindle must be aligned with the axis of polarity. The cell biology of these events has been most studied in three animal models: the mouse, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. A later focus has been on development in spiralia.  In C. elegans development  Asymmetric cell divisions during the first steps of the embryogenesis of C. elegans In C. elegans, a series of asymmetric cell divisions in the early embryo are critical in setting up the anterior/posterior, dorsal/ventral, and left/right axes of the body plan.G√∂nczy, P. and Rose, L.S. Asymmetric cell division and axis formation in the embryo (October 15, 2005), WormBook, ed. The C. elegans Research Community, WormBook, doi/10.1895/wormbook.1.30.1, After fertilization, events are already occurring in the zygote to allow for the first asymmetric cell division. This first division produces two distinctly different blastomeres, termed AB and P1. When the sperm cell fertilizes the egg cell, the sperm pronucleus and centrosomes are deposited within the egg, which causes a cytoplasmic flux resulting in the movement of the pronucleus and centrosomes towards one pole.Goldstein, B, Hird, SN. \\"Specification of the anteroposterior axis in Caenorhabditis elegans.\\" Development 1996. 122:1467‚Äì74. The centrosomes deposited by the sperm are responsible for the establishment of the posterior pole within the zygote. Sperm with mutant or absent centrosomes fail to establish a posterior pole. The establishment of this polarity initiates the polarized distribution of a group of proteins present in the zygote called the PARD proteins (partitioning defective), which are a conserved group of proteins that function in establishing cell polarity during development. These proteins are initially distributed uniformly throughout the zygote and then become polarized with the creation of the posterior pole. This series of events allows the single celled zygote to obtain polarity through an unequal distribution of multiple factors. The single cell is now set up to undergo an asymmetric cell division, however the orientation in which the division occurs is also an important factor. The mitotic spindle must be oriented correctly to ensure that the proper cell fate determinants are distributed appropriately to the daughter cells. The alignment of the spindle is mediated by the PARD proteins, which regulate the positioning of the centrosomes along the A/P axis as well as the movement of the mitotic spindle along the A/P axis.G√∂nczy, P. and Rose, L.S. Asymmetric cell division and axis formation in the embryo (October 15, 2005), WormBook, ed. The C. elegans Research Community, WormBook, Following this first asymmetric division, the AB daughter cell divides symmetrically, giving rise to ABa and ABp, while the P1 daughter cell undergoes another asymmetric cell division to produce P2 and EMS. This division is also dependent on the distribution of the PAR proteins.  In Drosophila neural development  Numb (blue) is asymmetrically distributed within the neuroblast. Following cell division, the GMC contains the Numb protein which suppresses Notch signaling. The other daughter cell is receptive to Notch signaling, causing distinct cellular responses, and ultimately two distinct cell fates between the daughter cells. In Drosophila melanogaster, asymmetric cell division plays an important role in neural development. Neuroblasts are the progenitor cells which divide asymmetrically to give rise to another neuroblast and a ganglion mother cell (GMC). The neuroblast repeatedly undergoes this asymmetric cell division while the GMC continues on to produce a pair of neurons. Two proteins play an important role in setting up this asymmetry in the neuroblast, Prospero and Numb. These proteins are both synthesized in the neuroblast and segregate into only the GMC during divisions. Numb is a suppressor of Notch, therefore the asymmetric segregation of Numb to the basal cortex biases the response of the daughter cells to Notch signaling, resulting in two distinct cell fates. Prospero is required for gene regulation in GMCs. It is equally distributed throughout the neuroblast cytoplasm, but becomes localized at the basal cortex when the neuroblast starts to undergo mitosis. Once the GMC buds off from the basal cortex, Prospero becomes translocated into the GMC nucleus to act as a transcription factor. Other proteins present in the neuroblast mediate the asymmetric localization of Numb and Prospero. Miranda is an anchoring protein that binds to Prospero and keeps it in the basal cortex. Following the generation of the GMC, Miranda releases Prospero and then becomes degraded. The segregation of Numb is mediated by Pon (the partner of Numb protein). Pon binds to Numb and colocalizes with it during neuroblast cell division. The mitotic spindle must also align parallel to the asymmetrically distributed cell fate determinants to allow them to become segregated into one daughter cell and not the other. The mitotic spindle orientation is mediated by Inscuteable, which is segregated to the apical cortex of the neuroblast. Without the presence of Inscuteable, the positioning of the mitotic spindle and the cell fate determinants in relationship to each other becomes randomized. Inscuteable mutants display a uniform distribution of Miranda and Numb at the cortex, and the resulting daughter cells display identical neuronal fates.  In spiralian development  Spiralia (commonly synonymous with lophotrochozoa) represent a diverse clade of animals whose species comprise the bulk of the bilaterian animals present today. Examples include mollusks, annelid worms, and the entoprocta. Although much is known at the cellular and molecular level about the other bilateralian clades (ecdysozoa and deuterostomia), research into the processes that govern spiralian development is comparatively lacking. However, one unifying feature shared among spiralia is the pattern of cleavage in the early embryo known as spiral cleavage. Mechanisms of asymmetric division (See Figure, right panel): Asymmetric cell division is integral during development. In spiralia, the first cleavage can be either symmetric or asymmetric, as shown in the left panel. Asymmetry can be accomplished through simple unequal segregation of cell fate determinants across a single plane, through sequestration of cell fate determinants in a polar lobe which is absorbed by one of the daughter cells, or a combination of both processes. The right panel summarizes the mechanisms of spiralian asymmetric cleavage discussed here. Red features indicate the molecule(s) implicated in establishing asymmetry. *Tubifex tubifex: The sludge worm Tubifex tubifex has been shown to demonstrate an interesting asymmetric cell division at the point of first embryonic cleavage. Unlike the classic idea of cortical differences at the zygotic membrane that determine spindle asymmetry in the C. elegans embryo, the first cleavage in tubifex relies on the number of centrosomes. Embryos inherit a single centrosome which localizes in the prospective larger CD cell cytoplasm and emits radial microtubules during anaphase that contribute to both the mitotic spindle as well as cortical asters. However, the microtubule organizing center of the prospective smaller AB cell emits only microtubules that commit to the mitotic spindle and not cortical bound asters. When embryos are compressed or deformed, asymmetric spindles still form, and staining for gamma tubulin reveals that the second microtubule organizing center lacks the molecular signature of a centrosome. Furthermore, when centrosome number is doubled, tubifex embryos cleave symmetrically, suggesting this monoastral mechanism of asymmetric cell division is centrosome dependent. *Helobdella robusta: The leech Helobdella robusta exhibits a similar asymmetry in the first embryonic division as C. elegans and tubifex, but relies on a modified mechanism. Compression experiments on the robusta embryo do not affect asymmetric division, suggesting the mechanism, like tubifex, uses a cortical independent molecular pathway. In robusta, antibody staining reveals that the mitotic spindle forms symmetrically until metaphase and stems from two biastral centrosomes. At the onset of metaphase, asymmetry becomes apparent as the centrosome of the prospective larger CD cell lengthens cortical asters while the asters of the prospective smaller AB cell become downregulated. Experiments using nocodazole and taxol support this observation. Taxol, which stabilized microtubules, forced a significant number of embryos to cleave symmetrically when used at a moderate concentration. Moreover, embryos treated with nocodazole, which sequesters tubulin dimers and promotes microtubule depolymerization, similarly forced symmetric division in a significant number of embryos. Treatment with either drug at these concentrations fails to disrupt normal centrosome dynamics, suggesting that a balance of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization represents another mechanism for establishing asymmetric cell division in spilarian development. *Ilyanasa obsoleta: A third, less traditional mechanism contributing to asymmetric cell division in spiralian development has been discovered in the mollusk Ilyanasa obsoleta. In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence experiments show that mRNA transcripts co-localize with centrosomes during early cleavage. Consequently, these transcripts are inherited in a stereotypical fashion to distinct cells. All mRNA transcripts followed have been implicated in body axis patterning, and in situ hybridization for transcripts associated with other functions fail to exhibit such a localization. Moreover, disruption of microtubule polymerization with nocodazole, and of actin polymerization with cytochalisin B, shows the cytoskeleton is also important in this asymmetry. It appears that microtubules are required to recruit the mRNA to the centrosome, and that actin is required to attach the centrosome to the cortex. Finally, introducing multiple centrosomes into one cell by inhibiting cytokinesis shows that mRNA dependably localizes on the correct centrosome, suggesting intrinsic differences between each centrosomal composition. It is important to note that these results reflect experiments performed after the first two divisions, yet still demonstrate a different molecular means of establishing asymmetry in a dividing cell.  In stem cells and progenitors  Animals are made up of a vast number of distinct cell types. During development, the zygote undergoes many cell divisions that give rise to various cell types, including embryonic stem cells. Asymmetric divisions of these embryonic cells gives rise to one cell of the same potency (self-renewal), and another that maybe of the same potency or stimulated to further differentiate into specialized cell types such as neurons. This stimulated differentiation arises from many factors which can be divided into two broad categories: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic factors generally involve differing amounts of cell-fate determinants being distributed into each daughter cell. Extrinsic factors involve interactions with neighboring cells and the micro and macro environment of the precursor cell. In addition to the aforementioned Drosophila neuronal example, it was proposed that the macrosensory organs of the Drosophila, specifically the glial cells, also arise from a similar set of asymmetric division from a single progenitor cell via regulation of the Notch signaling pathway and transcription factors. An example of how extrinsic factors bring about this phenomenon is the physical displacement of one of the daughter cells out of the original stem cell niche, exposing it to signalling molecules such as chondroitin sulfate. In this manner, the daughter cell is forced to interact with the heavily sulfated molecules, which stimulate it to differentiate while the other daughter cell remains in the original niche in a quiescent state.  Role in disease  In normal stem and progenitor cells, asymmetric cell division balances proliferation and self-renewal with cell- cycle exit and differentiation. Disruption of asymmetric cell division leads to aberrant self-renewal and impairs differentiation, and could therefore constitute an early step in the tumorogenic transformation of stem and progenitor cells. In normal non-tumor stem cells, a number of genes have been described which are responsible for pluripotency, such as Bmi-1, Wnt and Notch. These genes have been discovered also in the case of cancer stem cells, and shows that their aberrant expression is essential for the formation of tumor cell mass. For example, it has been shown that gastrointestinal cancers contain rare subpopulation of cancer stem cells which are capable to divide asymmetrically. The asymmetric division in these cells is regulated by cancer niche (microenvironment) and Wnt pathway. Blocking the Wnt pathway with IWP2 (WNT antagonist) or siRNA-TCF4 resulted in high suppression of asymmetric cell division. Another mutation in asymmetric cell divisions which are involved in tumor growth are loss-of-function mutations. The first suggestion that loss of asymmetric cell division might be involved in tumorigenesis came from studies of Drosophila. Studies of loss-of-function mutations in key regulators of asymmetric cell division including lgl, aurA, polo, numb and brat, revealed hyperproliferative phenotypes in situ. In these mutants cells divide more symmetrically and generate mis-specified progeny that fail to exit the cell cycle and differentiate, but rather proliferate continuously and form a tumor cell mass.

It corresponds to the census- designated place known as Cheyney University, which had a population of 988 at the 2010 census. It is the home of Cheyney University of Pennsylvania. The university derive their name from George Cheyney's Farm, which became the current campus of Cheyney University in 1902. George Cheyney's Farm and the surrounding area was part of the original land grant given to William Penn in 1681. Originally, Cheyney was located at the intersection of what is now Creek and Cheyney Roads. The original \\"Cheyney's Shops\\" dated from the mid 18th century and were located on the north west and north east corners of the intersection of Creek and Cheyney Roads. The original Cheyney Post Office was located there as well as the general store, hotel, blacksmith shop and wheelsmith's shop. There are old maps that show \\"Cheyney\\" to be located at the intersection of Creek (sometimes Tanguy) and Cheyney Roads. All the newer maps show the location of \\"Cheyney\\" to be on Station Road. The Cheyney Family originally owned nearly 10,000 acres. William Cheyney was the first postmaster in 1835. When the railroad came through Cheyney, the post office was moved to Station Road. The original station was located in a brick structure (now a private residence) that still stands on Station Road just east of Cheyney Road. The current station building is home to the Cheyney Post Office. The last remaining portion of the Cheyney's Shops are on the north east corner of Creek and Cheyney Roads. Cheyney University tore down all the original buildings located on the north west corner in the late 1960s or early 1970s. This group of buildings consisted of a hotel, general store/post office and blacksmith's shop as well as a large bank barn. A stone wheelwright's shop and two other related original buildings are located on the opposite corner and still survive today. These structures were purchased in 1847 from the Cheyney Family by William Maison. The wheelwright shop operated until 1918 when Samuel W. Maison, son of William Maison, died. In 1934 Mary Elizabeth Maison, daughter of William Maison, sold the structures and property. Cheyney straddles the border between Thornbury Township in Chester County and Thornbury Township in Delaware County. These townships were originally one township, which was bisected when Delaware County split from Chester County in 1789. Both township offices are located along Cheyney Road next to the university. The John Cheyney Log Tenant House and Farm and Melrose are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Leir (January 28, 1900 ‚Äì July 14, 1998) was an American industrialist, financier, and philanthropist. He is primarily known for his role in the post-World War II economic development of Luxembourg. Early life and career Leir was born Heinrich Hans Leipziger to a Jewish family in Beuthen-Ro√überg, Prussian Silesia. His father died in 1911, leaving his mother alone to raise a large family that included, in addition to himself, an older brother and five sisters. Leipziger was therefore obligated to contribute very early in life to the material livelihood of his family. In 1919, Leipziger moved to Mannheim to join the Ludwigshafen branch of the large steel firm Wolf Netter & Jacobi, where he remained until 1931. He then moved to Bonn with his wife Erna, whom he had married in 1929, to head the firm Magnesit GmbH, a manufacturer of refractories. In 1933 after being degraded by the Nazis to assistant, he resigned and the couple moved to Luxembourg, where Leipziger founded the Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Minerais. This company was to become the foundation of his business empire. Utopian Fiction In August 1937, Leipziger completed a utopian science fiction novel, mostly in German, entitled La Grande Compagnie de Colonisation: Dokumente eines Grossen Planes. It was published under the pseudonym \\"Tom Palmer\\" by the hitherto unknown publisher Malpartes-Verlag Evy Friedrich of Luxembourg. Written in the form of a collection of fictional meeting minutes, press releases, private letters, telegrams and newspaper clippings, the book tells the story of a corporation based in Luxembourg, chartered with the purpose of developing all unused and unpopulated regions in the world. The company eventually succeeds in its goal, overcoming various forms of nationalist opposition to accomplish massive works: irrigating deserts, closing the Straits of Gibraltar and the Bosporus, building a canal through Nicaragua, tunneling under the English Channel, developing the mineral resources of South America and creating arable land in China. Contemporary reviewers of the work detected the influence of the murdered German industrialist Walther Rathenau, who had published his own utopian vision Was wird werden in 1920. Between the USA and Luxembourg The year 1939 was especially eventful for Leipziger, who adopted his new name \\"Henry J. Leir\\" about this time. Since his arrival in Luxembourg in 1933, Leir had become a close financial advisor to the House of Nassau-Weilburg, the rulers of the duchy since 1890. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the independence of Luxembourg, Leir was invested by Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg as Grand Officier de l'Ordre Grand-Ducal de la Couronne de Ch√™ne. Shortly thereafter, in December 1939, Leir fled to New York City, where he was immediately granted a US passport and founded the Continental Ore Company. During the decades that followed, Leir forged a close relationship between the royal court of Luxembourg and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who traced his ancestry to Luxembourg through his mother Sara Delano. Over the decades following World War II, Leir built upon these personal, bi-national relationships to attract several major American corporations to Luxembourg, among them Goodyear, DuPont, Monsanto Company, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. In 1963 Armand Hammer's Occidental Petroleum acquired Leir's company Interore SA, a phosphate mining and chemical trading multinational with operations in twenty-seven countries. Hammer's autobiography describes the meetings with Leir that led to this transaction but included unflattering personal details about Leir that Leir later disputed. Another famous business associate of Leir's was Joseph Alioto, who served as legal counsel for Leir's business interests before becoming mayor of San Francisco in 1968. Philanthropy Leir and his wife Erna supported several philanthropic causes through their Ridgefield Foundation (named after Ridgefield, Connecticut, one of their three home towns) and the Leir Foundation in Luxembourg. Among their donations were the endowments of several university chairs including the Henry J. Leir Professor of International Humanitarian Studies at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University, the Leir Professor of International Trade and Business at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, the Henry J. Leir Professorial Chair at the Weizmann Institute in Israel and the Henry J. Leir Professor of Neurodegenerative Diseases at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Also the Fletcher School renamed its institute to Henry J. Leir Institute for Human Security, and also established the Henry J. Leir Human Security Award. Henry J. Leir was also a major benefactor of Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts and founded the school's Luxembourg program. In 1981, Clark University Press issued the first English translation of Leir's 1937 work La Grande Compagnie de Colonisation, together with new material concerning Leir's life. The edition also included a postscript by Christian Calmes (1913‚Äì95), a former Secretary General of the Council of Ministers of the European Communities in Brussels and grand marshal of the royal court of Luxembourg. The postscript describes Leir as a visionary of European and global integration in the tradition of the Club of Rome and Jean Monnet. The edition also reprints a 1980 letter to Leir from the Foundation Jean Monnet for Europe, announcing that Leir had been elected by unanimous vote to the Board of the Foundation. After Leir died in 1998, the Leir Charitable Foundations carried on his humanitarian vision for world prosperity and peace. Works * References *Henry J.

Early life and education Blair graduated from St Benet's Hall, Oxford, with a First Class degree in PPE. He was President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1993. He later attended Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University, taking a M.Phil in International Relations. In 1994, Blair represented Oxford at the grand final of the World Universities Debating Championship with Rufus Black. Although born in Malawi, Blair is a British citizen. He is not related to the former British prime minister, Tony Blair. Career in journalism Blair began working for the Daily Telegraph in Zimbabwe in 1999. He was forced to leave the country by President Robert Mugabe's regime in June 2001. Blair later published a book about his experiences Degrees in Violence: Robert Mugabe and the Struggle for Power in Zimbabwe. He was named Young Journalist of the Year in 2001 by the Foreign Press Association for his coverage of Zimbabwe. Thereafter, he was based in Pakistan (2002‚Äì2003) and the Middle East (2003‚Äì2004). He was among the first journalists to enter Jenin Refugee Camp in the West Bank after the controversial Israeli assault in April 2002. Blair's front-page report on the Palestinian suffering caused by this attack, headlined \\"Blasted to Rubble by the Israelis\\", attracted considerable attention as the Daily Telegraph had always been perceived as favourable to Israel. Blair reported extensively from Iraq before and after the American-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. At the height of the looting in Baghdad in April 2003, Blair entered Saddam Hussein's old foreign ministry and found documents purporting to show that George Galloway, then a member of parliament, had received money from the deposed regime. Galloway vigorously denied this charge and sued the Daily Telegraph for libel on the totality of the Telegraph reports, which included those by other journalists and editorials. Galloway won the case in November 2004 and the newspaper paid him damages of ¬£150,000 plus, after a failed appeal, legal costs of about ¬£2 million. The Daily Telegraph did not attempt to claim justification (where the defendant seeks to prove the truth of the defamatory reports): \\"It has never been the Telegraph's case to suggest that the allegations contained in these documents are true\\". Instead, the paper sought to argue that it acted responsibly because the allegations it reported were of sufficient public interest to outweigh the damage caused to Galloway's reputation. However the trial judge did not accept this defence saying the suggestion that Galloway was guilty of \\"treason\\", \\"in Saddam's pay\\", and being \\"Saddam's little helper\\" caused him to conclude \\"the newspaper was not neutral but both embraced the allegations with relish and fervour and went on to embellish them\\". Blair became the Daily Telegraph's Africa Bureau Chief in June 2004. He reported on the war in Darfur, the elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the war in northern Uganda. He left this job some time in late 2006. In 2009 Blair left his Daily Telegraph diplomatic editor post to join the Financial Times as Middle East and Africa news editor. In 2010 he was appointed the Financial Times energy correspondent. In November 2011 Blair returned to the Daily Telegraph as chief foreign correspondent.

According to the seventh-century atlas, the Ashkharhats'uyts', attributed to Anania Shirakatsi, Barda was known by the name of Partav (Partaw) during the period of late antiquity and was located in the district of Uti A·πõandznak in the province of Utik', which was at that time in the possession of Albania.Anania Shirakatsi (1992).

In the mid-seventh century, Javanshir, the lord of Gardman, led a movement that expelled the Persian marzpan from the province of Utik' and made Partav his capital and constructed churches and other buildings. His deeds were chronicled by the Armenian historian Movses Kaghankatvatsi, who hailed from a neighboring village. Medieval Alexander the Great in Nushabah-s Pavilion in Barda. Nizami Ganjavi In about 645, Partav fell under the control of the Muslim Arabs and was referred to as \\"Barda\\" or \\"Barda'a\\" in Arabic. In ca. 789, it was made the second alternate capital (after Dvin) of the governor (ostikan) of the province of Arminiya. Its governors strengthened the defenses of the city in order to counter the invasions of the Khazars attacking from the north.Bosworth, C.E. \\"Barda'a.\\" Encyclopaedia Iranica. December 15, 1988. In 768, the Catholicos of All Armenians, Sion I Bavonats'i, convoked an ecclesiastical council at Partav, which passed 24 canons that addressed issues relating to the administration of the Armenian Church and marriage practices. By the ninth to tenth centuries, Barda had largely lost its economic importance to the nearby town of Ganja; the seat of the Catholicos of the Church of Albania was also moved to Bardak (Berdakur), leaving Partav as a mere bishopric.Kirakos Gandzaketsi. History of the Armenians. Trans. Robert Bedrosian. According to the Muslim geographers Estakhri, Ibn Hawqal, and Al-Muqaddasi, the distinctive Caucasian Albanian language (which they called al-Raniya, or Arranian) persisted into early Islamic times, and was still spoken in Barda in the tenth century.Bosworth, C.

Referring to events in the late eleventh century, the twelfth-century Armenian historian Matthew of Edessa described Partav as an \\"Armenian city [\\"K'aghak'n Hayots'\\"], which is also called Paytakaran and located near the vast [Caspian] Sea.\\"Matthew of Edessa (1993). Armenia and the Crusades: Tenth to Twelfth centuries: The Chronicle of Matthew of Edessa. Trans. Ara E. Dosturian. Lanham: University Press of America, p. 151. The same Muslim geographers describe Barda as a flourishing town with a citadel, a mosque (the treasury of Arran was located here), a circuit wall and gates, and a Sunday bazaar that was called \\"Keraki,\\" \\"Korakƒ´\\" or \\"al-Kurki\\" (a name derived from Greek Œ∫œÖœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒÆ (kyriaki), the Lord's Day and Sunday, as the Armenian word kiraki is).Wheatley, Paul.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001. , , p 159.Estakhri states that there was a Sunday bazaar in Barda, known locally as \\"Koraki,\\" which in the opinion of scholar George Bournoutian derives directly from the Armenian, not the Greek, rendition of the word Sunday (\\"Kiraki\\"). On this basis, Bournoutian speculates that the city still had a significant Armenian element during the tenth century: see Jamal Javanshir Qarabaghi, Two Chronicles on the History of Karabagh: Mirza Jamal Javanshir‚Äôs Tarikh-e Karabagh and Mirza Adigozal Beg‚Äôs Karabagh-name.

In 943, it was attacked once more by the Rus and sacked.Kennedy, Hugh (2004). The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates: The Islamic Near East from the 6th to the 11th Century, 2nd ed. Harlow: Longman, p. 256. This may have been a factor in the decline of Bar·∏èa in the second half of the tenth century, along with the raids and oppressions from the rulers of the neighboring regions, when the town lost ground to Beylaqan. Centuries of earthquakes and, finally, the Mongol invasions destroyed much of the town's landmarks, with the exception of the fourteenth century tomb of Ahmad Zocheybana, built by architect Ahmad ibn Ayyub Nakhchivani. The mausoleum is a cylindrical brick tower, decorated with turquoise tiles. There is also the more recently built Imamzadeh Mosque, which has four minarets. Modern Agriculture is the main activity in the area. Local economy is based on the production and processing of cotton, silk, poultry and dairy products. The cease fire line, concluded at the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994, is just a few kilometers west of Barda, near Terter.  Notable residents  * Khosrow II.

Along with Petro Prokopovych, Dadant is considered one of the founding fathers of modern beekeeping. Biography Dadant was born in Vaux-sous-Aubigny, in Haute-Marne, in the Champagne-Ardenne region of France. In 1863, at age forty- six, he moved to America, with dreams of starting a vineyard. Dadant purchased land on the rolling tallgrass prairie in Hamilton, western Illinois, where he built a simple log house. After paying for his family to come to America from France and buying a farm, he was penniless. He did not know a word of English, but he was determined to succeed in his new country. When his dreams of being a vintner were not fulfilled, he turned to beekeeping, a hobby he had learned in France. Dadant learned English by subscribing to the New York Tribune. While working as a traveling salesman in France he educated himself. As his horse would plod along, Dadant would read the works of the French biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and the theories of the socialist Charles Fourier. He renounced the Catholic Church and became a socialist. When he moved to America he modeled his beekeeping business on socialist principles by working alongside his employees. By the end of the American Civil War he had nine colonies of honeybees, and traveled with his young son across the Mississippi River to sell honey and beeswax in a neighboring town. His interest in making quality candles grew from his love and knowledge of beekeeping. He invented the Dadant bee-hive, which has a 42 √ó 26.6 cm frame and founded in Hamilton one of the first factory of bee-keeping tools. The Dadant factory is still owned by the Dadant family. He contributed articles on beekeeping to numerous bee journals, both American and European. Dadant acquired The American Bee Journal and Dadant and Sons have published it since. He translated Langstroth's The Hive and the Honey-Bee into French so the rest of the world would learn of Langstroth's contributions to beekeeping. He strived to import Italian bees into the United States and, according to ABC in Bee Culture 1890, he succeeded by shipping 250 queen bees to the United States in 1874. He was not the first to bring Italian queens into the United States, selling for up to half the price ($12) asked by his competitors. He was always seeking a better way to keep bees. Just as he had begun with the old European \\"eke\\" he quickly abandoned that kind of beekeeping for the modern Langstroth hive concept. Bee hives have often been designed and built without regard for the needs and habits of the honey bee colony. Probably the best design for a colony was the large hive developed by Charles Dadant. It provided a large, deep brood chamber with plenty of room in which the queen could lay, and shallower supers for honey storage. However, the price and promotion of smaller hives offered for sale during the period from about 1885 to 1900 made them more popular. Charles Dadant died in Hamilton in 1902. He had one son, Camille Pierre Dadant (1851-1938). In 1978, The Center for Icarian Studies (Western Illinois University) received from the Dadant family a collection of papers consisting of biographical information, Life and Writings of Charles Dadant by C.P. Dadant and The Life of C.P. Dadant, by M.G. Dadant.

Life Douglas Lansford Bailey was born on Oct. 5, 1933, in Cleveland. After receiving a bachelor's degree from Colgate University in 1954, Mr. Bailey received his master's and doctorate degrees in 1957-1962 from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts. From 1968 to 1987, Bailey was President of Bailey Deardourff and Associates, among the first national political consulting firms. He worked for Republican candidates for Governor, Senate and president including: President Gerald Ford; senators Edward Brooke, Kit Bond, John Danforth, Charles Percy, Richard Schweiker, John Chafee, Richard Lugar, Robert Stafford, Howard Baker; governors Thomas Kean, William Milliken, Jim Rhodes, Otis R. Bowen, James R. Thompson, Lamar Alexander, Richard Snelling, William T. Cahill, Richard Thornburgh, Jim Rhodes, Robert Ray, Al Quie, Pete DuPont. He started The Hotline, a daily political newsletter delivered by fax, in 1987. It began partly as an experiment in bipartisanship. Each issue, faxed in the late morning, included a roundup of political jokes from the previous night's talk-show monologues. He sold it to the National Journal in 1996. Philanthropy After he left day-to-day operations, Bailey was involved in numerous philanthropic activities. Most recently, he was one of the four co-founders of the political reform movement Unity08. He was seeking to start a new centrist party for the 2008 presidential election to try to unite the country. He appeared on The Colbert Report to promote his cause. He founded Freedom's Answer, a non-partisan voter turnout effort, with former Clinton Press Secretary Mike McCurry. He also served on the Board of Directors of the Fletcher School at Tufts University. In 1994, Bailey joined Jeffrey Pollack in a venture to start a daily briefing for the sports world called the Sports Business Daily. This venture originally occupied three rooms in the same building as The Hotline, and was sold in 1996. In January 2008, Bailey and fellow Unity08 co-founder Gerald Rafshoon left that organization to launch a national effort to draft New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to run for president as an independent candidate. Bailey sat on the Council on American Politics, which brings leaders from the political and communications arenas together to address issues facing the growth and enrichment of GW's Graduate School of Political Management. Bailey died on June 10, 2013. Family He was married to Patricia P. Bailey, who was a FTC commissioner from 1979 to 1988; they had two children.

Jacottet in Contes Populaires des Bassoutos.Jacottet, Edouard. Contes populaires des Bassoutos: Afrique du Sud. Paris: Ernest Leroux. 1895. pp. 26-33. Synopsis All the rivers and streams ran dry. The animals dug a well to keep from dying, but the jackal did not help. They set a guard to keep the jackal from drinking. The first, a rabbit, kept off the jackal until it bribed it with some honeycomb to let it tie it up; then the jackal drank its full. The second, a hare, met the same fate. The third, the tortoise, did not answer the jackal, so it thought it could kick it aside, but the tortoise grabbed its leg and never let it go. The jackal did not manage to free itself until the other animals appeared; then it managed to wrench itself free and flee without drinking.

It originated as a movement against the Phanariote administration, with backing from the more conservative boyars, but mutated into an attempted removal of the boyar class. Though not directed against Ottoman rule, the revolt espoused an early version of Romanian nationalism, and is described by historians as the first major event of a national awakening. The revolutionary force was centered on a group of Pandur irregulars, whose leader was Tudor Vladimirescu. Its nucleus was the Wallachian subregion of Oltenia, where Vladimirescu established his \\"Assembly of the People\\" in February. From the beginning, Pandurs were joined by groups of Albanians and by veterans of the Serbian Revolution. Although infused with anti-Hellenism, they collaborated with, and were infiltrated by, agents of the Filiki Eteria. Vladimirescu also cooperated with the Sacred Band of Alexander Ypsilantis, thereby contributing to the larger war of Greek independence. In conjunction with Ypsilantis' troops coming in from Moldavia, Vladimirescu managed to occupy Bucharest in March. Vladimirescu agreed to split the country with Ypsilantis, preserving control over Oltenia, Bucharest, and the southern half of Muntenia. The Pandurs' relationship with the Sacred Band degenerated rapidly, upon revelations that the Russian Empire had not validated Ypsilantis' expedition, and also over Vladimirescu's attempts to quell Eterist violence. Many of the Albanians openly or covertly supported Ypsilantis, while others endorsed an independent warlord, Sava Fochianos. Vladimirescu secretly negotiated an entente with the Ottomans, who ultimately invaded Wallachia in late April. The Pandurs withdrew toward Oltenia, which put them at odds with the Sacred Band. Vladimirescu's brutality alienated his own troops; in turn, this rift allowed the Greek revolutionaries to arrest and execute Vladimirescu, unopposed. The Oltenians scattered, though some Pandurs formed pockets of resistance, led by captains such as Dimitrie Macedonski and Ioan Solomon. They suffered clear defeat in their confrontation with the Ottoman Army. In June, Ypsilantis' force and its remaining Pandur allies were routed at DrƒÉgƒÉ»ôani. The uprising sparked a cycle of repressive terror, with a final episode in August, when Fochianos and his Albanians were massacred in Bucharest. The uprising of 1821 is widely seen as a failed or incomplete social revolution, with more far-reaching political and cultural implications. The Ottoman government registered its anti-Phanariote message, appointing an assimilated boyar, Grigore IV Ghica, as Prince of Wallachia. The ascent of nationalist boyars was enhanced during the Russian occupation of 1828, and cemented by a new constitutional arrangement, Regulamentul Organic. During this interval, survivors of the uprising split between those who supported this conservative establishment and those who favored liberal causes. The latter also helped preserve a heroic image of Vladimirescu, which was later also borrowed by agrarianists and left-wing activists. Origins Phanariote crisis From the beginning of the 18th-century, Wallachia and Moldavia (the Danubian Principalities) had been placed by the Sublime Porte under a regime of indirect rule through Phanariotes. This cluster of Greek and Hellenized families, and the associated Greek diaspora, were conspicuously present at all levels of government. At a more generalized level, the Phanariote era emphasized tensions between the boyars, Phanariote or not, and the peasant class. Though released from serfdom, Wallachian peasants were still required to provide for the boyars in corv√©es and tithes. Over the early 19th century, the rural economy was often paralyzed by peasant strikes, tax resistance, sabotage, or litigation.Djuvara, pp. 261‚Äì262 Additional pressures were created by Ottoman demands for the hara√ß and other fiscal duties, which the Phanariotes fulfilled through tax farming. \\"Excessive fiscal policies, dictated by both the Ottoman demands and the short span of reigns\\" meant that Phanariotes treated the principalities as \\"an actual tenancy.\\"Iliescu & Miron, pp. 9‚Äì10 The national budget for 1819 was 5.9 million thaler, of which at least 2 million were taken by the Sublime Porte, 1.3 million went to the ruling family, and 2.4 supplied the bureaucracy.Djuvara, pp. 70‚Äì71 Although not at their highest historical level, Ottoman pressures had been steadily increasing since ca. 1800.Bogdan Murgescu, Rom√¢nia »ôi Europa. Acumularea decalajelor economice (1500‚Äì2010), pp. 32‚Äì37. Ia»ôi: Polirom, 2010. Tax payers were additionally constrained by those boyars who obtained tax privileges or exemptions for themselves and their families. In 1819, from 194,000 families subject to taxation, 76,000 had been wholly or partly exempted.Djuvara, p. 70. See also Iliescu & Miron, p. 10 Tax farmers, in particular the Ispravnici, acted in an increasingly predatory manner, and, in various cases, tortured peasants into paying more than their share.Djuvara, pp. 73‚Äì74; Iorga (1921), pp. 326‚Äì327 and (1932), pp. 5‚Äì7 In the 1800s, a reformist Prince Constantine Ypsilantis sided with the peasants, cracking down on abuse and even threatening capital punishment; this episode failed to address the causes, and abuses continued to be recorded into the 1810s.Djuvara, pp. 73‚Äì74 Under constant fiscal pressure, many villagers resorted to selling their labor to boyars or to peasant entrepreneurs. According to a report by the Ispravnic of Gorj County, in 1819 migrant farmhands could barely cover their tax debt.Maciu, pp. 935‚Äì936 The Phanariotes' hold on the country was nonetheless put into question by various episodes of the previous half-century, and especially by local troubles coinciding with the Napoleonic era; under the Phanariote regime, Wallachia had dissolved her levy army. In 1802, the threat of an invasion by Ottoman secessionist Osman Pazvantoƒülu pushed Bucharest into a panic. At its height, the mercenary Sava Fochianos and his Albanians denounced their contract and left the city defenseless.Djuvara, pp. 281‚Äì283. See also Maciu, p. 934 This embarrassment prompted Ypsilantis to form a small national contingent, comprising armed burghers and Pandurs who were trained by Western standards.Djuvara, pp. 283, 356; V√¢rtosu (1962), passim Especially visible in Oltenia, the Pandurs traced their origins to the late 17th century, and had also functioned as a militia in 1718‚Äì1739, when Oltenia was a Habsburg territory. At times, they had been self-sustaining, with a lifestyle that bordered on hajduk brigandage.Ciobotea & Osiac, pp. 143‚Äì144 SlƒÉtioara Although approved by the Ottomans, this new militia was secretly also a component of Ypsilantis' plan to shake off Ottoman suzerainty with help from the Russian Empire. By August 1806, his alliance with Russia had been exposed, and he was forced to leave into exile.Djuvara, pp. 283‚Äì284, 295 The incident also sparked a six-year-long Russo-Turkish War. During this period, the Wallachian Pandurs, including a young Tudor Vladimirescu, acted as a unit of the Imperial Russian Army.Bogdan-DuicƒÉ, p. 41; Cernatoni, pp. 40‚Äì41; Ciobotea & Osiac, pp. 143‚Äì146; Dieaconu, pp. 45, 47; Djuvara, pp. 284‚Äì286, 297, 299, 356; Finlay, p. 123; Georgescu, p. 100; Iliescu & Miron, pp. 12‚Äì13; Iorga (1921), pp. XI, 3‚Äì4, 189, 232 and (1932), p. 54; Iscru, pp. 678, 680; LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 37; Maciu, pp. 936, 939; Nistor, p. 889; Rizos- Nerulos, p. 284; V√¢rtosu (1945), p. 345 and (1962), pp. 530, 545; Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 75‚Äì77 Under Russian occupation, the Greek‚ÄìWallachian rebel Nicolae Pangal issued several manifestos which, as noted by historian Emil V√¢rtosu, resembled later appeals by Vladimirescu.V√¢rtosu (1962), pp. 533‚Äì535, 545 Hostilities were eventually suspended by the Treaty of Bucharest, hurried by Russia's need to defend herself against the French;Djuvara, pp. 288‚Äì289 Ottoman rule in Wallachia and Moldavia was again consolidated with Russia focused on winning a war in Central Europe. The new Phanariote Prince was John Caradja, whose reign saw an upsurge in tax resistance and hajduk gang activity. In Bucharest, the epidemic known as Caragea's plague was an opportunity for marauding gangs of outlaws, who confused the authorities by dressing up as undertakers.Djuvara, pp. 293‚Äì295 Rebellious activity peaked in Oltenia, where hajduks were organized by Iancu Jianu, a boyar's son, who frustrated all of Caradja's attempts at restoring order.Djuvara, p. 291 However, the Pandurs were divided. In 1814, some joined a raid by pirates from Ada Kaleh, storming through Mehedin»õi County and Gorj, though they later sought forgiveness from Vladimirescu.Maciu, pp. 936, 940. See also Iscru, pp. 679‚Äì680 The latter had sided with the Caradja regime, but still intervened on their behalf.Cernatoni, p. 42; Maciu, p. 936 Preparation As a result of 1814 riots, tax privileges for the Pandurs were suspended, and they were demoted to the position of a militia assisting the Ispravnici.Maciu, p. 936 In 1818, Caradja abandoned his throne and fled Wallachia, leaving Sultan Mahmud II to appoint an elderly loyalist, Alexandros Soutzos. His decision also specified that only four Phanariote families would be eligible for the crowns of either Wallachia and Moldavia: Callimachi, Mourouzis, and two lines of the Soutzos.Djuvara, pp. 295‚Äì296 Upon entering Bucharest, the new Prince inaugurated a regime of institutional abuse. In April 1819, the attempt to put pressure on the peasantry sparked a riot at Islaz.Cernatoni, p. 42. See also Popp, p. XII In one especially controversial writ of 1820, Soutzos ruled that the city of T√¢rgovi»ôte was not mortmain, and proclaimed it his family's property. This edict resulted sparked a burgher revolt, during which cadastre officials were attacked and chased out of T√¢rgovi»ôte.Djuvara, p. 191 Though he still favored the Albanians,Nistor, p. 887 Soutzos revised anti-Pandur persecution, restoring their role in the army and placing them under the command of a Romanian, Ioan Solomon.Ciobotea & Osiac, p. 146 His tensions with the Albanians resulted in a standoff with the mercenaries, who barricaded themselves inside Sinaia Monastery.Dieaconu, p. 46 However, Pandur Mihai Cioranu contends, Wallachia \\"swarmed with Greeks as never before\\", with every military commission set aside to serve \\"the Prince and his Greeks\\".Iorga (1921), pp. 228‚Äì229 Soutzos' other conflict was with the lesser Phanariotes, who were now won over by Greek nationalism. In 1820, Alexander Ypsilantis, son of Prince Constantine, united the various branches of the Filiki Eteria, a Greek revolutionary organization, and began preparing a massive anti-Ottoman revolt from the Russian port city of Odessa. This society had already managed to enlist in its ranks some preeminent Wallachian boyars: allegedly, its first recruits included Alecu Filipescu-Vulpea, joined later by Grigore Br√¢ncoveanu.Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 74‚Äì75. See also Iliescu & Miron, p. 12 According to one account, the Eterists also invited Soutzos to join the conspiracy, but he refused.Djuvara, p. 296; Iorga (1921), pp. 353‚Äì354 He died suddenly on January 19, 1821, prompting speculation that he had been poisoned by Ypsilantis' partisans.Djuvara, p. 296; Finlay, p. 118; Georgescu, p. 97; Iorga (1921), pp. 231, 353‚Äì354 and (1932), pp. 24, 25; LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 37, 227; Papacostea, p. 10; Potra (1963), p. 64 In Wallachia, Ypsilantis' cause had significant allies: the country's three main regents (or Caimacami)‚ÄîBr√¢ncoveanu, Grigore Ghica, Barbu VƒÉcƒÉrescu‚Äîwere all secretly members of the Eteria.Djuvara, p. 297 They contacted Vladimirescu with a mission to revive the national army and align it with Ypsilantis' movement.Cernatoni, p. 43; Djuvara, p. 297; Iliescu & Miron, p. 14 However, other records suggest that Vladimirescu acted independently of the regents. He was located in Bucharest in November 1820, and was in direct contact with the Eterist leadership through various channels. Within two months, he had reportedly sealed a pact with two of Ypsilantis' agents, Giorgakis Olympios and Yiannis Pharmakis, who were also officers in Soutzos' Albanian guard, and had borrowed 20,000 thaler from another Eterist, Pavel Macedonski, \\"to provide for the coming revolt.\\"Cernatoni, pp. 42‚Äì43. See also Iliescu & Miron, pp. 12‚Äì14; Rizos-Nerulos, p. 284; Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 74, 82‚Äì84 Nevertheless, according to historian Vasile Maciu, the convention between Vladimirescu and his Eterist colleagues survives only in an unreliable translation, which may be entirely fabricated.Maciu, p. 946 The Russian Consul in Wallachia, Alexander Pini, is viewed as a neutral player by scholar Barbara Jelavich,Jelavich, pp. 22, 24, 302 but he too may have been involved on the Eterist side. This was attested by Pini's Moldavian secretary, »òtefan Scarlat DƒÉscƒÉlescu, who attributes the revolt initiative to \\"the leaders of the Greek revolution and Mr. Pini\\",Iliescu & Miron, pp. 40‚Äì41 and dismisses Vladimirescu as a \\"Russian creature\\".Iorga (1932), p. 25 However, a letter from Tudor to Pini refutes any conscious cooperation between the two men.Iscru, pp. 684‚Äì686 According to information gathered by the Russian spy Ivan Liprandi, Vladimirescu was also promised full adherence by the leading 77 boyars of the country, their pledge eventually issued as a formal writ and presented on their behalf by Dinicu Golescu.Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 77‚Äì79, 81 Vladimirescu may have used this binding document as a collateral, allowing him to borrow 40,000 more thaler from Matija Nenadoviƒá.Vianu & Iancovici, p. 79 Liprandi also notes that the Pandur leader was already in contact with Ilarion Gheorghiadis, the Bishop of Arge»ô, who helped him define his international diplomacy.Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 74, 77 In the days before Soutzos' death, Vladimirescu had been spotted at Pite»ôti, moving into Oltenia with some 40 Albanians.Cernatoni, p. 43; G√¢rleanu, pp. 57‚Äì58; Iliescu & Miron, pp. 14, 40; Iorga (1921), pp. 4‚Äì5, 233, 356 and (1932), pp. 27, 53; Popa & Dicu, pp. 98‚Äì99; Potra (1963), p. 64; Vianu & Iancovici, p. 78. See also Georgescu, pp. 100‚Äì102 He traveled under an innocuous pretext, claiming to be heading for his Gugiu estate in Gorj County, to settle a land dispute.G√¢rleanu, pp. 57‚Äì58; Vianu & Iancovici, p. 78 Revolutionary ideology National and social ideas Personification of Justice, illustration to Petru Maior's Istoria pentru √Ænceputuri a Rom√¢nilor √Æn Dachia, Buda, 1812 While various researchers agree that Vladimirescu and his Pandurs were motivated by a nationalist ideology, its outline and implications remain debated among scholars. Social historians Ioan C. Filitti and Vlad Georgescu both argue that as a nationalist, Vladimirescu had short-term and long-term agendas: demands of recognition from the Porte, and for the restoration of ancient liberties, were only instrumental to a larger goal, which was national liberation with Russian assistance.Georgescu, pp. 102‚Äì103; Maciu, p. 933 Nicolae Iorga views the Pandur leader as taking \\"one step forward\\" in the development of nationalist discourse, by introducing references to the general will.Iorga (1921), pp. XII‚ÄìXIV Nicolae Liu also notes that the \\"pragmatic\\" rebel \\"made no reference to natural rights, but tacitly included them as the basis of his revolutionary program\\"; this notion was an import from Revolutionary France, along with the Pandurs' concept of the people-in-arms.Liu, pp. 298‚Äì300 Sociolinguist Klaus Bochmann identifies the 1821 documents, including those issued \\"in the entourage of Tudor Vladimirescu\\" and those of his adversaries, as the first Romanian-language references to \\"patriotism\\"‚Äîand possibly as the first-ever records of a \\"political debate being carried out (mainly) in Romanian.\\"Bochmann, p. 107 He underscores the ideological influence of Josephinism, noting that it came to Vladimirescu through his contacts with educator Gheorghe LazƒÉr;Bochmann, pp. 107‚Äì108 other reports suggest that Vladimirescu was informed about the ideology of the Transylvanian School, having read Petru Maior.Iscru, pp. 682‚Äì683 During the actual events of the uprising, Western sources began drawing parallels between Vladimirescu and historical peasant rebels, in particular Wat Tyler and Horea.»òerban, pp. 282‚Äì283 Various authors propose that Vladimirescu and his men were not only nationalists, but also had a core interest in social revolution, seeing it as their mission to supplant or control boyardom. Thus, historian Gheorghe Potra describes Tudor's rising as primarily \\"anti-feudal\\", with a \\"national character\\" in that it also aimed to shake off \\"the Turkish yoke\\".Potra (1963), pp. 22‚Äì23 As summarized by historian Neagu Djuvara, the Pandur revolt was originally \\"set out against all the nation's plunderers\\", but then \\"became a peasants' revolt which did not separate 'good' and 'bad' boyars, locals from foreigners. Nevertheless, in order to reach his goal, Tudor had no choice but to reach an agreement with the 'nationalist' boyars [...] as well as with Turkish power, [and] he resorted, at a later stage, to making his revolution into a fundamentally anti-Phanariote one.\\"Djuvara, p. 89 Another ideological difference was that between Vladimirescu's Russophilia, a minority opinion, and the mounting Russophobia of both upper- and middle-class nationalists.Djuvara, pp. 285‚Äì286, 289, 297 Iorga proposes that Vladimirescu tried his best to establish a \\"democratic companionship\\" of Wallachians, hoping to draw a wedge between Romanian and Greek boyars.Iorga (1921), p. VIII Among the left-wing scholars, Andrei O»õetea argues that Vladimirescu slowly abandoned the peasant cause and fell into a \\"complete and humiliating subordination to the boyars.\\"Maciu, p. 933 The rebels' anti-boyar discourse was mitigated by other factors. One was the issue of their leader's own social standing: though originating from a clan of Oltenian peasants, Vladimirescu had been accepted into the third-class boyardom, with the rank of Sluger.Djuvara, pp. 136, 228, 297, 299‚Äì300; Maciu, pp. 941, 944; Theodorescu, p. 221. See also Cernatoni, pp. 40‚Äì41, 46 Cultural historian RƒÉzvan Theodorescu argues that he, the rebel leader, actually belonged to a \\"rural bourgeoisie\\" which kept genealogies and had an \\"unexpected\\" taste for heraldry.Theodorescu, pp. 208‚Äì209 Other scholars also make note of Vladimirescu's elitist tastes and habits, his refusal to sanction retribution against the boyars, and his crushing of peasant radicalism during his seizure in power.Djuvara, p. 300; Georgescu, pp. 100, 103; Iorga (1932), pp. 27, 51; Iscru, pp. 676‚Äì680; Maciu, p. 941 It is also probable that Vladimirescu intended to have himself recognized as Prince, as evidenced by his wearing a white kalpak, traditionally reserved for royalty.Dima et al., p. 132; Djuvara, p. 300; Georgescu, p. 103; Iorga (1932), p. 51 His subordinates often referred to him as Domnul Tudor, which also indicated monarchic ambitions (see Domnitor).Djuvara, p. 300; Iorga (1921), pp. IX‚ÄìX, 61; Maciu, p. 945 The Italian press of his day viewed him as Wallachia's Duce.»òerban, p. 280 Pro- and anti-Greek Another fluctuating trait of Vladimirescu's revolt was his attitude toward Greek nationalism. According to Iorga, Phanariote rule meant a \\"system of indissoluble elements\\", centered on Hellenism and Hellenization.Iorga (1921), pp. VII‚ÄìVIII Maciu further notes that Phanariote rulers had stunted Romanian nationalism and national awakening by popularizing an Eastern Orthodox identity, common to Romanians and Greeks; this established a pattern of cooperation, pushing nationalists of various ethnicities into contact with each other.Maciu, pp. 934, 937‚Äì939, 945, 947‚Äì948 Overall, V√¢rtosu argues, the rebellion was not xenophobic, but protectionist: Vladimirescu favored the \\"uplift of the native people\\", but also addressed his to proclamation to a larger \\"human kin\\". His white-and-blue banner had both familiar symbols of Christian tradition, which \\"drenched [the message] in the theological coloring of religious faith\\", and verse which described the \\"Romanian Nation\\".V√¢rtosu (1945), pp. 345‚Äì346 In a Balkans context, Vladimirescu felt most sympathy toward the Serbian Revolution, having had direct contacts with Karaƒëorƒëe,Djuvara, p. 298; Iorga (1921), pp. X‚ÄìXII and The Public Ledger even speculated that he was himself a Serb.»òerban, pp. 279‚Äì280 Affiliates of the Pandur revolt also included Naum Veqilharxhi, who published what may be the first manifesto of Albanian nationalism.Nicolae Chiachir, Gelcu Maksutovici, \\"Ora»ôul Bucure»ôti, centru de sprijin al mi»ôcƒÉrii de eliberare din Balcani (1848‚Äî1912)\\", in Bucure»ôti. Materiale de Istorie »ôi Muzeografie, Vol. 5, 1967, p. 279 In this setting, however, Vladimirescu \\"had no particular reason to hold the Phanariote [Ypsilantis] dear\\",Djuvara, p. 298 and the ideals of Orthodox universalism, \\"subordinating [Romanian] aspirations\\", were viewed with generalized suspicion.Palade, p. 36 As historians note, Vladimirescu \\"would have liked to rid the country of both the Greeks and the Turks\\",Djuvara, p. 299 viewing the former with \\"strong aversion\\", as the \\"agents of Turkish oppression in his country.\\"Finlay, p. 123 Ottomanist Kemal Karpat suggests that: \\"[In] Turkish sources [...] Vladimirescu's revolt is interpreted as a local uprising aimed chiefly at the protection of the local population against Greek exploitation\\"; a \\"long accepted version was that Vladimirescu rebelled against the Greeks without even being aware that [Ypsilantis], the Greek revolutionary, had risen against the Sultan in Russia.\\"Karpat, pp. 406‚Äì407 In contrast, DƒÉscƒÉlescu proposes that the rebellion was originally anti-Turkish and pro-Greek, but that Vladimirescu had no way of winning over Oltenians with that message.Iliescu & Miron, pp. 40‚Äì43; Iorga (1932), pp. 53‚Äì54 Moreover, O»õetea writes that the Pandur movement cannot be separated from the Eteria, who gave it \\"a chief, a program, a structure, the original impulse, tactics for propaganda and combat, [and] the first means of achieving its goals\\".Vianu & Iancovici, p. 70 O»õetea also claims that Vladimirescu was indirectly influenced by the political vision of Rigas Feraios, though this verdict remains disputed.Nestor Camariano, \\"Rhigas Velestinlis.

Consul Pini approved their request to use force against Vladimirescu, but refused to commit Russian troops for that purpose.Iorga (1921), pp. 24‚Äì30; Potra (1963), pp. 64‚Äì65 Reassured by Pini, the regents began amassing an Albanian resistance to the rebellion, with individual units led by Dumitrachi Bibescu, Serdar Diamandi Djuvara, Deli-ba»ôa Mihali, Pharmakis, Had≈æi-Prodan, and Ioan Solomon. Though there were violent clashes between the two sides at Motru, many of the loyalist troops voluntarily surrendered to the Pandurs, after parleying with Pandur agent Dimitrie Macedonski.Iorga (1921), pp. 13‚Äì18, 24, 34‚Äì41, 236‚Äì238, 241‚Äì246, 330‚Äì332, 357‚Äì358. See also Ciobotea & Osiac, pp. 148, 152; Dieaconu, p. 48; Iorga (1932), p. 27 Faced with such insuburdionation, Caimacam Br√¢ncoveanu reportedly maintained his calm and demanded to know Vladimirescu's grievances. Through his Macedonski associates, the rebel leader asked for a unification of boyar parties around his revolutionary goal, which included solving the peasant issue, and ordered them to disband the Albanian corps.Iorga (1921), pp. 34‚Äì37; Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 79‚Äì80 Meanwhile, the peasantry responded to the proclamation of Pade»ô by organizing into a string a small uprisings. Some happened in Pandur strongholds, as during Dumitru G√¢rbea's raid on Baia de AramƒÉ, while others took root in more distant villages, such as B√¢rca and Radovanu.G√¢rleanu, p. 60 A Captain Ivanciu took control of Pite»ôti and raided the surrounding villages.Iorga (1921), p. 54 In other areas, there were highway robberies organized by Romanian peasants or slaves of Romani origin. Such incidents happened in SlƒÉnic, Urziceni, or at Nucet Monastery.Dieaconu, pp. 47, 56‚Äì57 On February 4, the Pandurs were again camped in Gorj, at »ö√¢n»õƒÉreni. Here, his army grew massively, to about 4,000 infantrymen and 500 horsemen.Ciobotea & Osiac, pp. 148‚Äì150 The Macedonskis recount that Vladimirescu was awaiting for the boyars to follow his orders and unite under his command, but that this demand was in fact unrealistic.Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 80‚Äì81 While waiting in »ö√¢n»õƒÉreni, Vladimirescu provided his response to the Boyar Divan, whose leadership had asked not to engage in activity \\"harmful for the country\\". Vladimirescu presented himself as a \\"caretaker\\" of the state‚Äîone elected by the people to review the \\"awful tyranny\\" of boyars, but without toppling the regime. A boyars' delegation, led by Vornic Nicolae VƒÉcƒÉrescu, traveled to Vladimirescu's camp on February 11. It asked of the Pandurs that they refrain from marching on Bucharest, and appealed to their patriotic sentiments. To this, Vladimirescu replied that his conception of the motherland was fundamentally different: \\"the people, and not the Coterie of plunderers\\" (or \\"robber class\\").Cernatoni, p. 44; Djuvara, pp. 297‚Äì298; Georgescu, p. 118; Iorga (1921), pp. 46‚Äì47; Liu, p. 299. See also Bochmann, pp. 108‚Äì111; Maciu, p. 943; Popp, p. XIII Though he thus restated his generic dislike for the boyars, Vladimirescu also reassured VƒÉcƒÉrescu that he did not \\"wish any harm to this Coterie\\", and \\"even more so I want to complete and strengthen its privileges.\\"Djuvara, p. 297; Iorga (1921), pp. 47‚Äì48 Army creation VƒÉcƒÉrescu was immediately replaced with Constantin Samurca»ô, who was an Eterist agent, and favored bribing the Pandurs into submission. He offered Vladimirescu a pardon and a large tribute collected from the citizens of Craiova,Iorga (1921), pp. 45‚Äì52, 54, 247, 331‚Äì332 allegedly sending Had≈æi- Prodan to »ö√¢n»õƒÉreni, with 90,000 thaler as a gift. According to at least one account, Samurca»ô also prepared Albanian troops, under Solomon and Djuvara, for a surprise attack on Vladimirescu's quarters.Iorga (1921), pp. 48‚Äì51, 244‚Äì247, 331 Prodan himself recounted that had secret orders to kill Vladimirescu, but disobeyed and defected to the Pandur side.Maciu, p. 943 Contrarily, anti-Greek authors view Prodan as a double agent of the Eteria, infiltrated alongside Dimitrie Macedonski.Iorga (1921), pp. 240‚Äì241, 257, 269, 289‚Äì290, 331 In recounting this episode, Liprandi claims that Vladimirescu turned tables and unexpectedly handed Samurca»ô a list of boyars and notabilities that he wanted executed. Names reportedly included Dionisie Lupu, Metropolitan of Wallachia.Vianu & Iancovici, p. 80 Meanwhile, Caimacam VƒÉcƒÉrescu wrote to promise Vladimirescu 250,000 thaler as additional aid, but, according to Liprandi, also demanded that the Pandurs arrest and kill Samurca»ô, the \\"enemy of [our] cause\\". The Pandurs had been joined by packs of Oltenian hajduks, including the already famous Iancu Jianu, and by a small selection of young boyars, including Ioan UrdƒÉreanuDjuvara, pp. 291, 299 and a group of scribes: Petrache Poenaru, Ioni»õƒÉ D√¢rzeanu, and Dumitrache Protopopescu.Potra (1963), pp. V, 4‚Äì5, 63‚Äì69 It remains uncertain whether Gheorghe Magheru, a scion of the boyar clan in Albeni, was also a volunteer Pandur in 1821.I.

RevistƒÉ de Istorie, Vol. 23, Issue 6, 1970, p. 1248 Vladimirescu still persecuted exponents of the old regime, having tax farmer Pau Nicolicescu put to death at Strehaia.G√¢rleanu, p. 60; Iorga (1921), pp. 10‚Äì13 Nevertheless, he allowed other known exploiters, including Ghi»õƒÉ Cu»õui, to join his rebel army. It is statistically probable that more than half of his army captaincies were held by third-class boyars.Ciobotea & Osiac, p. 150 The native Oltenian core was supplemented by Romanian peasants migrating from the Principality of Transylvania, which was part of the Austrian Empire; and from the Silistra Eyalet (Ottoman Dobruja).Radu »òtefan Ciobanu, \\"Evolu»õia ideii de independen»õƒÉ la rom√¢nii dobrogeni √Æntre revolu»õia condusƒÉ de Tudor Vladimirescu »ôi rƒÉzboiul pentru neat√Ærnarea neamului (1821‚Äî1877)\\", in Muzeul Na»õional, Vol. VI, 1982, p. 220 There were also massive arrivals of other Balkan ethnicities.

See also Maciu, p. 941 According to Liprandi, Olympios was always a liability in Vladimirescu's camp, manipulating both him and Ypsilantis for material gain.G√¢rleanu, p. 57; Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 82‚Äì84 Olympios also tested Vladimirescu by rescuing and protecting a renegade Pandur, Grigore C√¢rjaliul, and by murdering some of the prisoners held at Tismana.Iorga (1921), pp. 58, 216‚Äì217. See also Dieaconu, pp. 48, 49 Pharmakis, who commanded over his own cohort of \\"400 Albanians\\", also acted independently, shielding from persecutions the boyars LƒÉcusteanu.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 37‚Äì38 For his part, Vladimirescu protected the Dinicu Golescu and his family, ordering his troops to release Iordache. The latter was then given a Pandur guard which escorted him to Transylvania.Popp, p. V On February 23, Bucharest went through another regime change. Br√¢ncoveanu secretly left Bucharest and crossed into Transylvania, settling in the border city of Corona (Bra»ôov). His departure created another panic, stoked by the Albanians. Olympios and Pharmakis returned to the capital and took control of its garrison, also raiding T√¢rgovi»ôte, GƒÉe»ôti, and BƒÉicoi.Iorga (1921), pp. 53‚Äì55, 333‚Äì334 The Sultan selected a new Prince, Scarlat Callimachi, who refused to abandon Ottoman safety for his throne. Instead, Callimachi appointed a new triumvirate of Caimacami, presided upon by Stefan Bogoridi.Cernatoni, p. 45; Iorga (1921), pp. 246‚Äì249, 256‚Äì257, 333‚Äì334, 338‚Äì339 and (1932), p. 28; Vianu & Iancovici, p. 80‚Äì81 This interval also marked the return to Bucharest of Sava Fochianos, whom Callimachi had created a Binbashi of his own Albanian garrison.Finlay, pp. 122‚Äì123; Iorga (1921), pp. 256‚Äì257, 334, 335 In parallel, the Eterist uprising began with a revolt of the Moldavian military forces in Gala»õi and a pogrom of the local Turks, both staged by Vasileios Karavias.Ardeleanu, pp. 144‚Äì149; Dieaconu, pp. 46‚Äì47; Finlay, pp. 117‚Äì122; Iliescu & Miron, pp. 16, 21‚Äì24; Iorga (1921), p. 332; Rizos-Nerulos, pp. 288‚Äì289.

Overall, Moldavian boyars were shocked by Karavias' violence;Ardeleanu, pp. 148‚Äì149 the native population at large was anti-Greek by virtue of being anti-Phanariote, and only a few thousand Moldavians ever joined the Sacred Band.Djuvara, p. 297; Finlay, p. 122 Taking Bucharest In Wallachia, the combined Pandur‚ÄìAlbanian force also began moving on Bucharest, taking SlƒÉtioara on March 4. Callimachi's regency also sought to coax Vladimirescu into submission, but he ignored the offer, and, instigated by the Macedonskis, prepared a Pandur conquest of Wallachia. He then addressed the Caimacami a five-point ultimatum, which called for the removal of Phanariotes, the reestablishment of a levy army, tax relief, as well as 500,000 thaler for Vladimirescu's expenses.Iorga (1921), pp. 246‚Äì247 A document formulated as Cererile norodului rom√¢nesc (\\"Demands of the Romanian People\\") also specified a racial quota in assigning boyar offices and titles, and more generically a meritocracy. The main tax was kept, but reduced and divided into quarterly installments.Iliescu & Miron, p. 16. See also Liu, p. 300; V√¢rtosu (1945), pp. 344‚Äì345 Numerical estimates of Vladimirescu's force vary significantly.

According to various counts, they had five to eight cannons, of which two were smaller in size.Iorga (1921), pp. 203, 255, 257, 268, 290, 337, 363, 364 The Pandurs' march came with a recruitment drive. For instance, Solomon's auxiliary force held Craiova, where they began signing up burghers.Cernatoni, p. 45 Pite»ôti, which had strategic importance, was secured on March 7, and placed under Captain Simion Mehedin»õeanu. Pandur recruitment largely failed here, but the townsfolk pledged their material support.Popa & Dicu, pp. 98‚Äì100 The hostile narrator of Istoria jƒÉfuitorilor also claims that Vladimirescu was expected in Bucharest by a fifth column, comprising \\"vagabonds, foreigners, Serbian, Albanian or Bulgarian thieves, and all those Bucharest panhandlers that we mockingly call crai [kings]\\".Iorga (1921), p. 331 The breakdown of Phanariote power accelerated crossovers by the Albanians, who were no longer receiving salaries from the treasury.Iorga (1921), pp. 57, 331 Vladimirescu himself separated between loyal and disloyal Albanians. At Slatina, he had established a 40-men Serb \\"killing guard\\", possibly led by Chiriac Popescu. Its first mission was to assassinate Albanian leaders who had engaged in looting.Iorga (1921), pp. 257‚Äì259, 358‚Äì359.

See also Iliescu & Miron, pp. 23‚Äì24, 25 While camped there, the Sacred Band organized a military government, comprising Greeks and Wallachian Eterists. Going against Ypsilantis' earlier promises, it staged raids on civilians and multiple confiscations of property.Iorga (1921), pp. 59‚Äì61 As Cioranu notes, \\"Romanians never even wanted to hear [Ypsilantis' proclamations], let alone fight under his banner.\\"Iorga (1921), p. 266 The unexpected double invasion alarmed the Divan. Most boyars refused to trust in Vladimirescu's assurances, and fled Bucharest for safety in Transylvania or the countryside, although Olympios and Pharmakis tried to intercept them at Cotroceni and Ciorog√¢rla.Cernatoni, pp. 45, 50; Iorga (1921), pp. 53‚Äì54, 55, 57‚Äì60, 65‚Äì66, 255‚Äì257, 266, 332‚Äì333, 361, 363.

At Bolintin, Vladimirescu issued his appeal to Bucharesters, informing them that they had nothing to fear once they took up his cause, the cause \\"of Christendom\\".Cernatoni, pp. 45‚Äì46; Iorga (1921), pp. 260‚Äì261, 386‚Äì387 He disavowed the exiled boyars, accusing them of having made common cause with the Phanariotes.Maciu, pp. 943‚Äì944 A second proclamation on March 20 was a call to national unity, \\"for we are all parts of the same people\\".Cernatoni, p. 46 It showed his belief in class collaboration, but also, again, his ambition to stand as a national leader, governing for the benefit of the dispossessed.Iorga (1921), pp. 263‚Äì265; Maciu, p. 942 Map of Bucharest and its wards (\\"colors\\") under Tudor Vladimirescu; showing quarters of Vladimirescu and Ypsilantis' respective armies, Orthodox monasteries, and Belvedere manor The Pandurs slowly approached Bucharest from the west.

The rebel column, followed by a mass of city-dwellers, walked through the borough later known as Rahova. The procession was led on by an ensign with Vladimirescu's banner of white and blue; Vladimirescu himself held a loaf of bread, to signal prosperity.Ciobotea & Osiac, p. 153 Upon reaching Dealul Mitropoliei, he requisitioned the home of Zoe Br√¢ncoveanu, turning it into his temporary residence.Cernatoni, p. 46; Iorga (1921), pp. 58, 261‚Äì262, 335, 359‚Äì360 He and his army were welcomed by Metropolitan Dionisie, who now expressed his \\"great joy\\".Potra (1963), p. 19 Those boyars still present in the city proclaimed Vladimirescu's movement to be \\"useful and redeeming for the people\\", recognizing him as governor and taking an oath to support him.Cernatoni, p. 46; Maciu, pp. 944‚Äì945 By contrast, the Albanian garrison, supporting Fochianos, occupied the Metropolitan Church and Radu VodƒÉ Monastery, defying the Pandurs and shooting at them as they approached.Iorga (1921), pp. 58, 262‚Äì263, 335‚Äì336 and (1932), p. 28 The standoff was ended after friendly negotiations between Fochianos and Vladimirescu, resulting in a ceasefire; Fochianos recognized Vladimirescu's executive and judicial authority over Wallachia.Iorga (1921), pp. 335‚Äì336 Conflict with Ypsilantis Meanwhile, the Sacred Band, under Ypsilantis, had also reached the area, and remained camped outside the city. The two armies \\"observed each other, without merging into one another; the fundamental contradiction of [their] alliance was becoming more and more apparent\\". The Eterists pressed on to be allowed entry into Bucharest, but Vladimirescu only offered them a deserted Ghica family manor in Colentina, outside city limits. Ypsilantis and his staff were allowed to visit the city, but found themselves ridiculed by anti-Greek locals, who called theirs an army of \\"pie- makers\\".Iorga (1921), p. 266; Papacostea, p. 10 On March 25, Ypsilantis and Vladimirescu had their first meeting. Though they immediately disliked each other, they agreed to a partition of Wallachia: Vladimirescu held on to Oltenia, Bucharest, and southern Muntenia (comprising the Wallachian Plain), while the Sacred Band moved into the Muntenian stretch of the Southern Carpathians.Djuvara, p. 298; Iliescu & Miron, p. 17; Iorga (1921), p. 338. See also Georgescu, p. 103 The meeting also gave the Pandurs a chance to observe Ypsilantis' army, which they found to be alarmingly small and under- prepared.Cernatoni, pp. 46‚Äì47; Iorga (1921), pp. 266‚Äì269, 362 While the partition was ongoing, news came of Russia having denounced Ypsilantis, singled out as an enemy of the Holy Alliance. As Liprandi reports, Vladimirescu privately asked Ypsilantis to complete his transit of Wallachia or withdraw to Moldavia.Iorga (1921), p. 84; Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 84‚Äì85, 343 Ypsilantis hid this detail from his Wallachian contacts as he began taking pledges of support from the various Pandur captains.Iorga (1921), pp. 267‚Äì268; Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 84‚Äì85 He also hid from them that the Sacred Band had been anathemized by the Orthodox Patriarch, Gregory V.Iorga (1921), pp. 275‚Äì282 On March 15, Pharmakis and his troops, quartered in Lipscani, central Bucharest, broke with the Pandurs. A ceremony organized by actor Costache Aristia consecrated their own army symbols, which echoed Byzantine flags and insignia.Iorga (1921), pp. 272‚Äì274, 362 As noted by Cioranu, \\"just about most foreigners who were under Tudor's banners\\" abandoned their posts in Oltenia and joined the Sacred Band. In the process, they \\"looted churches, houses, villages, boyars, merchants and everything they could lay hands on, leaving Christians naked [...] and raping wives and girls in front of their husbands and fathers.\\"Iorga (1921), p. 254 The same Cioranu notes that the Sacred Band, though only numbering 7,000 men officially, could count then on support from at least 20,000 Greeks and allies.Iorga (1921), pp. 261‚Äì262, 268‚Äì269 Vladimirescu was nevertheless able to prevent an alliance between Fochianos and Ypsilantis, reminding the former, who was effectively his hostage,Ionel ZƒÉnescu, Camelia Ene, \\"Palatul 'de la Colentina-Tei'\\", in Magazin Istoric, May 2002, p. 54 of his pledge to the Divan.

On March 27, the boyars, instigated by him, produced a letter which informed foreign powers that the revolution only intended to restore \\"old privileges\\" and limit abuse.Cernatoni, p. 47 Vladimirescu also drafted and sent letters of fealty to Mahmud II, limiting his demands to the restoration of elective monarchy in Wallachia; the Ottomans responded that there would be such negotiation lest he surrender his weapons. At the time, the Eterist rear in Moldavia was being attacked by a pro-Ottoman, and Austrian-backed, guerrilla. Led by Gavril Istrati and flying red flags, it managed to chase the Greeks out of Boto»ôani.Iorga (1919), pp. 172‚Äì175 As argued by Iorga, this force stood for the \\"other revolution\\" (Iorga's emphasis), \\"opposed, like Tudor's was, to the Greek revolution.\\"Iorga (1919), p. 174 On April 5, Vladimirescu acknowledged Moldavian interests, writing to his own Divan, on April 5, about the possibility of a common movement for justice.Cernatoni, p. 47; Dima et al., p. 233; Maciu, p. 945 During the final days of March, amid rumors of an Ottoman retaliation, Vladimirescu barricaded his Pandurs in Cotroceni Monastery. The new fortifications were designed by the nationalist schoolteacher Gheorghe LazƒÉrBogdan-DuicƒÉ, p. 57; Dima et al., pp. 160, 163, 262; Popp, pp. XII‚ÄìXIII and built using convict labor.Iorga (1921), pp. 61‚Äì62, 337‚Äì338 The Pandurs also set up lookout points in the Metropolitan Church and at Radu VodƒÉ.Cernatoni, p. 47; Iliescu & Miron, p. 17 On April 14, Vladimirescu inspired his boyars to draft an anti-Eterist proclamation, accusing Ypsilanti of being a dishonored guest in a \\"country that had received [him] with open arms.\\" The Metropolitan and the Divan also obtained special protection from Tudor, and were moved to a safer location in Belvedere Manor, Ciurel. According to Liprandi, this was a move engineered by Filipescu-Vulpea, who planned the boyars' escape into Transylvania. Liprandi also reports that Vulpea exploited conflicts between Vladimirescu and Fochianos, presenting the latter as a mortal danger for the boyars as well.Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 81‚Äì82 In fact, the boyars were able to survive Fochianos' attempted raid on Belvedere.Iorga (1921), pp. 67‚Äì68, 284‚Äì285 From his barracks in T√¢rgovi»ôte, Ypsilantis responded to Vladimirescu's allegations with a proclamation in which he declared his disappointment, and stated his intention of leaving Wallachia to engage the Ottomans in the Balkans. However, he also began organizing northern Muntenia as an Eterist domain, sacking Vladimirescu's supporters. One report suggests that he also depleted Wallachian ammunition stores, taking away some 6,000 pounds (almost 3 tons) of gunpowder.Finlay, p. 129 Meanwhile, Vladimirescu had become more persistent in pursuing peace with the Ottomans. With the help of an Ottoman subject, Nuri Aƒüa, he circulated allegations that Ypsilantis and Callimachi were both conspirators, hinting that the Sultan could only ensure Wallachia's loyalty by removing the Phanariotes altogether.Iorga (1921), pp. 65‚Äì67. See also Finlay, p. 128 On April 18, Jianu and Constantin BorƒÉnescu were sent to Silistra to parley with the Ottomans. The negotiations were inconclusive, as Wallachians refused to either surrender or take up arms against the Sacred Band.Cernatoni, p. 47; Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 85‚Äì86.

Nuri later revealed that he had prepared bribes for Vladimirescu to use on Ypsilantis' captains. This offer was shoved aside by Vladimirescu, who explained that he feared bribing treasonous men.Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 85‚Äì86 In parallel, with a new proclamation from Cotroceni, Vladimirescu asserted that the Pandurs, Serbs and Bulgarians would stand together against Ottoman encroachment: \\"we must fire our rifles into Turkish flesh, should they invade.\\"G√¢rleanu, p. 57; Popp, p. XII Vladimirescu also reacted to the encroachment by sending his own Ispravnici to Ru»ôii, where Callimachi's Postelnic, Constantin Negri, had attempted to set his base. On Easter Sunday, 600 Ottoman soldiers stormed into Ru»ôii, executing 30 Pandurs along with 170 civilians.Iorga (1821), pp. 338‚Äì339. See also Popa & Dicu, p. 100 A Serbian outlaw, known as Ghi»õƒÉ Haidicul, punished such an incursion on March 21, capturing and maiming some 40 Turks.Dieaconu, pp. 50‚Äì51 Vladimirescu no longer intervened when the Bashi-bazouks took CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi, which they began fortifying in preparation for a larger invasion.Iorga (1821), p. 340 His revolt was nevertheless influential south of the Danube, in the Sanjak of Nicopolis. The Bulgarians here rose up in arms, but were put down by the Ottoman Army. Violent persecution against them was curbed, but later mutated into specific actions against Nicopolitan Catholics.Papacostea, pp. 11‚Äì13 During the last days of April, the Ottoman Army made its coordinated push into Wallachia, with 20,000 to 32,000 soldiers‚Äîhalf of whom headed straight for Moldavia.Iliescu & Miron, p. 18; Iorga (1921), p. 193 The other 10,000 or 14,000 were split into two columns: one, placed under Dervish Mehmed Pasha and Ioan Rogobete, entered Oltenia at Calafat; the other, led by Mehmed Selim Pasha and Kara Feiz Ali, set out of CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi into Muntenia.Iorga (1921), pp. 284‚Äì286, 288‚Äì289, 304‚Äì306. See also Iliescu & Miron, p. 18 Of the easternmost force, a regiment under Yusuf Berkofcali entered BrƒÉila en route to Moldavia, where they set fire to Gala»õi and massacred its population.Ardeleanu, pp. 154‚Äì156; Iorga (1921), p. 286; Rizos-Nerulos, pp. 312‚Äì316 This invasion force consisted of 5,500 infantry and 500 cavalry, assisted by 1,000 Zaporozhian Cossacks of the Danubian Sich; Hilmi Ibrahim Pasha also sailed to the region with some 40 Ottoman river vessels.Ardeleanu, pp. 154‚Äì156 During their subsequent invasion of Putna County, Berkofcali reportedly isolated some other remnants of Vladimirescu's army.Iliescu & Miron, pp. 26‚Äì27 On May 14‚Äì15, the Ottomans held CopƒÉceni and CƒÉ»õelu, in sight of Bucharest.Iorga (1921), pp. 289, 290, 341‚Äì342 A firman of the Porte announced that its armies would seek to administer justice, separating \\"the exploited from exploiters\\"; it commended Fochianos and Negri for their loyalism, assigning them to govern over Bucharest \\"until the peoples are as pacified as they have been in the old day.\\"Iorga (1921), pp. 286‚Äì288 This document described Vladimirescu as a loyalist who demanded \\"pity and justice\\", whereas Ypsilantis was dismissed as an \\"outcast\\".Iorga (1921), p. 287 Both Nuri and an Ottoman general, Keth√ºda Kara Ahmed, presented new offers for cooperation with the Pandurs, including promises that they would introduce a \\"settlement that is more favorable to the peasants\\".Vianu & Iancovici, p. 86 Although praised by the firman, Fochianos made a belated show of his conversion of the Eterist cause, parading through Bucharest under a \\"freedom banner\\", probably the same one flown by Aristia.Iorga (1921), pp. 75, 341‚Äì343, 362 Reportedly, Fochainos boasted his ability to \\"incite all of Bulgaria through his agents and his influence on that bellicose nation.\\"Rizos-Nerulos, p. 280 According to one interpretation, Vladimirescu still considered resisting militarily, but was suspicious of Fochianos, and abandoned this plan in favor of a full retreat.Cernatoni, p. 48 He sent his acolytes Mihali and Ghencea to meet Ypsilantis and Pharmakis at MƒÉrgineni Monastery, reportedly in order to synchronize resistance. Cioranu argues that this was merely a pretext to spy on the Sacred Band.Iorga (1921), pp. 289‚Äì290 Over those days, the two rival armies, Greek and Wallachian, had already begun moving across Wallachia and toward their respective Carpathian strongholds: Vladimirescu's set course for Oltenia, while Ypsilantis moved into northern Muntenia.Cernatoni, pp. 47‚Äì48; Djuvara, p. 298; Finlay, pp. 126‚Äì130; Georgescu, p. 103; Iorga (1921), pp. 73‚Äì77, 193‚Äì195, 282‚Äì284, 289‚Äì290, 341‚Äì344, 370 and (1932), p. 28; Potra (1990), pp. 444, 469; Rizos- Nerulos, pp. 310‚Äì311, 321‚Äì322; »òerban, pp. 281‚Äì282, 284; Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 85, 86‚Äì87 The retreat also saw military exercises which tested the troops' resilience and readiness for combat. In one reported incident, Vladimirescu staged an Ottoman attack, ordering some of his soldiers to dress up in Turkish uniforms.Iorga (1921), pp. 195‚Äì199, 370 Order and morale waned among the Pandurs, prompting Vladimirescu to met out punishments that were marked by \\"cruelty.\\"Djuvara, p. 298; Finlay, p. 130; Iorga (1921), p. 269 and (1932), pp. 27, 58 He may have killed as many as 30 of his own soldiers, some of them by his own hand.Iorga (1921), pp. 199‚Äì200, 290‚Äì291. See also Iliescu & Miron, p. 18; Jelavich, p. 25 The retreat also infuriated the Sacred Band. According to one account, Ypsilantis sent Fochianos in pursuit of the Wallachian column.Iorga (1921), pp. 343‚Äì344 Other versions suggest that Fochianos, still in contact with the Porte, expected to \\"play the two sides against each other and then side with the winner\\",Rizos-Nerulos, pp. 321‚Äì322 or \\"an opportunity of making the prince [Ypsilantis] prisoner\\". Olympios also followed the Pandurs and, upon reaching them, demanded that Vladimirescu return to fight for Bucharest. During a subsequent standoff on the banks of C√¢rcinov, Vladimirescu agreed to hold deescalation talks.Cernatoni, p. 48; Iliescu & Miron, p. 18; Iorga (1921), pp. 199‚Äì200, 290‚Äì293, 371‚Äì373; Popa & Dicu, pp. 100‚Äì101 Terror against his own troops had peaked during the Pandurs' passage through Arge»ô County. At Gole»ôti, Vladimirescu ordered the hanging of Ioan UrdƒÉreanu, as punishment for the desertion of four Pandur captains. This incident reportedly caused distress, greatly diminishing Pandur support for their leader.Djuvara, p. 299; Iorga (1921), pp. 293‚Äì297, 371‚Äì372 According to the scribe D√¢rzeanu, Olympios and Pharmakis used the negotiations at Gole»ôti, which resulted in a renewed pact with the Sacred Band, to approach Pandur malcontents and probe their commitments.Iorga (1921), p. 84; Vianu & Iancovici, p. 87 Vladimirescu also fell out with the Macedonskis, who claimed to have stumbled upon proof that he had embezzled 1 million thaler, and announced that they would surrender him to the Divan for trial.Vianu & Iancovici, p. 89 On May 21, Ypsilantis' agents marched into the camp and seized Vladimirescu, confident that none of his soldiers would resist them.Cernatoni, p. 48; Djuvara, p. 299; Iliescu & Miron, p. 18; Iorga (1921), pp. 84, 201‚Äì203, 269, 293‚Äì297 and (1932), p. 58; Maciu, pp. 946, 948; Popa & Dicu, p. 101; Vianu & Iancovici, pp. 89‚Äì90 Cioranu recalls that the Eterists displayed Vladimirescu's correspondence with the Porte, prompting the Pandurs to rally behind Prodan and Macedonski, identified as their new commanders.Iliescu & Miron, p. 18; Iorga (1921), pp. 296‚Äì297.

Having just crossed the border into Transylvania, they opted not to return.Potra (1963), pp. 26, 68‚Äì69; Dima et al., p. 296 Other Pandur sympathizers followed suit. They include poet Iancu VƒÉcƒÉrescu, who took with him a sabre that he claimed had been Vladimirescu's.Bogdan-DuicƒÉ, p. 29; Dima et al., p. 192 This influx alarmed Transylvanian authorities, who feared that Pandurs would incite revolution among the Grenz infantry and the serfs of Hunyad County.

The Wallachian revolt had generally more delayed and less conspicuous results. Sociologist Dimitrie DrƒÉghicescu was particularly dismissive of the 1821 movement, viewing it as a sample of Romanian \\"passivity\\": \\"[it] was so unlike a real, courageous, revolution; it can be reduced to a rally of no consequence.\\"Dimitrie DrƒÉghicescu, Din psihologia poporului rom√¢n. Introducere, 450. Bucharest: Libraria Leon Alcaly, 1907 According to Djuvara, Vladimirescu failed because \\"the time had not yet come for what he intended to accomplish\\": \\"he never managed to entice the peasant mass of the villages, where his message never penetrated the way it should have. [...] The class he could have relied on‚Äîand to which he did not himself belong‚Äî, that of traders and artisans, the barely nascent bourgeoisie, was not at that junction structured enough to represent a political force.\\"Djuvara, p. 300 V√¢rtosu also describes the Pandurs were a \\"first generation of democracy\\", but a \\"sacrificial generation\\"‚Äî\\"there was little ideological preparation in the Country\\".V√¢rtosu (1945), pp. 347‚Äì348 Similarly, Potra notes that the \\"revolutionary movement of 1821\\" was actually hailed by Bucharesters as an opportunity for \\"national liberation\\", \\"but could not have achieved this.\\" Instead, \\"this first revolution, which opened the way for a line of struggles [...] for the independence and freedom of the Romanian nation, has violently shaken up the feudal order, contributing to the demise of the Phanariote regime.\\"Potra (1990), p. 18 Maciu contrarily believes that Vladimirescu's movement could have in fact brought about \\"bourgeois rule\\" and the capitalist mode of production, but that it never took off as an actual revolution.Maciu, pp. 940‚Äì941, 947‚Äì948 Karl Marx once categorized the 1821 events as a \\"national insurrection\\" rather than \\"peasants' revolt\\". As Maciu concludes, this acknowledges that the revolt was carefully planned, but fell short of stating a bourgeois objective.Maciu, pp. 947‚Äì948 Vladimirescu endured in the symbolic realm, a hero of folklore and literature, \\"a legend [...] which will serve to nurture the builders of modern Romania.\\" As poet Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu argued, the Pandurs had managed to take Wallachia out of her \\"somnolence\\" and \\"degeneracy\\".Bogdan-DuicƒÉ, pp. 50, 52 In its immediate aftermath, however, the revolt sparked mainly negative commentary. A cluster of chroniclers, boyar and conservative, still dominated the literary scene. They include Dobrescu, Alecu Beldiman, Naum R√¢mniceanu, and Zilot Rom√¢nul, all of whom disliked Vladimirescu.Dima et al., pp. 123, 127, 132, 138, 142 A noted exception to this rule was the Aromanian patriot Toma Gheorghe Pe»ôacov.Dima et al., pp. 123, 139‚Äì141 Though he probably never approved of Vladimirescu's social discourse, Dinicu Golescu subdued his criticism, and expressed his own concerns about the corv√©e system.Popp, pp. V‚ÄìVI, XIII‚ÄìXIV Through its parallel depiction in folklore, the Pandur rising was transposed into foreign literature: some of the first ballads about Vladimirescu or Fochianos were collected in the Bessarabia Governorate by Alexander Pushkin (who was enthusiastic about the revolt, as early as February 1821),Cochran, pp. 311‚Äì313 and reused as literary sources by Alexander Veltman.S.

One of the early signs of change came just months after its suppression, when the Divan restored T√¢rgovi»ôte to its citizens, and the \\"cartel of the four [princely] families\\" was formally annulled.Djuvara, pp. 191, 296 In July 1822, after having heard a new set of boyar complaints which had Russian and Austrian backing, the Sultan put an end to the Phanariote regime, appointing Grigore IV Ghica (the former Caimacam of 1821) and Ioan Sturdza as \\"native\\" Princes of Wallachia and Moldavia, respectively.Cernatoni, p. 49; Djuvara, p. 307; Georgescu, pp. 103‚Äì105; Iliescu & Miron, p. 19; Iorga (1921), p. 321 and (1932), pp. 8, 16, 26, 30‚Äì32, 54‚Äì55; Jelavich, pp. 26‚Äì27; Karpat, pp. 406, 407; LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 231, 259; Maciu, p. 948; Nistor, passim; Zane, p. 232 Trying to appease Russia, in 1826 the Ottoman Empire also signed the Akkerman Convention, which set commercial freedoms for Wallachians and the Moldavians, and allowed the Divans to elect their Princes for seven-year terms.Djuvara, pp. 320, 323; Jelavich, pp. 27‚Äì28.

Drawing by Michel Bouquet, 1841 According to Jelavich, repressive measures against the Romanian peasantry remained subdued: \\"although villages were disarmed and attempts were made to collect the taxes and labor obligations that were due from the period of the rebellion, the entire matter was handled with relative moderation.\\"Jelavich, p. 27 Overall, however, the Vladimirescu revolt and the Sacred Band contributed to the \\"tangible degradation\\" of Wallachia's economy, which was only enhanced by the \\"terrible plundering\\" of Ottoman occupation.Djuvara, pp. 223‚Äì224 Le Moniteur Universel reported that \\"everything in the countryside has been destroyed; what Greek revolutionaries could not accomplish, the Ottoman vanguard did.\\"»òerban, pp. 285‚Äì286 A monetary crisis, sparked by the events of 1821 and cemented by the recovery of boyar privilege, affected both principalities for an entire decade.Zane, pp. 202‚Äì209, 221‚Äì222 Troubles continued under Ghica, including raids by Albanians hiding in Transylvania and a number of riots. In 1826 Simion Mehedin»õeanu attempted a new uprising at Pade»ô; he was defeated and hanged.Dieaconu, pp. 55‚Äì57 Despite Ottoman concessions, Wallachia and Moldavia fell to a new Russian occupation in 1828‚Äì1829. During this phase, the Pandurs were revived by Governor Pavel Kiselyov and Costache Ghica, who created new units throughout Muntenia. The Divan, fearful of rebellion, reduced the number of Oltenian recruits, while Muntenians simply kept away.Nistor, pp. 889‚Äì891, 895‚Äì896 Liprandi commanded his own Russian unit in the campaign, giving employment to many Albanians who had lived the previous seven years as marauding outlaws.Dieaconu, pp. 49, 57 This time saw the rise of a new Pandur commandant, Gheorghe Magheru. After policing Oltenia, he saw action again at »òi»ôe»ôti, repelling 3,000 Ottomans with a force of 450 Pandurs. The Russian regime was extended by a new constitutional arrangement, Regulamentul Organic, which made the two countries Russian-controlled territories under Ottoman suzerainty. The corresponding Treaty of Adrianople enhanced commercial freedoms, and is credited as the birth certificate of Romanian capitalism, with its modern middle class and a new standard of living.Dima et al., pp. 7‚Äì8, 13, 229‚Äì230, 434; Djuvara, pp. 324, 327‚Äì329; Georgescu, pp. 122, 127‚Äì133; Karpat, pp. 407‚Äì408; Popa & Dicu, pp. 103‚Äì104; Popp, pp. XI‚ÄìXII; Potra (1990), p. 348 The full reestablishment of Wallachia's professional military under Russian command was, according to Potra, also a means to perpetuate a \\"strong revolutionary tradition\\" that included the Pandur unrest.Potra (1963), p. 163 The new system continued to be perceived as oppressive by the peasants, giving rise to various attempted revolts, particularly in Oltenia. In the 1830s, Gorj and Dolj witnessed peasant rioters shouting slogans such as \\"Tudor has come back to life!\\"Barbu, pp. 153‚Äì154 A veteran of 1821, Nicolae GroazƒÉ, reverted to a life of crime. This \\"last Romanian hajduk\\", captured and tried in 1838, defended himself by noting that he followed in the footsteps of Vladimirescu, Pharmakis, and Solomon.Alecu Russo, Scrieri postume. Traduse de V. Alecsandri, Al. Odobescu, Mihail Sadoveanu, pp. 154‚Äì164. Craiova: Scrisul Rom√¢nesc, [n. y.]. During this interval, Vladimirescu associate Poenaru became organizer of Wallachian education. Although he had abandoned his youthful radicalism, Poenaru encouraged research into the revolt, as well as artistic homages to Vladimirescu.Potra (1963), pp. V‚ÄìVII, 4‚Äì5, 69, 216 The Pandurs' colors may also have inspired political symbolism adopted the \\"native\\" rulers. Vladimirescu's banner, though blue-and-white, had blue-yellow-red tassels; a memory of this color scheme may have inspired the adoption of Wallachian ensigns and Romanian tricolors.PƒÉlƒÉnceanu, pp. 136‚Äì139 In Moldavia, as early as 1843, historian Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu praised Vladimirescu for having \\"raised the national flag\\" to demand \\"a national government, founded on a liberal charter.\\"Maciu, p. 931 Later echoes Coat of arms of Gorj County during the communist period.

This revival of interest was contrasted by conservative views. Poet and essayist Grigore Alexandrescu viewed Vladimirescu as \\"nearsighted and cruel\\",Bogdan-DuicƒÉ, p. 263 while Grigore LƒÉcusteanu defined the uprising as a \\"first attempt to murder Romanian aristocracy, so that the nobodies and the churls may take its place\\".LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 28‚Äì29 Solomon, though he had served Vladimirescu and remained a Pandur commander, also turned conservative during the 1840s.Barbu, pp. 134, 153; Dima et al., p. 605; LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 147‚Äì164, 169‚Äì175, 232 Eventually, the Regulamentul regime was ended by the Crimean War, which also opened the way for the creation of a Romanian state from the union of Moldavia and Wallachia.

Aricescu to write a new history of the revolt.Iorga (1921), pp. V‚ÄìVI This populist trend was continued following the proclamation of a Kingdom of Romania. The original rebel flag, preserved by the Cacala»õeanu family, was recovered in 1882 and assigned to the Romanian Land Forces by Hasdeu.PƒÉlƒÉnceanu, pp. 135‚Äì136 In the 1890s, Constantin Dobrescu-Arge»ô, the agrarian leader and Pandur descendant, made reference to the Vladimirescu revolt as a precursor to his own movement.Nicolae Gh.

The atoms are typically represented by spheres, connected by rods which represent the bonds. Double and triple bonds are usually represented by two or three curved rods, respectively, or alternately by correctly positioned sticks for the sigma and pi bonds. In a good model, the angles between the rods should be the same as the angles between the bonds, and the distances between the centers of the spheres should be proportional to the distances between the corresponding atomic nuclei. The chemical element of each atom is often indicated by the sphere's color. In a ball-and-stick model, the radius of the spheres is usually much smaller than the rod lengths, in order to provide a clearer view of the atoms and bonds throughout the model. As a consequence, the model does not provide a clear insight about the space occupied by the model. In this aspect, ball-and-stick models are distinct from space-filling (calotte) models, where the sphere radii are proportional to the Van der Waals atomic radii in the same scale as the atom distances, and therefore show the occupied space but not the bonds. Computer ball-and-stick model of cyclohexane. Ball-and-stick models can be physical artifacts or virtual computer models. The former are usually built from molecular modeling kits, consisting of a number of coil springs or plastic or wood sticks, and a number of plastic balls with pre-drilled holes. The sphere colors commonly follow the CPK coloring. Some university courses on chemistry require students to buy such models as learning material. History Hofmann's 1865 ball-and-stick model of methane (CH4). Later discoveries disproved this geometry. In 1865, German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann was the first to make ball-and-stick molecular models. He used such models in lecture at the Royal Institution of Great Britain. Specialist companies manufacture kits and models to order. One of the earlier companies was Woosters at Bottisham, Cambridgeshire, UK. Besides tetrahedral, trigonal and octahedral holes, there were all-purpose balls with 24 holes. These models allowed rotation about the single rod bonds, which could be both an advantage (showing molecular flexibility) and a disadvantage (models are floppy). The approximate scale was 5 cm per √•ngstr√∂m (0.5 m/nm or 500,000,000:1), but was not consistent over all elements. The Beevers Miniature Models company in Edinburgh (now operating as Miramodus) produced small models beginning in 1961 using PMMA balls and stainless steel rods. In these models, the use of individually drilled balls with precise bond angles and bond lengths enabled large crystal structures to be accurately created in a light and rigid form.

He won the Single Sculls World Championship six times during the early part of the 20th century. Early life Richard Arnst leading a group of cyclists to the finish line in a two-mile scratch race Richard Arnst was the eighth of thirteen children born to Hermann and Catharina Arnst. The family lived at Tai Tapu near Christchurch. He, and his brothers Jack, Herman and Bill (William),https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1039757942755079.1073741850.154992607898288&type;=1&l;=acf80bedd8 became champion cyclists both on the road and on the track. Richard and Jack were placed fourth and third respectively in the 1903 Timaru to Christchurch road race which was over a distance of . Jack subsequently won, in record time, the 1903 road race between Warrnambool and Melbourne over a distance of . Some of the credit of this win was due to Arnst's unselfish pacing of his brother. Richard gained 5th place in this race in the second fastest time, that was inside the previous best time. The brothers returned to Australia in 1904 with Richard finishing in 10th and Jack well back in 25th. In 1905 Jack could only manage 76th with Richard in 77th. On the brothers second trip to Australia in 1904 they raced in the Goulburn to Sydney Classic with Jack finishing 2nd and setting the fastest time, and Richard finishing 12th. Jack again set the fastest time in 1905, finishing 15th while Richard suffered with cramps. Richard Arnst culminated his cycling career by winning the Sydney Thousand in March 1906. The Sydney Thousand was a track race which carried a total prize purse of ¬£1000 and thus was the richest track race in the world at that time. Only the very top cyclists were in the final held in Sydney. Sculling World Champion After this Richard Arnst took up sculling; a sport in which he had no previous experience. He was tutored in Australia by experts and after six months or so started winning some races. On the strength of these he challenged various leading Australian scullers for a match race but most were rejected on the grounds that he was too inexperienced. However, one was accepted by Harry Pearce, for a stake of ¬£100 a side. The race was won by Arnst who subsequently challenged fellow New Zealander William Webb (rower) for the professional Single Sculls World Championship title. Webb had won the title in Sydney in 1907, and held off one challenge in New Zealand. These races were normally over a distance of about three and a quarter miles. Webb accepted Arnst's challenge with the stake at ¬£500 a side. The sum of ¬£500 would be the amount of money earned over several years by a working man at the time. The match was held on the Whanganui River (New Zealand) on 15 December 1908 and Arnst won by eight or ten lengths. He had achieved the distinction of becoming World Champion after only a couple of years or so in the sport. Subsequent matches Webb vs Arnst sculling race, Whanganui River A rematch between Arnst and Webb was arranged for 22 June 1909 on the same course. A fast time of 18m.15s was recorded by Arnst who again won, this time by two to three lengths. Arnst was then challenged for the title by George Whelch of Akaroa, a town near Christchurch. This race was held on Akaroa Harbour on 4 April 1910 and the stake agreed to was ¬£300 a side. The result was never in doubt; Arnst crossing the line several lengths in front of the challenger. The next challenge came from Ernest Barry, the Champion of England. Barry wanted Arnst to travel to England for the match which he was willing to do provided certain expenses were met. (Normally a challenger would travel to where the Champion lived.) Barry was unable to arrange the expenses but then the British South Africa Company offered to stage the match in Northern Rhodesia. They believed the match would promote the company and the country. Stakes and expenses were guaranteed by the company and the match was arranged to be run on the Zambezi River on 18 August 1910. Arnst's brother went ahead of them on the river to shoot the crocodiles. The heat and the altitude affected both scullers but Arnst was the better of the two and he crossed the line in front of Barry to retain his title. Richard Arnst was by now often known as 'Dick' and the next challenge for his crown came from Harry Pearce, the Australian Champion. The match was to be raced on the Parramatta River (Sydney) on 29 July 1911 and the stake was again for ¬£500 a side. Professional sculling was immensely popular and it was estimated that one hundred thousand people turned out to see this match. During the race Arnst nearly fouled his opponent, which would have cost him the game, but he managed to save himself and went on to win. Championship loss Ernest Barry wanted another tilt at the title and challenged Arnst to a race to be held on the Thames (England). Strangely, the date agreed to was 29 July 1912, exactly a year after the previous race. Arnst travelled to England to scull the race which was over a distance of about four and a quarter miles on the Championship Course. This time it was Barry who crossed the line in first place. Later events Arnst next raced Jim Paddon for the Championship of Australia. The stake was ¬£200 a side and the race was held on the Parramatta course on 1 November 1913. Paddon won and subsequently went on to win the World's Championship after the War. Barry held off three challenges before the First World War which put all title matches on hold. After the War, Barry lost the title on the Thames to Alf Felton of Australia. A rematch was arranged and Barry travelled to Sydney, Australia to meet Felton with the result that Barry again became World Champion on 31 August 1920. Champion again Before the race, Dick Arnst had issued a newspaper challenge to the winner of the Felton/Barry match. Barry returned to England and retired from the sport, so Arnst claimed the title by forfeiture. There was no controlling body responsible for the title (nor for many other professional titles) so the claim by Arnst stood. A number of world titles and or claims to them were only generally recognised as being valid when they were accepted by various sporting newspapers, and by implication, the general public. Final races Dick Arnst wanted to defend his otherwise empty title and accepted a challenge from New Zealander Pat Hannan. This race was sculled on the Wairau River, near Blenheim, New Zealand, on 11 June 1921 with the result confirming Arnst as World Champion for the sixth time. His final race for the world title took place on the Whanganui River on 5 January 1922. The challenger was Darcy Hadfield, another New Zealander, who had been an Olympic rower and bronze medal winner, and who won the match in a fairly convincing manner. Hadfield subsequently lost the title to Australian Jim Paddon. In April 1922 Arnst and Paddon agreed to row for the title but the race never eventuated. In 1924 Arnst challenged Hannan for the Australasian title. The race for the Australasian title was, unusually, held on the Waikato River on 26 October over a course of three and a quarter miles. Hannan got the lead at the start and maintained it throughout. Arnst broke part of his right scull on a piece of driftwood near the start but he later said that it had made no difference to the result of the race. Hannan won by over twenty lengths. Life after sculling Arnst had always been a good shot and after retiring from sculling he became active in shooting and won the following New Zealand Gun Clubs' Championships; 1926 Live Pigeons, 1928 Live Pigeons, 1930 Sparrows, and 1932 Clay Birds. In 1934 Arnst bought a farm south of Timaru running sheep and cattle, and growing crops, in partnership with his brother Henry. Richard Arnst died in 1953. Two years later a Christchurch street, Arnst Place, was named after him. The Arnst River in the Nelson Lakes National Park is also named after him. In 1995 Arnst was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame. Arnst was a man who had been held in high esteem by his peers and was a fine, well liked, and honourable sportsman.

In the same period SGN spent ¬£500 million on upgrading the network.  History  The company was formed in 2005 as Scotia Gas Networks. In September 2014 they changed their name to SGN. The rebrand was driven by a desire to present with a greater unity between the two distinct geographic areas of its business. Those are Scotland and the south of England, where SGN owns and maintains the gas network. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority bought a 16.7% equity stake in SGN in 2016. In September 2020 SGN announced that they were working together with global engineering and consultancy company Wood, in order to create a ‚Äúdecarbonisation roadmap‚Äù for the north-east and east coast of Scotland.  2014 Rebrand  In 2014, Scotia Gas Networks, Scotland Gas Networks and Southern Gas Networks were rebranded to SGN. The company believed the previous names did not represent the business as \\"bright, forward thinking experts\\", and that the name \\"SGN\\" would be better for customers to understand what SGN does as a company. The logo was also changed. From 2005, the logo was originally red and blue dots forming a shape of the United Kingdom. The red dots covered Scotland and the southern area on the \\"Scotia Gas Networks\\" logo, just Scotland for the \\"Scotland Gas Networks\\" logo and just the southern area for \\"Southern Gas Networks\\". This was to highlight where works are carried out by the company. The new logo shows a cylinder filled with orange, blue and purple dots.  Funding for Innovation  In 2014 SGN was awarded funding from the industry regulator, Ofgem, to develop two projects. Opening up the Gas Market is an investigation into whether the British Gas Safety Regulations could be changed to accept different types of gas. Robotics is a project to develop technology for repairing steel mains without interrupting the gas.  Corporate Social Responsibility  A partnership between Girlguiding and SGN is designed to encourage young women into male dominated industries and also spread a message about gas safety and carbon monoxide. SGN also works with Royal Voluntary Service to produce a leaflet for winter safety, targeting the elderly.

The casino was New Zealand's first when it opened in 1994. The casino operates five hundred slot machines and thirty-four table games. The property has three restaurants and two bars. Entry is restricted to patrons above the age of 20. Ownership On 29 June 2004, SkyCity Entertainment Group announced that it had settled the acquisition of Aspinall (NZ) Limited, which held a 40.5% shareholding in Christchurch Casinos Limited. The purchase price was NZ$93.75 million (on a debt free basis). The deal marked the end of an era for Aspinall. Skyline Enterprises, which controls a 41 per cent stake in the casino, had opposed SkyCity's purchase of a matching stake from Aspinall earlier in 2004. As part of his resistance to the deal, Mr. Thomas had refused to cooperate over due diligence. Skyline had attempted to purchase the 41 per cent stake from Aspinall but had been rebuffed. Skyline Enterprises chairman Barry Thomas had objected to the SkyCity purchase on the basis that it gave SkyCity an interest in five out of six New Zealand casinos. The deal was nonetheless approved by both the Casino Control Authority and the Commerce Commission. In clearing SkyCity's application, the Commerce Commission said that the deal would not substantially restrict competition in the Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin casino entertainment markets.SkyCity Completes Casino Deal SkyCity gets nod for casino purchase SkyCity Entertainment Group Managing Director, Evan Davies, said that SkyCity's acquisition of the shares in Aspinall and its interest in CCL was a logical extension of its New Zealand operations and in line with the company's investment strategy. The acquisition was motivated in part by the 2003 Gambling Act which outlaws the opening of any new casinos in New Zealand.SkyCity press release:Cleared To Buy Interest In Christchurch Casino In December 2012, both partners reached a deal, in which SkyCity sold its shares in the casino to Skyline for $80 million, and bought Skyline's 40% stake in Skycity Queenstown for $5 million. As a result, Skyline Enterprises became the major owner of Christchurch Casino.  Expansion plans  In November 2016, Christchurch Casino announced it will build a 200-room hotel.

Cuthbert's baseball career began in 1865 with the Keystone Club of Philadelphia. After two seasons as a second baseman and outfielder with the Keystones, he moved across town to the West Philadelphia club, playing only four games for them before joining the Philadelphia Athletics. With Cuthbert, the Athletics won national championships in 1867 and 1868. A solid batsman and outfielder, Ned jumped to the Chicago White Stockings in 1870. Cuthbert was with a number of teams in the National Association and its successor, the National League, playing in Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, and Cincinnati. After game-fixing allegations surfaced as part of the Brown Stockings 1877 season, Brown Stockings ownership officially withdrew from the National League and folded the team. In time for the 1878 season, Ned Cuthbert and four other former players of the Brown Stockings spent the next few years (1878‚Äì1881) playing as a reorganized, semi-professional baseball team, filling vacant positions with the best of the St. Louis amateur players. Cuthbert played with the semi- professional Brown Stockings (1878, 1879, and 1881) and the St. Louis Red Stockings (1880). It was Cuthbert who, while working at his saloon during these years, convinced grocery and saloon owner Chris von der Ahe to invest in the Brown Stockings and return them to professional baseball status. Von der Ahe purchased the Brown Stockings in 1880, changed their name to the Browns, and returned them to professional status in 1882. In 1882, Cuthbert became the player/manager for the St. Louis team of the newly formed American Association. The following year, Cuthbert relinquished the managerial duties but continued with the Brown Stockings as a player before jumping to the Baltimore Monumentals of the ill-fated Union Association in 1884, his final season. Reportedly, Cuthbert stole the first base in organized baseball in 1865 while playing for the Philadelphia Keystones, simply by waiting for the pitcher to be distracted and running from first to second base. However, according to Peter Morris' \\"A Game Of Inches\\", base-stealing was part of baseball well before 1865; the earliest explicit account of stealing a base goes back to 1856. Cuthbert died of endocarditis in St. Louis, Missouri, and was laid to rest at Bellefontaine Cemetery.

It is located at 167 San Marco Avenue. On August 27, 1987, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The St. Johns County Jail now serves as the Old Jail Museum. The Old Jail The building was designed and constructed by the P.J. Pauley Jail Building and Manufacturing Company of St. Louis, Missouri in 1891. Its construction was financed by Henry Flagler, who struck a deal with the county for $10,000 because the former jail building stood on land that Flagler needed for the construction of his Ponce de Le√≥n Hotel. The Old Jail served as the St Johns County Jail until 1953. After the jail facilities were moved to a new, more modern building, the vacant Old Jail building was sold to entrepreneur Henry \\"Slim\\" McDaniel who began operating the remarkably well preserved building as a roadside tourist attraction. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Originally built to house up to 72 prisoners, the two story northern wing of the Jail consists of a general population and maximum security area, a women's section and a lower level kitchen. Maximum Security housed the most dangerous prisoners held at the Jail and includes a Death Row cell, for those condemned to die. A total of 8 men were hung from the Gallows on the Jail compound during its history. Overall conditions at the Jail for those serving varying sentences were quite poor by modern standards and prisoners were typically used as free farm laborers during the day. Baths were infrequent, toilet facilities consisted of one bucket per cell and diet was poor and was typically supplemented by any animals that the prisoners might catch while working on the fields. Segregation by race was steadfastly adhered to at the Jail and disease, violence and death were commonplace. The two story southern wing of the Jail consists of an Office for the Sheriff and living quarters for his family. Old Jail Museum The Old Jail Museum consists of a restored jail with sheriff's living quarters. It also contains a display of weaponry and a pictorial history of the hangings carried out at the Old Jail, with emphasis on the time the Sheriff CJ Perry was in residence with his family. The Jail is only accessible by guided tour, with costumed guides \\"processing\\" in the new prisoners. The Jail also serves as the grand finale to Old Town Trolley's Ghost and Gravestones tour, allowing visitors to access the building by night as well.

The Queen v. Donald Payne ..., www.publications.parliament.uk, July 2005 He was jailed for one year and dismissed from the army. Service career Donald Payne joined the British Army on 5 June 1988, enlisting with the Queen's Lancashire Regiment, which subsequently amalgamated into the 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment. He was promoted to the substantive rank of Corporal on 30 June 2000. As an NCO he worked as a Provost Corporal with the Regimental Police in Catterick Garrison. He also served in Iraq, South Armagh, and the Former Yugoslavia He had earned the following decorations/awards: General Service Medal with Northern Ireland clasp, NATO Medal with Former Yugoslavia clasp, Accumulated Campaign Service Medal, The Queen's Jubilee Medal and the Iraq Medal His service career ended on 30 April 2007 when he was reduced to the ranks and dismissed from Her Majesty's armed forces for his conduct in Iraq. War crimes On 14 September 2003, a number of Iraqis were detained by British forces in raids on hotels in Basra. The detainees were taken to a three-room building in Basra, where they were questioned for 36 hours. Among the detainees was Baha Mousa, a 26-year-old employee of the Haitham Hotel in Basra, who died as a result of the interrogation. The subsequent post-mortem found 93 injuries, including fractured ribs and a broken nose. Detainees claimed that the British soldiers had held kicking competitions, competing to see who could kick the prisoners the furthest. Prisoners were also made to assume stress positions and were beaten and kicked if they failed to do so. Court martial On 19 July 2005, Attorney General Lord Goldsmith announced that Payne was being charged with manslaughter, perverting the course of justice and inhumane treatment of persons under the International Criminal Court Act 2001. On the same day, another ten soldiers were also charged with similar crimes, six relating to the death of Mousa and four relating to the death of another Iraqi, Ahmed Jabber Kareem Ali, on 8 May 2003. The Court Martial was held in Bulford Camp, Wiltshire, after an investigation by the Royal Military Police. It convened in the autumn of 2006, and concluded six months later in April 2007, being the most expensive Court Martial in modern British military history During the court martial, Corporal Payne admitted he \\"enjoyed\\" hearing Iraqis call out during torture, describing their cries of pain as \\"the choir\\". He was cleared of manslaughter and perverting the course of justice. Six other soldiers were cleared of any charges. After earlier pleading guilty to the offence of inhuman treatment of persons protected under the Geneva Conventions, Corporal Donald Payne was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, reduced to the ranks, and dismissed from Her Majesty's Armed Forces, on 30 April 2007. On all other charges, Cpl Payne, and the other defendants, were acquitted when the presiding judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, ruled that there was no evidence against them. Mr Justice McKinnon suggested that he believed there had been some level of covering-up with relation to the case, when he stated during the proceedings that \\"None of those soldiers has been charged with any offence, simply because there is no evidence against them as a result of a more or less obvious closing of ranks.\\" Video of Payne abusing prisoners On 13 July 2009, a video reportedly showing Cpl Payne abusing Iraqi prisoners was released as part of the evidence being presented to the public inquiry into the death of Baha Mousa. The video reportedly shows Cpl Payne forcing hooded and bound prisoners into stress positions, pushing and shoving prisoners, and aggressively shouting obscenities at them whilst they clearly vocalise their distress. Procedures shown in the video were banned from use by British military personnel on 2 March 1972, by Edward Heath, the Prime Minister at the time, after IRA internees in Northern Ireland were subjected to similar techniques. The ban was announced the day the Parker Report was published and found them to be illegal under English law.

For example, the tag en stands for English; es-419 for Latin American Spanish; rm- sursilv for Sursilvan; gsw-u-sd-chzh for Z√ºrich German; nan-Hant-TW for Min Nan Chinese as spoken in Taiwan using traditional Han characters. To distinguish language variants for countries, regions, writing systems etc., IETF language tags combine subtags from other standards such as ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166-1, and UN M.49. The tag structure has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in Best Current Practice (BCP) 47; the subtags are maintained by the IANA Language Subtag Registry. IETF language tags are used by computing standards such as HTTP,, HTML, XML, and PNG.  History  IETF language tags were first defined in RFC 1766, edited by Harald Tveit Alvestrand, published in March 1995. The tags used ISO 639 two-letter language codes and ISO 3166 two-letter country codes, and allowed registration of whole tags that included variant or script subtags of three to eight letters. In January 2001, this was updated by RFC 3066, which added the use of ISO 639-2 three-letter codes, permitted subtags with digits, and adopted the concept of language ranges from HTTP/1.1 to help with matching of language tags. The next revision of the specification came in September 2006 with the publication of RFC 4646 (the main part of the specification), edited by Addison Philips and Mark Davis and RFC 4647 (which deals with matching behaviour). RFC 4646 introduced a more structured format for language tags, added the use of ISO 15924 four-letter script codes and UN M.49 three-digit geographical region codes, and replaced the old registry of tags with a new registry of subtags. The small number of previously defined tags that did not conform to the new structure were grandfathered in order to maintain compatibility with RFC 3066. The current version of the specification, RFC 5646, was published in September 2009. The main purpose of this revision was to incorporate three-letter codes from ISO 639-3 and 639-5 into the Language Subtag Registry, in order to increase the interoperability between ISO 639 and BCP 47.Language Tag Registry Update charter  Syntax of language tags  Each language tag is composed of one or more \\"subtags\\" separated by hyphens (-). Each subtag is composed of basic Latin letters or digits only. With the exceptions of private-use language tags beginning with an x- prefix and grandfathered language tags (including those starting with an i- prefix and those previously registered in the old Language Tag Registry), subtags occur in the following order: * A single primary language subtag based on a two- letter language code from ISO 639-1 (2002) or a three-letter code from ISO 639-2 (1998), ISO 639-3 (2007) or ISO 639-5 (2008), or registered through the BCP 47 process and composed of five to eight letters; * Up to three optional extended language subtags composed of three letters each, separated by hyphens; (There is currently no extended language subtag registered in the Language Subtag Registry without an equivalent and preferred primary language subtag. This component of language tags is preserved for backwards compatibility and to allow for future parts of ISO 639.) * An optional script subtag, based on a four-letter script code from ISO 15924 (usually written in Title Case); * An optional region subtag based on a two-letter country code from ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (usually written in upper case), or a three-digit code from UN M.49 for geographical regions; * Optional variant subtags, separated by hyphens, each composed of five to eight letters, or of four characters starting with a digit; (Variant subtags are registered with IANA and not associated with any external standard.) * Optional extension subtags, separated by hyphens, each composed of a single character, with the exception of the letter x, and a hyphen followed by one or more subtags of two to eight characters each, separated by hyphens; * An optional private-use subtag, composed of the letter x and a hyphen followed by subtags of one to eight characters each, separated by hyphens. Subtags are not case-sensitive, but the specification recommends using the same case as in the Language Subtag Registry, where region subtags are UPPERCASE, script subtags are Title Case, and all other subtags are lowercase. This capitalization follows the recommendations of the underlying ISO standards. Optional script and region subtags are preferred to be omitted when they add no distinguishing information to a language tag. For example, es is preferred over es-Latn, as Spanish is fully expected to be written in the Latin script; ja is preferred over ja-JP, as Japanese as used in Japan does not differ markedly from Japanese as used elsewhere. Not all linguistic regions can be represented with a valid region subtag: the subnational regional dialects of a primary language are registered as variant subtags. For example, the valencia variant subtag for the Valencian dialect of Catalan is registered in the Language Subtag Registry with the prefix ca. As this dialect is spoken almost exclusively in Spain, the region subtag ES can normally be omitted. IETF language tags have been used as locale identifiers in many applications. It may be necessary for these applications to establish their own strategy for defining, encoding and matching locales if the strategy described in RFC 4647 is not adequate. The use, interpretation and matching of IETF language tags is currently defined in RFC 5646 and RFC 4647. The Language Subtag Registry lists all currently valid public subtags. Private-use subtags are not included in the Registry as they are implementation-dependent and subject to private agreements between third parties using them. These private agreements are out of scope of BCP 47.  Relation to other standards  Although some types of subtags are derived from ISO or UN core standards, they do not follow these standards absolutely, as this could lead to the meaning of language tags changing over time. In particular, a subtag derived from a code assigned by ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166, or UN M.49 remains a valid (though deprecated) subtag even if the code is withdrawn from the corresponding core standard. If the standard later assigns a new meaning to the withdrawn code, the corresponding subtag will still retain its old meaning. This stability was introduced in RFC 4646.  ISO 639-3 and ISO 639-1  RFC 4646 defined the concept of an \\"extended language subtag\\" (sometimes referred to as extlang), although no such subtags were registered at that time. RFC 5645 and RFC 5646 added primary language subtags corresponding to ISO 639-3 codes for all languages that did not already exist in the Registry. In addition, codes for languages encompassed by certain macrolanguages were registered as extended language subtags. Sign languages were also registered as extlangs, with the prefix sgn. These languages may be represented either with the subtag for the encompassed language alone (cmn for Mandarin) or with a language-extlang combination (zh- cmn). The first option is preferred for most purposes. The second option is called \\"extlang form\\" and is new in RFC 5646. Whole tags that were registered prior to RFC 4646 and are now classified as \\"grandfathered\\" or \\"redundant\\" (depending on whether they fit the new syntax) are deprecated in favor of the corresponding ISO 639-3‚Äìbased language subtag, if one exists. To list a few examples, nan is preferred over zh-min-nan for Min Nan Chinese; hak is preferred over i-hak and zh-hakka for Hakka Chinese; and ase is preferred over sgn-US for American Sign Language.  ISO 639-5 and ISO 639-2  ISO 639-5 defines language collections with alpha-3 codes in a different way than they were initially encoded in ISO 639-2 (including one code already present in ISO 639-1). Specifically, the language collections are now all defined in ISO 639-5 as inclusive, rather than some of them being defined exclusively. This means that language collections have a broader scope than before, in some cases where they could encompass languages that were already encoded separately within ISO 639-2. For example, the ISO 639-2 code afa was previously associated with the name \\"Afro-Asiatic (Other)\\", excluding languages such as Arabic that already had their own code. In ISO 639-5, this collection is named \\"Afro-Asiatic languages\\" and includes all such languages. ISO 639-2 changed the exclusive names in 2009 to match the inclusive ISO 639-5 names. To avoid breaking implementations that may still depend on the older (exclusive) definition of these collections, ISO 639-5 defines a grouping type attribute for all collections that were already encoded in ISO 639-2 (such grouping type is not defined for the new collections added only in ISO 639-5). BCP 47 defines a \\"Scope\\" property to identify subtags for language collections. However, it does not define any given collection as inclusive or exclusive, and does not use the ISO 639-5 grouping type attribute, although the description fields in the Language Subtag Registry for these subtags match the ISO 639-5 (inclusive) names. As a consequence, BCP 47 language tags that include a primary language subtag for a collection may be ambiguous as to whether the collection is intended to be inclusive or exclusive. ISO 639-5 does not define precisely which languages are members of these collections; only the hierarchical classification of collections is defined, using the inclusive definition of these collections. Because of this, RFC 5646 does not recommend the use of subtags for language collections for most applications, although they are still preferred over subtags whose meaning is even less specific, such as \\"Multiple languages\\" and \\"Undetermined\\". In contrast, the classification of individual languages within their macrolanguage is standardized, in both ISO 639-3 and the Language Subtag Registry.  ISO 15924, ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode  Script subtags were first added to the Language Subtag Registry when RFC 4646 was published, from the list of codes defined in ISO 15924. They are encoded in the language tag after primary and extended language subtags, but before other types of subtag, including region and variant subtags. Some primary language subtags are defined with a property named \\"Suppress-Script\\" which indicates the cases where a single script can usually be assumed by default for the language, even if it can be written with another script. When this is the case, it is preferable to omit the script subtag, to improve the likelihood of successful matching. A different script subtag can still be appended to make the distinction when necessary. For example, yi is preferred over yi-Hebr in most contexts, because the Hebrew script subtag is assumed for the Yiddish language. As another example, zh- Hans-SG may be considered equivalent to zh-Hans, because the region code is probably not significant; the written form of Chinese used in Singapore uses the same simplified Chinese characters as in other countries where Chinese is written. However, the script subtag is maintained because it is significant. Note that ISO 15924 includes some codes for script variants (for example, Hans and Hant for simplified and traditional forms of Chinese characters) that are unified within Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646. These script variants are most often encoded for bibliographic purposes, but are not always significant from a linguistic point of view (for example, Latf and Latg script codes for the Fraktur and Gaelic variants of the Latin script, which are mostly encoded with regular Latin letters in Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646). They may occasionally be useful in language tags to expose orthographic or semantic differences, with different analysis of letters, diacritics, and digraphs/trigraphs as default grapheme clusters, or differences in letter casing rules.  ISO 3166-1 and UN M.49  Two-letter region subtags are based on codes assigned, or \\"exceptionally reserved\\", in ISO 3166-1. If the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency were to reassign a code that had previously been assigned to a different country, the existing BCP 47 subtag corresponding to that code would retain its meaning, and a new region subtag based on UN M.49 would be registered for the new country. UN M.49 is also the source for numeric region subtags for geographical regions, such as \`005\` for South America. Region subtags are used to specify the variety of a language \\"as used in\\" a particular region. They are appropriate when the variety is regional in nature, and can be captured adequately by identifying the countries involved, as when distinguishing British English (en-GB) from American English (en-US). When the difference is one of script or script variety, as for simplified versus traditional Chinese characters, it should be expressed with a script subtag instead of a region subtag; in this example, zh-Hans and zh-Hant should be used instead of zh-CN and zh-HK. When a distinct language subtag exists for a language that could be considered a regional variety, it is often preferable to use the more specific subtag instead of a language-region combination. For example, ar-DZ (Arabic as used in Algeria) may be better expressed as arq for Algerian Spoken Arabic.  Extensions  Extension subtags (not to be confused with extended language subtags) allow additional information to be attached to a language tag that does not necessarily serve to identify a language. One use for extensions is to encode locale information, such as calendar and currency. Extension subtags are composed of multiple hyphen-separated character strings, starting with a single character (other than x), called a singleton. Each extension is described in its own IETF RFC, which identifies a Registration Authority to manage the data for that extension. IANA is responsible for allocating singletons. Two extensions have been assigned as of January 2014.  Extension T (Transformed Content)  Extension T allows a language tag to include information on how the tagged data was transliterated, transcribed, or otherwise transformed. For example, the tag en-t-jp could be used for content in English that was translated from the original Japanese. Additional substrings could indicate that the translation was done mechanically, or in accordance with a published standard. Extension T is described in RFC 6497, published in February 2012. The Registration Authority is the Unicode Consortium.  Extension U (Unicode Locale)  Extension U allows a wide variety of locale attributes found in the Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) to be embedded in language tags. These attributes include country subdivisions, calendar and time zone data, collation order, currency, number system, and keyboard identification. Some examples include: * gsw-u-sd-chzh represents Swiss German as used in the Canton of Z√ºrich. * ar-u-nu-latn represents Arabic-language content using Basic Latin digits (0 through 9) instead of Arabic-script digits (Ÿ† through Ÿ©). * he-IL-u-ca-hebrew-tz-jeruslm represents Hebrew as spoken in Israel, using the traditional Hebrew calendar, and in the \\"Asia/Jerusalem\\" time zone as identified in the tz database. Extension U is described in RFC 6067, published in December 2010. The Registration Authority is the Unicode Consortium.

The assistance, which can reach to over $400 billion annually,United States Office of Management and Budget; Office of Federal Financial Management, The Single Audit is provided and administered by federal government agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through special programs to recipients. Definition The term assistance (or benefits) is defined by the federal government as:2006 CFDA ; \\"Introduction And How To Use This Catalog\\"; pg. I, par. 6-8 Federal assistance programs To provide federal assistance in an organized manner, the federal government offers assistance through federal agencies. It is the agency's responsibility to adequately provide assistance, as well as manage, account, and monitor the responsible use of federal funds used for that assistance. The agencies then supply the assistance to beneficiaries (known as recipients, see below), such as States, hospitals, poverty-stricken families, etc., through hundreds of individual programs. These programs are defined by the federal government as: \\"any function of a Federal agency that provides assistance or benefits for: (1) a State or States, territorial possession, county, city, other political subdivision, grouping, or instrumentality thereof; (2) any domestic profit or nonprofit corporation or institution; or (3) an individual; other than an agency of the Federal government\\". Therefore, programs (or \\"functions\\") can refer to any number of activities or services provided by agencies, such as building a bridge, providing food or medicine vouchers to the poor, or providing counseling to violence victims. Programs are assigned to offices within a federal agency and may include administrative personnel who work directly or indirectly with the program. Each program is created with a specific purpose and has unique operations and activities, (i.e., no program is made for the same purpose and to operate the same way as a previously existing program) and it is assigned an official name to differentiate it from other programs. A program may be called by a different term than its official name by the general public, by an entity, or even by law or regulation‚Äîsuch as by the type of activity or service it engages, by a specific project name (e.g., the Big Dig tunnel project), or any other similar term. This type of name, title or term given to a program is called the \\"popular name\\".2006 CFDA ; \\"Introduction And How To Use This Catalog: Organization of this Catalog\\"; pg. VIII, par. 7; \\"Program Title, Number and Popular Name\\" However, the official name of program is standardized within the federal government so that federal agencies can maintain better accountability of their assigned assistance. For example, an individual who receives rent assistance payments through the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program might not know the exact official name of the program, and may simply call it the \\"rent subsidizing\\" program, due to its type of activity or service. However, there are many other federal rent subsidizing programs, which require standard program names to differentiate them. In this case, programs such as Supportive Housing for the Elderly (Sec. 202), which is a project-based rental assistance program exclusively for the elderly and Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program-Special Allocations, a rent assistance program usually tied to public housing projects, also engage in the activity of rent subsidizing.OMB A-133: Compliance Supplement , Part 4, pg. 4-14.182-1: \\"Supportive Housing for the Elderly (Sec. 202)\\" (CFDA 14.157), pg. 4-14.157-1 & \\"Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program-Special Allocations (CFDA 14.195) Examples of federal assistance programs * Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Block Grant * Child and Adult Care Food Program * Community Development Block Grant * Conservation Reserve Program * Federal Pell Grant * Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program * Head Start * Local Law Enforcement Block Grant * Nutrition Assistance for Puerto Rico * Private landowner assistance program (PLAP) * Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher * Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Federal grants and awards Programs administer assistance by \\"granting\\" or \\"awarding\\" a portion of the assistance to recipients. These are called Federal grants or awards. Recipients must first apply for the award directly to the federal agency that administers the program. The agency must then determine the amount of assistance to be awarded and notifies the recipient of the award. To be official, an award requires a contract or grant agreements between the agency and the recipient that details the use of the award and restrictions and limitations. Federal awards may specify a time period during which the recipient may use the assistance. This is called the Period of Availability of Federal Funds.OMB A-133: Compliance Supplement ; Part III, pg. 3-H-1, Period of Availability of Federal Funds, par. 1 Most grants have a term of one year (although some may have a longer lifespan, even indefinitely), and the recipient must use the assistance within that timeframe. This is done because federal assistance is tied to the federal government's budget process, and any funds not used by a recipient within the specified time limit is reverted to other uses. As a condition of receiving Federal awards or grants, recipients must agree to comply with the applicable laws and regulations related to the program and its agency, as well as any provisions included in the contracts and grant agreements entered between the recipient and the agency.OMB A-133: Compliance Supplement ; Part I, pg. 1-6, par. 5 Failure to do so may lead to sanctions, including fines and penalties, exclusion or suspension from participating in federal assistance programs and activities, and/or criminal charges. Most federal program regulations for which agencies and recipients must always comply are compiled in the Code of Federal Regulations, with summaries and guidance for these regulations contained in OMB Circular letters. Types of federal grants Given the enormous size of federal assistance provided, the Federal government has designed different types of grants, each with its own unique way of awarding and/or operating: *Project grants are awarded competitively. Project grants are the most common form of grants and a large number are found in scientific research, technology development, education (such as Federal Pell Grants), social services, the arts and health care types of assistance. *Formula grants provide funds as dictated by a law. Examples of this type of grant includes Aid to Families with Dependent Children and the Job Training Partnership Act, and the Work Incentive Program. These can be sub-categorized as either Categorical or Block: **Categorical grants may be spent only for narrowly defined purposes and recipients often must match a portion of the federal funds. **Block grants combine categorical grants into a single program. Examples of this type of grant includes the Community Development Block Grant and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Block Grant. Recipients of block grants have more leeway in using funds than recipients of individual categorical grants. *Earmark grants are explicitly specified in appropriations of the U.S. Congress. They are not competitively awarded, and have become controversial because of the involvement of political lobbyists used in the process of awarding them to recipients. In fiscal year 1996 appropriations, the Congressional Research Service found 3,023 earmarks totalling $19.5 billion, while in FY2006 it found 12,852 earmarks totalling $64 billion. Recipients A recipient of federal awards or funds is defined as any non-federal entity that receives federal assistance and is part of, or located within, the United States and its territories and possessions. Recipients are grouped into six main categories, as established by the GSA:2006 CFDA ; \\"Introduction And How To Use This Catalog\\"; pg. III; Types of Assistance * State governments - This category includes any of the 50 States of the United States and the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.), or any agency or instrumentality of these governments, with the exception of institutions of higher education (colleges and universities) and hospitals. * Local governments - This category includes any county, parish, municipality, city, town, township, village, State- designated Indian tribal government, local public authority, school district, special district, intrastate district, council of governments, sponsor group representative organizations, and other regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or instrumentality of a local government, which are located within the U.S. * Territories and possessions - This category includes the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, Guam, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and American Samoa. * Indian Tribal governments - This category includes the governing body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community (including any Native village) within the U.S. and its territories. These must first be certified by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior as eligible to receive assistance under special programs and services provided through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service. * Non-profit organizations and institutions ‚Äì This category includes semi- public, public and private institutions of higher education and hospitals, Native American Indian Organizations, and any other semi-public and private nonprofit organizations. However, Federally funded research and development centers are excluded from this category. * Private individuals ‚Äì This category includes Native Americans, homeowners, students, farmers, artists, scientists, consumers, small businesses, refugees, aliens, veterans, senior citizens, low- income persons, health and education professionals, builders, contractors, developers, handicapped persons, and the physically afflicted. Examples of direct assistance to these individuals include Section 8 vouchers, Pell Grant scholarships, and disaster relief awards, among many others. Every program is designed with a specific recipient in mind. Certain programs have restrictions on who may receive the assistance because of the nature of its activity or service. Examples include infrastructure programs and grants, which are usually restricted to States, local governments, and U.S. territories‚Äîbecause these are usually the only entities that administer public roads, bridges, etc. Another example is health-related research grants, which individuals are eligible for as long as they satisfy certain criteria, such as that they have a professional or scientific degree, three years of research experience, and are a citizen of the United States.2006 CFDA ; \\"Introduction And How To Use This Catalog: Organization of this Catalog\\"; pg. IX; \\"Eligibility Requirements: Applicant Eligibility\\" Pass-through entities and sub- recipients The federal government allows certain entities mentioned above to act as a Pass-through entity that provides the federal assistance to another recipient. The Pass-through entity is still considered a recipient, but the assistance assigned to it may be \\"passed on\\" or \\"passed-through it\\" to another recipient. The entity that receives the assistance from a pass-through entity is a sub-recipient.U.S. State Department Grant Terminology U.S. DOJ Glossary of Terms This is allowed because certain federal programs may not have the organizational structure to provide assistance directly to the final recipient and requires support from other entities. For example, crime- prevention federal programs may be assigned to a State Attorney General's Office (AGO) (considered a State government). This State office may decide to assign part of its federal grant through sub-grants (also known as sub-awards) to cities and counties within the State (considered local governments) for crime-prevention activities such as neighborhood watch programs or supplying new equipment to police forces. The original recipient, the AGO, has become a Pass-through entity and the cities and counties have become \\"sub-recipients\\", all the while the assistance is still serving the federal program's purpose to prevent crime. Sub-recipients may in turn pass on the assistance to another sub-recipient to serve the purpose required by the federal program, for example if the cities mentioned above pass on part of their assistance to nonprofit organizations dedicated to patrolling neighborhoods at night. Therefore, a recipient may be considered a pass-through entity and a sub- recipient at the same time. Certain programs may require the original recipient to pass on the assistance to sub-recipients (i.e., the federal program requires that the assistance be provided to nonprofit neighborhood watch organizations, and the assistance passes recipient through recipient until it reaches them), while others may require that the recipient not pass on the assistance (i.e., State must use the assistance entirely on its own). Some programs award assistance to a pass-through entity who is neither the direct applicant nor the ultimate beneficiary, such as the Pell Grant program where students apply and receive the aid but it is the university's responsibility to receive and administer the applications and disburse the aid. Pass-through entities and sub-recipients are equally responsible for the management of federal aid received. The federal government monitors the federal aid provided to any recipient and requires all pass-through entities to monitor the aid they pass on. Noncompliance of a federal regulation on the part of the sub-recipient may also be attributed to the pass-through entity because it is still responsible for the funds it passed on. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) logo.The task of organizing and categorizing federal assistance programs into a uniform and standardized system has been assigned to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) since 1984.2006 CFDA; \\"Introduction And How To Use This Catalog\\"; pg. I, par. 2 There were precursor catalogs to this one, focusing on particular topics and maintained by other groups, such as the US office of education https://archive.org/details/ERIC_ED067776/page/n17/mode/2up pub. 1972 pg. iii . The GSA achieves these tasks by maintaining the Federal assistance information database, which incorporates all federal agency programs that provide grants and awards to recipients. The Office of Management and Budget assists the GSA in maintaining the database by serving as an intermediary agent between the Federal agencies and GSA. In addition to these tasks, the Federal Program Information Act requires the GSA to provide federal assistance information to the general public through the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA), a free register, which incorporates both federal agency and federal program information. This register acts both as a directory and as a dictionary, facilitating both recipients and the general public in finding information of a specific program. Currently, programs in the Catalog are being classified by the GSA into 15 types of assistance, which are then sub- classified into seven financial types of assistance and eight non-financial types of assistance: Financial type assistance * Formula Grants (A) ‚Äì Includes allocations of money to States or their subdivisions in accordance with distribution formulas prescribed by law or administrative regulation, for activities of a continuing nature not confined to a specific project. Examples of this type of assistance include transportation and infrastructure grants designated by Congress, such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). * Project Grants (B) ‚Äì Includes funding of specific projects for fixed or known periods.

CFDA number To help potential recipients locate a federal program, the General Services Administration assigns a two-digit number unique to each federal agency authorized to provide assistance, and a three digit number to each federal assistance program within that agency. With these designations, a federal assistance program is identified by the combination of both numbers, which in turn creates a five digit number divided by a dot (55.555). The two digit numbers assigned to federal agencies are: * 10 ‚Äì United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) * 11 ‚Äì United States Department of Commerce (DOC) * 12 ‚Äì United States Department of Defense (DoD) * 14 ‚Äì United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) * 15 ‚Äì United States Department of the Interior (DOI) * 16 ‚Äì United States Department of Justice (DOJ) * 17 ‚Äì United States Department of Labor (DOL) * 19 ‚Äì United States Department of State (DOS) * 20 ‚Äì United States Department of Transportation (DOT) * 21 ‚Äì United States Department of the Treasury (TREAS) * 45 ‚Äì National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) * 66 ‚Äì United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) * 81 ‚Äì United States Department of Energy (DOE) * 84 ‚Äì United States Department of Education (ED) * 93 ‚Äì United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) * 94 ‚Äì Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) * 96 ‚Äì Social Security Administration (SSA) * 97 ‚Äì United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) * 98 ‚Äì United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Monitoring activities Due to the extensive amount of assistance the federal government provides, federal agencies rely on numerous monitoring activities performed by themselves, pass-through entities, and external sources. The most common monitoring procedure is the Single Audit. This is an annual examination of a recipient's operations and records that determines whether or not the recipient complied with laws and regulations applicable to the assistance they received. Additionally, Federal agencies routinely visit recipients and inspect their records and statements to check for situations of noncompliance with laws and regulations, and require periodic financial and performance reports that detail recipient operations. Federal agencies also require pass-through entities to perform similar procedures to their sub-recipients, since they are responsible for the assistance they pass on.Understanding Single AuditsOMB A-133: Compliance Supplement ; Part III, pg. 3-M-1: Sub-recipient MonitoringThe Single Audit Act: Audits of States, Local Governments and Non-Profit Organizations; AICPA Audit Committee Toolkit: Non-profit Organizations; American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Notes References Primary sources * 2006 Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) of the United States General Services Administration * United States Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement * U.S. State Department Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, Grants Division, Grant Terminology * U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Glossary of Terms Secondary sources * Understanding Single Audits by Henry Flood, Grantsmanship Center Magazine, Fall 2002, retrieved on June 30, 2006 * The Single Audit Act: Audits of States, Local Governments and Non-Profit Organizations; AICPA Audit Committee Toolkit: Non-profit Organizations; American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Further reading * Rhett D.

Prior to 1978, WJOF featured a mixture of beautiful music and, at night, country music. On June 10, 1980, the call letters were switched to the current WZYP. Through most of the 1980s, WZYP was northern Alabama's top-rated station, dethroned only by WDRM when country experienced a resurge in popularity among young people in the late 1980s and 1990s. Nonetheless, it has remained among the Huntsville market's most-listened to stations through the mid-2000s. Ownership On April 1, 2003, WZYP was sold by Athens Broadcasting Co. (William E.

Plot Blackadder and Baldrick are discussing the latter's latest feeble cunning plan: namely, Baldrick carving his name on a bullet to get around the fact that \\"there's a bullet with [his] name on it\\". Lt. George enters and provides Blackadder with a copy of the propaganda magazine King and Country, which Blackadder uses for toilet paper, and a new service revolver. Blackadder deduces from these ominous signs that an advance against the Germans is imminent, one which they will probably not survive. Baldrick suggests that they take up cooking at HQ to get out of the assault but Blackadder shoots down the idea, knowing Baldrick is the worst cook in the world: his cream custard, for instance, is really just cat's vomit. Shortly afterwards, Blackadder is called to the office of General Melchett for a special mission: Field Marshal Haig's supreme tactical plan (where the men climb out of their trenches and walk slowly towards the enemy, a plan they've used 18 times before) is weakening the men's morale and he is in search of a way to raise their spirits. After Blackadder jokingly suggests Haig's resignation and suicide (which Melchett takes literally and notes down), he is told that they need new inspiring artwork for the front cover of King and Country. Blackadder is uninterested until he learns that the artist needs to leave the trenches for Paris, and attempts to paint a work of art by himself. He and Baldrick both fail, but when George reveals he can paint surprisingly well, Blackadder gets him to paint a picture of a British soldier (resembling Blackadder) standing next to the body of a dead nun in a ruined French village. When Melchett and Captain Darling arrive to inspect their work, Blackadder displays his own painting \\"War\\" in place of George's. The General rejects it; George tries to protest, but he and Baldrick are only to speak when given permission by Blackadder, which the Captain refuses to grant. The next painting, Baldrick's \\"My Family and Other Animals\\", shows vomit and is rejected by Melchett as well. Blackadder proceeds to take credit for George's painting, earning himself the position of war artist. Melchett then reveals that the King and Country cover story was just a ploy: instead of Paris, the chosen artist will in fact go into No-Man's Land and draw the enemy positions. With debatable help from George and Baldrick, he returns with a sketch illustrating immense but fictional enemy defensive capabilities, including a large number of elephants. Darling and Blackadder suggest that the push should be cancelled. Melchett responds by saying that would be exactly what the enemy would expect ‚Äì and therefore what they won't do, in order to make the Germans think that the British Intelligence is rotten. Melchett orders the attack anyway, which Blackadder, George and Baldrick avoid by dressing up as Italian chefs and substituting themselves for Melchett's chef. After serving Baldrick's vile cuisine to Melchett and Darling, the three escape back to the trenches, where Blackadder asks Baldrick how he managed ‚Äùto get so much custard out of such a small cat‚Äù.

Founded in 1889 as Cuttington College by Episcopal Church of the United States (ECUSA), it is the oldest private, coeducational, four-year, degree-granting institution in sub-Saharan Africa. History In 1887, Robert Fulton Cutting, treasurer of the ECUSA, donated $5000 to an Episcopalian bishop in Liberia for the establishment of a school for teaching Liberian children ‚Äî both Americo- Liberian and native ‚Äî about industry and agriculture.Saha, Santosh C. ‚ÄúAgriculture in Liberia during the Nineteenth Century: Americo-Liberians' Contribution‚Äù, Canadian Journal of African Studies, Vol. 22, No. 2 (1988), Canadian Association of African Studies, pp. 224-239. The university was finally established in 1889 by Samuel David Ferguson in Cape Palmas where it remained until 1929. Named Cuttington College when it opened, M. P. Keda Valentine served as the first principal followed by Samuel Taylor. Among the first private colleges in the West African region, the school was seen as a college for Liberia's elite.Rossouw, Henk. ‚ÄúA Liberian University Rises Up From the Ravages of War‚Äù, The Chronicle of Higher Education, November 9, 2001, International, p. 58. Some of the earliest graduates included \\"two chief justices of the Liberian Supreme Court and three associate justices, one minister of education and many civil servants\\". In 1948, the college moved to Suacoco in Bong County, 120 miles north of Liberia's capital of Monrovia. Prior to the First Liberian Civil War, 45% of government officials were alumni of the college. In the wake of the 1980 military coup, the college continued to be favoured with government assistance, as the Ministry of Action for Development and Progress provided approximately $1.5 million for the college's 1981-1982 budget.Greaves, Cynthia. \\"Cuttington Will Open Next Month\\". Daily Observer 1981-03-04: 12. During the First Liberian Civil War from 1989 to 1996 the school was looted and the structures were damaged and the campus used as a training facility for militias. From 1990 to 1997 the school operated only at an office in the U.S. state of Virginia. In 1998, the now Cuttington University College re-opened with a class of 103 students. The college has now reopened for the third time in its history (the second founding was at its current location was in 1948), after a lengthy period of civil conflict. On August 15, 2004, 117 students graduated on the war-ravaged campus in various disciplines, with the highest number of graduates being in nursing. War damage On February 5, 2004, the President of Cuttington, Dr. Henrique F. Tokpa met his son Captain Matthew J. Denkyan of the U.S. Army who is assigned to Liberia as a military observer. They were part of an inspection team who toured the partially renovated facilities which had been damaged by looters during the war. #The Dunbar Building, which houses the office of Registrar; bookstore and a few classrooms had been de-roofed and heavy and repeated rain storms had damaged the ceiling, roofing frame and nearly all of the books that had been previously donated by the County College of Morris in Randolph, New Jersey, USA. #The AFRICANA Museum is in similar condition to the Dunbar Building (zinc and ceiling material have been removed by looters and the roofing timbers had been exposed to the weather and only the concrete walls and rafters remained in place. #The Tubman Library had sustained less structural damage, but extensive looting and on site destruction of books and facilities has taken place there. #The Seth C. Edwards cafeteria has been partially de-roofed and some of the roofing timbers had collapsed. #A grass fire had destroyed a building that had been built by the Lutheran Church as the guest house for commuting professors. The fire had created extensive cracks in the structure and will have to be demolished. The cause of the grass fire is unknown, but during the dry Harmattan season grass fires are common, but during the war they burned out of control. #The newly constructed Power House which was constructed with a USAID and ASHA grant is relatively intact although looters entered the building, less damage was done. Details Cuttington University is located 120 miles north of Monrovia in Suacoco, Bong County Cuttington University is the oldest private, coeducational, four-year, degree-granting institution in sub-Saharan Africa. It issues degrees in the liberal arts and a number of technical studies. It has educated generations of leaders for the nation of Liberia and West Africa. Its roots lie deep within the history of the nation, the relationship between Liberia and the United States, and the Episcopal Church. Currently the school is attempting to find sponsors who will help to improve its communications with the world. Since the end of the war, regular telephone, electricity, and internet service have been restored. The campus also runs its own water treatment facility. At present a volunteer web site is maintained remotely in the United States. The Cuttington University public radio and television stations planned to resume broadcasts by January 2010. The campus, 120 miles from Monrovia, includes only a single- story white structure. These are set among rolling hills and cotton trees as well as rice paddies and the native tropical plants. Next to campus is the school's affiliated hospital, Phebe Hospital. Cuttington is a member of the Association of African Universities.

The ancient Tamil philosopher Valluvar, in his Tirukkural, taught ahimsa and moral vegetarianism as a personal virtue. Animal rights is the idea in which some, or all, animals are entitled to the possession of their own existence and that their most basic interests‚Äîsuch as the need to avoid suffering‚Äîshould be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings.Taylor (2009), pp. 8, 19‚Äì20; Rowlands (1998), p. 31ff. That is, some species of animals have the right to be treated as the individuals they are, with their own desires and needs, rather than as an unfeeling property. Its advocates oppose the assignment of moral value and fundamental protections on the basis of species membership alone‚Äîan idea known since 1970 as speciesism, when the term was coined by Richard D. Ryder‚Äîarguing that it is a prejudice as irrational as any other.Horta (2010). They maintain that animals should no longer be viewed as property or used as food, clothing, research subjects, entertainment, or beasts of burden.That a central goal of animal rights is to eliminate the property status of animals, see Sunstein (2004), p. 11ff. *For speciesism and fundamental protections, see Waldau (2011). *For food, clothing, research subjects or entertainment, see Francione (1995), p. 17. Multiple cultural traditions around the world such as Jainism, Taoism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shintoism and Animism also espouse some forms of animal rights. In parallel to the debate about moral rights, animal law is now widely taught in law schools in North America, and several legal scholars, such as Steven M. Wise and Gary L. Francione, support the extension of basic legal rights and personhood to non-human animals. The animals most often considered in arguments for personhood are hominids. This is supported by some animal rights academics because it would break through the species barrier, but opposed by others because it predicates moral value on mental complexity, rather than on sentience alone.For animal law courses in North America, see \\"Animal law courses\\" , Animal Legal Defense Fund. Retrieved July 12, 2012. *For a discussion of animals and personhood, see Wise (2000), pp. 4, 59, 248ff; Wise (2004); Posner (2004); Wise (2007). *For the arguments and counter-arguments about awarding personhood only to great apes, see Garner (2005), p. 22. *Also see Sunstein, Cass R. (February 20, 2000). \\"The Chimps' Day in Court\\", The New York Times. As of November 2019, 29 countries have currently enacted bans on hominoid experimentation, and Argentina has granted a captive orangutan basic human rights since 2014. Critics of animal rights argue that nonhuman animals are unable to enter into a social contract, and thus cannot be possessors of rights, a view summed up by the philosopher Roger Scruton, who writes that only humans have duties, and therefore only humans have rights. Another argument, associated with the utilitarian tradition, is that animals may be used as resources so long as there is no unnecessary suffering; they may have some moral standing, but they are inferior in status to human beings, and any interests they have may be overridden, though what counts as \\"necessary\\" suffering or a legitimate sacrifice of interests varies considerably.Garner (2005), pp. 11, 16. *Also see Frey (1980); and for a review of Frey, see Sprigge (1981). Certain forms of animal rights activism, such as the destruction of fur farms and animal laboratories by the Animal Liberation Front, have also attracted criticism, including from within the animal rights movement itself,Singer (2000), pp. 151‚Äì156. as well as prompted reaction from the U.S. Congress with the enactment of laws allowing these activities to be prosecuted as terrorism, including the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act. Historical development in the West Moral status and animals in the ancient world Aristotle argued that animals lacked reason (logos), and placed humans at the top of the natural world. Aristotle stated that animals lacked reason (logos), and placed humans at the top of the natural world, yet the respect for animals in ancient Greece was very high. Some animals were considered divine, e.g. dolphins. In the Book of Genesis 1:26 (5th or 6th century BCE), Adam is given \\"dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\\" Dominion need not entail property rights, but it has been interpreted, by some, over the centuries to imply \\"ownership\\".Francione (1995), p. 36. Contemporary philosopher Bernard Rollin writes that \\"dominion does not entail or allow abuse any more than does dominion a parent enjoys over a child.\\" Rollin further states that the Biblical Sabbath requirement promulgated in the Ten Commandments \\"required that animals be granted a day of rest along with humans. Correlatively, the Bible forbids 'plowing with an ox and an ass together' (Deut. 22:10‚Äì11). According to the rabbinical tradition, this prohibition stems from the hardship that an ass would suffer by being compelled to keep up with an ox, which is, of course, far more powerful. Similarly, one finds the prohibition against 'muzzling an ox when it treads out the grain' (Deut. 25:4‚Äì5), and even an environmental prohibition against destroying trees when besieging a city (Deut. 20:19‚Äì20). These ancient regulations, virtually forgotten, bespeak of an eloquent awareness of the status of animals as ends in themselves\\", a point also corroborated by Norm Phelps. The philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras (c. 580‚Äìc. 500 BCE) urged respect for animals, believing that human and nonhuman souls were reincarnated from human to animal, and vice versa.Steiner (2005), p. 47; Taylor (2009), p. 37. Against this, Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BCE), student to the philosopher Plato, said that nonhuman animals had no interests of their own, ranking them far below humans in the Great Chain of Being. He was the first to create a taxonomy of animals; he perceived some similarities between humans and other species, but stated for the most part that animals lacked reason (logos), reasoning (logismos), thought (dianoia, nous), and belief (doxa).Sorabji (1993), p. 12ff.; Wise (2007). Theophrastus (c. 371 ‚Äì c. 287 BCE), one of Aristotle's pupils, argued that animals also had reasoning (logismos) and opposed eating meat on the grounds that it robbed them of life and was therefore unjust.Taylor (2009), p. 37.Sorabji (1993) p. 45 ff. Theophrastus did not prevail; Richard Sorabji writes that current attitudes to animals can be traced to the heirs of the Western Christian tradition selecting the hierarchy that Aristotle sought to preserve. Plutarch (1 C. CE) in his Life of Cato the Elder comments that while law and justice are applicable strictly to men only, beneficence and charity towards beasts is characteristic of a gentle heart. This is intended as a correction and advance over the merely utilitarian treatment of animals and slaves by Cato himself. Tom Beauchamp (2011) writes that the most extensive account in antiquity of how animals should be treated was written by the Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry (234‚Äìc. 305 CE), in his On Abstinence from Animal Food, and On Abstinence from Killing Animals.Beauchamp (2011a), pp. 4‚Äì5. *Porphyry. On Abstinence from Animal Food , translated by Thomas Taylor, Animal Rights Library. *Also see Clark (2011), pp. 37‚Äì38. 17th century: Animals as automata Early animal protection laws in Europe According to Richard D. Ryder, the first known animal protection legislation in Europe was passed in Ireland in 1635. It prohibited pulling wool off sheep, and the attaching of ploughs to horses' tails, referring to \\"the cruelty used to beasts.\\"The Statutes at Large. Dublin, 1786, cited in Ryder (2000), p. 49. In 1641, the first legal code to protect domestic animals in North America was passed by the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The colony's constitution was based on The Body of Liberties by the Reverend Nathaniel Ward (1578‚Äì1652), an English lawyer, Puritan clergyman, and University of Cambridge graduate. Ward's list of \\"rites\\" included rite 92: \\"No man shall exercise any Tirrany or Crueltie toward any brute Creature which are usually kept for man's use.\\" Historian Roderick Nash (1989) writes that, at the height of Ren√© Descartes' influence in Europe‚Äîand his view that animals were simply automata‚Äîit is significant that the New Englanders created a law that implied animals were not unfeeling machines.Nash (1989), p. 19. The Puritans passed animal protection legislation in England too. Kathleen Kete writes that animal welfare laws were passed in 1654 as part of the ordinances of the Protectorate‚Äîthe government under Oliver Cromwell (1599‚Äì1658), which lasted from 1653 to 1659, following the English Civil War. Cromwell disliked blood sports, which included cockfighting, cock throwing, dog fighting, bull baiting and bull running, said to tenderize the meat. These could be seen in villages and fairgrounds, and became associated with idleness, drunkenness, and gambling. Kete writes that the Puritans interpreted the biblical dominion of man over animals to mean responsible stewardship, rather than ownership. The opposition to blood sports became part of what was seen as Puritan interference in people's lives, and the animal protection laws were overturned during the Restoration, when Charles II was returned to the throne in 1660.Kete (2002), p. 19 ff. Ren√© Descartes The great influence of the 17th century was the French philosopher Ren√© Descartes (1596‚Äì1650), whose Meditations (1641) informed attitudes about animals well into the 20th century. Writing during the scientific revolution, Descartes proposed a mechanistic theory of the universe, the aim of which was to show that the world could be mapped out without allusion to subjective experience. His mechanistic approach was extended to the issue of animal consciousness. Mind, for Descartes, was a thing apart from the physical universe, a separate substance, linking human beings to the mind of God. The nonhuman, on the other hand, were for Descartes nothing but complex automata, with no souls, minds, or reason.Midgley, Mary (May 24, 1999-2000). Treatment of animals as man's duty towards himself John Locke, Immanuel Kant Against Descartes, the British philosopher John Locke (1632‚Äì1704) commented, in Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693), that animals did have feelings, and that unnecessary cruelty toward them was morally wrong, but that the right not to be harmed adhered either to the animal's owner, or to the human being who was being damaged by being cruel. Discussing the importance of preventing children from tormenting animals, he wrote: \\"For the custom of tormenting and killing of beasts will, by degrees, harden their minds even towards men.\\"Locke (1693). Locke's position echoed that of Thomas Aquinas (1225‚Äì1274). Paul Waldau writes that the argument can be found at 1 Corinthians (9:9‚Äì10), when Paul asks: \\"Is it for oxen that God is concerned? Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our sake.\\" Christian philosophers interpreted this to mean that humans had no direct duty to nonhuman animals, but had a duty only to protect them from the effects of engaging in cruelty.Waldau (2001), p. 9. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724‚Äì1804), following Aquinas, opposed the idea that humans have direct duties toward nonhumans. For Kant, cruelty to animals was wrong only because it was bad for humankind. He argued in 1785 that \\"cruelty to animals is contrary to man's duty to himself, because it deadens in him the feeling of sympathy for their sufferings, and thus a natural tendency that is very useful to morality in relation to other human beings is weakened.\\"Kant (1785), part II, paras 16 and 17. 18th century: Centrality of sentience Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued for the inclusion of animals in natural law. Jean-Jacques Rousseau Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712‚Äì1778) argued in Discourse on Inequality (1754) for the inclusion of animals in natural law on the grounds of sentience: \\"By this method also we put an end to the time-honored disputes concerning the participation of animals in natural law: for it is clear that, being destitute of intelligence and liberty, they cannot recognize that law; as they partake, however, in some measure of our nature, in consequence of the sensibility with which they are endowed, they ought to partake of natural right; so that mankind is subjected to a kind of obligation even toward the brutes. It appears, in fact, that if I am bound to do no injury to my fellow-creatures, this is less because they are rational than because they are sentient beings: and this quality, being common both to men and beasts, ought to entitle the latter at least to the privilege of not being wantonly ill-treated by the former.\\"Rousseau (1754), quoted in Midgley (1984), p. 62. In his treatise on education, Emile, or On Education (1762), he encouraged parents to raise their children on a vegetarian diet. He believed that the food of the culture a child was raised eating, played an important role in the character and disposition they would develop as adults. \\"For however one tries to explain the practice, it is certain that great meat- eaters are usually more cruel and ferocious than other men. This has been recognized at all times and in all places. The English are noted for their cruelty while the Gaures are the gentlest of men. All savages are cruel, and it is not their customs that tend in this direction; their cruelty is the result of their food.\\" Jeremy Bentham Jeremy Bentham: \\"The time will come, when humanity will extend its mantle over every thing which breathes.\\"Bentham (1781), Part III. Four years later, one of the founders of modern utilitarianism, the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748‚Äì1832), although opposed to the concept of natural rights, argued that it was the ability to suffer that should be the benchmark of how we treat other beings. Bentham states that the capacity for suffering gives the right to equal consideration; equal consideration is that the interests of any being affected by an action are to be considered and have the equal interest of any other being. If rationality were the criterion, he argued, many humans, including infants and the disabled, would also have to be treated as though they were things.Benthall (2007), p. 1. He did not conclude that humans and nonhumans had equal moral significance, but argued that the latter's interests should be taken into account. He wrote in 1789, just as African slaves were being freed by the French: 19th century: Emergence of jus animalium Badger baiting, one of the rural sports campaigners sought to ban from 1800 onwards. The 19th century saw an explosion of interest in animal protection, particularly in England. Debbie Legge and Simon Brooman write that the educated classes became concerned about attitudes toward the old, the needy, children, and the insane, and that this concern was extended to nonhumans. Before the 19th century, there had been prosecutions for poor treatment of animals, but only because of the damage to the animal as property. In 1793, for example, John Cornish was found not guilty of maiming a horse after pulling the animal's tongue out; the judge ruled that Cornish could be found guilty only if there was evidence of malice toward the owner.Legge and Brooman (1997), p. 40. From 1800 onwards, there were several attempts in England to introduce animal protection legislation. The first was a bill against bull baiting, introduced in April 1800 by a Scottish MP, Sir William Pulteney (1729‚Äì1805). It was opposed inter alia on the grounds that it was anti-working class, and was defeated by two votes. Another attempt was made in 1802, this time opposed by the Secretary at War, William Windham (1750‚Äì1810), who said the Bill was supported by Methodists and Jacobins who wished to \\"destroy the Old English character, by the abolition of all rural sports.\\"Phelps (2007), pp. 96‚Äì98. *Speeches in Parliament, of the Right Honourable William Windham. Volume I. Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown (1812), pp. 303, 340‚Äì356. In 1809, Lord Erskine (1750-1823) introduced a bill to protect cattle and horses from malicious wounding, wanton cruelty, and beating. He told the House of Lords that animals had protection only as property: \\"The animals themselves are without protection--the law regards them not substantively--they have no rights!\\"Cruelty to Animals: The Speech of Lord Erskine in the House of Peers (London: Richard Phillips, 1809) p 2 Italics in original speech. Also see John Hostettler, Thomas Erskine and Trial By Jury (Hook, Hampshire: Waterside Press, 2010) pp 197-199. Erskine in his parliamentary speech combined the vocabulary of animal rights and trusteeship with a theological appeal included in the Bill's preamble to opposing cruelty.Cruelty to Animals: The Speech of Lord Erskine, see the Preamble pp 6-7, other theological allusions pp 3, 8-9, 25 & 26 The Bill was passed by the Lords, but was opposed in the Commons by Windham, who said it would be used against the \\"lower orders\\" when the real culprits would be their employers. Martin's Act The Trial of Bill Burns In 1821, the Treatment of Horses bill was introduced by Colonel Richard Martin (1754‚Äì1834), MP for Galway in Ireland, but it was lost among laughter in the House of Commons that the next thing would be rights for asses, dogs, and cats.Legge and Brooman (1997), p. 41. Nicknamed \\"Humanity Dick\\" by George IV, Martin finally succeeded in 1822 with his \\"Ill Treatment of Horses and Cattle Bill\\"‚Äîor \\"Martin's Act\\", as it became known‚Äîwhich was the world's first major piece of animal protection legislation. It was given royal assent on June 22 that year as An Act to prevent the cruel and improper Treatment of Cattle, and made it an offence, punishable by fines up to five pounds or two months imprisonment, to \\"beat, abuse, or ill-treat any horse, mare, gelding, mule, ass, ox, cow, heifer, steer, sheep or other cattle.\\" Legge and Brooman argue that the success of the Bill lay in the personality of \\"Humanity Dick\\", who was able to shrug off the ridicule from the House of Commons, and whose sense of humour managed to capture the House's attention. It was Martin himself who brought the first prosecution under the Act, when he had Bill Burns, a costermonger‚Äîa street seller of fruit‚Äîarrested for beating a donkey, and paraded the animal's injuries before a reportedly astonished court. Burns was fined, and newspapers and music halls were full of jokes about how Martin had relied on the testimony of a donkey.Phelps 2007, pp. 98‚Äì100. Other countries followed suit in passing legislation or making decisions that favoured animals. In 1822, the courts in New York ruled that wanton cruelty to animals was a misdemeanor at common law.Francione 1996, p. 7. In France in 1850, Jacques Philippe Delmas de Grammont succeeded in having the Loi Grammont passed, outlawing cruelty against domestic animals, and leading to years of arguments about whether bulls could be classed as domestic in order to ban bullfighting.McCormick, John. Bullfighting: Art, Technique and Spanish Society. Transaction Publishers, 1999, p. 211. The state of Washington followed in 1859, New York in 1866, California in 1868, and Florida in 1889.Legge and Brooman (1997), p. 50. In England, a series of amendments extended the reach of the 1822 Act, which became the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, outlawing cockfighting, baiting, and dog fighting, followed by another amendment in 1849, and again in 1876. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Richard Martin soon realized that magistrates did not take the Martin Act seriously, and that it was not being reliably enforced. Martin's Act was supported by various social reformers who were not parliamentarians and an informal network had gathered around the efforts of Reverend Arthur Broome (1779-1837) to create a voluntary organisation that would promote kindness toward animals. Broome canvassed opinions in letters that were published or summarised in various periodicals in 1821.\\"To Correspondents\\" The Kaleidoscope, 6 March 1821 p 288. Also see The Monthly Magazine Vol. 51 April 1, 1821 p 3.\\"The Brute Species\\". \\"Notice\\" in Morning Post, 17 February 1821, p 3. Similarly see \\"Cruelty to Animals\\" The Sporting Magazine, Vol. VIII New Series No. XLIII (April 1821), p 33. After the passage of Richard Martin's anti-cruelty to cattle bill in 1822, Broome attempted to form a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that would bring together the patronage of persons who were of social rank and committed to social reforms. Broome organised and chaired a meeting of sympathisers in November 1822, where it was agreed that a Society should be created and at which Broome was named its Secretary, but the attempt was short-lived.See Kathryn Shevelow, For the Love of Animals: The Rise of the Animal Protection Movement (New York: Henry Holt, 2008), 268; Arthur W. Moss, Valiant Crusade: The History of the RSPCA (London: Cassell, 1961), 22. In 1824, Broome arranged a new meeting in Old Slaughter's Coffee House in St Martin's Lane, a London caf√© frequented by artists and actors. The group met on June 16, 1824, and included a number of MPs: Richard Martin, Sir James Mackintosh (1765‚Äì1832), Sir Thomas Buxton (1786‚Äì1845), William Wilberforce (1759‚Äì1833), and Sir James Graham (1792‚Äì1861), who had been an MP, and who became one again in 1826.Anonymous (1972). \\"The History of the RSPCA\\", reproduced by the Animal Legal and Historical Center, Michigan State University College of Law. Retrieved March 25, 2008. They decided to form a \\"Society instituted for the purpose of preventing cruelty to animals\\"; the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, as it became known. It determined to send men to inspect slaughterhouses, Smithfield Market, where livestock had been sold since the 10th century, and to look into the treatment of horses by coachmen. The Society became the Royal Society in 1840, when it was granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria, herself strongly opposed to vivisection.Legge and Brooman 1997, p. 47. *\\"The Legacy of Humanity Dick\\", Time magazine, January 26, 1970. From 1824 onwards, several books were published, analyzing animal rights issues, rather than protection alone. Lewis Gompertz (1783/4‚Äì1865), one of the men who attended the first meeting of the SPCA, published Moral Inquiries on the Situation of Man and of Brutes (1824), arguing that every living creature, human and nonhuman, has more right to the use of its own body than anyone else has to use it, and that our duty to promote happiness applies equally to all beings. Edward Nicholson (1849‚Äì1912), head of the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, argued in Rights of an Animal (1879) that animals have the same natural right to life and liberty that human beings do, disregarding Descartes' mechanistic view‚Äîor what he called the \\"Neo-Cartesian snake\\"‚Äîthat they lack consciousness.Taylor (2009), p. 62. *Nicholson, Edward.Rights of an Animal (1879), chapter 6. Other writers of the time who explored whether animals might have natural (or moral) rights were Edward Payson Evans (1831‚Äì1917), John Muir (1838‚Äì1914), and J. Howard Moore (1862‚Äì1916), an American zoologist and author of The Universal Kinship (1906) and The New Ethics (1907).Nash 1989, p. 137. Arthur Schopenhauer Schopenhauer argued in 1839 that the view of cruelty as wrong only because it hardens humans was \\"revolting and abominable\\".Schopenhauer, Arthur. On the Basis of Morality. This edition Hackett Publishing, 1998, p. 96. The development in England of the concept of animal rights was strongly supported by the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788‚Äì1860). He wrote that Europeans were \\"awakening more and more to a sense that beasts have rights, in proportion as the strange notion is being gradually overcome and outgrown, that the animal kingdom came into existence solely for the benefit and pleasure of man.\\"Phelps 2007, p. 153‚Äì154. *Schopenhauer wrote in The Basis of Morality: \\"It is asserted that beasts have no rights ... that 'there are no duties to be fulfilled towards animals.' Such a view is one of revolting coarseness, a barbarism of the West, whose source is Judaism.\\" A few passages later, he called the idea that animals exist for human benefit a \\"Jewish stence.\\" See Phelps, op cit. He stopped short of advocating vegetarianism, arguing that, so long as an animal's death was quick, men would suffer more by not eating meat than animals would suffer by being eaten. Schopenhauer also theorized that the reason people succumbed to the \\"unnatural diet\\" of meat-eating was because of the unnatural, cold climate they emigrated to and the necessity of meat for survival in such a climate, for fruits and vegetables could not be dependably cultivated at those times. He applauded the animal protection movement in England‚Äî\\"To the honor, then, of the English, be it said that they are the first people who have, in downright earnest, extended the protecting arm of the law to animals.\\" He also argued against the dominant Kantian idea that animal cruelty is wrong only insofar as it brutalizes humans: Percy Bysshe Shelley The English poet and dramatist Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792‚Äì1822) wrote two essays advocating a vegetarian diet, for ethical and health reasons: A Vindication of Natural Diet (1813) and On the Vegetable System of Diet (1829, posth.). Isabella Beeton Isabella Beeton (1836-1865) the English reporter, editor and author of Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management was an early advocate against force-fed poultry and caged hens. About the former, she wrote that force-feeding, was a process that \\"may produce a handsome-looking bird, and it may weigh enough to satisfy the whim or avarice of its stuffer; but, when before the fire, it will reveal the cruel treatment to which it has been subjected, and will weep a drippingpan-ful of fat tears. You will never find heart enough to place such a grief-worn guest at the head of your table\\". About the necessity for free-range rather than caged hens, she wrote: John Stuart Mill John Stuart Mill (1806‚Äì1873), the English philosopher, also argued that utilitarianism must take animals into account, writing in 1864: \\"Nothing is more natural to human beings, nor, up to a certain point in cultivation, more universal, than to estimate the pleasures and pains of others as deserving of regard exactly in proportion to their likeness to ourselves. ... Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man; is that practice moral or immoral? And if, exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness, they do not with one voice answer 'immoral,' let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned.\\"Garner (2005), p. 12; Mill (1874) . Charles Darwin Charles Darwin wrote in 1837: \\"Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind?\\" James Rachels writes that Charles Darwin's (1809‚Äì1882) On the Origin of Species (1859)‚Äîwhich presented the theory of evolution by natural selection‚Äîrevolutionized the way humans viewed their relationship with other species. Not only did human beings have a direct kinship with other animals, but the latter had social, mental and moral lives too, Darwin argued. He wrote in his Notebooks (1837): \\"Animals ‚Äì whom we have made our slaves we do not like to consider our equals. ‚Äì Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind?\\"Darwin (1837), quoted in Redclift (2010), p. 199. Later, in The Descent of Man (1871), he argued that \\"There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties\\", attributing to animals the power of reason, decision making, memory, sympathy, and imagination.Rachels (2009), pp. 124‚Äì126; Beauchamp (2009), pp. 248‚Äì249. Rachels writes that Darwin noted the moral implications of the cognitive similarities, arguing that \\"humanity to the lower animals\\" was one of the \\"noblest virtues with which man is endowed.\\" He was strongly opposed to any kind of cruelty to animals, including setting traps. He wrote in a letter that he supported vivisection for \\"real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror ...\\" In 1875, he testified before a Royal Commission on Vivisection, lobbying for a bill to protect both the animals used in vivisection, and the study of physiology. Rachels writes that the animal rights advocates of the day, such as Frances Power Cobbe, did not see Darwin as an ally. American SPCA, Frances Power Cobbe, Anna Kingsford Frances Power Cobbe founded two of the first anti- vivisection groups. Anna Kingsford, one of the first English women to graduate in medicine, published The Perfect Way in Diet (1881), advocating vegetarianism. An early proposal for legal rights for animals came from a group of citizens in Ashtabula County, Ohio. Around 1844, the group proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution stating that if slaves from slave states were receiving representation as 3/5 of a person on the basis that they were animal property, all the animal property of the free states should receive representation also. The first animal protection group in the United States, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), was founded by Henry Bergh in April 1866. Bergh had been appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to a diplomatic post in Russia, and had been disturbed by the mistreatment of animals he witnessed there. He consulted with the president of the RSPCA in London, and returned to the United States to speak out against bullfights, cockfights, and the beating of horses. He created a \\"Declaration of the Rights of Animals\\", and in 1866 persuaded the New York state legislature to pass anti-cruelty legislation and to grant the ASPCA the authority to enforce it. In 1875, the Irish social reformer Frances Power Cobbe (1822‚Äì1904) founded the Society for the Protection of Animals Liable to Vivisection, the world's first organization opposed to animal research, which became the National Anti-Vivisection Society. In 1880, the English feminist Anna Kingsford (1846‚Äì1888) became one of the first English women to graduate in medicine, after studying for her degree in Paris, and the only student at the time to do so without having experimented on animals. She published The Perfect Way in Diet (1881), advocating vegetarianism, and in the same year founded the Food Reform Society. She was also vocal in her opposition to experimentation on animals.Rudacille (2000), pp. 31, 46. *Also see Vyvyan (1969). In 1898, Cobbe set up the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, with which she campaigned against the use of dogs in research, coming close to success with the 1919 Dogs (Protection) Bill, which almost became law. Ryder writes that, as the interest in animal protection grew in the late 1890s, attitudes toward animals among scientists began to harden. They embraced the idea that what they saw as anthropomorphism‚Äîthe attribution of human qualities to nonhumans‚Äîwas unscientific. Animals had to be approached as physiological entities only, as Ivan Pavlov wrote in 1927, \\"without any need to resort to fantastic speculations as to the existence of any possible subjective states.\\" It was a position that hearkened back to Descartes in the 17th century, that nonhumans were purely mechanical, with no rationality and perhaps even no consciousness.Ryder (2000), pp. 5‚Äì6. Friedrich Nietzsche Avoiding utilitarianism, Friedrich Nietzsche (1844‚Äì1900) found other reasons to defend animals. He wrote that \\"The sight of blind suffering is the spring of the deepest emotion.\\"Animal Rights: A Historical Anthology. By Andrew Linzey, Paul A. B. Clarke He once wrote: \\"For man is the cruelest animal. At tragedies, bull-fights, and crucifixions hath he hitherto been happiest on earth; and when he invented his hell, behold, that was his heaven on earth.\\"The Selected Writings of Friedrich Nietzsche. Wilder Publications April 21, 2008. Throughout his writings, he speaks of the human being as an animal. Henry Salt In 1894, Henry Salt (1851‚Äì1939), a former master at Eton, who had set up the Humanitarian League to lobby for a ban on hunting the year before, published Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress.Taylor (2009), p. 62. He wrote that the object of the essay was to \\"set the principle of animals' rights on a consistent and intelligible footing.\\" Concessions to the demands for jus animalium had been made grudgingly to date, he wrote, with an eye on the interests of animals qua property, rather than as rights bearers: He argued that there was no point in claiming rights for animals if those rights were subordinated to human desire, and took issue with the idea that the life of a human might have more moral worth. \\"[The] notion of the life of an animal having 'no moral purpose,' belongs to a class of ideas which cannot possibly be accepted by the advanced humanitarian thought of the present day‚Äîit is a purely arbitrary assumption, at variance with our best instincts, at variance with our best science, and absolutely fatal (if the subject be clearly thought out) to any full realization of animals' rights. If we are ever going to do justice to the lower races, we must get rid of the antiquated notion of a 'great gulf' fixed between them and mankind, and must recognize the common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood.\\" 20th century: Animal rights movement Brown Dog Affair, Lizzy Lind af Hageby Lizzy Lind af Hageby (centre, seated) in 1913. In 1902, Lizzy Lind af Hageby (1878‚Äì1963), a Swedish feminist, and a friend, Lisa Shartau, traveled to England to study medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women, intending to learn enough to become authoritative anti-vivisection campaigners. In the course of their studies, they witnessed several animal experiments, and published the details as The Shambles of Science: Extracts from the Diary of Two Students of Physiology (1903). Their allegations included that they had seen a brown terrier dog dissected while conscious, which prompted angry denials from the researcher, William Bayliss, and his colleagues. After Stephen Coleridge of the National Anti-Vivisection Society accused Bayliss of having violated the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, Bayliss sued and won, convincing a court that the animal had been anesthetized as required by the Act. In response, anti-vivisection campaigners commissioned a statue of the dog to be erected in Battersea Park in 1906, with the plaque: \\"Men and Women of England, how long shall these Things be?\\" The statue caused uproar among medical students, leading to frequent vandalism of the statue and the need for a 24-hour police guard. The affair culminated in riots in 1907 when 1,000 medical students clashed with police, suffragettes and trade unionists in Trafalgar Square. Battersea Council removed the statue from the park under cover of darkness two years later.Mason (1997). Coral Lansbury (1985) and Hilda Kean (1998) write that the significance of the affair lay in the relationships that formed in support of the \\"Brown Dog Done to Death\\", which became a symbol of the oppression the women's suffrage movement felt at the hands of the male political and medical establishment. Kean argues that both sides saw themselves as heirs to the future. The students saw the women and trade unionists as representatives of anti-science sentimentality, and the women saw themselves as progressive, with the students and their teachers belonging to a previous age.Lansbury (1985), pp. 152‚Äì169; Kean (1998), pp. 142‚Äì143. Development of veganism Members of the English Vegetarian Society who avoided the use of eggs and animal milk in the 19th and early 20th century were known as strict vegetarians. The International Vegetarian Union cites an article informing readers of alternatives to shoe leather in the Vegetarian Society's magazine in 1851 as evidence of the existence of a group that sought to avoid animal products entirely. There was increasing unease within the Society from the start of the 20th century onwards with regards to egg and milk consumption, and in 1923 its magazine wrote that the \\"ideal position for vegetarians is [complete] abstinence from animal products.\\"Salt (1880) , p. 7. Mahatma Gandhi (1869‚Äì1948) argued in 1931 before a meeting of the Society in London that vegetarianism should be pursued in the interests of animals, and not only as a human health issue. He met both Henry Salt and Anna Kingsford, and read Salt's A Plea for Vegetarianism (1880). Salt wrote in the pamphlet that \\"a Vegetarian is still regarded, in ordinary society, as little better than a madman.\\" In 1944, several members, led by Donald Watson (1910‚Äì2005), decided to break from the Vegetarian Society over the issue of egg and milk use. Watson coined the term \\"vegan\\" for those whose diet included no animal products, and they formed the British Vegan Society on November 1 that year.Leneman (1999) *Phelps (2007), pp. 163‚Äì165. *Davis, John. \\"Gandhi‚Äîand the launching of veganism\\", International Vegetarian Union, March 16, 2011. *\\"History of Vegetarianism: The Origin of Some Words\\", International Vegetarian Union, April 6, 2010. Tierschutzgesetz This cartoon appeared in Kladderadatsch, a German satirical magazine, on September 3, 1933, showing lab animals giving the Nazi salute to Hermann G√∂ring, after restrictions on animal testing were announced. On coming to power in January 1933, the Nazi Party passed a comprehensive set of animal protection laws. Arnold Arluke and Boria Sax wrote that the Nazis tried to abolish the distinction between humans and animals, to the point where many people were regarded as less valuable than animals. In April 1933 the Nazis passed laws regulating the slaughter of animals; one of their targets was kosher slaughter. In November the Tierschutzgesetz, or animal protection law, was introduced, with Adolf Hitler announcing an end to animal cruelty: \\"Im neuen Reich darf es keine Tierqu√§lerei mehr geben.\\" (\\"In the new Reich, no more animal cruelty will be allowed.\\") It was followed in July 1934 by the Reichsjagdgesetz, prohibiting hunting; in July 1935 by the Naturschutzgesetz, environmental legislation; in November 1937 by a law regulating animal transport in cars; and in September 1938 by a similar law dealing with animals on trains.Sax (2000) p. 114. Hitler was a vegetarian in the later years of his life; several members of his inner circle, including Rudolf Hess, Joseph Goebbels, and Heinrich Himmler, adopted some form of vegetarianism. By most accounts their vegetarianism was not as strict as Hitler's.Proctor (1999), pp. 135‚Äì137; Sax (2000), pp. 35, 114. Increase in animal use Despite the proliferation of animal protection legislation, animals still had no legal rights. Debbie Legge writes that existing legislation was very much tied to the idea of human interests, whether protecting human sensibilities by outlawing cruelty, or protecting property rights by making sure animals were not harmed. The over-exploitation of fishing stocks, for example, is viewed as harming the environment for people; the hunting of animals to extinction means that humans in the future will derive no enjoyment from them; poaching results in financial loss to the owner, and so on. Notwithstanding the interest in animal welfare of the previous century, the situation for animals deteriorated in the 20th century, particularly after the Second World War. This was in part because of the increase in the numbers used in animal research‚Äî300 in the UK in 1875, 19,084 in 1903, and 2.8 million in 2005 (50‚Äì100 million worldwide), and a modern annual estimated range of 10 million to upwards of 100 million in the US\\"Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Great Britain, 2005\\", Her Majesty's Stationery Office. *\\"The Ethics of research involving animals\\" , Nuffield Council on Bioethics, section 1.6. *\\"The history of the NAVS\\", National Anti-Vivisection Society. *\\"Monument to the Little Brown Dog, Battersea Park\\" , Public Monument and Sculpture Association's National Recording Project. *Singer (1990), p. 37, citing the US Congress Office of Technology Assessment's Alternatives to Animal Use in Research, Testing, and Education, 1986, p. 64.‚Äîbut mostly because of the industrialization of farming, which saw billions of animals raised and killed for food on a scale considered impossible before the war.Ten billion animals are now killed for food every year in the US alone; see Williams and DeMello (2007), p. 73. Development of direct action In the early 1960s in England, support for animal rights began to coalesce around the issue of blood sports, particularly hunting deer, foxes, and otters using dogs, an aristocratic and middle-class English practice, stoutly defended in the name of protecting rural traditions. The psychologist Richard D. Ryder ‚Äì who became involved with the animal rights movement in the late 1960s ‚Äì writes that the new chair of the League Against Cruel Sports tried in 1963 to steer it away from confronting members of the hunt, which triggered the formation that year of a direct action breakaway group, the Hunt Saboteurs Association. This was set up by a journalist, John Prestige, who had witnessed a pregnant deer being chased into a village and killed by the Devon and Somerset Staghounds. The practice of sabotaging hunts (for example, by misleading the dogs with scents or horns) spread throughout south-east England, particularly around university towns, leading to violent confrontations when the huntsmen attacked the \\"sabs\\".Ryder (2000), p. 167ff. The controversy spread to the RSPCA, which had grown away from its radical roots to become a conservative group with charity status and royal patronage. It had failed to speak out against hunting, and indeed counted huntsmen among its members. As with the League Against Cruel Sports, this position gave rise to a splinter group, the RSPCA Reform Group, which sought to radicalize the organization, leading to chaotic meetings of the group's ruling Council, and successful (though short-lived) efforts to change it from within by electing to the Council members who would argue from an animal rights perspective, and force the RSPCA to address issues such as hunting, factory farming, and animal experimentation. Ryder himself was elected to the Council in 1971, and served as its chair from 1977 to 1979. Formation of the Oxford group The same period saw writers and academics begin to speak out again in favor of animal rights. Ruth Harrison published Animal Machines (1964), an influential critique of factory farming, and on October 10, 1965, the novelist Brigid Brophy had an article, \\"The Rights of Animals\\", published in The Sunday Times. She wrote: Robert Garner writes that Harrison's book and Brophy's article led to an explosion of interest in the relationship between humans and nonhumans.Garner (2004), p. 3ff. In particular, Brophy's article was discovered in or around 1969 by a group of postgraduate philosophy students at the University of Oxford, Roslind and Stanley Godlovitch (husband and wife from Canada), John Harris, and David Wood, now known as the Oxford Group. They decided to put together a symposium to discuss the theory of animal rights. Around the same time, Richard Ryder wrote several letters to The Daily Telegraph criticizing animal experimentation, based on incidents he had witnessed in laboratories. The letters, published in April and May 1969, were seen by Brigid Brophy, who put Ryder in touch with the Godlovitches and Harris. Ryder also started distributing pamphlets in Oxford protesting against experiments on animals; it was in one of these pamphlets in 1970 that he coined the term \\"speciesism\\" to describe the exclusion of nonhuman animals from the protections offered to humans.Waldau (2001), pp. 5, 23‚Äì29. He subsequently became a contributor to the Godlovitches' symposium, as did Harrison and Brophy, and it was published in 1971 as Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non- humans.Godlovitch, Godlovitch, and Harris (1971); see the Introduction for the reference to the symposium. Publication of Animal Liberation In 1970, over lunch in Oxford with fellow student Richard Keshen, a vegetarian, Australian philosopher Peter Singer came to believe that, by eating animals, he was engaging in the oppression of other species. Keshen introduced Singer to the Godlovitches, and in 1973 Singer reviewed their book for The New York Review of Books. In the review, he used the term \\"animal liberation\\", writing: Singer pointed out that claiming animal rights in particular has nothing to do with \\"animal affection.\\" Just as claiming race or gender equality does not mean that they are \\"black lovers\\" or \\"female lovers,\\" they say, \\"there is no reason to assume that those who strive to improve animal conditions should love animals.\\" You can do it or don't have to do it because it's your taste. However, the issue of rights is not the realm of likes and dislikes, but the realm of parity. This argument spread throughout American society the discussion of animal rights, which was then only among \\"animal lovers.\\" On the strength of his review, The New York Review of Books took the unusual step of commissioning a book from Singer on the subject, published in 1975 as Animal Liberation, now one of the animal rights movement's canonical texts. Singer based his arguments on the principle of utilitarianism ‚Äì the view, in its simplest form, that an act is right if it leads to the \\"greatest happiness of the greatest number\\", a phrase first used in 1776 by Jeremy Bentham.Singer (April 5, 1973). *Singer (1990), pp. xiv‚Äìxv. *Also see \\"Food for Thought\\", letter from David Rosinger and reply from Peter Singer, The New York Review of Books, Volume 20, Number 10, June 14, 1973. He argued in favor of the equal consideration of interests, the position that there are no grounds to suppose that a violation of the basic interests of a human‚Äîfor example, an interest in not suffering‚Äîis different in any morally significant way from a violation of the basic interests of a nonhuman.Singer 1990, p. 5. Singer used the term \\"speciesism\\" in the book, citing Ryder, and it stuck, becoming an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1989.Singer (1990), p. 269, footnote 4. The book's publication triggered a groundswell of scholarly interest in animal rights. Richard Ryder's Victims of Science: The Use of Animals in Research (1975) appeared, followed by Andrew Linzey's Animal Rights: A Christian Perspective (1976), and Stephen R. L. Clark's The Moral Status of Animals (1977). A Conference on Animal Rights was organized by Ryder and Linzey at Trinity College, Cambridge, in August 1977. This was followed by Mary Midgley's Beast And Man: The Roots of Human Nature (1978), then Animal Rights‚ÄìA Symposium (1979), which included the papers delivered to the Cambridge conference. From 1982 onwards, a series of articles by Tom Regan led to his The Case for Animal Rights (1984), in which he argues that nonhuman animals are \\"subjects-of-a-life\\", and therefore possessors of moral rights, a work regarded as a key text in animal rights theory. Regan wrote in 2001 that philosophers had written more about animal rights in the previous 20 years than in the 2,000 years before that.Regan (2001), p. 67. Garner writes that Charles Magel's bibliography, Keyguide to Information Sources in Animal Rights (1989), contains 10 pages of philosophical material on animals up to 1970, but 13 pages between 1970 and 1989 alone.Garner (2004), p. 2. *Also see \\"A little respect for our friends\\", New Scientist, January 20, 1990. Founding of the Animal Liberation Front In 1971, a law student, Ronnie Lee, formed a branch of the Hunt Saboteurs Association in Luton, later calling it the Band of Mercy after a 19th-century RSPCA youth group. The Band attacked hunters' vehicles by slashing tires and breaking windows, calling it \\"active compassion\\". In November 1973, they engaged in their first act of arson when they set fire to a Hoechst Pharmaceuticals research laboratory, claiming responsibility as a \\"nonviolent guerilla organization dedicated to the liberation of animals from all forms of cruelty and persecution at the hands of mankind.\\"Molland (2004), pp. 70‚Äì74; Monaghan (2000), pp. 160‚Äì161. Lee and another activist were sentenced to three years in prison in 1974, paroled after 12 months. In 1976, Lee brought together the remaining Band of Mercy activists along with some fresh faces to start a leaderless resistance movement, calling it the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). ALF activists see themselves as a modern Underground Railroad, passing animals removed from farms and laboratories to sympathetic veterinarians, safe houses and sanctuaries.Best (2004), pp. 23‚Äì24. Some activists also engage in threats, intimidation, and arson, acts that have lost the movement sympathy in mainstream public opinion.Singer (1998), pp. 151‚Äì152. The decentralized model of activism is frustrating for law enforcement organizations, who find the networks difficult to infiltrate, because they tend to be organized around friends.Ben Gunn, former Chief Constable, Cambridge Constabulary, interviewed for \\"It Could Happen to You,\\" True Spies, BBC Two, November 10, 2002. In 2005, the US Department of Homeland Security indicated how seriously it takes the ALF when it included them in a list of domestic terrorist threats.Rood, Justin. \\"Animal Rights Groups and Ecology Militants Make DHS Terrorist List, Right-Wing Vigilantes Omitted\\", Congressional Quarterly, March 25, 2005. The tactics of some of the more determined ALF activists are anathema to many animal rights advocates, such as Singer, who regard the movement as something that should occupy the moral high ground. ALF activists respond to the criticism with the argument that, as Ingrid Newkirk puts it, \\"Thinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out.\\"Newkirk (2004), p. 341./ From the 1980s through to the early 2000s there was an increased level of violence by animal rights extremist groups directed at individuals and institutions associated with animal research. Activist groups involved included the Justice Department, the Animal Rights Militia and SHAC.Holder, T. (2014) - \\"Standing Up for Science\\", EMBO Reports, Volume 15, Issue 6, pages 625‚Äì630, June 2014 Subcultures and animal rights In the 1980s, animal rights became associated with punk subculture and ideologies, particularly straight edge hardcore punk in the United States and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom. This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe. Animal Rights International Henry Spira (1927‚Äì1998), a former seaman and civil rights activist, became the most notable of the new animal advocates in the United States. A proponent of gradual change, he formed Animal Rights International in 1974, and introduced the idea of \\"reintegrative shaming\\", whereby a relationship is formed between a group of animal rights advocates and a corporation they see as misusing animals, with a view to obtaining concessions or halting a practice. It is a strategy that has been widely adopted, including the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.Francione and Garner (2010), p. 1ff. Spira's first campaign was in opposition to the American Museum of Natural History in 1976, where cats were being experimented on, research that he persuaded them to stop. In 1980 he convinced the cosmetics company Revlon to stop using the Draize test, which involves toxicity tests on the skin or in the eyes of animals. He took out a full-page ad in several newspapers, featuring a rabbit with sticking plaster over the eyes, and the caption, \\"How many rabbits does Revlon blind for beauty's sake?\\" Revlon stopped using animals for cosmetics testing, donated money to help set up the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing, and was followed by other leading cosmetics companies.Feder, Barnaby J. (November 26, 1889). \\"Pressuring Perdue\\", The New York Times. *Also see Singer (1998), and Singer (2003). 21st century: developments In 1999, New Zealand passed a new Animal Welfare Act that had the effect of banning experiments on \\"non- human hominids\\". Also in 1999, Public Law 106-152 (Title 18, Section 48) was put into action in the United States. This law makes it a felony to create, sell, or possess videos showing animal cruelty with the intention of profiting financially from them. In 2005, the Austrian Parliament banned experiments on apes, unless they are performed in the interests of the individual ape. Also in Austria, the Supreme Court ruled in January 2008 that a chimpanzee (called Matthew Hiasl Pan by those advocating for his personhood) was not a person, after the Association Against Animal Factories sought personhood status for him because his custodians had gone bankrupt. The chimpanzee had been captured as a baby in Sierra Leone in 1982, then smuggled to Austria to be used in pharmaceutical experiments, but was discovered by customs officials when he arrived in the country, and was taken to a shelter instead. He was kept there for 25 years, until the group that ran the shelter went bankrupt in 2007. Donors offered to help him, but under Austrian law only a person can receive personal gifts, so any money sent to support him would be lost to the shelter's bankruptcy. The Association appealed the ruling to the European Court of Human Rights. The lawyer proposing the chimpanzee's personhood asked the court to appoint a legal guardian for him and to grant him four rights: the right to life, limited freedom of movement, personal safety, and the right to claim property. In June 2008, a committee of Spain's national legislature became the first to vote for a resolution to extend limited rights to nonhuman primates. The parliamentary Environment Committee recommended giving chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans the right not to be used in medical experiments or in circuses, and recommended making it illegal to kill apes, except in self-defense, based upon the rights recommended by the Great Ape Project. The committee's proposal has not yet been enacted into law. From 2009 onwards, several countries outlawed the use of some or all animals in circuses, starting with Bolivia, and followed by several countries in Europe, Scandinavia, the Middle East, and Singapore. In 2010, the regional government in Catalonia passed a motion to outlaw bull fighting, the first such ban in Spain. In 2011, PETA sued SeaWorld over the captivity of five orcas in San Diego and Orlando, arguing that the whales were being treated as slaves. It was the first time the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude, was cited in court to protect nonhuman rights. A federal judge dismissed the case in February 2012.  Petitions for habeas corpus  In 2015, the Nonhuman Rights Project (NhPR) filed three lawsuits in New York State on behalf of four captive chimpanzees, demanding that the courts grant them the right to bodily liberty via the writ of habeas corpus and immediately send them to a sanctuary affiliated with the North American Primate Sanctuary Alliance. All of the petitions were denied. In the case involving the chimpanzees Hercules and Leo, Justice Barbara Jaffe did not immediately dismiss the filing and instead ordered a hearing requiring the chimpanzee owner to show why the chimpanzees should not be released and transferred to the sanctuary. Following the hearing, Justice Jaffe issued an order denying Hercules and Leo's petition. Even though the petition was denied, the NhRP interpreted Justice Jaffe's decision as a victory. In its press release it emphasized the fact that Justice Jaffe agreed with NhRP, writing that \\"'persons' are not restricted to human beings, and that who is a 'person' is not a question of biology, but of public policy and principle\\" and also stating that \\"efforts to extend legal rights to chimpanzees are thus understandable; some day they may even succeed.\\" In East and South Asia Emperor Tenmu began bans on killing and eating meat in 675 in Japan. The temple town of Palitana, India is the world's first vegetarian-only city. The belief in and promotion of animal rights has had a long history in East and South Asia. It has its roots in traditional Eastern religious and philosophical beliefs and concepts such as ahimsa, the doctrine of non- violence. The earliest reference to the idea of non-violence to animals (pashu-ahimsa), apparently in a moral sense, is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda (KapS 31.11), written about the 8th century BCE. Ancient era Several kings in India built hospitals for animals, and the emperor Ashoka (304‚Äì232 BCE) issued orders against hunting and animal slaughter, in line with ahimsa, the doctrine of non-violence.Garner (2005), pp. 21‚Äì22. In Japan in 675, the Emperor Tenmu prohibited the killing and the eating of meat during the busy farming period between April and September but excluded the eating of wild birds and animals. This ban and several others that followed over the centuries were overturned in the nineteenth century during the Meiji restoration. Modern era In 2000, the High Court in Kerala, India used the language of \\"rights\\" in relation to circus animals, ruling that they are \\"beings entitled to dignified existence\\" under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The ruling said that if human beings are entitled to these rights, animals should be too. The court went beyond the requirements of the Constitution that all living beings should be shown compassion, and said: \\"It is not only our fundamental duty to show compassion to our animal friends, but also to recognize and protect their rights.\\" Waldau wrote that other courts in India and one court in Sri Lanka have used similar language.Waldau (2011), p. 108. In 2012, the Indian government issued a ban on the use of live animals in education and much research. In 2014, the Jain pilgrimage destination of Palitana City in India became the first city in the world to be legally vegetarian. It has outlawed, or made illegal, the buying and selling of meat, fish and eggs, and also related jobs or work, such as fishing and penning 'food animals'. In religion For some the basis of animal rights is in religion or animal worship (or in general nature worship), with some religions banning killing of any animal, and in other religions animals can be considered unclean. Hindu and Buddhist societies abandoned animal sacrifice and embraced vegetarianism from the 3rd century BCE. Garner (2005), pp. 21‚Äì22. One of the most important sanctions of the Jain, Hindu and Buddhist faiths is the concept of ahimsa, or refraining from the destruction of life. According to Buddhist belief, humans do not deserve preferential treatment over other living beings. The Dharmic interpretation of this doctrine prohibits the killing of any living being. In Islam, animal rights were recognized early by the Sharia. This recognition is based on both the Qur'an and the Hadith. In the Qur'an, there are many references to animals, detailing that they have souls, form communities, communicate with God and worship Him in their own way. Muhammad forbade his followers to harm any animal and asked them to respect the rights of animals. Philosophical and legal approaches Overview Martha Nussbaum, Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago, is a proponent of the capabilities approach to animal rights. The two main philosophical approaches to animal rights are utilitarian and rights-based. The former is exemplified by Peter Singer, and the latter by Tom Regan and Gary Francione. Their differences reflect a distinction philosophers draw between ethical theories that judge the rightness of an act by its consequences (consequentialism/teleological ethics, or utilitarianism), and those that focus on the principle behind the act, almost regardless of consequences (deontological ethics). Deontologists argue that there are acts we should never perform, even if failing to do so entails a worse outcome.Craig (1988). There are a number of positions that can be defended from a consequentalist or deontologist perspective, including the capabilities approach, represented by Martha Nussbaum, and the egalitarian approach, which has been examined by Ingmar Persson and Peter Vallentyne. The capabilities approach focuses on what individuals require to fulfill their capabilities: Nussbaum (2006) argues that animals need a right to life, some control over their environment, company, play, and physical health.Nussbaum (2006), pp. 388ff, 393ff; also see Nussbaum (2004), p. 299ff. Stephen R. L. Clark, Mary Midgley, and Bernard Rollin also discuss animal rights in terms of animals being permitted to lead a life appropriate for their kind.Weir (2009): see Clark (1977); Rollin (1981); Midgley (1984). Egalitarianism favors an equal distribution of happiness among all individuals, which makes the interests of the worse off more important than those of the better off.Vallentyne (2005); Vallentyne (2007). Another approach, virtue ethics, holds that in considering how to act we should consider the character of the actor, and what kind of moral agents we should be. Rosalind Hursthouse has suggested an approach to animal rights based on virtue ethics.Rowlands (2009), p. 98ff; Hursthouse (2000a); Hursthouse (2000b), p. 146ff. Mark Rowlands has proposed a contractarian approach. Utilitarianism Nussbaum (2004) writes that utilitarianism, starting with Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, has contributed more to the recognition of the moral status of animals than any other ethical theory.Nussbaum (2004), p. 302. The utilitarian philosopher most associated with animal rights is Peter Singer, professor of bioethics at Princeton University. Singer is not a rights theorist, but uses the language of rights to discuss how we ought to treat individuals. He is a preference utilitarian, meaning that he judges the rightness of an act by the extent to which it satisfies the preferences (interests) of those affected.For a discussion of preference utilitarianism, see Singer (2011), pp. 14ff, 94ff. His position is that there is no reason not to give equal consideration to the interests of human and nonhumans, though his principle of equality does not require identical treatment. A mouse and a man both have an interest in not being kicked, and there are no moral or logical grounds for failing to accord those interests equal weight. Interests are predicated on the ability to suffer, nothing more, and once it is established that a being has interests, those interests must be given equal consideration.Singer (1990), pp. 7‚Äì8. Singer quotes the English philosopher Henry Sidgwick (1838‚Äì1900): \\"The good of any one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view ... of the Universe, than the good of any other.\\" Peter Singer: interests are predicated on the ability to suffer. Singer argues that equality of consideration is a prescription, not an assertion of fact: if the equality of the sexes were based only on the idea that men and women were equally intelligent, we would have to abandon the practice of equal consideration if this were later found to be false. But the moral idea of equality does not depend on matters of fact such as intelligence, physical strength, or moral capacity. Equality therefore cannot be grounded on the outcome of scientific investigations into the intelligence of nonhumans. All that matters is whether they can suffer.Singer (1990), p. 4. Commentators on all sides of the debate now accept that animals suffer and feel pain, although it was not always so. Bernard Rollin, professor of philosophy, animal sciences, and biomedical sciences at Colorado State University, writes that Descartes' influence continued to be felt until the 1980s. Veterinarians trained in the US before 1989 were taught to ignore pain, he writes, and at least one major veterinary hospital in the 1960s did not stock narcotic analgesics for animal pain control. In his interactions with scientists, he was often asked to \\"prove\\" that animals are conscious, and to provide \\"scientifically acceptable\\" evidence that they could feel pain.Rollin (1989), pp. xii, pp. 117‚Äì118; Rollin (2007). Scientific publications have made it clear since the 1980s that the majority of researchers do believe animals suffer and feel pain, though it continues to be argued that their suffering may be reduced by an inability to experience the same dread of anticipation as humans, or to remember the suffering as vividly.Singer (1990), pp. 10‚Äì17, citing Stamp Dawkins (1980), Walker (1983), and Griffin (1984); Garner (2005), pp. 13‚Äì14. The problem of animal suffering, and animal consciousness in general, arose primarily because it was argued that animals have no language. Singer writes that, if language were needed to communicate pain, it would often be impossible to know when humans are in pain, though we can observe pain behavior and make a calculated guess based on it. He argues that there is no reason to suppose that the pain behavior of nonhumans would have a different meaning from the pain behavior of humans.Singer (1990) p. 12ff. Subjects-of-a-life Tom Regan: animals are subjects-of-a-life. Tom Regan, professor emeritus of philosophy at North Carolina State University, argues in The Case for Animal Rights (1983) that nonhuman animals are what he calls \\"subjects-of-a-life\\", and as such are bearers of rights.Regan (1983), p. 243. He writes that, because the moral rights of humans are based on their possession of certain cognitive abilities, and because these abilities are also possessed by at least some nonhuman animals, such animals must have the same moral rights as humans. Although only humans act as moral agents, both marginal-case humans, such as infants, and at least some nonhumans must have the status of \\"moral patients\\". Moral patients are unable to formulate moral principles, and as such are unable to do right or wrong, even though what they do may be beneficial or harmful. Only moral agents are able to engage in moral action. Animals for Regan have \\"intrinsic value\\" as subjects-of-a-life, and cannot be regarded as a means to an end, a view that places him firmly in the abolitionist camp. His theory does not extend to all animals, but only to those that can be regarded as subjects-of-a-life. He argues that all normal mammals of at least one year of age would qualify: Whereas Singer is primarily concerned with improving the treatment of animals and accepts that, in some hypothetical scenarios, individual animals might be used legitimately to further human or nonhuman ends, Regan believes we ought to treat nonhuman animals as we would humans. He applies the strict Kantian ideal (which Kant himself applied only to humans) that they ought never to be sacrificed as a means to an end, and must be treated as ends in themselves.Regan (1983). Abolitionism Gary Francione: animals need only the right not to be regarded as property. Gary Francione, professor of law and philosophy at Rutgers Law School in Newark, is a leading abolitionist writer, arguing that animals need only one right, the right not to be owned. Everything else would follow from that paradigm shift. He writes that, although most people would condemn the mistreatment of animals, and in many countries there are laws that seem to reflect those concerns, \\"in practice the legal system allows any use of animals, however abhorrent.\\" The law only requires that any suffering not be \\"unnecessary\\". In deciding what counts as \\"unnecessary\\", an animal's interests are weighed against the interests of human beings, and the latter almost always prevail.Francione (1990), pp. 4, 17ff. Francione's Animals, Property, and the Law (1995) was the first extensive jurisprudential treatment of animal rights. In it, Francione compares the situation of animals to the treatment of slaves in the United States, where legislation existed that appeared to protect them while the courts ignored that the institution of slavery itself rendered the protection unenforceable.Francione (1995), pp. 4‚Äì5. He offers as an example the United States Animal Welfare Act, which he describes as an example of symbolic legislation, intended to assuage public concern about the treatment of animals, but difficult to implement.Francione (1995), p. 208ff. He argues that a focus on animal welfare, rather than animal rights, may worsen the position of animals by making the public feel comfortable about using them and entrenching the view of them as property. He calls animal rights groups who pursue animal welfare issues, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the \\"new welfarists\\", arguing that they have more in common with 19th-century animal protectionists than with the animal rights movement; indeed, the terms \\"animal protection\\" and \\"protectionism\\" are increasingly favored. His position in 1996 was that there is no animal rights movement in the United States.Francione (1996), p. 32ff *Francione and Garner (2010), pp. 1ff, 175ff. *Hall, Lee. \\"An Interview with Professor Gary L. Francione\\" , Friends of Animals. Retrieved February 3, 2011. Contractarianism Mark Rowlands, professor of philosophy at the University of Florida, has proposed a contractarian approach, based on the original position and the veil of ignorance‚Äîa \\"state of nature\\" thought experiment that tests intuitions about justice and fairness‚Äîin John Rawls's A Theory of Justice (1971). In the original position, individuals choose principles of justice (what kind of society to form, and how primary social goods will be distributed), unaware of their individual characteristics‚Äîtheir race, sex, class, or intelligence, whether they are able-bodied or disabled, rich or poor‚Äîand therefore unaware of which role they will assume in the society they are about to form.Rowlands (1998), p. 118ff, particularly pp. 147‚Äì152. The idea is that, operating behind the veil of ignorance, they will choose a social contract in which there is basic fairness and justice for them no matter the position they occupy. Rawls did not include species membership as one of the attributes hidden from the decision makers in the original position. Rowlands proposes extending the veil of ignorance to include rationality, which he argues is an undeserved property similar to characteristics including race, sex and intelligence. Prima facie rights theory American philosopher Timothy Garry has proposed an approach that deems nonhuman animals worthy of prima facie rights. In a philosophical context, a prima facie (Latin for \\"on the face of it\\" or \\"at first glance\\") right is one that appears to be applicable at first glance, but upon closer examination may be outweighed by other considerations. In his book Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory, Lawrence Hinman characterizes such rights as \\"the right is real but leaves open the question of whether it is applicable and overriding in a particular situation\\".Hinman, Lawrence M. Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory. Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace College, 1998. Print. The idea that nonhuman animals are worthy of prima facie rights is to say that, in a sense, animals have rights that can be overridden by many other considerations, especially those conflicting a human's right to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. Garry supports his view arguing: In sum, Garry suggests that humans have obligations to nonhuman animals; animals do not, and ought not to, have uninfringible rights against humans. Feminism and animal rights ecofeminist Carol Adams has written extensively about the link between feminism and animal rights, starting with The Sexual Politics of Meat (1990). Women have played a central role in animal advocacy since the 19th century.Lansbury (1985); Adams (1990); Donovan (1993); Gruen (1993); Adams (1994); Adams and Donovan (1995); Adams (2004); MacKinnon (2004). The anti-vivisection movement in the 19th and early 20th century in England and the United States was largely run by women, including Frances Power Cobbe, Anna Kingsford, Lizzy Lind af Hageby and Caroline Earle White (1833‚Äì1916).Kean (1995). Garner writes that 70 per cent of the membership of the Victoria Street Society (one of the anti-vivisection groups founded by Cobbe) were women, as were 70 per cent of the membership of the British RSPCA in 1900.Garner (2005), p. 141, citing Elston (1990), p. 276. The modern animal advocacy movement has a similar representation of women. They are not invariably in leadership positions: during the March for Animals in Washington, D.C., in 1990‚Äîthe largest animal rights demonstration held until then in the United States‚Äîmost of the participants were women, but most of the platform speakers were men.Garner (2005), pp. 142‚Äì143. Nevertheless, several influential animal advocacy groups have been founded by women, including the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection by Cobbe in London in 1898; the Animal Welfare Board of India by Rukmini Devi Arundale in 1962; and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, co-founded by Ingrid Newkirk in 1980. In the Netherlands, Marianne Thieme and Esther Ouwehand were elected to parliament in 2006 representing the Parliamentary group for Animals. The preponderance of women in the movement has led to a body of academic literature exploring feminism and animal rights; feminism and vegetarianism or veganism, the oppression of women and animals, and the male association of women and animals with nature and emotion, rather than reason‚Äîan association that several feminist writers have embraced. Lori Gruen writes that women and animals serve the same symbolic function in a patriarchal society: both are \\"the used\\"; the dominated, submissive \\"Other\\".Gruen (1993), p. 60ff. When the British feminist Mary Wollstonecraft (1759‚Äì1797) published A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), Thomas Taylor (1758‚Äì1835), a Cambridge philosopher, responded with an anonymous parody, A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes (1792), saying that Wollstonecraft's arguments for women's rights could be applied equally to animals, a position he intended as reductio ad absurdum.Singer (1990), p. 1. Transhumanism Some transhumanists argue for animal rights, liberation, and \\"uplift\\" of animal consciousness into machines. Transhumanism also understands animal rights on a gradation or spectrum with other types of sentient rights, including human rights and the rights of conscious artificial intelligences (posthuman rights). Critics R. G. Frey R. G. Frey, professor of philosophy at Bowling Green State University, is a preference utilitarian, as is Singer. But, in his early work, Interests and Rights (1980), Frey disagreed with Singer ‚Äì who in his Animal Liberation (1975) wrote that the interests of nonhuman animals must be included when judging the consequences of an act ‚Äì on the grounds that animals have no interests. Frey argues that interests are dependent on desire, and that no desire can exist without a corresponding belief. Animals have no beliefs, because a belief state requires the ability to hold a second-order belief‚Äîa belief about the belief‚Äîwhich he argues requires language: \\"If someone were to say, e.g. 'The cat believes that the door is locked,' then that person is holding, as I see it, that the cat holds the declarative sentence 'The door is locked' to be true; and I can see no reason whatever for crediting the cat or any other creature which lacks language, including human infants, with entertaining declarative sentences.\\"Frey (1989), p. 40. Carl Cohen Carl Cohen, professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan, argues that rights holders must be able to distinguish between their own interests and what is right. \\"The holders of rights must have the capacity to comprehend rules of duty governing all, including themselves. In applying such rules, [they] ... must recognize possible conflicts between what is in their own interest and what is just. Only in a community of beings capable of self-restricting moral judgments can the concept of a right be correctly invoked.\\" Cohen rejects Singer's argument that, since a brain-damaged human could not make moral judgments, moral judgments cannot be used as the distinguishing characteristic for determining who is awarded rights. Cohen writes that the test for moral judgment \\"is not a test to be administered to humans one by one\\", but should be applied to the capacity of members of the species in general.pg. 94-100. Cohen and Regan (2001). Richard Posner Judge Richard Posner: \\"facts will drive equality.\\" Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit debated the issue of animal rights in 2001 with Peter Singer.Singer (June 15, 2001). Posner posits that his moral intuition tells him \\"that human beings prefer their own. If a dog threatens a human infant, even if it requires causing more pain to the dog to stop it, than the dog would have caused to the infant, then we favour the child. It would be monstrous to spare the dog.\\"Posner (June 15, 2001); Posner-Singer debate in full, courtesy link on utilitarian.net. *Also see Posner (2004). Singer challenges this by arguing that formerly unequal rights for gays, women, and certain races were justified using the same set of intuitions. Posner replies that equality in civil rights did not occur because of ethical arguments, but because facts mounted that there were no morally significant differences between humans based on race, sex, or sexual orientation that would support inequality. If and when similar facts emerge about humans and animals, the differences in rights will erode too. But facts will drive equality, not ethical arguments that run contrary to instinct, he argues. Posner calls his approach \\"soft utilitarianism\\", in contrast to Singer's \\"hard utilitarianism\\". He argues: Roger Scruton: rights imply obligations. Roger Scruton Roger Scruton, the British philosopher, argues that rights imply obligations. Every legal privilege, he writes, imposes a burden on the one who does not possess that privilege: that is, \\"your right may be my duty.\\" Scruton therefore regards the emergence of the animal rights movement as \\"the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview\\", because the idea of rights and responsibilities is, he argues, distinctive to the human condition, and it makes no sense to spread them beyond our own species. He accuses animal rights advocates of \\"pre-scientific\\" anthropomorphism, attributing traits to animals that are, he says, Beatrix Potter-like, where \\"only man is vile.\\" It is within this fiction that the appeal of animal rights lies, he argues. The world of animals is non-judgmental, filled with dogs who return our affection almost no matter what we do to them, and cats who pretend to be affectionate when, in fact, they care only about themselves. It is, he argues, a fantasy, a world of escape. Scruton singled out Peter Singer, a prominent Australian philosopher and animal-rights activist, for criticism. He wrote that Singer's works, including Animal Liberation, \\"contain little or no philosophical argument. They derive their radical moral conclusions from a vacuous utilitarianism that counts the pain and pleasure of all living things as equally significant and that ignores just about everything that has been said in our philosophical tradition about the real distinction between persons and animals.\\" Tom Regan countered this view of rights by distinguishing moral agents and moral patients.Tom Regan: The Case For Animal Rights. The VegetarianSite. Accessed November 2, 2019 Continuity between humans and nonhuman animals A bonobo, a great ape Evolutionary studies have provided explanations of altruistic behaviours in humans and nonhuman animals, and suggest similarities between humans and some nonhumans.Lawrence (2004) Animal Acts: Configuring the Human in Western History. Journal of Popular Culture, 37(3), 555 Scientists such as Jane Goodall and Richard Dawkins believe in the capacity of nonhuman great apes, humans' closest relatives, to possess rationality and self-awareness.The Great Ape Project: Equality beyond humanity. 1993. Fourth Estate publishing, London, England. In 2010, research was presented to a conference in San Diego, suggesting that dolphins are second in intelligence only to human beings, and concluded that they should be regarded as nonhuman persons. MRI scans were used to compare the dolphin and primate brain; the scans indicated there was \\"psychological continuity\\" between dolphins and humans. The research suggested that dolphins are able to solve complex problems, use tools, and pass the mirror test, using a mirror to inspect parts of their bodies.Leake, Jonathan (January 3, 2010). \\"Scientists say dolphins should be treated as 'non-human persons'\\", The Sunday Times. Studies have established links between interpersonal violence and animal cruelty.Frank R. Ascione, Phil Arkow Child abuse, domestic violence, and animal abuse: linking the circles of compassion for prevention and intervention Randall Lockwood, Frank R. Ascione. Cruelty to Animals and Interpersonal Violence. Purdue University Press 1998 In Christian theology, the founder of the Methodist movement, John Wesley, was a Christian vegetarian and maintained \\"that animals had immortal souls and that there were considerable similarities between human and non-human animals.\\" Public attitudes According to a paper published in 2000 by Harold Herzog and Lorna Dorr, previous academic surveys of attitudes towards animal rights have tended to suffer from small sample sizes and non-representative groups. However, a number of factors appear to correlate with the attitude of individuals regarding the treatment of animals and animal rights. These include gender, age, occupation, religion, and level of education. There has also been evidence to suggest that prior experience with companion animals may be a factor in people's attitudes. Women are more likely to empathize with the cause of animal rights than men. A 1996 study suggested that factors that may partially explain this discrepancy include attitudes towards feminism and science, scientific literacy, and the presence of a greater emphasis on \\"nurturance or compassion\\" among women. A common misconception on the concept of animal rights is that its proponents want to grant non-human animals the exact same legal rights as humans, such as the right to vote. This is not the case, as the concept is that animals should have rights with equal consideration to their interests (for example, cats do not have any interest in voting, so they should not have the right to vote.) A 2016 study found that support for animal testing may not be based on cogent philosophical rationales, and more open debate is warranted. A 2007 survey to examine whether or not people who believed in evolution were more likely to support animal rights than creationists and believers in intelligent design found that this was largely the case ‚Äì according to the researchers, the respondents who were strong Christian fundamentalists and believers in creationism were less likely to advocate for animal rights than those who were less fundamentalist in their beliefs. The findings extended previous research, such as a 1992 study which found that 48% of animal rights activists were atheists or agnostic. A 2019 study in The Washington Post found that those who have positive attitudes toward animal rights also tend to have a positive view of universal healthcare, favor reducing discrimination against African Americans, the LGBT community and undocumented immigrants, and expanding welfare to aid the poor. Two surveys found that attitudes towards animal rights tactics, such as direct action, are very diverse within the animal rights communities. Near half (50% and 39% in two surveys) of activists do not support direct action. One survey concluded \\"it would be a mistake to portray animal rights activists as homogeneous.\\" See also Animal cognition *Animal consciousness *Animal liberation *Animal liberation movement *Animal liberationist *Animal rights by country or territory *Animal studies *Animal trial *Animal Welfare Institute *Antinaturalism (politics) *Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness *Chick culling *Critical animal studies *Deep ecology *Do Animals Have Rights?

However, the style of music was developed throughout South America with different names given to it before the name \\"Tecnocumbia\\" was adopted as the single denomination for the music. In Mexico, it developed as a variant of the Mexican cumbia that started in the early 1980s. The style added electronic instruments along with samplers to the Mexican cumbia music. One of the first musical groups with electrical 1980s sounds was Super Show de los Vazkez from Veracruz, M√©xico, formed in 1981, also, other important exponents were Los Temerarios, Los Bukis, Fito Olivares, among others. These groups created several hits with electrical sounds, their fame continues to the end of the 1980s.Mexican Cumbia's section, Website of Cuarteto Continental In the early 1990s, Selena the \\"Tex-mex queen,\\" had great musical hits in U.S. and Mexico, her main hits of the tecnocumbia style was \\"Como la flor\\" (Like a flower), \\"Carcacha\\" (the old car), and, for first time, this genre was called like \\"Technocumbia\\" by her, with the musical hit of same name, \\"Technocumbia\\". In South America, where the Colombian Cumbia most easily expanded in popularity, different \\"modern\\" styles of the original Colombian rhythm were started mainly in the countries of Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. The Peruvian cumbia, developed in the early 1960s, used electric guitars and synthesisers along with the other classical instruments of the Colombian cumbia in order to create a kind of tropical sound. Variations within the Peruvian cumbia added more tropical rhythms along with a more Andean flavor, which eventually resulted in the creation of the Andean cumbia (Commonly called \\"Chicha music\\" in Peru). Using the Andean cumbia as a base, in the middle of the 1990s the Tecnocumbia sprung up in Peru and since then has gone through many changes in Peru and Bolivia. Rossy War was the most important singer of the Peruvian tecnocumbia, she recorded several hits for Peru and Mexico, but her fame was bigger in the U.S.A's Latin community. Finally in the north of Argentina the most recent exponents are the group Kasualidad and Lagrimas. In Ecuador, this style of music began in 1992 with Grupo Coctelhttp://www.elcomercio.com/entretenimiento/grupo-Coctel-vuelve- escenarios- sensual_0_606539379.htmlhttp://www.kandelayson.com/xjet/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=13&Itemid;=48&Itemid;=48 and; later, in 1999 with Sharon la Hechicera and Widinson. They are considered the beginners of this music in Ecuador. After them male and female groups appeared like Tierra Canela, Magia Latina, Las Chicas Dulces, Deseo, Kandela y Son, Yerba Buena, Milenium, Batahola and others singers like Jazmin, Jaime Enrique Aymara, Hipatia Balseca, Sanyi, Mayra Alvarado, Milena, Enrique Augusto, Manolo and Silvana. Nowadays the most important singers of tecnocumbia are Maria de los Angeles, Gerardo Mor√°n, Patty Ray, Omayra, Veronica Bola√±os, Katty Egas and Delfin Quishpe. In Chile, a similar style is known as Sound or M√∫sica Tropical. The Mexican and South American tecnocumbias have similar styles and rhythms, due to them both having the Colombia cumbia as a base, but they developed through different methods independently of each other and do not sound exactly alike.

The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and airs a talk radio format. WBHP programming is simulcast on AM 800 WHOS in nearby Decatur, FM translator at 102.5 FM and on 102.1 WDRM- HD2 (HD Radio). Its studios are located in Madison, Alabama and its transmitter is located southwest of downtown Huntsville. Programming WBHP and WHOS have a local morning drive news and talk show hosted by Toni Lowery and Gary Dobbs. The rest of the weekday schedule is made up of nationally syndicated talk shows, mostly from co-owned Premiere Networks: Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Michael Berry, Clyde Lewis and Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. Independently syndicated Dave Ramsey is heard middays, instead of Rush Limbaugh. Even though Limbaugh is syndicated by Premiere, his show airs on talk radio rival 770 WVNN and 92.5 WVNN-FM, owned by Cumulus Media. Weekends feature shows on money, real estate, cars, travel and home repair. Weekend syndicated hosts include Rudy Maxa, Joe Pags, Gary Sullivan and Bill Cunningham. Most hours begin with world and national news from Fox News Radio. In addition to its regularly scheduled talk programming, the station is an affiliate of the Auburn Tigers football radio network and the Auburn Tigers men's basketball radio network. History The station went on the air as WBHS on April 22, 1931, as the first radio station in Huntsville. It was a service of The Hutchens Company, a hardware firm. The call sign stood for \\"World's Best Hardware Store.\\" The studios were in the Russel Erskine Hotel downtown. WBHS later moved to a building on Governor‚Äôs Drive. During the Great Depression the station ran into financial problems and went off the air in 1933. The FCC reassigned the frequency and the new station returned to the air on May 23, 1937 as WBHP.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-5 WBHP had been through several owners until its acquisition by iHeartMedia, Inc. (formally Clear Channel Communications), its current licensee. The current call letters stem from longtime previous owner Wilton \\"Buster\\" Harvey Pollard. From its early days until the November 1997 switch to an all-news format, WBHP broadcast country music. In the 1960s the country music station changed its format for one hour each Sunday afternoon to air classical music. The program was called ‚ÄúThe German Hour‚Äù and catered to Wernher von Braun‚Äôs German rocket scientists and their families. More than 1500 German scientists, engineers and technicians were brought to Huntsville to work on developing rockets as part of Operation Paperclip. In 2018, WBHP launched an FM translator on 102.5 to simulcast the station. Former programming WBHP and sister station WHOS were the flagship stations for the 1999-2000 final season of the Huntsville Channel Cats and for the short-lived Huntsville Tornado for the 2000-2001 hockey season. Both teams played their home games at the Von Braun Center and competed in the Central Hockey League. Awards and honors As a country music formatted station, WBHP on-air personality Dana Webb was nominated for and won a Country Music Association Award as \\"Small Market Broadcast Personality of the Year\\" in 1986.

Dover Corporation was incorporated in 1947, and in 1955, Ohrstrom brought in the former owner and president of C. Lee Cook Company, Fred D. Durham, to manage his four companies. Later that same year, the Dover Corporate offices opened in Washington, D.C., and Dover Corporation went public on the New York Stock Exchange. As such, the year 1955 marks the company's official founding. Fred Durham influenced Dover's corporate culture, emphasizing autonomy, decentralization, and few corporate staff members. As a result, divisions were run in an independent fashion, each with its own president. Today, Dover is still known for its decentralized management structure, in its governance of operating companies, and for its acquisitive approach. Between 1955 and 1979, Dover acquired fourteen companies. A great deal of this acquisition activity served to build the Dover Elevator business. This elevator growth began in 1955, as Dover Elevator split from Rotary Lift and became an independent operating company within Dover. Dover's purchase of the Shepard Warner Elevator Company in 1958 marked the beginning of an effort to grow the elevator business. In 1963, Dover acquired Acme Elevator, and then Elevator Service, Reddy Elevator Company in 1964, and Hunter-Hayes Elevator Company in 1970. With these purchases, Dover soon became the third largest elevator company in the U.S. and remained so for many years. Dover continued to expand its elevator division throughout the 1960s and 1970s with the purchases of Moody & Rowe, Burch, Turnbull, Burlington, Hammond & Champness, Louisiana Elevator, and W.W. Moore. Ultimately, Dover sold its elevator business in 1999 to Thyssen AG for $1.1 billion. Dover Elevator had a pretax operating profit of $93 million in 1997 and the sale was mutually beneficial: it allowed Dover to focus on building its other businesses and moved ThyssenKrupp Elevator Americas to the number three spot worldwide in the elevator and escalator industry. Acquisitions Dover's acquisition history reaches beyond the elevator industry. With a focus on diversification in the 1960s, such as the acquisition of Ohio Pattern Works & Foundry Company in 1961, came notable purchases of companies that continue to be a significant part of Dover Corporation today. The company was shorthanded to OPW, and in 1949 one of its engineers, Leonard H. Duerr, invented the automatic shutoff fuel-dispensing nozzle valve. Today, the basic technology of Duerr's invention continues to exist in automatic shutoff nozzles, and OPW is still a part of Dover, specializing in the design and manufacture of commercial and retail- fueling solutions. In 1962, Dover made two notable acquisitions: Detroit Stamping Company, now DE-STA-CO, specializing in the design and manufacture of clamping, gripping, transferring, and robotic tooling solutions; and Alberta Oil Tool, now part of Dover Artificial Lift. Today, Alberta Oil Tool produces specialty drive rods, Norris tubular fittings, Norriseal control valves, and other products. 1964 marked a significant year, as OPW's former leader Thomas Sutton became president of Dover and corporate headquarters were relocated to New York City. The 1970s were characterized by Dover's intent to expand beyond its principle industries of building materials, equipment, and industrial components. A result of this effort included the acquisition of Dieterich Standard, which manufactured liquid-measurement instruments and whose president, Gary Roubos, went on to become Dover's chief operating officer (COO) and president in 1977. Later, Roubos became Dover's chief executive officer (CEO) in 1981. Another significant acquisition included Sargent Industries, a manufacturer of control devices for aerospace and industrial end-markets, purchased in 1984 for $68 million. The Sargent Aerospace & Defense unit persisted as a global supplier of precision-engineered components and aftermarket services, performing critical functions on a variety of commercial and military aircraft, submarines, and land-based vehicles. In the 1980s, Dover also began to focus more on electronics. This period was marked by the acquisitions of K&L; Microwave in 1983, Dielectric Laboratories in 1985, and NURAD in 1986. Dover later chose to spin off DOVatron in 1993 to shareholders, as the company specialized in circuit-board assembly and had become a source of competition for Dover customers. That same year, Dover acquired Phoenix Refrigeration Systems, which then acquired Hill Refrigeration in 1994 to form Hillphoenix. Hillphoenix now manufactures commercial refrigeration systems and mechanical centers, electrical distribution products, walk-in coolers and freezers, and specialty display cases and fixtures. The company is a partner of the EPA's GreenChill initiative, which focuses on reducing refrigerant emissions and climate-change impact. Hillphoenix has more equipment installed at GreenChill Certified retail stores than any other refrigeration manufacturer. Also in 1994, Dover's COO and President, Thomas Reece, became CEO of the company. The following year, Dover purchased an 88 percent interest in the French company Imaje Printing Products for $200 million; this acquisition marks the largest in Dover's corporate history. In 2006, Dover acquired Markem Corporation which specializes in identification solutions. One year later, the companies merged and were renamed Markem-Imaje, and have since focused on product coding, labeling, and traceability solutions. 2000s While Dover acquired more than seventy companies between 1998 and 2002, the company's acquisition rate slowed in the early 2000s. Dover sold eight companies in 2001 for a total of $400 million. The early 2000s also marked a leadership change: Ronald Hoffman, Dover's vice president, and former president and CEO of Dover Resources, become president and COO of Dover Corporation in 2003. In 2005, he was appointed to the position of CEO. The financial crisis hit Dover hard, but the company recovered quickly. Dover focused on growing target areas from 2007 to 2009, including electronic communication, energy and fluids, product identification, and refrigeration. Dover continued to grow its refrigeration business with the 2012 purchase of Anthony International for $602.5 million. Anthony designs and manufactures specialty glass, commercial-glass refrigeration and freezer doors, lighting systems, and display equipment. In 2008, Robert Livingston was appointed Dover's new CEO and president. Livingston's Dover career began twenty-nine years earlier with the acquisition of K&L; Microwave, where he was a vice president. After joining Dover, Livingston also served as COO and vice president of Dover Corporation, president and CEO of Dover Engineered Systems, and president and CEO of Dover Electronics. Under Livingston's leadership, Dover moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to the Chicago area in 2010. Factors at play in this decision included Chicago's central location, wide variety of housing options for employees, quality of life, and nearby air service to national and global destinations. The choice to move to Downers Grove, Illinois, was also partially impacted by an effort to consolidate operations, and reduce administration costs, as the move brought all four segment headquarters under one roof. From 2008 to 2012, Dover acquired almost twenty-five companies. Livingston's corporate development strategy sought to strengthen promising businesses and divest those that were either growing slowly or had significant exposure to highly volatile industries. As a result, Dover was able to apply greater focus to growing four or five targeted end- markets. Livingston also worked to reduced expenses by consolidating back office operations, metal purchases, and freight transportation. Inpro/Seal, a producer of bearing isolators, was purchased by Waukesha Bearings Corporation in 2009, which included 150,991 shares of Dover's common stock being issued to Inpro/Seal shareholders. In 2010, KMC Inc. and Bearings Plus Inc. were acquired by Waukesha Bearings Corporation with the expectation of synergizing their bearing seal technologies with Dover. In addition, between 2008 and 2010, Dover spent approximately $436 million to purchase a total of sixteen businesses, while only $100 million was earned from the sale of eight businesses. In 2011, Dover expanded its acoustic components business with the purchase of Sound Solutions, a manufacturer of dynamic speakers and receivers for mobile phones and other consumer electronics, for $855 million. Dover had acquired Knowles, a designer and manufacturer of hearing-aid technology and other acoustical componentry, six years earlier for $750 million. Together, Sound Solutions and Knowles gave Dover the necessary scale to develop integrated solutions for the rapidly evolving mobile-electronics industry. In 2014, Dover spun off Knowles, which had a $2.6 billion market cap post-spin. Today, Knowles continues to be a global supplier of communication-technology components, such as MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems), microphones, speakers, receivers, transducers, capacitors and oscillators. Dover CEO and president Robert Livingston described the spinoff as allowing both Knowles and Dover to more aggressively pursue their individual growth strategies. In 2015, Dover sold Sargent Aerospace & Defense to RBC Bearings. Segments and operating companies Dover's organization and segment structure has changed over its history. For example, in 1985 Dover restructured into five major subsidiaries to reflect its key markets of interest. For reporting purposes, these five major subsidies were represented in four sections: building industries (Dover Elevator International); electronic products (Dover Technologies); petroleum (Dover Resources); and industrial and aerospace products (Dover Industries, Dover Sargent). In 1989, Dover re-segmented into six sectors based on market activity changes: Dover Elevator International, Dover Technology, Dover Resources, Dover Industries, Dover Diversified, and Corporate Companies. After selling Dover Elevator, these segments became Diversified, Electronics, Industries, Resources, Systems and Technologies. In 2007, Dover reported four segments: Industrial Products, Engineered Systems, Fluid Management, and Electronic Technologies. By 2012, Dover had re-segmented again into Dover Communication Technologies, Dover Energy, Dover Engineered Systems, and Dover Printing & Identification. In 2014, Dover Corporation has operated with four segments: Energy, Engineered Systems, Fluids, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. The operating companies that reside within each segment are run like independent companies. Again, as in 1985, during 2020, Dover's business was divided into five segments; ENGINEERED PRODUCTS, FUELING SOLUTIONS, IMAGING & IDENTIFICATION, PUMPS & PROCESS, SOLUTIONS, REFRIGERATION & FOOD EQUIPMENT.  FUELING SOLUTIONS  Providing a comprehensive portfolio of high-quality and cutting-edge products and solutions for the retail fueling and other adjacent markets incorporates Dover Fueling Solutions and OPW.

The game features the same graphic engine previously used in the development of Sword of Vermilion. However, Rent A Hero has an unusual innovation for the genre. Instead of using standard turn-based battles, fights are in a similar format to 2D fighting games. Plot Taro Yamada, or lives in the town of Corja in Japan with his mother, eccentric father and younger sister Alyssa; the family moved there after his father changed jobs. He received his Combat Armor by accident during their house-warming party, when he ordered pizza from 'Sensational Cafeteria' or SECA and instead received the suit. After realizing the suit gave him incredible strength and that he is required to pay for the armor, Taro decides to become a hero for hire, performing various heroic tasks and odd-jobs for the townspeople of Corja. Release Rent A Hero was released for the Mega Drive on September 20, 1991, in Japan by Sega. It was later released on the Wii's Virtual Console download service on April 17, 2007. Remake Rent-A-Hero No. 1 Rent A Hero No. 1, a remake of the original Mega Drive game, was released for the Dreamcast in 2000. It features similar events to Rent A Hero, this time adding Rent A Hiroko, a female counterpart of Taro. The fighting engine used for the game is the same used for Sega's Spikeout games and allows the player to receive hints via in-game email. The game was enhanced and given online capabilities by Coolnet Entertainment for the Xbox in 2003, and also translated into English for a North American release in what would have been the first Rent A Hero overseas release. However, the English version of the game was never released due to distribution problems, and the Xbox version remained only in Japan as had previously happened with the original Dreamcast version. In 2008, the unreleased English-translated version of the game got leaked and appeared on torrent sites in an apparently complete state, with only minor text errors present. This version was very close to completion and was reviewed by GamePro and Electronics Gaming Monthly in February 2003. Other media Taro is available in Fighters Megamix as an unlockable character. He is one of few characters to use projectile attacks, and one of the strongest fighters. However, he has an additional handicap: above his life bar are battery symbols, that deplete the longer a fight lasts, if they deplete fully, Taro's armor will disappear. In this state, he will not be able to perform a number of moves, including all projectile moves, and he will also take more damage.

He studied at the University of Leicester in the 1990s and spent a sandwich year at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, graduating in 1997 with a 2:1 degree in chemistry.  Professional wrestling career   Heartland Wrestling Association (1998‚Äì2004)  In September 1998, Haworth began training under Les Thatcher in the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA) in Cincinnati, Ohio, incurring large debts in the process. After debuting in September 1999, working under the ring name Nigel McGuinness and defeating GQ Masters III in a match that was featured on ABC's 20/20, he spent a year wrestling in the mid west. Haworth returned to England where he worked two full-time jobs to earn enough money to be able to return to the United States to wrestle, and wrestled for All Star promotions between September and December 2001, where he learned from wrestlers such as Robbie Brookside. McGuinness developed a heel character which he described as \\"a punk rock soccer hooligan... Billy Idol meets Johnny Saint\\". On 10 July 2001, McGuinness defeated Dean Jablonski in a singles match with the HWA Tag Team Championship on the line (the co-holder of the title, Chet Jablonski, was indisposed), claiming the title for himself and his partner, The Human Time Bomb. McGuinness and The Bomb held the title until 7 August, when the Jablonski brothers regained the title. McGuinness and The Bomb would become champions for a second time on 23 July 2002, defeating the Jablonski brothers once more. They lost the title to Southern Breeze later that year. In 2003, McGuinness introduced the HWA European Championship to HWA. He held the title until 30 September 2003, when he lost to Hoss. He regained the title on 4 November and promptly retired it. McGuinness won the HWA Heavyweight Championship on 6 September 2003 in Batavia, Ohio, defeating Chad Collyer, He held the title until 3 January 2004, when he lost the title to Hoss. McGuinness defeated Hoss to begin a second reign with the title on 6 January, and held it until 17 March 2004, when he lost to El Temor.  Ring of Honor   Pure Champion (2003‚Äì2006)  ROH Pure Champion McGuinness debuted in Ring of Honor (ROH) on 9 August 2003, defeating Chet Jablonski. He wrestled for ROH throughout 2004, but had limited success. In March 2005, McGuinness and Colt Cabana teamed together to challenge for the ROH Tag Team Championship, but lost to the incumbents, Dan Maff and B.J. Whitmer. Cabana and McGuinness then began fighting one another, with McGuinness defeating Cabana on 7 May 2005, with an accidental low blow for a shot at the ROH Pure Championship. He challenged the champion, Samoa Joe, on 12 June 2005, but was defeated. He faced Joe once more on 27 August, and defeated him to win the Pure Championship. After becoming champion, McGuinness turned heel and for several months was engaged in a feud with Claudio Castagnoli, instigated by a non-title match on 14 October where Castagnoli was able to use his knowledge of McGuinness's European wrestling style to score a pinfall on the champion. This led to a series of matches for the title, with McGuinness using underhanded tactics to avoid losing the championship belt. On 25 March 2006, McGuinness defeated Castagnoli in a match billed as the latter's last chance to win the championship as long as McGuinness was champion. During his Pure Championship run, McGuinness regularly carried an iron (decorated with the Union Jack) to ringside. When asked, the typical story given was that a group of men once broke into his home to attack him, but he was able to defend himself with the iron. In reality, he began carrying the iron after a girlfriend's mother asked him why some wrestlers carried weapons to ringside, and then inquired as to whether anyone had ever carried an iron before. He would often use the iron as a weapon to win his matches. McGuinness also had a malapropistic gimmick in ROH of mispronouncing words. An example would be at Survival of the Fittest 2005 in Dorchester, Massachusetts, when he said the fans appreciated him as much as \\"their beloved Boston Red Stockings\\". During the rest of 2006, McGuinness was mostly uninvolved in the war between ROH and Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), instead developing a new gimmick where he would win his matches by countout by using (often unfair) methods of preventing opponents from returning to the ring. McGuinness received a shot at the ROH World Championship against Bryan Danielson with his own Pure Championship on the line and contested under pure wrestling rules on 29 April. McGuinness again won by countout, by which only the Pure title could be won, but not Danielson's World title. The victory was enough to earn a rematch under regular rules on 29 July, in which Danielson narrowly managed to retain his title. A month later in Liverpool, England, ROH arranged a unification match between the two titles and guaranteed there would be a winner, with both titles able to change hands due to countout or disqualification under pure wrestling rules. McGuinness lost the match on 12 August and the Pure Championship was unified and retired. McGuinness reign of 350 days is the longest in the two-year history of the Pure Championship. After the match, Danielson offered McGuinness one more shot at the unified ROH World Championship and on 25 August the two of them wrestled a two-out-of-three- falls match to a 60-minute time limit and as a result McGuinness could no longer challenge for the title as long as Danielson was the champion. After the match, Danielson recognised McGuinness' efforts and gave him the now retired Pure Championship belt as a trophy.  Feud with Jimmy Rave and Chris Hero (2006‚Äì2007)  After losing the Pure Championship, McGuinness, now a face, challenged for Pro Wrestling Noah's GHC Heavyweight Championship on 16 September 2006, at ROH's Glory by Honor V ‚Äì Night 2, but was defeated by the defending champion Naomichi Marufuji. The rest of the year saw McGuinness feuding with Jimmy Rave, who, using his new submission manoeuvre, the Heel Hook (a single leg Boston crab and twisting ankle lock combination), forced him to tap out on two separate occasions, first on 8 December 2006, at The Chicago Spectacular Night 1 and then on 23 December 2006, at Final Battle 2006. Rave followed that up with another victory over McGuinness on 27 January 2007, this time in an \\"I Quit\\" match, which he won via referee stoppage. In February, McGuinness began acting as a representative of NOAH and as a spokesperson and tag team partner of NOAH talent Takeshi Morishima, upon his arrival to the company. On 4 March in Liverpool, McGuinness ended his feud with Jimmy Rave by defeating him with a Rebound Lariat, which in storyline resulted in Rave suffering a broken jaw and earned the move the new name of Jawbreaker Lariat, when in reality Rave had broken his jaw a month earlier. McGuinness' next feud would be with Chris Hero, who had dubbed himself the best pure wrestler in the world. During this feud McGuinness also received two shots at the ROH World Championship, on 14 April and 16 July, but was both times defeated by champion Takeshi Morishima. On 23 June, McGuinness defeated Hero in a 30-minute time limit match, but Hero came back on 10 August and defeated McGuinness with help from his agent Larry Sweeney and the Sweet 'n' Sour Inc. in a match contested under pure wrestling rules.  ROH World Champion (2007‚Äì2009)  McGuinness as the ROH World Champion in October 2008 On 15 September 2007, at Man Up, ROH's third pay-per-view, McGuinness defeated Chris Hero, Claudio Castagnoli and Naomichi Marufuji in a four-way match to earn one more shot at Takeshi Morishima's ROH World Championship, which McGuinness won at Undeniable on 6 October 2007. In late 2007, ROH confirmed that McGuinness had suffered a torn biceps and would be out of action until Final Battle 2007, however he would not be stripped of the ROH World Championship. On 2 November, the first night of ROH's Glory by Honor VI event in Philadelphia, Chris Hero and his agent Larry Sweeney complained of McGuinness' injury, calling him a fluke champion. Sweeney felt that Hero's victory of the Survival of the Fittest in Las Vegas earned him a title shot any time he wanted. McGuinness, in street clothes, accepted the challenge. He successfully retained the title against Hero, despite first losing the match due to the referee failing to notice McGuinness' foot on the rope while Hero made him tap out to submission. On 29 December 2007, McGuinness returned to the ring full-time at ROH fifth pay-per-view, Rising Above. During his defence of the ROH World Championship against Austin Aries, however, McGuinness injured his head when Aries dove from the ring onto him, which resulted in him hitting his head on the metal guard rail. The impact gave McGuinness a concussion, broke his nose, opened his eyebrow, and required 14 stitches. On 25 January 2008, McGuinness wrapped up his feud with Chris Hero by successfully defending his title against him in a steel cage match. In February at ROH's Sixth Anniversary Show, McGuinness turned heel during his successful title defence against Bryan Danielson by breaking an earlier agreement and targeting his head, injured earlier at the hands of Morishima. Throughout the rest of the year, McGuinness successfully defended his title against the likes of Tyler Black, Austin Aries, Kevin Steen, Claudio Castagnoli, Go Shiozaki, Jerry Lynn, Roderick Strong, El Generico and on 22 November 2008, at Rising Above, in a grudge match against Bryan Danielson. On 20 March 2009, McGuinness sustained an arm injury competing in a tag team match. However, despite the injury reportedly requiring surgery, he still wrestled at the Seventh Anniversary Show the next night and defeated KENTA to retain his title. Finally, on 3 April 2009 at Supercard of Honor IV, McGuinness lost the ROH World Championship to Jerry Lynn at his 39th defence, ending his reign at 545 days.  Injuries and departure (2009)  After a hiatus to recover from the injury, McGuinness returned to wrestling a few months later. On 24 July, McGuinness suffered a minor injury during a four-way match after his \\"spine got compacted taking a piledriver\\", and was unable to wrestle the following night. On 4 September, ROH announced that McGuinness had \\"in principle\\" agreed to a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), but confirmed that he would continue to wrestle for ROH until the end of September. McGuinness wrestled his last ROH match on 26 September at Glory by Honor VIII: The Final Countdown, losing to Bryan Danielson, who was also making his final appearance for the company.  Independent circuit (2004‚Äì2009)  McGuinness at a 2CW show in April 2009 While still in ROH, McGuinness continued to compete in various other independent promotions like IWA Mid-South, New Era Pro Wrestling, Italian Championship Wrestling, and American All-Star Wrestling, as well as tours in various countries. McGuinness would also make appearances for some major promotions. On 11 August 2004, McGuinness appeared in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), debuting in a 22-man Gauntlet for the Gold for the TNA X Division Championship, which was won by Petey Williams. On 31 August 2005, McGuinness competed in Ohio Valley Wrestling, WWE's developmental territory, on episode of its OVW TV, losing to Elijah Burke. He would go on to wrestle Danny Basham on 11 September 2005, episode of Sunday Night Heat, taped prior to Raw on 5 September, losing after Basham hit an inverted DDT. On 13 November 2005, McGuinness returned to TNA at the pre-show prior to the Genesis pay-per-view in a losing effort to Shark Boy, before leaving America to tour Japan with NOAH in November and December 2005. He wrestled nine matches in total, seven of which he won, and teamed with fellow gaijin Doug Williams, 2 Cold Scorpio and Bison Smith. During his tour of Japan, McGuinness was supposed to compete in TNA's 2006 World X Cup Tournament, but Team UK was replaced by Team Canada, after McGuinness and Williams could not appear because both were booked in Japan. In 2007, McGuinness represented ROH in the King of Europe Cup. He made his way through to the final and, in his home country, defeated fellow Brit and tag-team partner Doug Williams to win the 2007 tournament final. On 14 October 2007, McGuiness wrestled James Tighe in the first round of the British National Championship held by International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom (IPW:UK), however McGuiness was disqualified for the use of brass knuckles and eliminated from the tournament. McGuinness won the 1PW Openweight Championship, his first title in a British promotion, on 19 April 2009, by defeating Johnny Moss.  Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2009‚Äì2011)  Wolfe in a match with Kurt Angle On 4 September 2009, ROH announced that Haworth had agreed to a contract with the WWE \\"in principle\\". On 20 October 2009, it was reported that Haworth's deal with the WWE had fallen through due to him failing a pre-screening physical test after feeling an old biceps injury needed surgery and that he had decided to sign with TNA instead. He officially made his TNA return as a heel under the ring name Desmond Wolfe on 22 October episode of Impact! by attacking Kurt Angle. The following week, Wolfe defeated Angle in a street fight via referee stoppage, following a lariat. On 12 November, Wolfe won a third exchange with Angle as he laid him out with a DDT. At Turning Point, Angle defeated Wolfe via submission. The following month at Final Resolution, Wolfe faced Angle in a \\"Three Degrees of Pain\\" two-out-of-three-falls match. Wolfe managed to gain the first fall by pinning Angle following the Tower of London, but tapped out to the ankle lock in the second fall to make it even. In the final fall, which could only be won by escaping the cage, Angle managed to escape first and won the match and the feud. hopefuls: (from left to right) Wolfe, Robert Roode, A.J. Styles, and James Storm. Following the loss to Angle, Wolfe moved on to feuding with D'Angelo Dinero, who defeated him on 4 January 2010, three-hour, Monday night episode of Impact!. At Genesis, Wolfe debuted a new valet, who was later named Chelsea, and defeated Dinero in a rematch. At Against All Odds, Wolfe entered the 8 Card Stud Tournament to crown a new number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated in the first round by the eventual winner of the whole tournament, Dinero. On 25 February episode of Impact!, Wolfe aligned himself with Ric Flair and then TNA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles in their battle with Hulk Hogan, Abyss and D'Angelo Dinero. On 4 March episode of Impact!, Wolfe received his first shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, held by Styles, in a four-way match, which also included Dinero and Abyss, but Styles was able to retain his title by defeating Dinero via referee stoppage. The following week on Impact!, Wolfe and Dinero were scheduled to once again face each other, but the match was cancelled after Wolfe attacked Dinero during an interview and re-injured his ankle. Wolfe and Dinero finally had their fourth singles match together on 29 March episode of Impact!, and this time Wolfe was able to pin the number one contender after hitting him with a chain, while Chelsea was distracting the referee, but on the following episode of Impact! Dinero defeated Wolfe in a rematch in just two minutes. At Lockdown, along with Sting, Robert Roode and James Storm, Wolfe represented Team Flair in the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they were defeated by Team Hogan (Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy), when Abyss pinned Wolfe. On 26 April, TNA introduced a new \\"Championship Ranking\\" system, where fans were allowed to vote on the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Surprisingly, Wolfe led the first poll from start to finish, ahead of the likes of Jeff Hardy, Mr. Anderson, Sting, A.J. Styles, Kurt Angle, D'Angelo Dinero and Abyss, and on 3 May episode of Impact! was granted a shot at the title, held by Rob Van Dam. However, Wolfe was defeated in the title match. At Sacrifice, Wolfe was defeated by Abyss, who as a result won Chelsea's services for 30 days. On the following episode of Impact!, Chelsea started showing sympathy towards Abyss, when he was being brutalised by Wolfe. The following month at Slammiversary VIII, Wolfe was defeated by Abyss in a Monster's Ball match, when Chelsea turned on him and helped Abyss pick up the victory. On the following episode of Impact!, Ric Flair, who had aligned himself with Wolfe, Styles, Roode, Storm and Kazarian, announced that he would reform the Four Horsemen under the new name , stating that each of them would have to earn their spots in the group and that in order for Wolfe to earn his spot, he needed to become the Lex Luger of the group. Later in the night, Chelsea reluctantly returned to Wolfe after her 30 days with Abyss were up. Wolfe gave her a chance to redeem herself, but her behaviour outside the ring provided a distraction, which cost Wolfe his match against Flair's nemesis Jay Lethal. After a series of losses, Wolfe attempted to get back in good graces with Flair by helping Styles and Kazarian defeat Samoa Joe and Rob Terry at Victory Road to earn their spots in , only to get a muscle buster from Joe after the match. On the following episode of Impact!, Wolfe confronted Flair when he inducted Styles and Kazarian into , demanding to be included in the stable. Two weeks later on Impact!, Flair revealed Robert Roode and James Storm as the final two members of , leaving Wolfe out of the stable. Wolfe, Chelsea and Magnus posing in the ring in July 2010 After failing to make it into , Wolfe went on to form a tag team with fellow Briton Magnus and together the two not only ended Wolfe's losing streak, but also started a winning streak, defeating teams like Amazing Red and Suicide, Hernandez and Rob Terry and Ink Inc. (Jesse Neal and Shannon Moore) on episodes of Xplosion, and in the process earned themselves the right to challenge for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On 26 August episode of Impact!, the team was named London Brawling. They were scheduled to receive their shot at The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) and the TNA World Tag Team Championship at No Surrender, but were at the last minute pulled from the event, with TNA citing a \\"personal issue\\" as the reason. It was later reported that Wolfe was pulled from the event due to an undisclosed medical situation that would sideline him for the next few months. On a December 2014 podcast, McGuinness revealed that at this time, he tested positive for Hepatitis B. On-screen his absence was explained by Magnus, who claimed that in an attempt to become a dual athlete, Wolfe had travelled to London to try out for Chelsea F.C. On 21 November 2010, TNA president Dixie Carter announced that Wolfe was close to a comeback. On 16 December episode of Impact!, Magnus met his former tag team partner Doug Williams and informed him that Wolfe was now done with football and would be coming back soon, while also telling him that they had gotten rid of Chelsea. Wolfe finally made his return in a non-televised segment on 10 December 2010, at the tapings of the 6 January 2011, episode of Impact!, when he and Magnus saved Williams from Fortune members A.J. Styles and Rob Terry. On 16 May 2011, Wolfe made his return to TNA, when he was announced as the new commissioner of Xplosion, turning face in the process. During his time as the commissioner, Wolfe also served as the third member of the Xplosion announcing team, working beside Jeremy Borash and Taz. However, on 17 June it was reported that Wolfe had been released from his TNA contract. Independent circuit and retirement (2011) After a fourteen-month break from in-ring competition, it was announced on 24 October that McGuinness would be making his return to the ring on 11 November at a Squared Circle Wrestling (2CW) event in Watertown, New York, starting a two-month-long string of shows billed as the \\"Nigel McGuinness Retirement Tour\\". In his return match, McGuinness faced Eddie Edwards in a losing effort. McGuinness decided to retire since WWE didn't sign him, he didn't want to come back to TNA and he can't keep the strong style he used to use in ROH. The following day, McGuinness was defeated by Chad Collyer at a HWA event in Hamilton, Ohio. A week later Haworth, performing as Desmond Wolfe, was defeated by Jebediah at a Main Event Championship Wrestling event in Alliance, Ohio. On 25 November, McGuinness returned to the United Kingdom, when he was defeated by Eddie Edwards in a Fight Club: Pro Championship three- way match in Wolverhampton, which also included Trent Seven. The following day, McGuinness was defeated by Jon Ryan at a Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw) event in Oberhausen, Germany, before returning to lose to Joel Redman at an International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom (IPW:UK) event in Sittingbourne on 27 November. After two more weekends of shows in the United Kingdom, McGuinness returned to the United States for his final match, which took place at an American Pro Wrestling Alliance (APWA) event in Clarksburg, West Virginia on 17 December 2011  Return to ROH (2011‚Äì2016)  McGuinness (right) with his Ring of Honor Wrestling broadcast partner Kevin Kelly in August 2011 On 13 August 2011, Haworth, returning to his Nigel McGuinness ring name, returned to ROH at the promotion's first Ring of Honor Wrestling tapings under the Sinclair Broadcast Group banner, working as the colour commentator beside Kevin Kelly. The tapings concluded with McGuinness saving Eddie Edwards from the House of Truth. At the 3 November 2012, tapings of Ring of Honor Wrestling, McGuinness was named the new \\"Matchmaker\\" of Ring of Honor, replacing Jim Cornette as the main on-screen authority figure. In December 2012, McGuinness released a documentary titled The Last of McGuinness on his final days as an in-ring performer, during which he revealed that WWE had rescinded his contract after feeling an old biceps injury needed surgery, while his in-ring career in TNA ended after contracting hepatitis B during his time there. In late May 2013, McGuinness toured the United Kingdom with the shorter final cut of his documentary and has become an advocate for hepatitis B vaccination and an end to the use of intentional blood loss in wrestling. In 2014, following the success of his documentary, McGuinness began working in the film industry as an Assistant Editor and Production Assistant on various television shows and in December of that year launched a Kickstart campaign for his new creative project, L.A. Fights, described as a scripted show about \\"a diverse group of amateur fighters and their morally ambivalent promoter struggle to coexist in their upstart fight league\\". In December 2016, ROH announced McGuinness had resigned as the promotion's matchmaker.  WWE (2016‚Äìpresent)  After being recommended by WWE lead commentator Michael Cole, on 15 December 2016, WWE announced that McGuinness had signed with the company as a commentator.

In 2019 WWE released a documentary on McGuinness' career entitled Chasing the Magic: The Nigel McGuinness Story on the WWE Network, that covered his full career from his early childhood fandom of wrestling to his success as a commentator for the company. On 28 May, it was reported McGuinness had been furloughed during April as part of budget cuts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.https://solowrestling.mundodeportivo.com/new/89892-wwe-despide-a- nigel-mcguinness-de-forma-temporal He returned on 17 September episode of NXT UK alongside Andy Shepherd and the following night on 205 Live alongside Vic Joseph.

In the lowest order product the adjustment corresponds to subtracting off the mean value, to leave a result whose mean is zero. For the higher order products the adjustment involves subtracting off lower order (ordinary) products of the random variables, in a symmetric way, again leaving a result whose mean is zero. The Wick product is a polynomial function of the random variables, their expected values, and expected values of their products. The definition of the Wick product immediately leads to the Wick power of a single random variable and this allows analogues of other functions of random variables to be defined on the basis of replacing the ordinary powers in a power-series expansions by the Wick powers. The Wick powers of commonly-seen random variables can be expressed in terms of special functions such as Bernoulli polynomials or Hermite polynomials. The Wick product is named after physicist Gian-Carlo Wick, cf. Wick's theorem. Definition Assume that X1, ..., Xk are random variables with finite moments. The Wick product :\\\\langle X_1,\\\\dots,X_k \\\\rangle\\\\, is a sort of product defined recursively as follows: :\\\\langle \\\\rangle = 1\\\\, (i.e. the empty product--the product of no random variables at all--is 1). For k ‚â• 1, we impose the requirement :{\\\\partial\\\\langle X_1,\\\\dots,X_k\\\\rangle \\\\over \\\\partial X_i} = \\\\langle X_1,\\\\dots,X_{i-1}, \\\\widehat{X}_i, X_{i+1},\\\\dots,X_k \\\\rangle, where \\\\widehat{X}_i means that Xi is absent, together with the constraint that the average is zero, : \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\langle X_1,\\\\dots,X_k\\\\rangle = 0. \\\\, Examples It follows that :\\\\langle X \\\\rangle = X - \\\\operatorname{E}X,\\\\, :\\\\langle X, Y \\\\rangle = X Y - \\\\operatorname{E}Y\\\\cdot X - \\\\operatorname{E}X\\\\cdot Y+ 2(\\\\operatorname{E}X)(\\\\operatorname{E}Y) - \\\\operatorname{E}(X Y).\\\\, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\langle X,Y,Z\\\\rangle =&XYZ;\\\\\\\\\\\\ &-\\\\operatorname{E}Y\\\\cdot XZ\\\\\\\\\\\\ &-\\\\operatorname{E}Z\\\\cdot XY\\\\\\\\\\\\ &-\\\\operatorname{E}X\\\\cdot YZ\\\\\\\\\\\\ &+2(\\\\operatorname{E}Y)(\\\\operatorname{E}Z)\\\\cdot X\\\\\\\\\\\\ &+2(\\\\operatorname{E}X)(\\\\operatorname{E}Z)\\\\cdot Y\\\\\\\\\\\\ &+2(\\\\operatorname{E}X)(\\\\operatorname{E}Y)\\\\cdot Z\\\\\\\\\\\\ &-\\\\operatorname{E}(XZ)\\\\cdot Y\\\\\\\\\\\\ &-\\\\operatorname{E}(XY)\\\\cdot Z\\\\\\\\\\\\ &-\\\\operatorname{E}(YZ)\\\\cdot X\\\\\\\\\\\\ &-\\\\operatorname{E}(XYZ)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &+2\\\\operatorname{E}(XY)\\\\operatorname{E}Z+2\\\\operatorname{E}(XZ)\\\\operatorname{E}Y+2\\\\operatorname{E}(YZ)\\\\operatorname{E}X\\\\\\\\\\\\ &-6(\\\\operatorname{E}X)(\\\\operatorname{E}Y)(\\\\operatorname{E}Z). \\\\end{align} Another notational convention In the notation conventional among physicists, the Wick product is often denoted thus: :: X_1, \\\\dots, X_k:\\\\, and the angle-bracket notation :\\\\langle X \\\\rangle\\\\, is used to denote the expected value of the random variable X. Wick powers The nth Wick power of a random variable X is the Wick product :X'^n = \\\\langle X,\\\\dots,X \\\\rangle\\\\, with n factors. The sequence of polynomials Pn such that :P_n(X) = \\\\langle X,\\\\dots,X \\\\rangle = X'^n\\\\, form an Appell sequence, i.e. they satisfy the identity :P_n'(x) = nP_{n-1}(x),\\\\, for n = 0, 1, 2, ... and P0(x) is a nonzero constant. For example, it can be shown that if X is uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1], then : X'^n = B_n(X)\\\\, where Bn is the nth-degree Bernoulli polynomial. Similarly, if X is normally distributed with variance 1, then : X'^n = H_n(X)\\\\, where Hn is the nth Hermite polynomial. Binomial theorem : (aX+bY)^{'n} = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n {n\\\\choose i}a^ib^{n-i} X^{'i} Y^{'{n-i}}  Wick exponential  :\\\\langle \\\\operatorname{exp}(aX)\\\\rangle \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=} \\\\ \\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{a^i}{i!} X^{'i} References * Wick Product Springer Encyclopedia of Mathematics * Florin Avram and Murad Taqqu, (1987) \\"Noncentral Limit Theorems and Appell Polynomials\\", Annals of Probability, volume 15, number 2, pages 767--775, 1987. * Hida, T. and Ikeda, N.

Original 1964 front cover illustrated by Harry Wingfield. A self-portrait watercolour by Harry Wingfield in his early 30s John Henry \\"Harry\\" Wingfield (4 December 1910 ‚Äì 5 March 2002) was an English illustrator, best known for his drawings that illustrated the Ladybird Books Key Words Reading Scheme (also known as Peter and Jane) in the 1960s through to the 1980s, which sold over 80 million copies worldwide. Wingfield was born in Denby, near Derby, the son of a blastfurnace man. He grew up in Manchester and Derbyshire. Hoping to become an engineer, he failed to obtain an apprenticeship to Rolls Royce, which he thought was because of his stammer. He started his first job in an advertising agency in Derby, aged 16, and then worked in Walsall and Birmingham. He took evening classes in drawing, where he met his wife, Ethel and he served in the RAF in the Second World War as a driver in the RAF regiment. Based in the Azores he painted camouflage but also gained a reputation for painting portraits of colleagues and family members. He worked as a graphic designer when he returned to England before working as a freelance illustrator for Ladybird in the 1950s. His watercolours, along with those of Martin Aitchison, provided strong images to accompany the simple text devised by William Murray. Wingfield's wife Ethel, as an expert in early learning, was a significant collaborator. His best-known work accompanied books in the Key Words Reading Scheme brought out by Ladybird as competition to the American Janet and John books. They conformed to stereotypes, with neat, obedient children; Peter helping Daddy with the car or in the garden, and Jane helping Mummy in the kitchen. They featured images initially based on photography of families on new council estates of the period, a market they targeted with phenomenal success. Within a few years, new lifestyles meant that Wingfield's images were looking out of date, so he modernised the illustrations in the 1970s. The children became scruffier, and the domestic settings changed, though the books never truly reflected the social changes of the period. Wingfield remained a freelance for most of his life and in 1989, Ladybird returned a catalogue of around 600 original pictures to him, some of which were sold at exhibition, but many of which he retained. He lived modestly, and after retirement continued to live in the house in Little Aston, near Walsall, where he had spent his working life as an artist. Exhibitions of Wingfield's pictures were held in Walsall in 2002 and 2003 and across the UK, organised by Ladybird enthusiasts including the writer Cressida Connolly. His works, along with the books, have increased in value in recent years as Ladybird books and their accompanying illustrations have become more fashionable and therefore more collectable. In late 2014 Ladybird books received major UK media coverage with the release of an iconic 'covers' collection to celebrate their 100th anniversary. Many of Harry Wingfield's illustrations were reproduced in the UK media as part of that announcement. In May 2018 a collection of Wingfield's works, owned by a former neighbour, were shown on the BBC Television programme Antiques Road Show.

Like all zero-knowledge proofs, it allows one party, the Prover, to prove to another party, the Verifier, that she possesses secret information without revealing to Verifier what that secret information is. The Feige‚ÄìFiat‚ÄìShamir identification scheme, however, uses modular arithmetic and a parallel verification process that limits the number of communications between Prover and Verifier.  Setup  Following a common convention, call the prover Peggy and the verifier Victor. Choose two large prime integers p and q and compute the product n = pq. Create secret numbers s_1, \\\\cdots, s_k coprime to n. Compute v_i \\\\equiv s_i^{2} \\\\pmod{n}. Peggy and Victor both receive n while p and q are kept secret. Peggy is then sent the numbers s_i. These are her secret login numbers. Victor is sent the numbers v_i by Peggy when she wishes to identify herself to Victor. Victor is unable to recover Peggy's s_i numbers from his v_i numbers due to the difficulty in determining a modular square root when the modulus' factorization is unknown.  Procedure  # Peggy chooses a random integer r, a random sign s\\\\in\\\\\\\\{-1,1\\\\\\\\} and computes x \\\\equiv s\\\\cdot r^2 \\\\pmod{n}. Peggy sends x to Victor. # Victor chooses numbers a_1, \\\\cdots, a_k where a_i equals 0 or 1. Victor sends these numbers to Peggy. # Peggy computes y \\\\equiv rs_1^{a_1}s_2^{a_2} \\\\cdots s_k^{a_k}\\\\pmod{n}. Peggy sends this number to Victor. # Victor checks that y^2 \\\\equiv \\\\pm\\\\, x v_1^{a_1}v_2^{a_2} \\\\cdots v_k^{a_k}\\\\pmod{n} and that x eq 0 . This procedure is repeated with different r and a_i values until Victor is satisfied that Peggy does indeed possess the modular square roots (s_i) of his v_i numbers.  Security  In the procedure, Peggy does not give any useful information to Victor. She merely proves to Victor that she has the secret numbers without revealing what those numbers are. Anyone who intercepts the communication between each Peggy and Victor would only learn the same information. The eavesdropper would not learn anything useful about Peggy's secret numbers. Suppose Eve has intercepted Victor's v_i numbers but does not know what Peggy's s_i numbers are. If Eve wants to try to convince Victor that she is Peggy, she would have to correctly guess what Victor's a_i numbers will be. She then picks a random y, calculates x \\\\equiv y^2 v_1^{-a_1}v_2^{-a_2} \\\\cdots v_k^{-a_k}\\\\pmod{n} and sends x to Victor. When Victor sends a_i, Eve simply returns her y. Victor is satisfied and concludes that Eve has the secret numbers. However, the probability of Eve correctly guessing what Victor's a_i will be is 1 in 2^k. By repeating the procedure t times, the probability drops to 1 in 2^{k t} . For k = 5 and t = 4 the probability of successfully posing as Peggy is less than 1 in 1 million.

The greater weever is widely distributed along the eastern Atlantic coastline from Norway to Morocco, extending to the Mediterranean, Aegean and Black Seas. Trachinus draco has been shown to occur in depths ranging from shallow water up to -150 meters where it inhabits mostly muddy or sandy grounds. Trachinus draco is mostly and notoriously known for its venomous spines that can inflict serious injuries on humans through accidental stinging. Because of these spines and its potent venom it is classified as one of the most venomous fishes in the Mediterranean.‚Å† The name ‚Äúweever‚Äù is thought to originate from the Anglo-Saxon word ‚Äúwivre‚Äù which translates as ‚Äúviper‚Äù.  Physical appearance  Trachinus draco is an elongated and laterally flattened fish with upstanding eyes and a distinct superior mouth that is inclined upwards. The lower jaw is longer than the upper jaw. The head is compact flat and relatively big and the eyes sit almost on top of it.‚Å† The upper rim of the eye has two to three small spines, in front of each eye. The five to seven spiny fin rays on its first dorsal fin and the thorns on each of the gill covers have venom glands at their basis.‚Å† Greater weever  Colouration  On its dorsal side Trachinus draco is coloured in an greenish brown with a varying count of dark marks on the upper side of the head. The flank is hued in a yellowish brown with bright blue and yellow discontinuous stripes that run crooked to the front of the fish.‚Å† Additionally oblique black stripes can be found laterally. This pattern is described as tiger-like by Horst M√ºller.‚Å†  Body dimensions  The body dimensions of Trachinus draco are described very differently by different authors and seem to differ based on the geographical location were the study has been carried out. In the Eastern Black Sea, the length distribution of mature fishes ranges from 10 cm up to a maximum of 25.8 cm for females and from 9.5 cm to 22.5 cm for males. The weight ranges from 6.96 g to 131.76 g for females and from 5.34 g to 75.84 g for males.‚Å† While the largest female recorded in the Eastern Black Sea was 25.8 cm long, the findings in other studies suggest, that Trachinus draco has a much bigger range in size than that found in this study. In the Algarve Coast of Southern Portugal the largest female found by Santos et al. had a total maximum length of 39.6 cm. But also in the Black Sea specimens have been observed, that outrange the largest female found by Ak & Gen√ß in 2013. The largest female found by Ak et al. in the Black Sea had a total maximum length of 35 cm.‚Å† For Ak & Gen√ß it seems to be clear that many factors contribute to the varying size of Trachinus draco like ‚Äútemperature, salinity, food (quantity, quality and size), sex, time of year and stage of maturity‚Äù.‚Å†  Ecology and Behaviour   Diet and feeding behaviour  Trachinus draco is a so-called ambush predator that digs itself into fine sand during daytime only with its eyes and the tip of the dorsal fin exposed.‚Å† There it lurks until prey emerges which is then attacked by the predator in a swift and sudden manner. During the night time the greater weever is believed to swim around freely, even pelagically. This thesis is indirectly supported by the finding, that prey in the stomach of T. draco which were caught during daytime was already mostly digested. Subsequent the feeding activity of T. draco seems to be higher during night time.‚Å†‚Å†‚Å† ‚Å† T. draco is a carnivore that mainly feeds on Decapods, Bonefish (Teleostei) and Opossum shrimps (Mysida) as catches in the eastern-central Adriatic Sea suggest. To a lower extent their diet contains also Isopoda, Amphipoda, Cephalopoda and Shells (Bivalvia). In general the former make up to over 90% of the total Index of Relative Importance (IRI). The most common prey that could be identified to the rank of species, were decapods namely Liocarcinus depurator and Galathea strigosa and mysids namely Anchialina agilis. But the compounds of the diet altered significantly with fish size. While the relatively small mysids were the most common prey for T. draco specimens under a size of 20 cm, their importance in the diet composition decreased with size, as the importance of amphipods did, too. On the other hand, the share of cephalopods and fishes increased with fish size. The feeding habit of T. draco in the eastern Adriatic Sea differs very little over the year and decapods have been the most common prey through all seasons but peaked through summer and autumn while teleostei consumption peaked in winter.‚Å†‚Å† In Danish waters on the other hand Merlangius merlangus and to smaller extent clupeoides were the main feeding source in the time of winter.‚Å† The frequency of empty stomachs, in the specimens found in the eastern Adriatic Sea was around 15% in general, but differed significantly through the year. In winter the frequency of empty stomachs was highest, with a maximum at around 43.3% and was lowest in summer with 6.8% and in autumn with 7.8%.‚Å† These findings were somewhat similar to those in Danish waters. In Kattegat the amount of empty stomachs has been observed in the months of January to April and is described as ‚Äúvery high, close to 100% in some month‚Äù.‚Å†‚Å†‚Å† Those findings may be due to the lower water temperature of around 12 to 13 ¬∞C and the therefore lowered metabolism and feeding activity respectively.‚Å† Aquarium experiments with stable light, temperature, salinity and sustained food supply on the contrary suggest an endogenous feeding pattern because even under such conditions the fishes refused to eat in the time from January to April and from October to March.‚Å†  Reproduction and Spawning behaviour  The reproduction period of T. draco seems to lasts from June to October.‚Å† This very broad range is limited by the observations of Ole Bagge (2004) who states that his findings strongly indicate that the spawning time of T. draco is indeed restricted to the period between June and August with a peak in July. Bagge also says that there have been no findings of greater weever in spawning condition from September to May.‚Å† T. draco is an oviparous spawning fish that lays its eggs into the pelagic zone. ‚Å†The larvae have a size of about 4.8 mm to 6.8 mm ‚Å† and hatch after approximately three months. The larvae and the eggs can both be found in the pelagic zone and the surface plankton. The larvae of T. draco may have a need for relatively warm water with a relatively low salinity to hatch in greater numbers.‚Å†‚Å† T. draco is probably not territorial, even in the mating season. It has not been observed to carry out any form of parental care.  Toxicity   Venomous apparatus  The venomous apparatus of T. draco consists of one spine on each operculum and five to eight dorsal spines. The spines on the operculum point towards the cauda, or tail, and are slightly bent downwards. The opercular spines arise from the upper edge of the operculum and are connected to the operculum with one third of their complete length. The other two thirds of their length lies free along the operculum. The total length of the opercular spines is approximately 27 mm. The spine itself is ‚Äúcovered by an integumentary sheath‚Äù.‚Å†‚Å† If this sheath ruptures because there is force applied to the spine, it allows the venom to leak from the venom gland cells and to run through a deep groove along the spine and into the wound caused by the sting. Each of the dorsal spines is covered in an individual integumentary sheet. The spines are connected through a fine interspinous membrane. The spines have different length and are by that arranged in a curve like manner. The spines observed by Russel & Emery (1960) had minimum lengths of 5 mm and maximum lengths of 29 mm and were quite heterogeneous in their appearance on a microscopic level. The dorsal spines are all bent very slightly towards the tail of the fish. The mechanism of envenomation is quite similar to that of the opercular spines.‚Å†  Venom glands  The glands producing T. draco‚Äôs venom are located in the derma of the fish. The venom glands are cased in connective tissue coated with a basal lamina which has a length of 0.1 Œºm. The venom glands are built up of polygonal cells with a long axis length of 40-50 Œºm. These cells show a relatively heterogeneous cytoplasm with noticeable large vacuoles and heterogeneous granular (Verdiglione, Mammola, Gargano, & Montesi, 2003). As in the tissue of the lesser weever (Echiichthys vipera / Trachinus vipera) supporting cells can be found in T. draco which develop from epidermal cells. These supporting cells form pockets inside the venom glands which are filled with differentiated glandular cells. The supporting cells most probably play a role in the cohesiveness of the venom gland and in the regeneration of the glandular cells.  Toxin  The potentially lethal protein component in the crude venom of T. draco is a 105 kDa polypeptide which is called Dracotoxin. The crude venom of T. draco has been shown to have membrane depolarizing and haemolytic characteristics. Those characteristics could be retraced to said single protein component. The depolarisation effect however could not be explained by well-established approaches. Neither does the depolarisation effect take place through Na+ or K+-channels nor through Na+-K+-ATPase activity.‚Å† The weever sting is often followed by first ischemic and subsequently hyperemic effects in the tissue surrounding the sting. These effects might be related to the high concentrations of histamines and catecholamines found in the venom.‚Å† ‚Å†‚Å†While Church & Hodgson (2002) suggest a cholinesterase activity of the toxin itself, Haavaldsen & Fonnum (1963) interpreted their finding of a high concentration of cholinesterase in the venom as a sign for a cholinergic mechanism in the production of the venom because cholinesterase activity hasn't yet been described in the venoms of the animal kingdom.‚Å† As Russel & Emery (1960) stated, the toxin extract of T. draco has a greyish colour but is clear in its appearance. It is said to have a ‚Äúfishy taste‚Äù and ‚Äúammoniacal odor‚Äù. The pH value of the extract seems to be 6.78 and is with that slightly sour.‚Å† The toxin of the closely related lesser weever T. vipera has been shown to contain 5-Hydroxy-Triptamine also called Serotonin but in the toxin of T. draco this finding could not be confirmed‚Å†.‚Å† The toxicity of the venom was dependent on the way of extraction. The highest toxicity was measured in live fish which were shock frozen and laired in ‚àí70 ¬∞C-freezers. Under such conditions the minimal lethal dose for mice was 1.8 Œºg/g while at least 110 mg could be extracted from an average sized fish.‚Å†  Relationship with humans  The most common incident regarding humans is strongly connected with T. draco‚Äô s typical behaviour: being burrowed in the sand of shallow waters. Especially in the summer it is quite possible for a careless bather to step, jump or fall on the venomous spines of the greater weever. The other occasion where humans are at risk to get stung by T. draco is when fishermen are handling the fish if caught in a net.‚Å†‚Å† ‚Å†The venom of the greater weever is best-known for the excruciating pain it provokes a short period of time after the initial sting which can last from a few hours to days. There are in fact cases reported, in which victims of a weever sting were still affected by it after a period of 4 months, even if this seems to be a rare scenario. The pain can in some cases reach up to a 10/10 on the numeric rating scale. In a reported case from 1782, a fisherman who had been stung, amputated his own finger to relieve the pain.‚Å†‚Å† Even if there are reported cases of fatal accidents with T. draco, it is widely believed that those are due to secondary infections and sepsis rather than to the toxin itself.‚Å†  Treatment  There are as many recommended treatments for a sting of the greater weever as there are fishermen who were stung by them. These recommendations reach from the application of hot water or vinegar to more arcane methods like fish liver, tobacco juice or the suggestion of ‚Äúburning the devilish weever, swear and pray‚Äù.‚Å† The modern medicine does in fact recommend the application of any kind of heat preferably to souse the affected limb into hot water (40-42 ¬∞C). Beside this first aid attempt to ease the pain it is recommended to clean the wound and to see a physician because antibiotics, further analgesics or even a tetanus prophylaxis might be appropriate.‚Å†  Commercial Use  Although the greater weever is sold commercially in France, where it is seen as a delicacy, it is often caught as by-catch.‚Å† ‚Å† If caught together with other by-catch fish it is often sold on markets in the category of mixed fish also called ‚Äúmorralla‚Äù or at least this is considered a practice in some parts of the Mediterranean.‚Å†  References   External links  * UKonline * Fishbase * Simpler info * UK Fishing species * Mike Ladle's Fishing diary * Marine life * Species * Category:Trachinus Category:Fish of the Mediterranean Sea Category:Fish of the Black Sea Category:Fish of the North Sea Category:Fish of the Baltic Sea Category:Fish of Europe Category:Fish described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Greater weever"},{"id":"7116205","text":"APM 08279+5255 is a very distant, broad absorption line quasar located in the constellation Lynx. It is magnified and split into multiple images by the gravitational lensing effect of a foreground galaxy through which its light passes. It appears to be a giant elliptical galaxy with a supermassive black hole and associated accretion disk. It possesses large regions of hot dust and molecular gas, as well as regions with starburst activity. Gravitational lensing APM 08279+5255 was initially identified as a quasar in 1998 during an Automatic Plate Measuring Facility (APM) survey to find carbon stars in the galactic halo. The combination of its high redshift (z=3.87) and brightness (particularly in the infrared) made it the most luminous object yet seen in the universe. It was suspected of being a gravitationally lensed object, with its luminosity magnified. Observations in the infrared with the NICMOS high- resolution camera on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) showed that the source was composed of three discrete images. Even accounting for the magnification, the quasar is an extremely powerful object, with a luminosity of 1014 to 1015 times the luminosity of the sun. Subsequent observations with the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph confirmed the presence of a third faint image between the two brighter images. Each component has the same spectral energy distribution and is an image of the quasar. Gravitational lensed systems with odd numbers of images are extremely rare; most contain two or four. Initially the magnification due to gravitational lensing was thought to be large, in the range of 40 to 90 times. After detailed observations at many wavelengths, the best model of the lensing galaxy is a tilted spiral galaxy. This gives a magnification of about 4. The additional observations led to a revised redshift of 3.911.  Galactic structure  APM 08279+5255 is a bright source at almost all wavelengths and has become one of the most studied of distant sources. Using interferometry it has been mapped in X-ray with the AXAF CCD Imaging Spectrometer on the Chandra X-ray Observatory, in infrared with the Hubble Space Telescope, and in radio with the Very Long Baseline Array. Measurements with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer and other instruments looked at the distribution of molecules such as CO, CN, HCN, and HCO+ as well as atomic carbon. From these observations APM 08279+5255 is a giant elliptical galaxy with large amounts of gas and dust and an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at its core. The AGN is radio-quiet with no evidence for a relativistic jet. It is powered by one of the largest known supermassive black holes: 23 billion solar masses (based on the molecular disk velocities); or alternatively 10 billion solar masses (based on reverberation mapping). The black hole is surrounded by an accretion disk of material spiraling into it, a few parsecs in size. Further out is a dust torus, a doughnut shaped cloud of dust and gas with a radius of about 100 parsecs. Both the accretion disk and dust torus appear to be almost face-on to us. The radiation from the molecular gas is coming from a flattened disk at the center of the galaxy with a radius of 550 pc. This is also the starburst region of the galaxy. The gas is heated both by activity in the AGN and by the newly forming stars. APM is an ultra- luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG). Its high redshift shifts the far-infrared spectrum into millimeter wavelengths where it can be observed from observatories on the ground. In 2008 and 2009 the intensities of its water vapor spectral lines were measured using the millimeter wave spectrometer Z-Spec at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. Comparing the spectrum to that of Markarian 231, another ULIRG, showed that it had 50 times the water vapor of that galaxy. This made it the largest mass of water in the known universe‚Äî100 trillion times more water than that held in all of Earth's oceans combined. Its discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the known universe for nearly its entire existence; the radiation was emitted 1.6 billion years after the Big Bang.

It originally aired on 12 October 1989. Plot Blackadder is feeling bored, so George suggests a Charlie Chaplin film to cheer him up, but Blackadder declines, citing his hatred of Chaplin. Baldrick gets a newspaper saying the Russian Revolution has started. The Russians have pulled out of the war as a result of the revolution. George is initially delighted, until he's reminded the Russians were on their side, and Blackadder is dismayed, since it will mean 'three- quarters of a million Germans leaving the Russian Front and coming over here with the sole purpose of using my nipples for target practice!'. Blackadder decides to desert, but is stopped when General Melchett comes into the trench as he ironically needs Blackadder to help him shoot some deserters. Melchett, reminding Blackadder of the French army mutinies the previous year, and the recent Russian uprising, is determined to prevent the same thing happening in the British Army. To prevent an uprising, he asks Captain Blackadder to organise a cabaret to boost the men's morale, something that Blackadder eagerly accepts when a possible tour is mentioned (which would allow him to leave the trenches). Melchett also asks his driver, Corporal \\"Bob\\" Parkhurst, to aid Blackadder. Blackadder immediately notices that \\"Bob\\" is a girl in disguise, something of which Melchett remains entirely unaware; however, Bob persuades Blackadder not to give the game away. The show, which features Baldrick's Charlie Chaplin impression (featuring a dead slug called Graham as Baldrick's \\"moustache\\"), which Melchett thinks is a slug-balancer, and Lieutenant George's drag act, \\"Gorgeous Georgina\\", is a success on its first night, but unfortunately Melchett falls in love with \\"Georgina\\", takes her to the Regimental Ball, and proposes to her. Worst of all, George accepts because he thought he might have been court-martialled for disobeying a superior officer. Blackadder is called to Melchett's office and it is revealed the marriage is to take place on Saturday and the General wants him to be his best man. Consequently, he informs Melchett that there is something wrong with Georgina. At first Melchett is worried she may be Welsh, but Blackadder then informs him of Georgina's \\"death\\" from stepping on a cluster of landmines. At first, Melchett mourns deeply for his \\"perfect woman\\", but seconds later, he recovers by saying \\"Oh well. Can't be helped. Can't be helped\\". He then refuses to continue the show, citing that Georgina was the only good thing about it, but Blackadder says he has already found a new leading lady. These words place Blackadder in \\"the stickiest situation since Sticky the stick insect got stuck on a sticky bun.\\" All of George's suggestions as to who to replace him as leading lady are rejected as being too short, too old or too dead. Baldrick offers to take up the role, but Blackadder quickly dismisses the idea (in truth, Baldrick's plan was to marry Melchett and be a Trojan Horse ‚Äì or 'frozen horse' as he refers to it ‚Äì to bring down the aristocracy). He then realises he has had a leading lady in his presence all the time and replaces George with Bob. In spite of Bob's more convincing and better received 'drag' act, and Baldrick's now seemingly \\"feeble impression of Buster Keaton\\", Melchett proclaims the second night's show a disaster, recognising Bob and still not realising she is a female, and immediately stops any possibility of a tour (and Blackadder leaving). He instead declares that with the arrival of the Americans into the war, morale will be boosted by endless showings of Charlie Chaplin films (with Blackadder as projectionist at a personal request from Chaplin himself which Darling reads out, much to his annoyance). Captain Darling revels in Melchett's displeasure with Blackadder, causing Blackadder to offer him a \\"liquorice allsort\\" (Baldrick's slug), which he accepts.

Marjory Gill was born in Bexleyheath, Kent. She was a cousin of Eric Gill and sister of Colin Gill. She was educated at Bedales School and University College, Reading, where she took a diploma course in horticulture. In 1921 she married Clifford Allen, a leading member of the Independent Labour Party who had been imprisoned as a conscientious objector in World War I. Marjory Allen worked as a landscape architect throughout the 1920s and 1930s and was elected the first fellow of the Institute of Landscape Architects in 1930. Clifford Allen, who had been created 1st Baron Allen of Hurtwood in 1932, died in 1939, and Lady Allen threw herself into her work, also becoming interested in the welfare of children. Her campaigning for children in institutional care led to the passing of the Children Act 1948. She was chairman (1942-1948) and president (1948-1951) of the Nursery School Association of Great Britain, founder president of the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education, a member of the Central Advisory Council for Education (1945-1949), and chairman of the Advisory Council on Children's Entertainment Films (1944-1950). During the Second World War, Lady Allen, with the support of the Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, with whom she was friends, established a scheme whereby waste material from the bomb sites were turned into children's toys. After World War II she served as a liaison officer with UNICEF in Europe and the Middle East. She campaigned for facilities for children growing up in the new high-rise developments in Britain's cities and wrote a series of illustrated books on the subject of playgrounds, and at least one book on adventure playgrounds, spaces for free creativity by children, which helped the idea spread worldwide.

Rantzau stood . Background and breeding Henri Tambareau purchased the Thoroughbred mare, Rancune, in 1943 for use as a broodmare. She had won several times on the racetrack, and came from good lines, including that of the famous jumping sire Bay Ronald. Rantzau's sire, Foxlight, was one of the best sons of the French stallion Haras du Pin, and also had the blood of Bay Ronald in his pedigree. After a notable career at the track, Foxlight retired to stud duty where he was quite successful, producing both flat racers and steeplechasers. His racing blood included that of Foxlaw (winner of the Ascot Gold Cup and Newmarket Jockey Club Stakes) and Foxhunter (winner of the Ascot Gold Cup). Career on the track As a three-year-old, Rantzau raced nine races between 2,000-3,000 meters, winning two and placing in five. He was then purchased by Marcel Boussac. Breeding career Marcel Boussac went on to sell Rantzau to the French National Stud at Saint-L√¥, and the stallion arrived at his new home in January 1951. When he first arrived, the stud inspector noted that he had: ‚Äúgood front extension, remarkably built through the shoulder and forearm, long haunches, this classy stallion of rare nobility also has low-placed joints and covers ground,\\" and later said he was \\"high off the ground, with slightly long cannon bones and slightly straight and interiorly bony hocks; but he has a very lovely look, a good frame, good muscle tone, a well-angled should and he is well muscled.\\" Between 1951 and 1962, Rantzau bred 40‚Äì49 mares a year, although these numbers dropped during the second half of his breeding career. However, he covered 772 mares during his 20 years at stud, averaging 38 each year. It was during this time that he was first recognized as a producer of jumping horses. In 1958, Rantzau was ranked 17th top showjumping producer, moving up to the 11th spot in 1962, and fifth in 1963. In 1964, Rantzau was ranked second leading producer of showjumpers, second only to the great Furioso. In 1970, a new ranking for \\"best sires of dams\\" was published, in which Rantzau was ranked 3rd, behind Ibrahim and Furioso. The next year, the year of his death, he was placed first. Although Ibrahim took the number-one spot again in 1973, Rantzau held onto fourth place in 1980, and again managed to rank number one in 1981, ten years after his death. Rantzau tended to produce sensitive, \\"difficult\\" horses, that were very athletic and generally excellent jumpers. Despite this reputation, riders of international calibre were interested in purchasing his offspring. Progeny *Cor de la Bryere: the most famous of Rantzau's sons.

Phnom Malai () is a mountain area in Malai District, Banteay Meanchey Province of Cambodia. The district became a Khmer Rouge stronghold and battleground through the 1980s and 1990s. Today it is a remote and sparsely populated border area with scattered settlements mostly made up of former rebels. History Refugees from refugee camps in Aranyaprathet, Thailand, were forcefully sent back across the border in 1980 to areas under Khmer Rouge control and many of them ended up in Phnom Malai. The process was organized by pro-Democratic Kampuchea cadres, but it was presented to the press as \\"voluntary\\". It was supported by the United States government, who took a dim view of the existing pro-Vietnamese Cambodian regime, as well as countries like Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, whose representative exhorted the disoriented refugees to \\"go back and fight.\\"Singapore‚Äôs Foreign Minister's comment; quoted in: Evans and Rowley, Red Brotherhood at War By 1981 Phnom Malai was not self-sufficient, the Khmer Rouge uniforms and weapons came from China, channeled through the Thai military, and the food from markets across the border in Thailand. In this period, the Khmer Rouge was able to rebuild its military, now titled the \\"National Army of Democratic Kampuchea\\" (NADK), as well as its infamous ruling party, the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), the sinister and shadowy \\"angkar\\", as the Party of Democratic Kampuchea. By mid-1980s, with the cooperation of the West and China, the Khmer Rouge had grown to about 35 to 50 thousand troops and committed cadres.Tom Fawthrop & Helen Jarvis, Getting away with genocide? Pol Pot lived in the Phnom Malai area, giving interviews in the early 1980s accusing all those who opposed him of being traitors and \\"puppets\\" of the Vietnamese until he disappeared from public view. In 1985, his \\"retirement\\" was announced, but he kept hiding somewhere close by, still pulling the Khmer Rouge strings of power.Kelvin Rowley, Second Life, Second Death: The Khmer Rouge After 1978 Phnom Malai was the location where in 1981 Pol Pot made his famous declarations denying guilt for the brutalities of the organization he led: ::[Pol Pot] said that he knows that many people in the country hate him and think he‚Äôs responsible for the killings. He said that he knows many people died. When he said this he nearly broke down and cried. He said he must accept responsibility because the line was too far to the left, and because he didn‚Äôt keep proper track of what was going on. He said he was like the master in a house he didn‚Äôt know what the kids were up to, and that he trusted people too much. For example, he allowed [one person] to take care of central committee business for him, [another person] to take care of intellectuals, and [a third person] to take care of political education.... These were the people to whom he felt very close, and he trusted them completely. Then in the end ... they made a mess of everything.... They would tell him things that were not true, that everything was fine, that this person or that was a traitor. In the end they were the real traitors. The major problem had been cadres formed by the Vietnamese.Quoted in David P.

Nothing is known of his early life. His primary notability is due to an encounter with the famed swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi. Miyamoto Musashi A few years after Tadamasa had established himself at Himeji as governor over the region, the famous Miyamoto Musashi opened a certain dojo in the town, and put up a sign that said, \\"Miyamoto Musashi, the number one adept of the sword in Japan.\\" After Lord Honda saw this, in his fury, he ordered his most skilled retainer, Gunbei, to be sent to teach Musashi that he was not truly the greatest of swordsmen. Miyake then visited Musashi, who kept him waiting for more than an hour. Miyake then said, \\"What an ill-mannered man! Keeping me waiting. Me, one of the principal vassals of the fief, whereas he is a warrior without a lord!\\". After Musashi came out to see Gunbei, Musashi replied to Gunbei, \\"If I had been informed that the purpose of your visit was for us to measure ourselves against each other in combat, I would have come sooner. Only I was in the midst of playing Go with a guest. Would you care to come out in the garden? I will leave the choice of weapons up to you, either a real sword or a wooden sword, as you prefer.\\". Miyake became very irritated after hearing these words from Musashi, but he recalled through his lord's orders that he was to test the abilities of Musashi, not to kill him. Before their duel began, Miyake cut a piece of bamboo that was within the garden and took it for his own weapon, while Musashi wielded his ordinary wooden sword. The combat ended in an instant, with Gunbei acknowledging that Musashi had lived up to his title. Gunbei then passed this information onto his lord.

However, if the pawn has advanced to its seventh rank it has possibilities of reaching a draw, and there are some drawn positions with the pawn on the sixth rank. This endgame arises most often from a race of pawns to promote. The side with the queen is the attacker and the side with the pawn the defender. Assume that the attacker has the move. If the pawn is not beyond its sixth rank, the attacker (to move) usually wins easily, but there are a few exceptions. The winning process is to either get the queen on a square in front of the pawn and getting the king over to help win the pawn or to check the defending king until it is forced in front of the pawn and using that tempo to bring the king closer, until it can assist in winning the pawn . After the pawn is won, the attacker has an elementary checkmate . Queen versus a pawn on the sixth rank The queen usually wins easily if the pawn is on the sixth rank. In the first position, Black is to move, but White wins. : 1... Kg2 : 2. Qg4+ Kf2 : 3. Kb7 Ke3 If Black plays 3...Ke2, White replies 4.Qe4+, forcing Black's king back in front of the pawn, and then advances his own king. : 4. Kc6 f2 : 5. Qd1 Kf4 : 6. Qf1 and White wins . Exceptions Exceptions can occur when the king blocks the queen on a file or diagonal, as in this position. : 1. Qh1+ Kb2! White needs to pin the pawn by 2. Qh8, but the king blocks the pin. :2. Qb7+ This was White's only check which prevents the pawn from advancing, and Black responds :2... Kc1! repeating the position. If the white king is anywhere else (other than h7 and h8), the queen can pin the pawn and allow for the queen and then the king to approach . Example The biggest problem for a queen versus a pawn on the sixth rank is when its own king gets in the way. In this position, the white king prevents the queen from getting on the a1 to h8 diagonal, to pin the pawn to prevent it from advancing. White actually wins by: :1. Qh6!! Now if : 1... c2 then :2. Qc1+ wins. If Black does not advance the pawn then the white queen can maneuver to pin the pawn along the diagonal, and wins easily. If instead, White tries what may seem to be correct: :1. Qh1+? a draw results with correct play (but there are many chances for losing moves). :1... Kb2! (1...Ka2 loses quickly to Qc1.) :2. Qb7+ (otherwise 2...c2 draws.) :2... Kc1! :3. Kf6! (White tries his best chance.) :3... c2 :4. Ke5 Kd2 :5. Qd5+!! Black has five replies. Four of them lose, but :5... Ke1! draws. :6. Qa5+ Kd1 (6...Ke2 loses to 7.Qa2.) :7. Qa4 Kd2 (7...Kc1 loses to 8.Qa2.) :8. Qa2 Kc3!! and White can make no progress . Example from game In this 1937 game between Vladimir Alatortsev and Vitaly Chekhover,Alatortsev vs. Chekhover White wins: :71... Ke3 :72. Qd5 Kf2 If 72...Ke2 then 73.Qe4+ Kf2 forces the Black king in front of the pawn. :73. Kd7 Kg3 :74. Ke6 f2 :75. Qh1! 1‚Äì0 . Queen versus a pawn on the seventh rank In order for the defending side to have a chance at a draw (with the other side to move), the pawn must be on its seventh rank and the king must be nearby (plus a few drawing positions with the pawn on the sixth rank, as above). Except for unusual cases, the attacking side wins if the pawn is a knight pawn (b- or g-files) or a central pawn (d- or e-files). For bishop pawns and rook pawns, the result also depends on the location of the attacking king. If the attacking king is close enough to the pawn, it wins; otherwise a draw results . First note that the attacker may win easily, depending on the location of the kings. In this position, White wins by 1. Qg5! followed by 2. Qc1, and then the white king is brought nearer to win the pawn. If the black king is on any other square around the pawn, the position is a draw, see below (position modified slightly) . Central pawn or knight pawn If the pawn is a central pawn or knight pawn (i.e. on the b, d, e, or g-file), the queen wins easily, except for a few unusual positions. In the position on the right, White wins. It takes several moves, but it is not difficult. : 1... Ke3 Black threatens to queen the pawn. White prevents this by forcing the black king in front of the pawn. : 2. Qh4 Kd2 3. Qd4+ Kc2 4. Qe3 Kd1 5. Qd3+ Ke1 Without the immediate threat of promotion, White has gained a tempo that can be used to bring his king closer. This process is repeated. : 6. Kc6 Kf2 7. Qd2 Kf1 8. Qf4+ Kg1 9. Qe3+ Kf1 10. Qf3+ Ke1 And now White can again bring his king closer. : 11. Kd5 Kd2 12. Qf2 Kd1 13. Qd4+ Kc2 14. Qe3 Kd1 15. Qd3+ Ke1 16. Ke4! Kf2 17. Qf3+ Ke1 18. Kd3 and White wins the pawn and then checkmates. The winning process with a knight pawn is the same . In some cases, the attacking king can block its own queen, as in the second diagram. If the white king is on d5, d6 or d7, the queen cannot approach the pawn, and the result is a draw . Rook pawn The process above does not work against a rook pawn. The reason is that when the king was forced in front of his pawn in other locations, he could move out the other side on the next move. With a rook pawn, this file is not available, and there can be a stalemate. In the first position, if the procedure above is tried, : 1. Qd4+ Kb1 : 2. Qb4+ Kc2 : 3. Qa3 Kb1 : 4. Qb3+ Ka1! and now the position is a stalemate unless White lets the black king back to the b-file. White can make no progress . White can win similar positions if his king is close enough to the pawn. In the second position, White's king is close enough to win ‚Äì by allowing the pawn to promote but then checkmating the king . White wins if the king is close enough to move to one of the squares marked with dots in two moves . : 1. Qf6+ Kb1 (if 1...Kc2 then 2.Qa1 wins) : 2. Qf1+ Kb2 : 3. Qe2+ Kb1 (3...Kb3 allows 4.Qe5 followed by 5.Qa1) : 4. Kc4! a1=Q : 5. Kb3 and White checkmates. If the white king was on e3, the win is simple: : 1. Qd2+ Kb1 : 2. Kd3 a1=Q : 3. Qc2# Bishop pawn A bishop pawn may also draw, but for a different reason (a different stalemate position). :1. Qb6+ Ka1! :2. Qd4+ Kb1 :3. Qb4+ Ka1 :4. Qc3+ Kb1 :5. Qb3+ Ka1! and White can not capture the pawn because stalemate would result . The rule is that White wins if his king is close enough to reach b3 or d2 in one move, because it can assist in checkmate . If the defending king is not on the side of the pawn near the corner and the attacking king is close enough, the game can still be won ‚Äì often by letting the pawn promote and then checkmating.

The audit is typically performed by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) and encompasses both financial and compliance components. The Single Audits must be submitted to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse along with a data collection form, Form SF-SAC. History Before implementing the Single Audit, the federal government relied on numerous audits carried out on individual federally funded programs to ensure these funds were spent properly. Because the government had numerous agencies awarding hundreds of different programs, the task of auditing all programs became increasingly difficult and time-consuming. To improve this situation, the Single Audit Act of 1984 standardized audit requirements for States, local governments, and Indian tribal governments that receive and use federal financial assistance programs.OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part I: Background, Purpose and Applicability; Background; pg. 1-1, par. 1 through 4 and pg. 1‚Äì2, par. 1 through 2 In 1985, the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued OMB Circular A-128, \\"Audits of State and Local Governments,\\" to help recipients and auditors implement the new Single Audit. In 1990, OMB administratively extended the Single Audit process to non-profit organizations by issuing OMB Circular A-133, \\"Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Organizations\\" which superseded OMB A-128. These new guides and provisions standardized the Single Audit in the United States to include all states, local governments, non- profit organizations, and institutions that receive federal funds from the US government.OMB Circular A-133 Subpart A ‚Äì General; ¬ß___.100 ‚Äì PurposeOMB Circular A-133 Title 1 ‚Äì Purpose On December 26, 2013, OMB issued the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, which standardized compliance and audit requirements for government entities, non-profit organizations and institutions of higher education. These consolidated requirements are codified in Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 200 with the single audit requirements in Subpart F of this section. The terms 2 CFR 200 and Uniform Guidance can be used interchangeably. Purpose and components The federal government provides an extensive array of federal assistance to recipients reaching over $400 billion annually. This assistance is provided through thousands of individual grants and awards annually for the purpose of benefiting the general public in the areas of education, health, public safety, welfare, and public works, among others. However, as a condition of receiving this assistance recipients must comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, as well as any particular provisions tied with the specific assistance.OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part I: Background, Purpose and Applicability; Overview of this Supplement; Internal Control; pg. 1‚Äì6, par. 5 The Single Audit provides the Federal government with assurance that these recipients comply with such directives by having an independent external source (the CPA) report on such compliance. However, it only applies to state, local government, and nonprofit recipients that expend $750,000 or more of such assistance in one year. A Single Audit encompasses an examination of a recipient's financial records, financial statements, federal award transactions and expenditures, the general management of its operations, internal control systems, and federal assistance it received during the audit period (the time period of recipient operations examined in the Single Audit, which is usually covers a natural or fiscal year).OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E ‚Äì Auditors; ¬ß___.500 ‚Äì Scope of Audit The Single Audit is divided into two areas: Compliance and Financial. The compliance component of a Single Audit covers the study and understanding (planning stage) as well as the testing and evaluation (exam stage) of the recipient with respect to federal assistance usage, operations and compliance with laws and regulations. The financial component is exactly like a financial audit of a non-federal entity which includes the audit of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Depending on the recipient, the Single Audit can be simple and straightforward, or it could be complex and troublesome. This is because there are millions of federal grants awarded each year to thousands of recipients, each with its own independent way of operating. Therefore, the Single Audit differs from recipient to recipient and from federal program to program. For these reasons, the federal government requires auditors to perform the compliance audit of a recipient with a planning stage and an exam stage. During the first stage, or planning stage, the auditor must study the recipient, determine whether there is a high or low risk that the recipient does not comply with laws and regulations, identify federal programs, and evaluate such programs. The second stage, or exam or audit stage, is where the auditor actually audits the federal assistance and programs. The planning stage is considered an integral part of the Single Audit because it allows the auditor to design and perform the audit based on the qualities, characteristics and needs of the recipient to be audited. Compliance audit: Planning stage Low- or high-risk auditee Before determining which federal programs to examine, the auditor must first determine, based on specific criteria, whether the recipient is a high-risk auditee or a low-risk auditee. A high-risk auditee is a recipient which has a high risk of not complying with federal laws and regulations, while a low-risk auditee is the exact opposite. The Uniform Guidance has set certain requirements a recipient must meet to be considered a low-risk auditee. This includes the following to be evaluated for each of the preceding two audit periods: * Single audits have been performed on an annual basis in prior years. * The auditor's opinions on the financial statements and the Schedule of Federal Expenditures (discussed later) were unmodified. * There are no material weaknesses identified. * The auditor did not report a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern. *None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two audit periods in which they were classified as Type A programs: **Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control for major programs; **A modified opinion on a major program in the auditor's report on major programs; or **Known or likely questioned costs that exceeded five percent of the total Federal awards expended for a Type A program during the audit period. The Uniform Guidance uses the high- and low-risk determination to regulate the dollar amount of federal expenditures to be audited. Although the actual work necessary for a Single Audit is established by the auditor, the OMB has set a limit for auditing high-risk and low-risk auditees. For high-risk auditees, the auditor is required to audit not less than 40% of all the federal assistance received during the year. For low-risk auditees, that limit is decreased to 20%. This determination affects the entire Single Audit because the auditor adjusts the scope of the audit accordingly. Since the auditor must provide an opinion to the federal government on whether the recipient and its programs complied with laws and regulations, the auditor performs sufficient procedures to confirm the opinion is correct.OMB A-133; Subpart E ‚Äì Auditors; ¬ß___.500 ‚Äì Scope of audit; section (d)(4) ‚Äì Compliance Identification of major programs  Step 1: Type A or Type B  To determine which federal programs to audit under the compliance audit, federal assistance expended by the recipient (also called federal expenditures) during one year is identified by federal program name, Federal agency and CFDA number. These federal expenditures are then combined to determine the total amount expended during the year. Any recipient whose total federal expenditures during a year equal or exceed $750,000 requires a Single Audit. If the recipient does not meet this threshold, a Single Audit is not required, although the recipient may elect to have a program-specific audit (an audit of a single federal program, without auditing the entire entity). Once this determination is performed, requires that federal programs be categorized in two groups: Type A programs and Type B programs. =Type A program= A Type A program is any federal program within a recipient that meets the following criteria. * If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than or equal to $750,000 and less than or equal to $25million, then any program that expends more than $750,000 is Type A. * If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $25million and less than or equal to $100million, then any program that expends more than 3% of total federal awards is Type A. * If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $100million and less than or equal to $1billion, then any program that expends more than $3million is Type A. * If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $1billion and less than or equal to $10billion, then any program that expends more than 0.3% of total federal awards is Type A. * If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $10billion and less than or equal to $20billion, then any program that expends more than $30million is Type A. * If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $20billion, then any program that expends more than 0.15% of total federal awards is Type A. In other words, if a recipient expended a total of $25million or less in federal assistance, then any single program which expended $750,000 or more is considered a Type A. If a recipient expended $30million in federal assistance, then any single program which expended $900,000 or more (3% √ó $30million) is considered a Type A program. Special consideration must be given to large loan programs in determining the Type A threshold. =Type B program= A Type B program is any single program which does not meet the Type A requirements. =Examples= Example 1: The City of Example operates a Section 8 program, and expended $950,000 in Section 8 funds and $5,000,000 of total federal assistance during the year. Since this amount does not exceed $25,000,000, the Section 8 program is considered a Type A program because $950,000 exceeds the $750,000 threshold. Example 2: Using the same data in Example 1 with the exception that the City of Example now expended a total of $30,000,000 in federal assistance, the Section 8 program would meet the Type A threshold because $950,000 is greater than $30,000,000 x 3% ($900,000). Example 3: Using the same data in Example 1 with the exception that the City of Example now expended a total of $100,000,000 in federal assistance, the Section 8 program would not meet the Type A threshold because $950,000 is less than $3 million, and would be considered a Type B program. Steps 2 and 3: Risk assessment After determining which programs are Type A and Type B, the Uniform Guidance requires that the auditor study and understand the operations and internal controls of such programs within the entity, and performOMB Circular A-133; Subpart E ‚Äì Auditors; ¬ß___.520 ‚Äì Major program determination; section (c) ‚Äì Step 2 and documentOMB Circular A-133; Subpart E ‚Äì Auditors; ¬ß___.520 ‚Äì Major program determination; section (g) ‚Äì Documentation of risk a risk assessment based on such study to determine whether each program has either a high or low risk of not complying with laws and regulations. Auditor may consider numerous factors including current and prior audit experience, good or poor internal controls over Federal programs, many or no prior audit findings, continuous or lack of oversight exercised by the federal government over the recipient, evidence or knowledge of fraud, and the inherent risk of the Federal program.OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E ‚Äì Auditors; ¬ß___.525 ‚Äì Criteria for Federal program risk For a Type A program to be considered low risk according to , it must have been audited as a major program at least once in the past two years and must not have had: * Material weaknesses in internal control * A modified opinion in the audit report * Known or likely questioned costs exceeding 5% of total federal award expenditures For any Type A program considered to be a high risk of not complying, the Uniform Guidance requires that the auditor to perform a compliance audit on that program.OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E ‚Äì Auditors; ¬ß___.520 ‚Äì Major program determination; section (e) ‚Äì Step 4 For a Type A program that is considered to be of low risk, then the auditor is not required to perform a compliance audit, although the Uniform Guidance allows the auditor to do so if he/she chooses to. Although the risk assessment is performed by the auditor based on his/her judgment, the Uniform Guidance does have two requirements for a program to be considered low risk. In assessing the risk of Type B programs, auditors should use professional judgement and criteria established in the Uniform Guidance. According to , a minimum number of Type B programs must be identified as high risk, calculated as 25% of the number of low-risk Type A programs (rounded up). In assessing risk, auditors are encouraged to use an approach that allows different programs to be identified as high risk over time. The auditor is not expected to perform risk assessments on smaller Type B programs with expenditures that do not exceed 25% of the Type A threshold determined in step 1. Type B programs which have a low risk of not complying are not required to be audited.  Step 4: Major program determination and percentage of coverage  High-risk Type A and high-risk Type B programs are considered major programs and must be audited. The auditor then totals all of the federal award expenditures for the identified major programs and divides by the total federal award expenditures for the entity as a whole. For low-risk auditees, major program expenditures as a percentage of total award expenditures must be at least 20%. For high-risk auditees, the required coverage percentage is increased to 40%. If the identified major programs do not meet the required coverage percentage, then the auditor must select additional programs to audit until the required coverage percentage is met. Compliance audit: exam stage After the auditor determines which federal programs to audit, the auditor performs a compliance audit that scrutinizes operations of the program‚Äîexamining files, documents, contracts, checks, etc. The auditor investigates, to some degree, transactions between the federal program and other parties. These functions are compared with the laws and regulations applicable to a program to see if they complied or not. The examination does not require observing every single document and every single process generated by the program, nevertheless the auditor is required to perform enough procedures to form an opinion on whether the program (as a whole) complied with laws and regulations.OMB A-133; Subpart E ‚Äì Auditors; ¬ß___.500 ‚Äì Scope of audit; section (d) ‚Äì Compliance Due to the amount of federal regulations, the federal government has provided certain guides and literature to assist the auditor in the examination, which includes the OMB Compliance Supplement and the Compliance requirements: OMB compliance supplement The OMB Compliance Supplement is a large and extensive guide created by the OMB for Single Audits, and is considered the most important tool of both the auditor and the recipient when performing, or being subject to, a Single Audit. It was created following amendments in 1996 to the Single Audit Act and serves to identify existing important compliance requirements that the Federal Government expects to be considered as part of a Single Audit. Without it, auditors would need to research thousands of laws and regulations for each single program of a recipient to determine which compliance requirements are important to the Federal Government. For Single Audits, the Supplement replaces any agency audit guides and other audit requirement documents for individual Federal programs. Compliance requirements Compliance requirements are series of directives provided by Federal agencies that summarize hundreds of laws and regulations applicable to federal assistance and are important to the successful management of such assistance. The OMB created 14 basic and standard compliance requirements for which recipients must always comply with when receiving and using federal assistance, and provided detailed explanations, discussions, and guidance about them in the OMB Compliance Supplement.OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part III: Compliance Requirements These compliance requirements only serve as guidelines for compliance with the specific laws and regulations applicable to the assistance and their objectives are designed to be generic in nature, because of the amount of different federal programs provided by the government. For example, many federal programs have eligibility requirements for individuals or organizations to participate in such programs because they have been established by either laws, regulations, or contract provisions. However, while the criterion for determining eligibility varies from program to program, the objective of the Eligibility compliance requirement that \\"only eligible and qualified individuals or organizations participate\\" is consistent and universal across all federal assistance programs. This eligibility universal criteria is called the Eligibility compliance requirement.OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part III: Compliance Requirements, pg. 3-E-1, Eligibility Financial audit The Single Audit requires that a recipient prepare financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The Single Audit also requires that a financial audit be performed on the recipient that includes the federal assistance operations as well as the non-federal assistance operations. Tests of transactions and account balances are performed to ensure that the information presented in the financial statements, and notes thereof, are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Additionally, the recipient must prepare a Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA), which is supplementary information to the financial statements unique to recipients of federal assistance that details all the federal assistance expended by the recipient during the year, categorized by federal program.OMB A-133; Subpart C ‚Äì Auditees; ¬ß___.310 ‚Äì Financial Statements; section (b) ‚Äì Schedule of Federal Expenditures The auditor must then audit and report on this Schedule \\"in relation to\\" the financial statements as a whole. Data Collection Form and Reporting Package After the Single Audit is concluded, the recipient prepares two documents: a \\"Data Collection Form\\" and a \\"Reporting Package\\". The data collection form, Form SF-SAC, is a standard form which is basically a summary of the Single Audit. It includes details of the auditor, a list of the federal programs audited, and a summary of any audit findings reported by the auditor. The Reporting Package includes all the auditor's final reports along with the recipient's financial statements. It includes:OMB A-133; Subpart C ‚Äì Auditees; ¬ß___.320 ‚Äì Report submission; section (c) ‚Äì Reporting Package * Auditor's reports * Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A;) ‚Äì This serves as an introduction to the recipient's financial statements where the recipient's management (e.g., governors, in the case of states; mayors, in the case of cities; president, in the case of many nonprofit organizations) discusses the results of operations and other financial information, offering insight and detailed description about the recipient itself. * Recipient's financial statements ‚Äì This contains the financial statements required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which includes the Government- wide statements as well as the Fund Financial Statements. * Recipient's notes to the financial statements ‚Äì This includes any notes and disclosures for the financial statements as required by US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). * Supplemental Information ‚Äì This section includes both financial and non-financial information relative to the recipient which is not covered in the MD&A; or the financial statements and their respective notes. * Schedule of Federal Award Expenditures ‚Äì This document details all federal assistance expenditures made by the recipient during the audit period, categorized by the federal program and federal agency. * Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs ‚Äì If the auditor finds situations where the recipient did not comply with laws and regulations, where internal controls are deficient, or a situation of illegal acts or fraud, the auditor is required to report such situations in this section, as well as any questioned costs. Questioned costs are amounts that the recipient expended, but which the auditor has determined that they were not permitted and must be returned to the federal government.OMB A-133; Subpart E ‚Äì Auditors; ¬ß___.505 ‚Äì Audit reporting * Schedule of Prior Audit Findings ‚Äì In this section, the auditor is required to follow up and report about the recipient's corrective action of any audit findings reported in prior years.

On June 18, 2020, the Office of Management and Budget issued a memo, stating that extensions are no longer allowed for organizations with 2020 year-ends because, \\"during the Coronavirus pandemic, many recipients learned the capabilities and are now getting the experience to perform the objectives of the Federal programs remotely with limited access to their physical office.\\" Auditor responsibility The auditor is responsible for conducting the actual audit of the recipient in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS)OMB A-133; Subpart E ‚Äì Auditors; ¬ß___.500 ‚Äì Scope of audit; section (a) ‚Äì General and using the guidance provided by the OMB Circular A-133 and its Compliance Supplement, all of which establish certain rules to follow during the Single Audit. The auditor must establish audit objectives that determine whether the recipient complied with laws and regulations. They must research the recipient's federal assistance awards and programs to determine applicability of specific laws and regulations. They must understand the recipient, its organization, operations, internal control systems, and ability to responsibly manage federal assistance. They must perform audit procedures (some of which are suggested by the Compliance Supplement) to meet these audit objectives. The auditor must understand the recipient's internal control system to determine if the recipient has proper safeguards that help manage federal assistance responsibly. After obtaining sufficient knowledge of that system, the auditor must perform audit procedures to verify the recipient's internal control system works properly, and the recipient's federal program operations comply with laws and regulations (e.g., the compliance audit portion of the Single Audit).OMB A-133; Subpart E ‚Äì Auditors; ¬ß___.500 ‚Äì Scope of audit; section (c) ‚Äì Internal controlThe Single Audit Act, AICPA As part of the Single Audit, the auditor must prepare and submit three individual reports to the recipient and to the federal government. The first report is an opinion, or a disclaimer thereof, on whether the recipient's financial statements are presented in conformity with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, identical to a financial audit's report on a non-recipient entity. The second report is about the status of internal controls relative to the financial statements and major programs. The third report is an opinion, or a disclaimer thereof, on the degree to which the recipient has complied with laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the federal assistance awards. Following the last two reports, if the Single Audit produced audit findings, the auditor must prepare the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs discussed earlier. The auditor's judgment is necessary to determine which audit procedures are sufficient to achieve the audit objectives, and whether additional or alternative audit procedures are needed to achieve such objectives. The auditor is responsible for determining the nature, timing, and extent of the audit procedures necessary to meet the audit objectives (i.e., it is the auditor who determines the necessary amount of his/her audit work needed to form an opinion on whether the recipient complied with laws and regulations).

Many eukaryotic guanylyl transferases are capping enzymes that catalyze the formation of the 5' cap in the co-transcriptional modification of messenger RNA. Because the 5' end of the RNA molecule ends in a phosphate group, the bond formed between the RNA and the GTP molecule is an unusual 5'-5' triphosphate linkage, instead of the 3'-5' linkages between the other nucleotides that form an RNA strand. In capping enzymes, a highly conserved lysine residue serves as the catalytic residue that forms a covalent enzyme- GMP complex.Fresco LD, Buratowski S. (1994).

His family was affiliated with the Radical Civic Union, but at the age of 27 Gorriar√°n Merlo joined the Trotskyist Workers Revolutionary Party (PRT), and then cofounded its armed wing, the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP). He continued to be a leader of the PRT and the ERP through to the beginning of the Argentine Dirty War, spanning the governments of H√©ctor Jos√© C√°mpora (1973), Juan Per√≥n, and Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n, the last of which was cut short by the coup that started the National Reorganization Process (1976). Prior to joining the insurgency around 1970, he lived in Rosario, 70 km from his birthplace, and worked for two years in the Swift meat packing plant. In an interview he alleged that insurgent organizations gained thousands of recruits in the area at the time. There, Gorriar√°n Merlo led the first armed attack by ERP, the capture of Police Station No. 24, in 1971. Soon afterwards, he was captured and imprisoned in Rawson, Chubut. He was part of the group of insurgents that organized the prison break that occurred during the night of 15 August 1972. Only six out of 110 were able to make a successful escape; 19 were recaptured and 16 were executed (see Trelew massacre). The successful ones, Gorriar√°n Merlo among them, fled to Chile, at that time under the Socialist administration of Salvador Allende, and from there were granted safe passage to Cuba. He returned to Argentina a few months later. In January 1974, he took part in the attack on the army barracks in Azul, Buenos Aires Province, where a Lieutenant Colonel and his wife were killed. After the fall of Isabel Per√≥n in March 1976, the largely defeated ERP fled the country in order to reorganize itself. Gorriar√°n Merlo moved to Nicaragua to collaborate with the Sandinistas, and in 1980 he was involved in the assassination of the deposed Nicaraguan President, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, who was living in exile in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay.El Ortiba. Enrique Gorriar√°n Merlo (1941-2006) (profile and interviews).

Gorriar√°n Merlo was arrested in Mexico in 1995. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 and spent eight years in the Devoto prison.

The broadcast signal, based from a transmitter in Montgomery's northeast side, can be heard as far away as Birmingham, Alabama, and is generally clear south of there along Interstate 65. The home of The Wake Up Crew with Gordie & April in the Morning, The Adam Bomb Show in Middays, John Garrett in the afternoon and the Zach Sang Show at night! History The station first operated in downtown Montgomery. During the late 1960s the station moved from the Frank Leu Building downtown, into a house on Norman Bridge Road. A broadcast wing was added to the back of the building in the early 1970s. The original \\"WHHY\\" was an AM station (1440 AM) owned by Holt/Robinson. The FM station on 101.9 was an automated FM country music station before becoming a rock station. It would be known as \\"The Music FM - Y-102\\". The FM station would simulcast the AM's morning show (06:00-10:00) hosted by longtime personality and program director Larry Stevens. This was followed on AM by Kris O'Kelly (10:00-14:00), \\"The Thin Man\\" (14:00-18:00), music director Lanny West (18:00-22:00) Jeffry Tilden (22:00-02:00) and public relations director Mike Sanders (02:00-06:00). During the 1970s Y-102 would split from the AM at 10 am each morning and would broadcast light classic rock (Elton John, ELO, Billy Joel, Bob Seger, etc.) The AM was CHR. In the early 1980s, the FM became the focus station of the pair. The FM was changed to CHR. The AM format was changed to adult contemporary. During the 1990s Holt/Robinson broadcasting began to have money problems. Longtime morning show host Larry Stevens exited to rival Colonial Broadcasting. The format was shifted to \\"New Rock\\" and known as \\"Live 101.9\\". In May 1993, Holt-Robinson Communications Corporation was placed into receivership. Thomas M. Duddy was approved by the FCC as receiver on June 21, 1993. In May 1995, receiver Thomas M. Duddy made a deal to sell this station to McDonald Investment Company, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on July 3, 1995, and the transaction was consummated on September 15, 1995. McDonald in turn sold it to Cumulus Broadcasting. The FM station's format was changed to country music by McDonald then back to CHR by Cumulus. The AM had several formats, including late 1970s AC with Larry King overnights and oldies. Cumulus Broadcasting changed the format of the AM to talk (\\"News Radio 1440\\") and ended the heritage call letters WHHY. The station was reassigned the heritage WHHY-FM call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on January 22, 1999.

He has also written a book on his experiences, titled Leap into Darkness. He escaped seven times during the Holocaust. Life Leo Bretholz was born in Vienna, Austria, on March 6, 1921. His father, Max Bretholz, was a Polish immigrant who worked as a tailor and died in 1930. His Mother, Dora (Fischmann) Bretholz, also Polish, was born in 1891 and worked as a seamstress. He had two younger sisters, Henny and Edith (Ditta). After the Anschluss in March 1938, many of his relatives were arrested. At his mother's insistence, Bretholz fled on a train to Trier, Germany, where he was met by a smuggler. He swam across the Sauer River into Luxembourg, where he spent five nights in a Franciscan monastery. Bretholz was arrested two days later in a coffee shop and chose to be taken to the Belgian border over arrest or being sent back to Germany. On November 11, 1938 he arrived in Antwerp, Belgium, where he stayed for a peaceful eighteen months, and went to a public trade school to become an electrician as an alternative to being sent to an internment camp. During that time, Bretholz learned to speak Dutch. On May 9, 1940, he entered a hospital in Antwerp to have surgery on a hernia, but Antwerp was bombed the next morning before he could be operated on. Upon being discharged from the hospital, he was arrested as an enemy alien. Now that the war had reached Antwerp, being an Austrian ‚Äì and thus, because of the Anschluss, German ‚Äì citizen, Bretholz became an enemy to Belgium. He was sent to St. Cyprien, an internment camp near the Spanish border. His friend Leon Osterreicher came to visit him and instructed him to escape by climbing under the camp's fence. While living with distant relatives nearby, he was sent to an assigned residence in Cauterets, France, near the Pyrenees Mountains, where he stayed for eight to ten months until on August 26, 1941, when the deportation began from this town. Upon a warning from the mayor of Luchon, he hid with his uncle overnight in the Pyrenees, returning the next day to find half of the ghetto's population deported. With his cousin Albert Hershkowitz he walked across the Swiss border in October 1942 under the name Paul Meunier, only to be stopped by a Swiss mountain patrol and sent back to France. There he was sent to the Rivesaltes internment camp, where he remained for two weeks before being sent to Drancy, a large-scale deportation camp in the suburbs of Paris. On November 5, 1942, Bretholz was deported on convoy 42 with 1000 others headed for Auschwitz. With his friend Manfred Silberwasser he escaped through the window and leaped off the train. Staying with two priests on subsequent nights, he and Manfred were given train tickets to Paris with a new set of false identification papers, this time under the name Marcel Dumont. Upon crossing into the Southern region (Vichy France), he was arrested again for abandoning his assigned residence. He spent nine months in prison, one month of which was in solitary confinement for having escaped for two days. He was released in September 1943, and was then sent to Septfonds labor camp for one month. In October 1943, Leo Bretholz was taken with thirteen other men to the Toulouse train station en route to the Atlantic coast to build fortifications. At this layover, he spent hours to bend the bars, then climbed out of the train window and escaped into the city of Toulouse. In Toulouse his friend Manfred sent a third set of false papers, this time under the name Max Henri Lefevre. Bretholz joined the Jewish Resistance Group Compagnons De France, known as \\"La Sixieme\\", so he could travel freely throughout France. He was assigned to Limoges, a city in south- central France. On May 8, 1944, his hernia ruptured and he collapsed on a Limoges park bench and was sent by a passerby to a hospital, where he had surgery. After spending seventeen days in the hospital, he returned for his dressings to be changed. Finally, Bretholz rejoined the underground movement, and remained in Limoges until departing on a ship for New York on January 19, 1947. Together with his aunt and uncle he moved to Baltimore, Maryland on January 29 and immediately sought work as a handyman, working in textiles, and traveling around the Mid-Atlantic. He moved into his own apartment with his friend Freddie, and met his wife Florine (n√©e Cohen) in November 1951; they married in July 1952. Bretholz had his first child, Myron, in 1955 and later had two daughters, named Denise and Edie. He received death notifications of his two sisters and mother in 1962, who had been deported to Auschwitz in April 1942, after which he had not heard from them. It was at this point he began to speak publicly about his experiences during the war. In 1968 he went into the retail book business. He lived in the Netherlands with his family for two years, and co-wrote an autobiography, Leap into Darkness, with Michael Olesker. Leo Bretholz appeared in the documentary films, Survivors Among Us, and See You Again Soon. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1787794/ Until his death in 2014, he lived in Pikesville, Maryland, and was a regular speaker at a range of venues, including the annual Holocaust Remembrance Project, and a number of schools.  Fight for SNCF Reparations  Prior to his death, Leo Bretholz fought for reparations from SNCF, the French rail company that transported Jews to Nazi concentration and death camps. When the class action lawsuit refused to be heard by the Supreme Court, the lower court ruling that the case was outside US jurisdiction stood and the case died. When his home state of Maryland proposed a high speed rail line, he testified in the state legislature against permitting SNCF to bid on the project.

The band first received broad attention when one of its songs was featured in an episode of Grey's Anatomy in 2005. The band released one EP and two full-length albums during its career. History The band was founded by New Orleans guitarists Grant Widmer and Ted Joyner. The band started in 2002, Grant and Ted's junior year at Louisiana State University, when the two former high school friends enlisted drummer Greg Gauthreaux and bass player Brian Waits to form \\"The Double Zeros\\". Singer Ashlin Phillips auditioned for the band in December 2002, after work had begun writing and practicing for the band's first gig. The band's name honors famed designers Charles and Ray Eames. By 2003 the now complete lineup became \\"The Eames Era\\" and had begun recording a 3-track demo in Grant's garage. Later that year the band signed on to the C Student Records label to release their first single \\"Could Be Anything\\" April 2004. After winning an award at the university's annual independent film festival they embarked on their first tour along the East Coast. Upon returning the band released \\"The Second EP\\" on the C Student label. The album's lead track on the EP, \\"Could Be Anything\\", was featured on the Abercrombie & Fitch website and two television shows (Grey's Anatomy and Falcon Beach), and received major airplay on college radio stations nationwide. In October 2005, shortly after graduating from Louisiana State University, the band released their full- length debut \\"Double Dutch\\". The week of the album's release, the band's tour bus got in an accident with a military truck on the way home from a photo shoot, thus cancelling a tour booked for November that year. The military truck was only in the area for providing Hurricane Katrina aid.The Eames Era, Spin (magazine), October 20, 2005 In 2007, the Eames Era won $2500 in the Yaris SXSW band video contest. In April 2007, the band released its second full-length album, \\"Heroes and Sheroes.\\" The song \\"When You Were a Millionaire\\" from that album was featured on MTV's new reality show \\"I'm from Rolling Stone,\\" running at the beginning and end of each of the ten episodes. That song as well as \\"Watson On Your Side\\" have videos made by Untucked Films. In April 2008, Grant Widmer wrote music blog The Rockist Society to let them know the band had decided to go their separate ways: > That's right, The Eames Era are no more. Ashlin and Greg moved to Chicago in > the past few months and they are on to other things. Ted, Brian and I have > also moved to New Orleans and we are hard at work on a new album.

The display driver will typically accept commands and data using an industry-standard general-purpose serial or parallel interface, such as TTL, CMOS, RS232, SPI, I2C, etc. and generate signals with suitable voltage, current, timing and demultiplexing to make the display show the desired text or image. The display driver may itself be an application-specific microcontroller and may incorporate RAM, Flash memory, EEPROM and/or ROM. Fixed ROM may contain firmware and display fonts. A notable example of a display driver IC is the Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller. Other controllers are KS0108, SSD1815 (graphics capable) and ST7920 (graphics capable) History The use of integrated circuit technology to drive a display driver chip dates back to the late 1960s. In 1969, Hewlett-Packard introduced the HP Model 5082-7000 Numeric Indicator, an early LED display and the first LED device to use integrated circuit technology. Its development was led by Howard C. Borden, Gerald P. Pighini, and Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla, at HP Associates and HP Labs, who had engaged in research and development (R&D;) on practical LEDs between 1962 and 1968. It was the first intelligent LED display, making it a revolution in digital display technology, replacing the Nixie tube and becoming the basis for later LED displays. In the early 21st century, display driver chips are widely used for mobile displays in smartphones and other smart devices as well as larger flat-panel displays.

It is the capital of the rayon Ordubad District. Ordubad is a medieval city of the Caucasus and in its current capacity of a town was founded in the 18th century. The town is divided into five districts: the Ambaras, the Kurdtatal, the Mingis, the Sar sheher, and the Uch. Ordubad is known as the ‚Äúpearl‚Äù of Nakhchevan province and is well known for its exports of fruits and spices, and for its cuisine. Etymology Ordubad is a name of Turco-Persian origin and means \\"army town\\" (from Turkic ordu (army) and Persian bad (town)), which implies that the city was founded during the period of the Mongol or the ensuing Il-Khanid rule. The historian and geographer Hamdallah Mustawfi (1281‚Äì1349) mentions Ordubad in the mid-14th century as \\"a provincial town, one of the five towns making up the tumƒÅn of Nakhchivan, with fine gardens, and producing good grapes, corn and cotton\\". French traveller Jean Saint-Martin mentions, in his 1818 book about the geography of Armenia, that the contemporary people referred to the city as Ordouvar () or Ourdovar () in Armenian, and Ardoubad in Turkish and Persian, and that the settlement had already existed in the 14th century. Location The Ordubad city, known as the ‚Äúpearl‚Äù of Nakhchevan province, is located at an elevation of . It is in the northern bank of the central stretch of the Araxes (Aras) river of the eastern Transcaucasia which earlier belonged to Persia, now in Azerbaijan. the second largest town.USSR: Administrative Territorial Division of the Union Republics, Moscow, 1977 The Ordubad Province itself has an area of and is delimited by Iran on the south, Armenia forming the north and west border, and the Julfa region of Nakhchivan bordering the east. The river that rises from the north from the Mt. QobƒÅn (also known as Tk. Qap√Øj√Øq, Rus. Kapudzhukh or Kapydzhik) at an elevation of drains into the Araxes. The town is divided into five districts of the Ambaras, the Kurdtatal, the Mingis, the Sar sheher, and the Uch. The city has a large number of walnut and mulberry trees. The closest railway station is Ordubad and the distance to Nakhchivan city is . Tabriz is away to the north-northwest. Demographics In 1999 the population of the city was reported as 5,000. Most of the population belonged to the Shiite Muslim sect with Armenians and Russians forming a minority. History sarshahar square The city may have been established by the 14th century, or earlier. The Ottoman Empire (1299‚Äì1923) had occupied the Ordubad territory in the past. Before this occupation, a local rebellion had been organized against invasion of the Ottomans by Hadji, known as ‚ÄúKasab‚Äù (butcher) and Bayandar when they came to know that Saffavids were to launch an attack. They were backed by the local people. The rebels initially took control of the city and also occupied a fortress near the city. However, the rebels had their own internal dissensions, and as a result a small battalion of the Ottoman army defeated the rebels and killed them. Following this victory and occupation by the Ottomans, Khaten bey Ordubadi, the prime vizier, appealed to the Shah to waive off all taxes levied on the local people, which was agreed. Ordubad was once an important regional stop on the caravan route of the Silk Road trade with China, Europe and India. The city was first founded as Gala city, a feudal city, on the top of the Ambras on the left bank of Ordubadchay River in the 15th century. In view of extensive trade, the city started developing on the right bank of the Ordubadchay with many new districts. In the 17th and 18th centuries trade centres were established in the city on the right bank, which diminished the importance of Gala city. Built in the backdrop of Zangezur Caucasus mountain it is enclosed on three sides by mountains providing for a very green environment. In the 17th century the city underwent major reconstruction activity, maintaining eastern feudal architectural features. Following the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828), the town passed from Iranian rule to Imperial Russian rule under the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828. According to a census conducted in 1834, Ordubad, with its 52 villages, had a population of 11,341 consisting of Muslims and Armenians. The Ordubad site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on 24 October 2001 in the Cultural category under Criteria (i), (iv) and (v). Archaeological excavations Archaeological excavations carried out by Russian archaeologists in ancient settlements of Ordubad have unearthed remnants of Bronze Age dated to the fourth century. It includes a necropolis, which revealed graves of warriors also dated to the fourth century. These were initially assessed, in 1928, as skeletons of only warrior men but subsequent research carried out by the Archaeological and Ethnological Institute of Azerbaijan National Academy of Science in 2004 has concluded that at least one of the skeletons is of a woman warrior found with her armory such as quiver, arrows and helmet. Economy Ordubad economy is dependent on trading particularly of fruits, wheat, and silk; grapes are of 40 varieties. The silk exports have been mostly to Venice, Marseille, Amsterdam and many other places in Europe, from the middle of the 16th century. During the early years of the 20th century the Ordubad silk received 13 gold medals in the international exhibitions and fairs. Arak is also an export commodity of the city. Economic activity in Ordubad and near by regions includes copper mining, Paragachayskoe molybdenum deposit from the Meghri-Ordubad gratoidnym batholiths, bauxite, tungsten and tin ore.  Industry  21 industrial plants operated in the region in 2015. The average number of people working for industry is 634. The cost of industrial products was 8469,7 thousand manat in 2015. Its rate is 4.8 times more than the level in 2005. There are 9 milk processing plants in Ordubad. The daily production rate is 24 ton. Besides, the wine plant Oren- Gala\\" produces pomegranate juice. Features of the city A view of Ordubad In the new city of Ordubad, planned in the 17th century, there were five divisions or districts with trade squares of larger size than the earlier blocks, which also had a plethora of mosques, springs, and bath-houses. The medieval market square in the heart of the city is prominent and the glass mosque, the C√ºm…ô Mosque, is a landmark. Caravan sheds and the market here traded in silk and dry fruits with East European countries. The lay out of the streets is radial and appears in the shape of a fan close to the center of the city.

The German Football Association lists Erhardt in the top 20 best German defenders of all time, and Bayern Munich included him in their best 16 in a team made up in the 1980s of famous past players. Erhard started out as a full back before being used as a half back by the mid-1950s. He then settled in the center half position by the end of the 1950s. He earned 50 caps for the West Germany national team, and was a member of the German team which won the 1954 FIFA World Cup. He also participated in two other World Cups, in 1958 and 1962. Although Erhard did not play in the 1954 World Cup, coach Sepp Herberger toyed with the idea of changing his defense by adding Erhardt as the left back in the final game against Hungary instead of Werner Kohlmeyer, but eventually decided to keep the same lineup as in the semifinal against Austria.Bitter, J√ºrgen.

In other words, it provides the basis and principles recipients must adhere to when spending federal funds.A-133 Sup Part 3 (2013); Section B -- Allowable Costs / Cost Principles, pg. 3-B-1. The federal government categorizes recipient types into three groups: * State, local, and Indian tribal governments * Institutions of higher education * Non-profit organizations Prior to December 26, 2014, each group has a separate set of cost principles to follow. The cost principles applicable to a recipient type apply to all federal assistance received by that entity, regardless of whether the awards are received directly from the federal government or indirectly through a pass-through entity. The OMB issues a Cost Principle Circular for each category. This is a guide for spending federal assistance in accordance with laws and regulations: * OMB Circular A 87, ‚ÄúCost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments‚Äù (2 CFR part 225) ‚Äì This circular includes the 50 States of the United States and the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.), any agency or instrumentality of these governments‚Äîand any county, parish, municipality, city, town, State-designated Indian tribal government, school district, United States territories and possessions, and any agency or instrumentality of these governments. * OMB Circular A-21, ‚ÄúCost Principles for Educational Institutions‚Äù (2 CFR part 220) - All institutions of higher education (e.g., Colleges, Universities, etc.) are subject to the cost principles contained in this circular. * OMB Circular A-122, ‚ÄúCost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations‚Äù (2 CFR part 230) - Non-profit organizations are subject to this circular, except those non-profit organizations listed in OMB Circular A-122, Attachment C that are subject to the commercial cost principles contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The three circulars list various types of cost or expense item (such as travel expense, maintenance expense, payroll salaries, lobbying costs, purchase of materials, payment of utility bills, etc.), and establishes whether each is either allowable or unallowable. Allowable costs are those the federal government determines permissible for federal assistance. Unallowable costs are those the government prohibits incurring for federal assistance. Certain cost items are considered universally unallowable, such as cost related to illegal activities and lobbying costs, but others may be considered unallowable for a type of recipient while being allowable for another type of recipient. As a general rule, any assistance used inappropriately, such as incurring unallowable costs, requires reimbursement to the federal government. The Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards was issued by the Office of Management and Budget on December 26, 2013. This final guidance superseded and streamlined the requirements from OMB Circulars A-21, A-87, A-110, and A-122 (which have been placed in OMB guidance);OMB 2 CFR Part 200 - Super Circular (formerly OMB A-87, 2 CFR Part 225) Circulars A-89, A-102, and A-133; and the guidance in Circular A-50 on Single Audit Act follow- up.https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/12/26/2013-30465/uniform- administrative-requirements-cost-principles-and-audit-requirements-for- federal-awards#h-21 In order for cost to be considered allowable, they must be supported by adequate documentation. Documentation standards - payroll costs Charges to federal awards for salaries and wages must be based on records that accurately reflect the work performed. These records must: (i) Be supported by a system of internal control which provides reasonable assurance that the charges are accurate, allowable, and properly allocated; [2 CFR ¬ß 200.430 (i)] Documenting time worked on federally funded activities is commonly referred to as Time and Effort Reporting.http://research.unc.edu/offices/sponsored- research/resources/data_res_osr_effortreporting/https://timeandeffort.com/OMB- time-and-effort-reporting-requirements-guidance.php Documentation standards - non-payroll costs The nature of documentation required for nonpayroll costs will vary by the nature of the transaction. Per 2 CFR ¬ß200.403,https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/12/26/2013-30465/uniform- administrative-requirements-cost-principles-and-audit-requirements-for- federal-awards#h-185 Except where otherwise authorized by statute, costs must meet the following general criteria in order to be allowable under federal awards: *(a) Be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the federal award and be allocable thereto under these principles. *(b) Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these principles or in the federal award as to types or amount of cost items. *(c) Be consistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to both federally financed and other activities of the non-federal entity. *(d) Be accorded consistent treatment. A cost may not be assigned to a federal award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been allocated to the federal award as an indirect cost. *(e) Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except, for state and local governments and Indian tribes only, as otherwise provided for in this Part. *(f) Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements of any other federally financed program in either the current or a prior period. *(g) Be adequately documented. Cash management (C) This section covers the actual management, or handling, of funds pertaining to a federal program, specifically on how federal assistance is distributed to recipients and how recipients manage the funds until disbursement. The actual transfer of funds, commonly referred to as ‚Äúdrawdowns‚Äù, is usually done electronically by requesting the funds to the federal agency via website or a network. The funds are automatically transferred from the US Department of Treasury to the recipient's bank account. Federal assistance for program operations is provided to recipients usually by one of two methods, also called ‚Äúfunding techniques‚Äù: by either advances of funds or by reimbursement of funds.A-133 Sup Part 3 (2013); Section C -- Cash Management, pg. 3-C-1. * Advances of funds ‚Äì Advances are federal funds provided to a recipient before the program activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount to the federal government (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program. * Reimbursement of funds ‚Äì This funding technique requires the recipient to pay program expenditures with their own funds, and then request a reimbursement for those expenses from the federal government or pass-through entity. Recipients prepare and send reimbursement requests, and maintain supporting documentation showing that the costs for which reimbursement was requested were paid prior to the date of the reimbursement request. Davis-Bacon Act (D) As part of the US Department of Labor‚Äôs (DOL) governmentwide implementation of the Davis-Bacon Act, federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics who work for a contractor or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages not less than those the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage).A-133 Sup Part 3 (2013); Section D -- Davis-Bacon Act, pg. 3-D-1.40 USC 276a to 276a-7 This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act, by including in their construction contracts with a contractor or subcontractor a clause or requirement to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations.29 CFR part 5 The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance. This report is commonly referred to as ‚Äúcertified payrolls‚Äù, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a standard form pre-designed by the OMB.29 CFR 5.5 and 5.6 Eligibility (E) The main objective of this compliance requirement is that only eligible individuals or organizations participate in federal assistance programs. While the criterion for determining eligibility may vary from program to program, the objective that only eligible individuals or organizations participate is consistent across all federal programs, which forms the basis of this compliance requirement.A-133 Sup Part 3 (2013); Section E -- Eligibility, pg. 3-E-1. To comply with this objective, recipients must first assure that proper eligibility determinations are made, which means that the recipient must determine the parameters and limitations to define eligibility for a specific program in accordance with the program's purpose. Many federal programs already contain eligibility requirements based on laws, agency regulations, grant agreements, etc., and recipients must assure that their eligibility determination complies with such requirements. An example includes federal programs that offer HIV/Aids treatment and require that the participants be victims of such diseases. It is usually the recipient's responsibility to determine how to determine such eligibility, such as establishing policy that requires an in-house doctor or laboratory to diagnose each prospective participant, accepting diagnoses from third-party doctors or laboratories, etc.42 USC 300ff-14(b) and 15(a)(7)(A)OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part IV, pg. 4-93.914-4, par. 4 However, certain agencies have included specific parameters for which the recipient should follow, as in the case of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) which states in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that recipients of certain HUD housing subsidy programs must obtain specific income verification documents to prove participant eligibility, such as W-2 payroll forms, a federal income tax return, etc.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part IV, pg. 4-14.850-3, par. 5 through 724 CFR part 5 subpart F; 24 CFR 5.601 et seq., and 24 CFR 960.253, 960.255, and 960.259 After determining which eligibility requirements participation in a program requires, the recipient must also assure that individual program participant or group eligibility was correctly determined by keeping evidence of such compliance, such as maintaining documentation in participant files (e.g., copies of HIV/Aids diagnosis, copies of federal income tax returns, etc.). Furthermore, the recipient must assure that only eligible individuals or groups participated in the program by establishing strict controls of program funds to avoid non-eligible persons from receiving the specific assistance. Equipment and real property management (F) This section established directives on how a recipient should manage equipment and real property of a federal program. Equipment management Equipment means tangible, non-expendable property acquired with federal assistance funds, that has a useful life of more than one year, and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit (though, consistent with a recipient's own equipment policy, lower cost limits may be established). Basically, this section requires that, as per A-102 Common Rule and OMB Circular A-110 regulations, equipment must be used in the federal program it was bought for, or‚Äîwhen appropriate‚Äîother federal programs. Additionally, the recipient must keep equipment records, perform a physical equipment inventory at least once every two years, and implement an appropriate internal control system to safeguard and maintain the equipment. When equipment with a current fair market value of $5,000 or more is no longer needed, it may be retained or sold, as a proportionate share is provided to the federal government amount of the current fair market value, based on the percent of federal funds to own recipients fund used to buy the item.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part III, pg. 3-F-1, Equipment and Real Property ManagementOMB Circular A-102 Common Rule (¬ß___.32)OMB Circular A-110 (¬ß___.34) Real property management Title to real property acquired by recipients with federal awards vests with the recipient. It must be used for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose. Real property may be used in other federally sponsored projects or programs that have purposes similar to the one the property was bought for, as long as the federal government authorizes it. However it may not dispose of or encumber the title to real property without prior federal government consent. When it is no longer needed for the federally supported programs or projects, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the federal government. As with equipment, if the property is sold, a proportionate share is provided to the federal government, amount of the current fair market value, based on the percent of federal funds to own recipient's fund used to acquire the item.A-102 Common Rule (¬ß___.31)OMB Circular A-110 (¬ß___.32) Matching, level of effort, earmarking (G) This section covers 3 compliance requirements concerning recipient performance. They may require that recipients provide a level of contributions to a federal program, maintain specific levels of performance or achievement, or restrict the amount of federal funds used for a specific purpose. Failure to meet these requirements may result in either limitation of future funds or termination of assistance. Specific requirements for matching, level of effort, and earmarking are unique to each federal program, and are described in the laws, regulations, and contract or grant provisions that pertain to the program.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part III, pg. 3-G-1, Matching, Level of Effort, and Earmarking Matching Matching, also referred to as ‚Äúcost sharing‚Äù, is a requirement for the recipient to provide contributions or donations (usually non-federal) of a specified amount or percentage to supplement federal assistance received.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part III, pg. 3-G-1, par. 4 In other words, when the recipient participates in a federal program (e.g. it receives federal assistance) and an operating budget is prepared, the federal government may require the recipient to provide contributions to cover a portion of that program's operations.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part III, pg. 3-G-1, par. 3 The matching requirement is based on the assertion that total program expenses are 100% and that, although the federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses, the recipient must still cover a portion of them. Such proportion is solely decided by the federal government, but usually the recipient decides how that contribution is provided and to which expenses, so long as the contribution is verifiable, generally does not originate from another federal program, and is considered in the operating budget. The expenses must be necessary and reasonable, allowed under cost principles (see B section above), and not used for another federal program. Matching may be in the form of contributing the recipient's own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs (e.g., paying program utility bills, paying part of program personnel payroll, etc.) or, in some cases, in the form of in-kind contributions, which are donations of non-monetary objects such as services, materials, property, etc. Examples of matching include the Head Start program, which requires that recipients provide 20% of the total annual expenses in either monetary or in-kind contributions. Recipients of these funds may contribute money to cover teacher payroll, or may contribute a building to house the program classrooms.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part IV, pg. 4-93.600-1, Head Start Program However, the federal government requires that in-kind contributions be properly valued and evidenced (such as estimating the value of a building to make sure that it meets the 20% of the program budget), and certain programs specifically require that matching be made by contributing money only.OMB A-133 Comp. Suppl., Part IV, pg. 4-16.579-5, par. 1 Level of effort Level of effort defines particular goals or objectives the recipient must achieve with the assistance received, and includes recipient requirements for a specified level of service, specified level of expenditures for designated activities, and federal funds to supplement and not supplant non-federal services.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part III, pg. 3-G-1, par. 5 Some examples are programs that establish that a recipient must provide medical services to 1,000 patients daily and programs that require that a recipients spend over 50% of its annual budget on capital projects, among other. Earmarking Earmarking is a requirement that specifies a limit amount or percentage of the program's assistance that must (minimum) or may (maximum) be used for specified activities.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part III, pg. 3-G-2, par. 1 Examples of this include limits imposed on the federal government on the amount of federal funds to cover administrative expenses, or a percentage requirement for total program funds provided to subrecipients.OMB A-133 Comp. Suppl., Part IV, pg. 4-16.579-5, par. 2-3 Earmarking may also be specified in relation to the types of participants covered (e.g. a limit on how many participants a recipient can provide assistance to). Period of availability of federal funds (H) This section establishes the fact that, although recipients may receive various federal awards during their lifespan, the individual federal grants are awarded for a specified time period, usually one year. Federal regulations prohibit the use of funds from a grant award outside its specified time frame unless authorized by a federal agency, and auditors should verify that the recipient expends its grant during that time only. For example, a surplus from a federal award that starts on January 1, 2006 and ends on December 31, 2006 cannot be used after December 31, because its lifespan has terminated. This surplus must be returned to the federal agency unless otherwise authorized.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part III, pg. 3-H-1, Period of Availability of Federal Funds Procurement and suspension and debarment (I) This section covers compliance of laws and regulations when obtaining a good or services from a vendor, supplier, or provider. The procurement requirement is established to ensure that such goods and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance laws and regulations, including the prohibition of conflicts of interest, the fair selection of vendors, provide open and free competition among vendors, etc.OMB Circular A-110, ¬ß____.40 through ¬ß____.48 The suspension and debarment requirement establishes that certain non-federal entities have been prohibited from participating in or receiving federal assistance for various reasons, including prior mismanagement of funds or previous non-compliance of laws and regulations. This prohibition may be temporary (suspension) or indefinite (debarment; until specifically allowed by the government). When performing this purchase, the recipient must verify that the vendor, supplier, provider or their respective principals (e.g., owners, top management, etc.) are not suspended, debarred or otherwise excluded by the federal government. This is done by checking the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) maintained by the General Services Administration or by contacting the federal agency.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part III, pg. 3-I-1, Procurement and Suspension and Debarment Program income (J) Program income is sometimes directly generated by the federally funded program.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part III, pg. 3-J-1, par. 1-2 This type of income includes, but is not limited to, income from fees for services performed, the use or rental of property acquired with program funds, the sale of items fabricated under the program, and payments of principal and interest on loans made by the recipient to others with program funds. However, it generally does not include interest on program funds (which is covered under ‚ÄúCash Management‚Äù, see above); nor does it cover rebates, credits, discounts, and refunds (covered under ‚ÄúAllowable Costs/Cost Principles‚Äù); nor proceeds from the sale of equipment or real property (covered under ‚ÄúEquipment and Real Property Management‚Äù). The uses or treatment of program income are either deducted by the federal agency from the current program budget (e.g., the program income substitutes part of the original budget), added to the current program budget, or used to meet matching requirements. Real property acquisition and relocation assistance (K) This section covers compliance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). This act provides for uniform and equitable treatment of persons displaced by a federal programs from their homes, businesses, or farms, including assuring just compensation and assisting in relocation.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part III, pg. 3-K-1, par. 1-2 For example, if the construction of a highway under a federal program requires the expropriation of homes, the expropriation must be made by either providing fair compensation for that property or providing assistance for, or reimbursement of, relocation expenses incurred by the affected person. The Compliance Supplement suggests verifying that the property acquired is appraised by qualified independent appraisers, the appraisals are examined by a review appraiser to assure acceptability, and that after acceptance, the review appraiser certifies the recommended or approved value of the property for just compensation to the owner. Reporting (L) This section establishes that all recipients must submit reports (whether financial, performance- related, or of special nature) to the federal government to monitor federal assistance activities and uses.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part III, pg. 3-L-1, par. 1-6 The most common reports are pre-designed by the federal agency, are approved by OMB, and are freely available to all recipients and the general public. The time deadlines for submitting them vary depending on the report. Furthermore, the reporting requirements (e.g., which reports must be submitted, the timing of the submission, information in the reports, etc.) may vary from recipient to recipient, although the federal government has established several reports that apply to all recipients. Some of the most common of these ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù reports include: *SF-269 (OMB approval no. 0348-0039) or SF-269A (OMB no. 0348-0038), commonly known as the Financial Status Report (FSR) ‚Äì Used to report the status of funds (e.g., amount received, amount expended or used, amount reserved, amount unused, etc.) *SF-270 (OMB no. 0348-0004), also known as the Request for Advance or Reimbursement - Used to request U.S. Treasury advance payments and reimbursements under non-construction programs. *SF-272 (OMB no. 0348-0003) or SF-272-A (OMB No. 0348-0003), commonly known as the Federal Cash Transactions Report or Status of Federal Cash Report - Provides accountability of all federal cash received by the recipient. It is partially prepared by the Division of Payment Management (DPM) within the Department of Health and Human Services based on data reported to the DPM by recipients and federal agencies, and is completed and certified by the recipient. Subrecipient monitoring (M) This compliance requirement establishes that any non-federal recipient of federal assistance that passes that assistance, whether in part or in total, to another recipient (known as pass-through entities and subrecipients, respectively) is responsible to monitor the federal assistance activities of that subrecipient, as well as assure that they are both complying with laws and regulations. This requirement is based on the fact that they are both equally responsible for federal funds received. Subrecipient monitoring may consist of site visits, regular contact, interviews, meetings and examinations of the subrecipient, as well as requiring that the subrecipient be subject to an annual single audit.OMB A-133: Comp. Suppl.; Part III, pg. 3-M-1, Subrecipient Monitoring Special tests and provisions (N) Certain programs have unique compliance requirements‚Äîestablished by laws, regulations, and contract or grant agreements‚Äîthat do not fit into the requirements listed above. This sections covers those requirements. The auditor must review the program's contract and grant agreements and referenced laws and regulations to identify unique compliance requirements, and develop audit objectives and audit procedures under this section.OMB A-133: Comp.

It is considered to be the most important tool of an auditor for a Single Audit. It was created following amendments in 1996 to the Single Audit Act based on numerous studies performed by the Government Accountability Office, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency and the National State Auditors Association (NSAA). It serves to identify existing important compliance requirements that the Federal Government expects to be considered as part of a Single Audit. Without it, auditors would need to research many laws and regulations for each single program of a recipient to determine which compliance requirements are important to the Federal Government. For Single Audits, the Supplement replaces any agency audit guides and other audit requirement documents for individual Federal programs.United States Office of Management and Budget; OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement ; Part I: Background, Purpose and Applicability; Background; pg. 1-1, par. 1 through 4 and pg. 1-2, par. 1 through 2 Divisions The OMB A-133 Compliance Supplement is divided into 7 divisions: * Part I: Background, Purpose, and Applicability ‚Äì Presents a brief description of the history of the Single Audit, defines the purpose of the OMB Circular A-133, and establishes where and why the Single Audit applies.United States Office of Management and Budget; OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement ; Part I: Background, Purpose and Applicability; Overview of this Supplement; pg. 1-5 and 1-6 * Part II: Matrix of Compliance Requirements ‚Äì This section is a table which details the federal programs which are common within the US and specifies which compliance requirement applies to each program. * Part III: Compliance Requirements ‚Äì This section provides guidance and description on the 14 types of compliance guidelines established by federal agencies which summarize the compliance with federal laws and regulations in a general way. It also provides the auditor with certain audit objectives and suggested audit procedures to facilitate the audit. All federal programs, recipients, and auditors are required to follow these guidelines. * Part IV: Agency Program Requirements ‚Äì By far the largest section of the Supplement, this section is similar to Part III with the exception that it provides the information program by program in substantial detail. Whereas Part III simply discusses the 14 compliance requirements, this section discusses how each requirement applies to a particular program. This section also provides a brief history of the program, discusses program objectives and operations, and provides the auditor with much more specific suggested audit procedures. * Part V: Clusters of Programs ‚Äì This section is similar to Part IV, with the exception that it discusses clusters of programs, which are a grouping of closely related programs that have similar compliance requirements, such as Research and Development (R&D;), Student Financial Aid (SFA), and other clusters. Although the programs within a cluster are administered as separate programs, a cluster of programs is treated as a single program for the purpose of meeting the audit requirements of OMB Circular A-133. * Part VI: Internal Control ‚Äì Federal guidelines require recipients to implement an internal control system to manage federal funds in keeping with compliance requirements. They also require auditors to obtain an understanding of the recipient's system as well as verify if it is operating correctly. This section helps recipients and auditors by describing, for each type of compliance requirement, the objectives and certain characteristics of internal control that, when present and operating effectively, may ensure compliance with program requirements. This is especially helpful for auditors because it describes characteristics of internal control which may be implemented and used by the recipient and verified and audited by the auditor to reasonably ensure compliance with the types of compliance requirements in Part III. * Part VII: Guidance for Auditing Programs Not Included in This Compliance Supplement ‚Äì This section provides guidance to auditors regarding federal programs that were not covered in Part II, Part IV and Part V of the Supplement, including providing suggestions on how to research for laws and regulations applicable to that particular program and suggesting audit procedures to perform. Compliance requirements Compliance requirements are series of directives established by US federal government agencies that guide recipients and auditors on how federal assistance should be managed. The OMB created 14 basic requirements which group all those compliance requirements and provided extensive array of information about them in the Compliance Supplement.

Anderson had first arrived in St. Augustine with his wife and two daughters in 1829. A portion of the land east of the residence was sold by Dr. Andrew Anderson Jr., the son of Dr. Anderson Sr, in 1887 to Henry M. Flagler for construction of the Ponce de Le√≥n Hotel. Dr. Anderson Jr. died in 1924. The house was then purchased by the mayor of St. Augustine, Herbert E. Wolfe, who sold it to Flagler College in 1966.

The route connects Avalon and Lavonia and provides access to Lake Hartwell and Tugaloo State Park. It is known as Gumlog Road for its entire length. It has been called Gumlog Road long before G-dot gave it a dreary number. Route description SR 328 begins at an intersection with old SR 17 in Avalon, in Stephens County. One block east it intersects but does not cross the 4-lane 17 bypass. With the 4-laneing of SR 17, Gumlog Road was lowered 5 feet. This turned out to be a mistake causing a problem with the line of sight on the 4-lane. Gumlog Road, with over 2,000 vehicles per day, has been blocked-off with a concrete island in the median. Now, only right turns are allowed from Gumlog Road. In order to turn left to Lavonia, one must first turn toward Toccoa, then make a U-turn toward Lavonia. A shorter route would be to turn on Martin Drive, crossing Gumlog Creek, then turn left on the 4-lane toward Lavonia thereby bypassing this backward-inbreed engineered intersection altogether. It travels in a roughly eastern direction and intersects Brookhaven Circle, the former path of SR 336\\\\. The highway travels through the Gumlog area of Martin and enters Franklin County and travels through the Gumlog precinct, G.M.D. 213. This section of Gumlog Road is a typical ridge road on the Savanna river system that runs down to a river wonderfully described in the book \\"Tobacco Road.\\" On the South side of the ridge is Gumlog Creek, and on the north side of the ridge is Eastanollee Estuary, so called because the public sees a large estuary from brookhave Road. It begins to curve to the southeast at Tugaloo State park road. It crosses over the Gumlog Cove section of Lake Hartwell. SR 328 then travels in a roughly southern direction. It crosses over, but does not have an interchange with Interstate 85 (I-85, Ernest Vandiver Highway). The route then curves to the south-southwest and meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 59 (Vickery Street) in Lavonia. Here, the roadway continues as Edgewood Drive. SR 328 is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History The roadway that would eventually become SR 328 was built in the mid-1950s on a nearly straight line from Avalon to just northeast of Lavonia.

The anime premiered in Japan on October 7, 2006, two months before the game's Japanese release, and concluded March 29, 2008 with a total of 76 episodes. Its debut followed shortly after the conclusion of a preceding Mega Man anime series, MegaMan NT Warrior, which ran from 2002 to 2006. The manga was serialized in CoroCoro Comic in September 2006. The anime was licensed by Viz Media and first premiered in English on the online streaming video service Toonami Jetstream on July 23, 2007. The series made its only television premiere on Cartoon Network with a 2-hour special on August 25, 2007. The series was later added to Viz Media's Neon Alley digital anime channel on June 1, 2015. Mega Man Star Force follows the adventures of Geo Stelar and his extraterrestrial partner Omega-Xis, a duo capable of merging through \\"Electromagnetic Wave Change\\" to become Mega Man. Together, they combat various EM wave beings that threaten to conquer or destroy the Earth, especially the invading FM Planet's forces. History Airing October 7, 2006 on TV Tokyo, the Ry≈´sei no Rockman anime filled the timeslot that had been held by Rockman EXE Beast+, the series' predecessor. Each of its episodes are approximately ten minutes in length as the program shared the thirty-minute segment Oha Coliseum with the Saru Getchu anime series. On April 17, 2007, VIZ Media announced that they acquired the rights to the anime series, with the title Mega Man Star Force. The press release mentioned that 13 episodes were to be released at lengths of 20 minutes each (each containing approximately 2 Japanese episodes worth of content). During the E3 2007 video-game convention, IGN revealed in their hands-on impressions of the Star Force video game that the English anime would premiere on Toonami Jetstream on July 23, 2007. The show made its television debut on Cartoon Network on August 25, 2007, edited as a 2-hour faux-movie presentation composed of Japanese episodes 1 through 9 and heavily slimmed- down versions of episodes 12, 15, and 16. The series would never air in normal episodic format on television, and subsequent episode airings online revealed that the unusual edits are exclusive to its television appearance. The series is no longer being shown on Toonami Jetstream as the service is currently defunct. It was later added to Neon Alley on June 1, 2015. According to the September 2007 issue of CoroCoro Comic, the anime would conclude in Japan on October 27, 2007 and, following the trend of its predecessor, continue with a new series called Ry≈´sei no Rockman Tribe, premiering on November 3, 2007. The second anime is loosely based on the events of the second video game (which was also released in November). According to an interview with Fuyuka Oura (Geo's voice actor in the Japanese version) at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, Tribe has a deeper and \\"cooler\\" storyline than before, and the new character Solo is a prominent character in the plot. As of October 6, 2007, the time-slot that had been held by Saru Getchu was replaced with the Zero Duel Masters anime. On March 29, 2008, Tribe concluded with 21 episodes, and its time-slot was replaced with A Penguin's Troubles. There are no known plans for another Mega Man anime in Japan, marking the first time a Mega Man anime has not been on the air in Japan since the six-month hiatus between Rockman EXE and Rockman EXE Axess in 2003. Although the entire Rockman EXE series was distributed in Japan on DVD, there is no word on Star Force receiving the same treatment in Japan or in the United States. However, Manga Entertainment released a Region 2 box set in the UK on November 3, 2008. The box set contains all 13 episodes of the English dub that aired on Toonami Jetstream. Production Mega Man Star Force's Electromagnetic Wave Change sequences take after the Cross Fusion sequences of its predecessor. Depicted here is Geo at the beginning of his transformation. Mega Man Star Force's animation is overseen by XEBEC, with musical arrangements by Naoki Maeda. Character designs (which have in some cases deviated from Capcom's original concepts) are handled by Mitsuru Ishihara and Shingo Adachi (who is also one of the series' art directors, some of the others being Masayuki Nomoto, Akira Takahashi, and Yasuo Shimizu). The art directors usually work independently of each other on any given episode. Shogakukan manages computer-generated imagery. The title sequences of each series are sung by Misato Fukuen as Sonia Sky. In the original series, the theme is entitled and in Tribe, the theme is entitled . Several characters appearing in the original series opening are colored incorrectly. A background identical to that used for Cross Fusion sequences of MegaMan NT Warrior is employed in the anime's Electromagnetic Wave Change scenes. Easter eggs referencing other series within the Mega Man franchise are also inserted into the program on occasion. Examples include a broadcast of a girl wearing Roll Caskett's clothes from Mega Man Legends, as well as a boy in Shepard's class wearing Lan Hikari's clothes from Mega Man Battle Network sans the headband.Shooting Star Rockman Episode 11, 2006.Shooting Star Rockman Episode 13, 2006. With the premiere of the English version, it was revealed that two Japanese version episodes are combined to create one English version episode to fill a 30-minute time slot. Furthermore, in order to fill more time, a few minutes of footage from various episodes are added at the start of episodes, usually narrated by a particular member of the cast, acting as a recap of previous episodes and slight foreshadow of upcoming events. As voice recording was outsourced to Studiopolis in Studio City, California, Star Force became the first (and as of the premiere of Mega Man: Fully Charged, only) animated adaptation in the franchise to not be recorded in Vancouver, British Columbia. One noticeable oddity, however, exists in English episode 13. Instead of combining Japanese episodes 25 and 26, the next two episodes in order, Viz opted to fill 26's time with ten minutes of recycled footage with narration by Geo Stelar. This was presumably done because the series ends on an odd number of episodes, with the only other alternative to ending the series with enough footage being to skip an episode entirely. However, this strategy would prove fruitless as the dub was discontinued before reaching that point. Unlike the English version of the series' predecessor Mega Man NT Warrior, the dub for Mega Man Starforce features a considerably more accurate translation with far less cut footage and censorship. While many names and terms were changed, they mostly coincided with changes first made by Capcom of America for the English versions of the video games. However, there are a number of translation inconsistencies. Some examples include the character of Misora Hibiki, who is referred to as Sonia Strumm in the English games but as Sonia Sky in the English anime.Mega Man Star Force Episode 5, 2007. There are also instances where the original Japanese name is used instead of the localized version used in the games, such as an instance where Mega Man shouts \\"Rock Buster\\" instead of \\"Mega Buster.\\"Mega Man Star Force Episode 9, 2007. Furthermore, appearances of Japanese text (such as on signs or hard subtitles for setting information) are left untranslated and unedited.Mega Man Star Force Episode 10, 2007. The animation for the introduction sequence is also left completely unchanged. However, all of the original background music is completely removed‚Äîincluding the introduction song \\"Heart Wave\\"‚Äîand original scores performed by Thorsten Laewe are put in place of the Japanese version's soundtrack. Nevertheless, all the original Japanese sound effects are left intact. Plot The year is 220X. Technology has advanced rapidly since the age of the internet, leading to the creation of new and more efficient modes of transportation, as well as the construction of futuristic cities, all linked together by three satellites orbiting the Earth‚ÄîPegasus, Leo, and Dragon. The satellites accomplish this by maintaining a network of EM waves around the planet's atmosphere, thereby powering the invisible EM Wave World. The human population carries portable devices called Transers to interface with the EM Wave World and other electronic devices. Problems caused by criminals and EM Wave Viruses manipulating the EM Wave World are commonly dealt with by the Satella Police. Original series 200px A proud warrior of the FM Planet, Omega-Xis, betrays his kind and escapes to Earth where he makes contact with Geo Stelar. Like his fellow extraterrestrials called FM-ians, Omega-Xis is capable of initiating a process known as \\"Electromagnetic Wave Change,\\" which transforms ordinary humans of the same frequency as themselves into \\"EM Wave Humans,\\" allowing them to freely operate in the EM Wave World. With these new powers, Geo becomes known as Mega Man, a hero of Echo Ridge. However, Omega-Xis holds the key to accessing the weapon Andromeda, capable of destroying planets. As such, many FM-ians pursue Omega-Xis with the intent of retrieving the key in their goal to destroy the Earth. Meanwhile, Omega-Xis also knows the secret to the disappearance of Geo's father in a catastrophic space accident months ago. The first half of the series focuses on the FM-ians hunting Omega-Xis for the Andromeda Key. Eventually, they succeed, but by using Star Force, Mega Man is able to sustain Andromeda and destroy the key. In the latter half of the series, the FM-ians band together, taking the guise of their original human counterparts, and seek a way to energize a new Andromeda Key. Eventually, Gemini Spark takes the reins of the operation and succeeds in reviving Andromeda, but the FM-ian king Cepheus descends onto Earth to put a stop to all of the chaos. Geo also has an encounter with his father Kelvin who reveals that he has become an EM wave being and is still exploring space, and that Geo's place is on Earth, fighting for justice as Mega Man. Tribe 200px The second series follows the events of the second game focusing on the lost continent of Mu. The ancient civilization vanished ages ago, and a few of its remnants still exist as myths and legends called UMAs (Unidentified Mystery Animals similar to FM-ians that also have the ability to fuse with humans). The UMAs begin merging with humans in order to search for the treasures of Mu, the powerful OOPArts, which will give them the power to revive Mu. After Geo and Omega-Xis encounter several unusual enemies, they meet a professor named Doctor Vega who sends them on a quest to find the OOPArts and stop the UMAs. Using the OOPArts, Mega Man is able to take new forms, primarily the sword- wielding Thunder Zerker form. Near the end, Geo discovers that Doctor Vega and her accomplice Hollow are manipulating Geo to use the OOPArts for the revival of Mu and the devastating force known as Le Mu. But Mega Man combines the three OOPArts together, forming Tribe King, and uses this new power to stop Le Mu and seal Mu once more. The series premiered November 3, immediately after the original series' conclusion, and concluded March 29, 2008. Characters An image depicting many of the series' main characters. From left to right, top row: Hope, Kelvin, Aaron, Copper, Omega-Xis; bottom row: Pat, Luna, Bud, Zack, Sonia, and Geo. Geo Stelar : Geo Stelar: : Omega-Xis: Geo Stelar, known as in Japan, is the main protagonist of the series. A gentle but a bit lonely fifth-grade student, Geo mourns the disappearance of his father that occurred three years prior, and has neglected school as a result. After being confronted by his classmates who pester him to return to school, he heads to an observing platform where he discovers the fugitive FM-ian Omega-Xis by donning the Visualizer glasses left to him by his father, which allows him to view the EM Wave World. Omega-Xis, having stolen the mysterious Andromeda Key from the FM King, claims to have knowledge of the boy's missing parent. The two are able to merge becoming Mega Man, in the Japanese version. Geo uses this newfound power to protect his friends and others from the invading FM- ians. Aided by Sonia Strumm and Lyra, they combat such threats as the forces of the FMian king, Cepheus, as well as the minions of Dr. Vega and the Dealers. Sonia and Luna have been shown to have feelings for him, though he is seen to be oblivious. Like any 10-year-old, however, any mentioning of either not only leaves him confused, but embarrassed as well. In Mega Man Star Force 3, he is officially allied with the Satella Police and is registered under Project TC - a registry of those allowed to legally perform Wave Change - as No. 003. In the manga, Geo's back-story remains the same. However, he is more ambitious about building up the strength to find his father. Geo goes after the \\"Star Force,\\" a power being offered to the winner of the Wave Coliseum, a tournament pitting various radio wave humans against each other in battle. Also, as the manga is aimed at a younger audience, Omega-Xis is a lot more comical. Omega-Xis, known as in the Japanese version, is an AM-ian; unlike FM- ians, AM-ians are able to turn humans into EM waves without fusing with them. At first, Omega has no feelings towards the Earth or its people, including Geo, with his only concern being the safety of the Andromeda Key; however, he slowly begins to change and care for others. Geo and Omega-Xis, in their Mega Man form, appear in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as part of Mega Man's Final Smash called Mega Legends alongside MegaMan.EXE from MegaMan NT Warrior, Mega Man X, Mega Man Vulnutt from Mega Man Legends, Proto Man, and Bass. Sonia Strumm and Lyra : Sonia Strumm : Lyra Sonia Strumm, known as in the original version and Sonia Sky in the dubbed anime version, is a popular rock star who, like Geo, is depressed over the loss of a parent, her mother, which leads them to establish a friendship. She is similar to Mayl in the Battle Network series. In terms of demeanor, Sonia is quite the opposite of Geo: spunky, outspoken, and mischievous. Sonia seems to be romantically interested in Geo, shown by the fact that she has asked Geo out on dates several times. Sonia also throws herself in front of one of Queen Ophiuca's attacks to protect Geo, and as a result is poisoned. In the second game, Sonia again asks Geo to go to Wilshire Hills. In this game, Sonia seems more blatant about their relationship. She once asked Geo who he likes better between an argument with Luna. She has also shown jealousy when Geo is with a girl alone during his mission of finding the OOPArts. Sonia is constantly pressured by her money-starved manager, leading Lyra to manipulate her into transforming into Harp Note, Lyra Note in the English anime, and attack people throughout the city. In Mega Man Star Force 2, Hollow blackmails her into working for Vega in exchange for Geo's safety. When Mega Man finds her in the Bermuda Maze, she claims that she doesn't want to be found, and cuts off their Brother Band. Later, when Mega Man is lured out by Hollow and Solo, Sonia rescues him and transports him back to Echo Ridge. When Mega Man goes back to the Bermuda Maze, he defeats Sonia. There, she explains she was following Vega's orders to protect to which Geo replies how her betrayal did not protect him. She also helps Mega Man find Mu's location in the Bermuda Maze afterwards. In the third game, she is officially allied with the Satella Police and is registered under Project TC - a registry of those who are allowed to legally perform Wave Change - as No. 004. She also is an actress and appears on a TV drama. Notably, all of the songs sung during the anime are sung by Misato Fukuen, and twice, once during the anime and once during the games, Misora Hibiki is portrayed actually singing the theme songs, the latter case done through printed vocals. Lyra, known as in the Japanese version, is based on the constellation Lyra. She is an FM-ian who used to work for the FMian king and often hides in Sonia's guitar. Her form is a cross between a harp and a note. She is shown to act like a high status old lady, whom gets into arguments with Omega-Xis. When she first met Sonia, Lyra tries unsuccessfully to invade Sonia's heart, so is forced to take control of her while she sleeps. Following her defeat by Mega Man, Lyra becomes an ally of Omega-Xis. Friends Luna Platz Luna Platz, known as in the Japanese version, is the perky and bossy fifth-grade class president of Echo Ridge Elementary (Kodama Elementary in the Japanese version) and wears a short blue dress with a red tie and a green greed jewel. In the beginning of the game and anime, she constantly tries to get Geo to come to school, claiming that it is her job to get him there. When Geo finally comes to school, Luna basically treats Geo like another flunky. Luna openly admits she adores Mega Man from the second he saved her. However, throughout the game, it is constantly implied that Luna has developed strong feelings for Geo, stemming from Geo's declaration that he would protect her, and various times other times. Her English last name is a play on her original last name, the kanji of which mean \\"platinum\\" (the word \\"shirogane\\" means silver). As the class president, most of her friends refer to her as \\"The Prez\\", or simply \\"Prez\\". In the anime, Luna was infatuated with Mega Man after he saved her life, though unaware of his secret identity. It was this weakness that she is targeted by \\"Ophiucus\\" during one of Sonia's concerts, taking advantage of Luna's desire to see her hero and her jealousy over Lyra Note, who she believes may be romantically involved with Mega Man. Even as \\"Ophiucus Queen\\", Luna still had retained her crush on Mega Man, and in the fight with Mega Man, actually flirted with him more than attacking. Luna, after witnessing Mega Man change back to Geo goes into self-denial of seeing it though Zack and Bud were present at the time. Luna also seems to like Geo, making food for him and bickering with Lyra Note over who likes Mega Man more. In the game, because of her involvements with numerous FM-ian incidents, her parents transferred her to a new school. She keeps this painful news away from her friends. At the mall, she observes Geo and Sonia while they attend a jungle exhibit, and tailed them out of jealously. There she has an unexpected run-in with her parents, and the confrontation prompts Ophiucus to appear before her. Ophiucus promises to make Luna's parents pay, and Luna allows Ophiucus to invade her heart, merging the together to create . Queen Ophiucus holds Luna's parents hostage demanding Omega-Xis hand over the Andromeda Key. Mega Man eventually beats Queen Ophiucus, but she tries to persuade Omega-Xis to hand over the key so they may use its power together. Omega-Xis refuses, and Ophiucus is defeated by Gemini on a whim. Luna then regains consciousness, and hugs Mega Man as thanks. However, the Wave World deteriorates as they return to the real world, and shows Luna hugging Geo, who ends up being the second human (after Sonia) to know Mega Man's identity. Queen Ophiucus makes a second appearance in Mega Man Star Force 2 as a main story boss. Hyde kidnaps Luna in an attempt to lure Mega Man out. When Mega Man finds Luna, Hyde has Ophiuca's residual waves take over Luna, turning her back into Queen Ophiucus. Upon defeating her, the player unlocks the Tribe-On power. =Vogue= Vogue (Mode in the Japanese version) is the Wizard companion to Luna Platz who appears in the third game. Vogue's appearance is that of a bunny in a hat. Vogue is a support Wizard and Luna is thus unable to perform a Wave Change with Vogue. Vogue helps Luna keep track of important events and her daily schedule. Bud Bison Bud Bison, known as in the Japanese version, is a gruff bully who attempts to intimidate Geo into returning to school. Bud is very much like Dex from Battle Network, as he is, at first, he is a bully character who eventually makes amends with the main character. He is quite a dim witted student who depends on Luna to get him out of trouble or explaining things to him. He has a crush on Luna. The last name Ushi means cow or cattle in Japanese. His English adaptation of his last name refers to a Bison. In Mega Man Star Force, Bud tried to threaten Geo to go to school for Luna. Omega- Xis's brash personality causes Geo to punch Bud, leaving him embarrassed and his companions questioning their association with him, with Luna threatening to cut off their Brother Band, which Bud feels would make him a nobody. Taurus acts on his anguish, offering him the power to get Geo back. Under Taurus' control, Bud begins randomly destroying red objects in the real world. When he, Luna, and Zack go on patrol, they encounter Geo where Bud transforms and escapes into the cyber network of a truck that Luna and Zack are riding in, driving it recklessly through the city, attempting to run Geo over. Afterwards, Bud has little recollection of the incident, only that he did some terrible things. Taurus Fire reappears in Mega Man Star Force 2 as a main story boss. Taurus's residual waves take over Bud during an eating competition and transform him back into Taurus Fire. He also re-appears in Mega Man Star Force 3 as a Wizard for Bud. Taurus is loaned to Geo to defeat Diamond Ice. He is registered under Project TC as No. 005. In the anime, he grows jealous over Luna spending so much time with Geo upon his return to school as Taurus (an FM-ian who is number one in terms of power amongst his kind) arrived upon sensing Bud. After being thrown into a hallway by Omega-Xis in the first confrontation, Taurus enters Bud's body and uses him as Taurus Fire until he is defeated and Taurus is forced out of him. Later, Taurus takes on the form of W Bud while gathering minus energy to recreate the Andromeda Key. He is the first FM-ian to be ultimately deleted by Gemini Spark in order to refill the real Andromeda Key with minus energy. In the manga, Bud encounters a gang of street thugs who bully him and an innocent puppy. Taurus subsequently targets Bud who desires the power to overcome the bullies. However, after being defeated by Mega Man, Taurus becomes an ally of Omega-Xis's and reveals that the \\"Star Force\\" will help Geo find his father. Zack Temple Zack, known as in the Japanese version, is a nerdy and condescending student who is more or less one of Luna's flunkies. Zack seems to also have a problem with his height and tries numerous ways to get taller. Zack also appears to be afraid of heights. Zack usually gets information off of his own website, the \\"Zackpedia\\". After discovering Geo was Mega Man, Zack starts to admire him more. He, Luna, Bud, and Geo usually help test out Tom Dubius's new upgrade for the Star Carrier. Zack is the only one of Geo's immediate friends who has not Wave Changed, against their will or otherwise, though he does get a Wizard named \\"Pedia\\" in the third game, thus making a pun with their combined names, \\"Zackpedia\\", the name of his website. =Pedia= Pedia is the Wizard companion to Zack Temple. As expected, Pedia is a very intelligent Wizard that supplies Zack and his companions with information. Patrick Sprigs Patrick Sprigs, known as in the original Japanese version, was abandoned by parents in a junkyard on Dream Island as an infant; because of that, Pat developed split personality disorder, the other more evil personality named Rey Sprigs, known as in the original version. While generally nice, Pat is pushed by Rey to hate the world, and has also been in contact with Gemini for an extended period prior to Geo's meeting with Omega-Xis. Once merged, Pat and Rey separate into two separate bodies representing the form of Gemini Spark. Pat's personality works as Gemini Spark White, while Rey is personified in Gemini Spark Black. It is their alliance with Gemini that causes Geo to doubt trusting others for a time. His original name is a play on \\"futagoza\\", which is the Japanese name for the Gemini constellation. Gemini Spark appears in the game's sequel at Whazzap Village as a friendly, optional boss. He requests Geo to fight him in order to help gain control over his darker personality Rey. Apparently after beating his SP form, he gains near full control, with Rey only bursting out under stress. This means that Pat now has control over the resurrected Gemini. Pat does not make an appearance in the third game; the only explanation given is that he's \\"gone,\\" and his empty seat at Echo Elementary is filled by Jack. In the anime, the Rey personality is virtually absent, with Gemini becoming Gemini Spark Black, and with Pat seemingly a willing participant in the FM Planet's plans. Rescued by Gemini after being run over by a truck and left to die in the ensuing blaze, Pat decided to form an alliance with Gemini. Unlike Geo, Pat had already mastered Electromagnetic Wave Change before they met. Gemini Spark was easily the strongest of the FMains, overwhelming Mega Man in their first two battles, and even in later fights the only Mega Man could win was using the Star Force. Although the other FM-ians plan to destroy Earth, Pat and Gemini secretly intend to destroy the FM Planet by taking the Andromeda Key for themselves. They give Cancer a fake Andromeda key after the real was destroyed by Omega-Xis, telling Cancer that the one they gave him was real (and keeping the real one for themselves) and recreating the EM Wave Conversion System for the FM-ians. Pat and Gemini then remain behind the scenes waiting for the FM-ians to gather enough minus energy for the Andromeda Key. However, the FM-ian king Cepheus eventually calls the FM-ians back to planet FM, and Gemini then betrays the other FM-ians and delete them all except for Cancer, who manage to escape, and use them as energy to restore the Andromeda Key. Gemini Spark White eventually sacrifices his \\"Black\\" counterpart to restore fully Andromeda and destroy Earth when the not at full power Andromeda was stopped by the three Sages of AM. However, Geo and Omega-Xis destroyed the Andromeda Key while Cepheus regressed Gemini Spark White back to human form and erased Pat's memories. In the manga, Gemini Spark only has one embodiment that alternates between the darker, more aggressive Black (B) and the calmer, more mellow White (W). (The two personalities usually dispute over control of the body.) When Gemini Spark was a child, he was abandoned in space and found by Crown Thunder. They shared a bond through their control of lightning, and thus Crown Thunder raised him. Considering Gemini Spark has existed as Gemini Spark since his youth, it is unlikely that Pat and Gemini exist independently in the manga. AMAKEN Aaron Boreal Aaron Boreal, known as in the Japanese version, is a good friend of Kelvin Stellar, Geo's father. He is the head researcher and founder of , Aaron delivers the news of Kelvin's disappearance to Geo and his mother, and bestows upon Geo the Visualizer that was left to him by his father. He aids Geo in reaching a space station to prevent the FM King from destroying the Earth by using a transmitter in its debris on Dream Island. He appears in the second game as a minor character, where he upgrades Geo's Star Carrier. In the third game he works in the WAZA command center with fellow AMAKEN employee Tom Dubius, and does his part in helping Geo to get to Meteor G. His English name is a pun on the Aurora Borealis. Tom Dubius Tom Dubius, known as in the Japanese version is a worker at AMAKEN laboratory and is paranoid of those around him. This is due to his past where a man used their brother band to steal his work and presented it as his own. Thus, Tom is afraid to open up to others and have his work stolen, specifically his latest invention, the Flap Pack, a flying pack powered by EM waves. Aaron approaches him asking if he'd like to form a Brother Band, which Tom, while happy at the idea, is still a little doubtful, at which time Cygnus approaches him. When he misunderstands coworker Aaron as claiming the jacket as his own, Cygnus reappears before him, telling him that society's nature is to betray, and together they trap Aaron and the tourists visiting the labs in the Space Simulation chamber (which mimics space, including the room having no oxygen) by forcing them to dance in circles. Hoping to earn Tom's trust, Aaron removes his helmet in the Space Simulation chamber (which, as it turns out, Tom already filled with oxygen), a shocked Dubius realizes the truth, releasing Cygnus' hold over him. Cygnus Wing reappears in Mega Man Star Force 3 as an optional boss, registered under Project TC as No. 020. Cygnus is now Dubius's wizard. Tom's anime background is the same as the game, except that Cygnus has him believe that everyone is against him and Tom attempts to crash a satellite on the city in retaliation. Though Tom realized the truth in time, Cygnus took full control over the human's body and escaped. Cygnus acted as the leader of the FM-ians on earth, using Tom to build an \\"EM Wave Conversion System\\" that allows his fellow FM- ians to transform into EM Wave Humans without the need for host bodies, directing them to seize the Pegasus, Leo, and Dragon satellites. But eventually, Cygnus reveals his never cared for his minions once he gets the Andromeda Key, almost killing them when he goes to destroy the earth. But eventually, Cygnus was killed by Mega Man. In the manga, Cygnus Wing appears as an opponent of Mega Man's in the Wave Coliseum tournament. Cygnus Wing's manga personality exhibits a mixture of effeminate mannerisms and slight sadism. Also, Cygnus Wing is lacking his wings for unknown reasons. FM-ian hosts ;Mitch Shepar : :Mitch Shepar, known as in the Japanese version, is an idealistic and friendly teacher. He has seven children of his own and sees his students as if they were his own kids. He often tells stories instead of teaching by the books, claiming that he does not want to raise kids who can only study. In the game, the Principal tells him he will lose his job as a teacher for not using the Study Wave (an EM wave that stimulates brain activity). Mitch Shepar breaks down due to stress and meets Libra who tells him that he must abandon his ideals in order to succeed. Together with the FM- ian, his personality shifts to extremely strict, and he puts his class into a trance of non-stop studying using the Study Wave. After being defeated by Mega Man and seeing his students concern for his well being, Shepar realizes that he was wrong and drives Libra from his heart. In the anime, \\"Mitch Shepard\\" lectures at Echo Ridge Laboratory. When Libra (an FM-ian who often weighs decisions in an \\"A or B\\" scenario before taking action) becomes injured in a battle against Mega Man, he takes control of Shepar's body to hide while he recovers. Once Libra is able to take the form of W Shepar, he hosts a game show under the name Mr. Lovely that Sonia is invited to participate in. He ends up being deleted by Gemini Spark in order to refill the Andromeda Key. A recurring habit that Libra Scales had was to give others or himself a choice of A or B in a situation, though the choices were always the same (A being annihilation and B being destruction Cooper and his officers, and making both the choices for himself and A and B \\"run\\" when fighting Mega Man when used the Star Force). ;Damian Wolfe : :Damian Wolfe, known as in the original Japanese version, is a gardener and is employed by the owners of the jungle exhibit that Geo and Sonia visit. His introduction to Wolf was abrupt, as the FM-ian just showed up in his Transer one day. He asks Geo to fight him in order to quell his ferocity, which he claims to experience every full moon. Damian and Wolf reappeared as Wolf Woods in Mega Man Star Force 3, as according to the website, he is registered under Project TC as No. 011. He now works as a gardener. In the anime, he works for the family of a young woman named Himeka (Samantha in the dub, voiced by Stephanie Sheh), who he also courts as a possible suitor. Targeted off-screen by Wolf (a particularly ferocious and uncontrollable FM-ian), Damian automatically undergoes Electromagnetic Wave Change (though its effects can be suppressed) whenever he sees anything in the shape of a full moon due to the FM-ian's inability to fully corrupt his heart. He fought Mega Man and Lyra Note at the mall, but Samantha intervened and allowed Damian to break free from Wolf. ;Jean Couronne XIV : : is a deceased French king. Jean Couronne's ship sunk off the coast of Dream Island. His spirit haunts the junkyard, but the circumstances of his meeting with Crown are unknown. He requests that Geo fight him because as it is a family tradition to die fighting, he can not rest in peace until he dies in combat. In the anime, Courrone, though never appearing in the flesh, so to speak, is said to be a king who was overthrown in a revolution and exiled to sea. His ghost is said to guard a treasure buried underneath an amusement park, in turn built over the ruins of Couronne's sunken ship. He is targeted by Crown (an FM-ian who enjoys threatening the weak) off-screen, who gains an immortal vessel in merging with the man's skull. Satellite Admins :Pegasus Magic :Leo Kingdom :Dragon Sky The are survivors of the AM Planet's annihilation, named , , and . Oddly, their names are 2 words rather than one (Leo, Dragon, and Pegasus), titles usually reserved for wave changed humans. Surveyors of the three satellites in Earth's orbit that keep the EM Wave World in check and the wise men of the AM Planet, the Admins question whether Geo and Omega-Xis are strong enough to take on the FM forces, and as a test, Mega Man must battle with one of them in a weakened \\"shadow\\" state. When victorious, Mega Man is given the legendary \\"Star Force,\\" a power which allows him to take on the appearance and abilities of the Satellite Admins themselves. The transformations are Fire Leo, Ice Pegasus, and Green Dragon. The Satellite Admins appear in the secret area in Mega Man Star Force 3. In the anime, the Satellite Admins save Geo from the hands of Cygnus Wing as he was obtaining the Andromeda Key from Omega-Xis. They then bestowed the power of Star Force to allow Geo and Omega-Xis to harness their power. An example how strong Mega Man got from using the Star Force when he first used it, and easily defeated all the FM-ians in one fight. He never lost a fight when had the Star Force until he fought the Andromeda. The Satellite Admins would not be seen again until Gemini Spark re-activated the Andromeda Key using the minus energy of the deleted FM-ians. In a last-ditch effort to subdue Andromeda, the Satellite Admins used a kamikaze technique to stop Andromeda. This appeared to work until Gemini Spark White deleted his other half in order to harness his minus energy and revive Andromeda. Kelvin Stelar Kelvin Stelar, known as in the original version, is Geo's father. He is a respected researcher who mysteriously vanished while trying to make friendly contact with extraterrestrials through the use of Brother Band, a type of EM wave technology. He had a desire to visit the FM Planet, but was unable to do so because he was human, so he pleaded with Omega-Xis to be turned into an EM Wave Human. Just as Kelvin was transforming, the space station where he was working was attacked by Taurus and his spirit was left to wander. The event left his wife devastated, though she continued to nurture her son ‚Äì albeit worriedly ‚Äì on her own. He was absorbed by the Crimson Dragon while in space, battling it the whole time, but was eventually freed and returns home in Mega Man Star Force 3. Hope Stelar Hope Stelar, known in Japan as (, Geo's mother. In both the game and anime, she wishes for Geo to go back to school, but respects his wishes to stay at home. In the anime, she is shown to be a great lover of TV, and to Geo's distaste, likes to order a lot of stuff via television. She is shown to have a love for cooking, though Geo only partially likes some of what she cooks. Hope is also shown to be a bit of a tease with others, especially her son, whom on a few occasions has been teased about his female friends. The anime reduces the time since Kelvin's disappearance from three years to three months. Because of this change, the impact of Kelvin's disappearance is greatly diminished. Claud Pincer and Cancer :Claud Pincer :Cancer Claud Pincer, known as in the original Japanese version, is a boy who frequents at the Big Wave store in Echo Ridge. He has no backstory in the game; he simply wished to test his own power against Geo/Mega Man, though Omega-Xis deduced that since FM-ians are drawn to a human's loneliness, Claud met Cancer because he apparently had no friends, which Claud verified. While Cancer does not have evil intentions like many of his FM brethren, he and his human partner are boastful and pride themselves highly on their skills in battle. He also makes an appearance in Mega Man Star Force 2 as an optional boss on the slopes of Grizzly Peak. Cancer Noise is an available Noise Change in Mega Man Star Force 3. In the anime, he is a cocky and determined third grade student who was saddened by his lack of friends, resulting in his encounter with Cancer (who accidentally merged with Claud when he was trying to merge with the security guard throwing Claud out of Sonia Strumm's concert). He is a die-hard fan of Sonia's and is targeted by Cancer after failing to get into one of her concerts without a ticket where Cancer was trying to target the security guard. Unlike other EM Wave Humans, Cancer Bubble retained Claud's voice and personality, and the transformation is rarely complete (thus, Cancer Bubble is often still wearing Claud's clothes or hat). is based on the constellation Cancer. His form is that of a crab. When fused with Claud, he becomes . In the anime, from his bond with Claud, Cancer also ended becoming a fan of Sonia and even seemed to have a crush on her at times (he was however, unaware that Sonia was also Lyra Note, whom he had a dislike for until he learned the truth). Later in the series, Cancer Bubble takes Cygnus' place as leader to oversee the recreation of the Andromeda Key. He is one of the two FM-ians to evade being deleted by Gemini when it came to powering the Andromeda Key since he went to get Mega Man's help. Later in the Tribe series, Cancer becomes an agent for Sonia, helping around her home. Overall, he's the comic relief of the villains (in battle he's depicted as almost completely harmless), much in the same vein as BubbleMan in the series' predecessor, MegaMan NT Warrior. Furthermore, in the Japanese versions, Cancer commonly ends statements with the word \\"buku,\\" very similar to BubbleMan's tendency to end statements with \\"puku\\" (both buku and puku are Japanese onomatopoeia for a bubble bursting). Kidd Gruff and Goat Foo Kidd Gruff, known as in the original Japanese version, is a young boy from a small town in the Loch Mess area. He met his FM-ian partner, , in Alohaha, but when they combine, they become Kung-Foo Kid ( in the Japanese version), a wood-based martial artist known for his exceptional speed. Kung-Foo Kid was the winning entry in a Japanese contest sponsored by Capcom. He is an optional boss battle in the game. He doesn't make an appearance in the anime. His Japanese last name Yagi, is the Japanese word for \\"goat\\". His English name refers to both a \\"kid\\" (a young goat) and to the fairy tale Three Billy Goats Gruff. Detective Bob Copper Bob Copper, known as in the Japanese version, is a detective and an investigator of incidents involving FM-ians and suspects that Geo, who is often present during the incidents, may be involved. In the anime, Cooper make an incorrect assumption that Mega Man was a criminal and often tried (and failed miserably) to arrest him. Although like everyone else he was never able to figure that Geo was Mega Man, he did grow suspicious of Geo. In the manga, Copper succeeds in capturing both Mega Man and Gemini Spark, and pits the two against one another in a Wave Battle. Copper is pretty stubborn and refuses to trust EM-creatures. His motto he follows for the EM-creatures are \\"Once you have seen one you see them all\\". His last name in Japanese translates to \\"Trouble all around\\". Arthur C. Eos and Acid :Ace Arthur C. Eos (Shid≈ç Akatsuki in the Japanese version), known as A.C. Eos, or simply \\"Ace\\" is a member of the Zero Satella Police and is partnered with the Wizard being known as Acid. Using the Ace Program, they are able to Wave Change to form Acid Ace, and are registered under Project TC as No. 001. Unlike other EM beings, Acid is more material than EM waves. This is due to him being a man- made Wizard. While normally, Real Wizards cannot wave change with humans (A status normally reserved for real EM Beings such as AMians, FMians, and Murians), Acid was designed specifically for that purpose, making him more of a Manmade FMian. Despite this, Wave Changing puts Ace's body and mind under extreme stress, tearing his body apart, and only allowing him to stay Wave changed for a short amount of time. Ace created the Hunter VG, a device replacing the Transer from Mega Man Star Force 2. Acid is infected with Noise by Joker and thus becomes Acid Ace B/Acid Illegal. Mega Man defeats the Noise that infected Acid Ace and he is returned to normal. Later, he absorbs the self-destruct energy emitted by Joker to save Geo and the others, but is deleted in the process. However, he is presumed to be alive when the credits shows a screenshot of Ace in the hospital with Queen Tia and Dr. Goodall at his bedside. Despite Eos's generally cheerful and goofy demeanor, he used to be a member of Dealers before leaving and joining the Satella Police. In the past, he used to have a relationship with Queen Tia. He has a fondness for candy, particularly the \\"Mega Snack\\", an amazingly cheap candy at only 10 Zenny each, but comes in a wide variety of unusual flavors, such as, when noted by Geo and Omega-xis, Pepperoni and Taco Cheese. Woody Boffin and Magnes Woody Boffin (Manabu Kino in Japan) is an employee of Echo Ridge Elementary, where he works in the rocket lab. His goal is to send a rocket into space. He operates two Wizards to help him in his duties: Magnes (Magnets in Japan) and his \\"brother\\" Coil. Corrupted by a Noise Card, courtesy of Queen Tia and Jack, Magnes mutates into a battle form known as Spade Magnes (Spade Magnets in Japan), and can attack with dual-wielded swords and missiles. Megaman manages to revert him back to normal, and Magnes resumes his original goal of launching the rocket. The rocket is later used to travel to the Meteor G core. Belle and Ice Belle (Suzuka in Japan) is a child TV actress, and Ice is a Wizard who functions as her manager. During the shooting for a TV drama co-starring Sonia Strumm, Jack uses a Noise Card to infect her with Noise, whereupon she mutates into Diamond Ice (Dia Iceburn in Japan), a pixie- like battle form that utilizes ice and cold to fight. She sabotages the show's projector and drops the temperature below freezing in order in an attempt to kill Sonia, but with Taurus's help, Mega Man manages to defrost the stage and defeat the crazed Wizard. Afterwards, Ice realizes that she was a little over her head and attempts to resign as Belle's manager because of her actions until Belle points out how much she cares about her. Strong A Wizard who operates the environmental system in the temple on Alohaha Island (Shisaa Island in Japan). A Noise Card mutates him into the hulking Club Strong battle form. Though Mega Man manages to defeat him and revert him back to normal, Strong is soon deleted by Joker so that Queen Tia can harvest his leftover Crimson energy. He is later restored, albeit not to his original self. Antagonists FM-ians ;Taurus : :Taurus, known as in the Japanese version, is based on the constellation Taurus. He is an extremely strong armored bull with the bashfulness of a bull as well. He emits fire to propel himself forward or to burn his enemies. When he fuses with Bud, he becomes Taurus Fire, known as in the original version. Taurus is later deleted by Gemini. In Tribe, Taurus reappears alive and appears behind Bud as he attends Sonia Strumm's concert with the other FM-ians. He returns in the 2nd game via residual wave data left on Bud, which allowed him to turn back into Taurus Fire unintentionally. He also returns in the 3rd game by order of Cepheus, and makes amends with Bud, becoming his Wizard. He also appears as a Noise Change in the third game. ;Cygnus : : is an FM-ian based on the constellation Cygnus. When he fuses with Tom, they become . Cygnus reappears in Mega Man Star Force 3 as a Noise Change for Mega Man, as well as an optional boss, Cygnus' residual data apparently converted to Wizard format for Tom Dubius to use freely with transcode 020. ;Gemini : : is based on the constellation Gemini. When fused with Patrick, they separate into two and become . After his defeat, Gemini is restored by the FM King Cepheus, along with the other FM warriors. In an attempt to stop Geo and Omega-Xis from going to space and fighting Andromeda, he faces them both, using memory data to re-assume the form of Gemini Spark. However, due to Pat's intervention, Geo and Omega-Xis are able to fight back and destroy Gemini, though he is later revived once again by Cepheus. Pat then rejoins Geo's friends. In the game's final scene, it is revealed that it was Gemini who preyed on Cepheus's paranoia and drove him to destroy the planet AM, thus revealed to be the true antagonist in the game. Mega Man, in the third game, is able to obtain Gemini Noise Change. In Tribe, Gemini reappears alive and appears behind Bud as he attends Sonia Strumm's concert with the other FM-ians. ;Libra : : is an old brown looking FM-ian with a balance for a Torso. He is based on Libra. When he takes over Mitch, they become Libra Scales, known as in the Japanese version. He is later deleted by Gemini. In Tribe, Libra reappears alive and appears behind Mitch as he attends Sonia Strumm's concert with the other FM-ians. Libra reappears in Mega Man Star Force 3 as a Noise Change. ;Wolf : : is based on the constellation . When they fuse, they become Wolf Woods, known as in the original Japanese version. He is eventually deleted by Gemini Spark for minus energy. In Tribe, Wolf reappears alive and was seen with the other FM-ians attending the concert of Sonia Strumm where he is behind Damian. Wolf reappears as a Noise Change for Mega Man in the third game, as well as an optional boss, with Damion Wolfe registered with Transcode 011. ;Crown : is an FM-ian based on the Corona Borealis. When fused with Jean Couronne's remains, they become . In the game, he is one of three optional bosses in Mega Man Star Force. In the anime, after being defeated, Crown is later able to take the form of W Couronne, but his body is cold and dead with various arrows protruding from it, causing humans to flee at the sight of him. Like Cancer, he was a fan of Sonia. Gemini Spark ultimately deletes him in order to fill the Andromeda Key with minus energy. In Tribe, Crown reappears alive and appears behind Jean's ghost as he attends Sonia Strumm's concert with the other FM-ians. In the manga, Crown Thunder found Gemini Spark when he was a child, and through their bond of lightning, Crown Thunder decided to raise the child. Crown reappears in the third game as a Noise Change for Mega Man. ;Virgo :Virgo, is based on the constellation Virgo. When she fuses with Queen Tia, she becomes Queen Virgo, known as Queen Virugo in the original version. She was disguised as Queen Tia's wizard and worked with her. Later, when Geo convinced Queen Tia to surrender her plan to destroy Earth's EM Technology, Virgo turned on her and attempted to destroy. Queen Tia was saved by the timely arrival of Rogue. She is revived by Sirius with the ability to EM Wave Change alone. ;Corvus :Corvus, is based on the constellation Corvus. He can EM Wave Change with Jack to become Jack Corvus. He acted as Jack's Wizard for most of the events of Mega Man Star Force 3, but he and Virgo are deleted by Rogue. He is later revived by Sirius with the ability to EM Wave Change without a host. ;Ophiuca : :Ophiuca (Ophiuchus in the anime version) is based on the serpent-tamer constellation, Ophiucus. Her form is that of a dark purple snake, she has the power to control snakes. After her defeat, Ophiuca takes on the form of Luna while gathering minus energy to recreate the Andromeda Key. During this time, Ophiuca often bickered with other FM-ians over how to spend money, and she herself also developed a love of shopping. Eventually, Ophiuca is deleted by Gemini Spark in order to fill the Andromeda Key, though her residual wave data existed on Luna, which, with sufficient force, could transform her back into Queen Ophiucus (Ophiucus Queen in the original version and Queen Ophiuca in the English games). In Tribe, Ophiuca reappears alive and appears behind Luna as she attends Sonia Strumm's concert with the other FM-ians. A Noise Change for her is available in Mega Man Star Force 3. Cepheus is the FM King. His constellation is based on Cepheus. He is the original holder of the Andromeda Key, a device which permits access to a war-engine made up of EM waves throughout the universe known as Andromeda. Under Gemini's suggestion, he obliterated the AM Planet with Andromeda's assistance, and also ordered the assault on the space station from where Kelvin was trying to contact his home world. Cepheus viewed Brother Band as a means for humans to invade and conquer his planet, thus he sought to stop it by declaring war on Earth. He is rescued by Mega Man when Andromeda begins to overload, and turns over a new leaf when offered a hand in friendship. As a token of his appreciation, Cepheus leaves with the Satellite Admins to rebuild the AM Planet from its remnants. He returns in the 3rd game - after it is beaten. Requesting help from Mega Man, he returns to earth due to a black hole attempting to devour the FM and (newly) recreated AM planets. In the anime, Cepheus does not appear until Gemini Spark is defeated. He reverts Gemini Spark White to his human form and erases his memories from after he met Gemini. While at first seeing the Brother Band as a threat, he turns a new leaf after being exposed to it. He comes to Earth to stop Andromeda from destroying it, apologizing to humans for trying to destroy them when they offered friendship. Solo and Laplace Solo is a mysterious character introduced during the events of the second game and anime season as the rival character of the series and Anti-hero of the series. He is the last descendant of the destroyed Mu continent, and is able to EM Wave Change without the aid of a wave being. In his transformed state, he is referred to as Rogue, known as in the original Japanese version. In the game, he desires to collect the OOPArts in order to find out how Mu was destroyed, and so works with Vega to do so, crossing paths with Geo and Omega-Xis multiple times, thinking they are after Mu and his power. He prefers to work alone, and detests Geo for his devotion to his friends and his positive attitude towards bonds. Solo's abilities to see EM waves and Wave Change resulted in him being branded a monster and being brutalized and beaten by gangs, resulting in him closing his heart off to human contact, symbolized by the EM Wave Barrier he uses in combat. It is also revealed in the third game that Solo appears to be quite fond of video games as suggested when he calls Geo about his deleted saved game data and gets mad at Laplace for doing so. In the third installment, he's joined by a new type of EM being (called \\"Wizards\\") named Laplace. Laplace is presumably an EM Being (UMA) freed from the Remnants of Mu when it was destroyed. Laplace was either drawn to Solo's loneliness, or the fact that he is the last Murian alive. Laplace differs from other EM Beings, being more electromagnetic 'light' than material, making him quite opposite to Acid. Since Solo can already perform Wave Change on his own, he does not Wave Change with Laplace. Rather, Laplace uses his Wizard abilities to transform into a large scimitar that Rogue uses in place of his old broadsword. His goal is to eliminate Dealer, the reason being that they are misusing Murian technology. He somewhat reluctantly joins Geo's side in the struggle against Meteor G, and in the finale deletes Virgo and Corvus when they turn on their hosts and brings Jack and Queen Tia back to Earth. Throughout the game, Solo has saved Geo from a number of dangerous encounters, many of which Geo is oblivious to, though Solo mostly does so as an excuse for saying Geo was in his way. During the post-game content involving Sirius, Rogue shows up outside of the Black Hole Server with the intention of defeating Sirius and reclaiming a stolen piece of Murian metal, but does not intend to do so until after the black hole swallows up Planet FM. Upon being defeated, Rogue says that he and Geo will never see eye to eye, but admits that Geo is strong enough to protect his bonds. Solo has been registered by the Satella Police's Project TC as No. 002, suggesting he attempted wave changing soon after the Hunter VG was installed, and before Geo did. Rogue Noise is a secret Noise Change in Mega Man Star Force 3. In the anime, Solo is even more of an enigma, as he appears to be working to collect the OOPArts by himself, and rarely speaks. He is shown to be quite powerful in combat, almost effortlessly defeating Geo upon their first encounter, and later again in a three-on-one fight against Geo, Sonia, and Cancer Bubble. However, Geo proved more than a match for Solo when he gained the Berserk Sword. He eventually disappears through a portal to Mu, and is discovered there by Geo and Sonia much later in stasis. He is then revealed to be the protector of the seal on Le Mu, and only pursued the OOPArts so that they could not be used to revive it. Though defeated by Hollow, he reappears to help Geo seal Le Mu back within Mu for once and for all. Vega Dr. Vega, known as in the original Japanese version, is the primary antagonist of the second Star Force game. She was a scientist from the Tanabata Kingdom whose research led to the creation of Matter Waves, materialized EM waves, but she disappeared after discovering Murian ruins. Her designs for Mu revolve around restoring it and using its power to form the Neo Mu Empire. Those who prove exceptional in some way would be allowed to become a citizen of the new Mu. Her plan required the OOPArt in order to unlock Mu from within the Bermuda Maze (the one involved depends on the version being played). To this end, she recruits Solo, the last living Murian, as well as giving UMA (Unidentified Mystery Animal) wave beings to individuals to carry out her bidding. After Le Mu (Ra Mu in the Japanese version) is defeated, it is revealed that her primary reason for reviving Mu is so that she could use its power to bring her dead lover Altair (the only person whom she ever formed a BrotherBand with), back to life. Altair, who sometimes referred to her by the pet name of \\"Vegalita\\", had to leave her in order to fight in a war. He died fighting in the war, and as a result, Vega became bitter, and ultimately blamed the world for his death, leading her to become a scientist, and after discovering Mu, she vowed to unleashed her vengeance leading to the events in the game. She had created Hollow as a replacement for her lover, Altair, hoping it would bring him back in a sense, but it had neither his personality or memories, but the image of him kept her from destroying him. Hollow would be her loyal follower, and Vega viewed him as such, until he sacrificed himself for her, making Vega realize that she had loved Hollow as well, not as Altair, but as his own person. In the anime, she is introduced as a famous researcher who is known for her writings on ancient civilizations as well as the invention of the Radio Composer that Tom Dubius used when he was controlled by Cygnus. She recruited Geo (being able to figure out that he was really Mega Man) into helping her hunt down the OOPArts because she was worried of what would happen should Mu's \\"Ultimate Lifeform\\", Le Mu, be awakened. In reality, she wanted to awaken Le Mu and have it rule over the world as its god, eventually revealing this when she had Hollow take the Berserk Sword from Mega Man. In the end, she stayed behind on Mu rather than face imprisonment (as opposed to escaping in the game), leaving her final fate open to interpretation. The characters of Vega and Altair are based on the central figures of the Japanese Tanabata star festival. Hollow Hollow ( in the Japanese Version) is Vega's imposing, soft-spoken assistant. His name comes from the fact that he seems almost like an empty shell, with no host. In battle, he attacks by using the four elements and by summoning viruses. Hollow is actually an EM version of Altair (Hiko in the Japanese version), Vega's dead lover. After his death, Vega created a Matter Wave simulacrum of his soul, and placed it inside of a shell body. Hollow, however, had neither the memories nor personality of Altair. Nevertheless, he served Vega faithfully, often acting as a bodyguard, which led to his death when he tried to shield her from Le Mu's power. His final wish was to allow Vega to speak with Altair one last time. In the anime an electrical generator provides him with limitless power, effectively making him invulnerable. In his initial fight in the anime he easily beat Dark Phantom and Yeti Blizzard, then when he turned on Mega Man under Vega's orders not even Berserk Sword's power (with which Mega Man seemed invincible in all his earlier battles) could stop him. The only downside to this was that his range was greatly limited, and he would be rendered vulnerable if the generator was damaged or destroyed, this likely being the reason Vega had Mega Man collect the OOparts, since Hollow was limited to where the generator was, but when given the OOparts he took from Dark Phantom and Yeti Blizzard he overcame this weakness. Eventually when Geo gained all three OOPArts, Hollow was utterly and epically destroyed by Mega Man's Tribe King form, despite his immense power. Vega does get teary-eyed after witnessing Hollow's destruction, implying that there was a deeper connection between the two. The characters of Vega and Altair are based on the central figures of the Japanese Tanabata star festival. Mu EM Body Users ;Hyde and Phantom :Hyde :Phantom : and are antagonists introduced during the events of the second game. Hyde can EM Wave Change with the UMA Phantom. In this form, he is referred to as Dark Phantom ( in the Japanese Version), and resembles Erik from The Phantom of the Opera. He crosses paths with Geo several times throughout the course of the game, performing tasks such as kidnapping and distributing UMAs, until he is tossed aside by Vega. He makes a reappearance in Mega Man Star Force 3, working on his own. Again, he tries to play things by a 'script', and attempts to steal the Ace/Joker program from Geo in an attempt to control the noise himself and gain more power. After his second defeat, he seemingly falls to his death, but Mega Man was sure that he would return. In the anime, Hyde is a painter, yet his works are not very popular due to their macabre nature, leading him to wish for immortality so that he can live to see the time when his works are recognized. The mischievous UMA Phantom, known as in the anime, appears outside his window one day, encouraging him to search for the OOPArts, saying that they will grant him the immortality he seeks. After tangling with both Mega Man and Yeti Blizzard, he manages to steal the Ninja OOPArt. Vega bribes both him and rival Yeti Blizzard into accompanying her to Mu, yet the two escape when the tables begin to turn in Mega Man's favor. He is currently at large. In the anime, Hyde generally depicted as a comical incompetent fool. ;Rich Dotcom and Yeti :Rich Dotcom :Yeti :Rich Dotcom, known as in the original Japanese version, and are antagonists introduced during the events of the second game. Rich is a mafia boss and is often seen with a veritable army of female assistants. He can EM Wave Change with the UMA Yeti and become , a wave being that resembles the Abominable Snowman. In the game, he tries to buy the Grizzly Peak resort, and when that fails, he sabotages the mountain's weather system in an attempt to drive its visitors away. In the anime, Rich first appears in an attack on a museum to steal the Sword of Berserk as Yeti Blizzard, but loses his prize to Mega Man. He is not above bribing or threatening people in order to get what he wants, though Yeti often admonishes him for not using his brain enough. The pair eventually do manage to steal the Saurian OOPArt from the Dombler Lake after manipulating Plesio Surf into distracting Mega Man and Lyra Note. Vega bribes both him and rival Dark Phantom into accompanying her to Mu, yet the two escape when the tables begin to turn in Mega Man's favor. He is currently at large. ;Gerry Romero and Plesio :Gerry Romero :Brachio :Gerry Romero and Plesio, known as Ky≈´ Demegawa and Brachio in the original Japanese version, are two characters introduced during the events of the second game. Romero is the director and host of \\"World Mysteries\\", a Netopian television station and greedily accepts the Plesiosaurus UMA Plesio from Hyde. His wave form is called Brachio Wave in the Japanese version (there is an inconsistency in his English name; see below paragraph). He poses as a monster living in Loch Mess (Dombler Lake in the Japanese version), nicknamed Messie (Dossy in Japan; both names are a play on the Loch Ness monster who is often nicknamed \\"Nessie\\"). He does this to boost his station's ratings, but Mega Man puts an end to his deception. In the U.S. release, there is a localization inconsistency regarding the name of Ky≈´/Gerry's wave form. In the dialog, when he first appears in EM Wave form, he refers to himself as \\"Plesio Wave\\", but the actual boss is identified during the battle as Plesio \\"Surf\\" (in its usual CamelCase abbreviated form), which is also reflected in the relevant battle cards for the character (later dialog uses the \\"Plesio Surf\\" name). In the anime, Romero is head of CMM's Mystery Investigators, sent to investigate reported Messie sightings at Loch Mess. The skeptical reporter is taken over by Plesio, the real Messie, so that he can put an end to development on the lake's shores. Plesio reveals to Sonia and Geo that his attacks are not malicious; he merely wants the lake to be peaceful again. After Rich Dotcom manages to steal the Saurian OOPArt from the lake bottom, Plesio bids farewell to the two, content that the activity will die down. Romero, now convinced of Messie's existence, departs with his crew to investigate other mysteries around the world. In the anime, Romero does not seem to be evil, unlike in the game. ;Chief Osa Agame and Condor :Chief Osa Agame :Condor :Nansuka Village Chief Osa Agame (referred to as simply the \\"Shaman\\" in the U.S. release) and Condor are two characters introduced during the events of the second game. Chief Osa Agame is the leader of Nansuka Village (pronounced \\"Nan-ska\\", a reference to the Nazca Lines, and a shortening of the Japanese \\"nani desu ka,\\" meaning \\"what is it,\\"), in which the people greet each other by saying \\"Nansuka\\". In the U.S. release, both the greeting and the location are renamed \\"Whazzap\\", obscuring references to the aforementioned Nazca Lines (including a section of the village named the \\"Nansuka Lines\\"; this was renamed the \\"Whazzap Lines\\") but retaining the dynamics of the \\"Nanska!\\" greeting used by the natives (\\"What is it?\\" can be loosely translated as \\"What's going on?\\" or \\"What's up?\\"). Additionally, \\"Whazzap\\" is portrayed as a country as opposed the merely being a tribal village originally. Agame accepts Condor from Hyde, believing him to be some kind of deity. His wave form, called Terra Condor (Condor Geograph in the Japanese version), believes Bud Bison is his village's god. He kidnaps Bud, Luna and Zack, but is defeated by Mega Man. In the anime, Agame cares deeply about his village and admires its flowers most of all. However, during a ceremony he is possessed by Condor. As Terra Condor he believes himself to be a god and terrorizes his village. In the end Agame is reminded of his love of flowers, distracting Condor long enough for Mega Man to use the Berserk Sword to land a killing blow and delete the UMA. In the aftermath, he comes to believe that Mega Man is in fact Whazzap's god. His Japanese voice actor is Katsuhisa Houki and Condor's Japanese voice actor is Takeharu Oonishi. Dealer ;Mr. King :Mr. King is the head of Dealer, and the main antagonist of the third installment. He is famous as a genius scientist, and his public persona is that of the head of the King Foundation. In the final battle, he fuses with Meteor G to make the Crimson Dragon ;Heartless :Heartless is a member of Dealer, and she functions as Mr. King's right hand lady. Heartless is revealed to be a spy who originally headed the organization that made it possible to send Kelvin into space. Aside from trying to overthrow King, she had also been attempting to make contact with Kelvin who was trapped inside Meteor G. She is also an old friend of Geo's mother. It is also implied that \\"Heartless\\" is not her real name as Geo's mother reveals that \\"Heartless\\" is one of many names she uses. ;Queen Tia and Virgo :Queen Tia is part of an organization called Dealer. The FM-ian , along with Corvus, is the most wanted criminal on Planet FM. The two can perform Wave Change to form , who is capable of using aquatic attacks such as summoning a dragon made of water. She enters the story by posing as a new teacher at Echo Elementary. It's later revealed that she used to have a relationship with A.C. Eos while he was a member of Dealer. She and her brother were both orphaned in a war sparked over technological advances. As a consequence, the two wish to use Meteor G to destroy the world's technology. Within the Meteor Server, Geo is able to talk them out of revenge, prompting their FM-ian partners to turn on their hosts, but they are deleted by Rogue and the siblings are saved. Queen Tia is later seen by the hospitalized A.C.'s side thus getting back with him. A Noise Change is available with Virgo. ;Jack and Corvus :' is the younger brother of Queen Tia who also works for Dealer. The FM-ian Corvus' is, along with Virgo, the most wanted criminal on Planet FM. He also has something of an axe to grind with Omega-Xis. The two can perform Wave Change to form Jack Corvus, a fire-elemental being who can attack from the skies. He enters the story as a new transfer student at Echo Elementary, filling up Pat Sprigs's empty seat in 5-A. He is mostly emotionless around others, his sister being the only one he can open up to, though he does show a highly aggressive side as well. He and his sister were both orphaned in a war sparked over technological advances. As a consequence, he and his sister wish to use Meteor G's power to destroy the world's technology. Within the Meteor Server, Geo is able to talk them out of revenge, prompting their FM-ian partners to turn on their hosts, but they are deleted by Rogue and the siblings are saved. Jack is later seen celebrating the destruction of Meteor G with his classmates, having finally been able to open up to people. A Noise Change is available with Corvus. ;Joker :Joker is another member of Dealer. He is able to Wave Change to form Dread Joker, a powerful EM being who fights with brute strength. Joker is not actually a human being, but rather Mr. King's wizard, the self- proclaimed \\"most powerful Battle Wizard ever created\\". He draws upon Meteor G itself to achieve his finalized form. Manga Cover art for the first tank≈çbon of the manga produced by Masaya Itagaki. The Ry≈´sei no Rockman manga began running in CoroCoro Comic in November 2006. The manga differs vastly from the video-game and anime iterations of the franchise, although the premise is set up similarly. Geo is grieving the disappearance of his father and questioning the unusual partnership he has gained with the \\"FM-ian\\" Omega- Xis. By combining their powers, they are able to transform into the EM Wave Human named Mega Man and battle crime. Geo soon learns of the Wave Coliseum, a tournament that awards the champion a power known as Star Force. Geo believes this power will allow him to travel to space and find his father, so he enters the tournament. However, complications occur when one of the competitors, Gemini Spark, steals the Star Force in order to revive Andromeda, the king of the FM-ians. This story arc concludes with Mega Man discovering that Andromeda and his father Kelvin had fused as a single EM Wave Human. Defeating Andromeda, Kelvin is freed and returns to Earth to live with his family and new FM-ian friends. From chapter 17 and on the story shifts to focus on characters and concepts from the second video-game. However, Geo and Omega-Xis are completely absent. Instead, the three Tribe-On transformations from the second video-game‚ÄîThunder Zerker, Fire Saurian, and Green Ninja‚Äîare personified as entities of their own. In the past, their tribe was ravaged by a warrior named Rogue. Having grown up, Zerker has taken on the task of invading the continent Mu and hunting down Rogue for revenge. But in order to reach Rogue, Zerker must first traverse an eight-story tower and battle Rogue's underlings every step of the way, including Saurian and Ninja who are under the influence of Mu. Another manga was also serialized in CoroCoro Comic by Kawano Takumi called , a light-hearted story that appears to focus on two separate Mega Men. In order to promote the third installment of the video-game series, Ryo Takamisaki (author of the MegaMan NT Warrior manga) produced a new manga series to run in CoroCoro Comic as of November 2008. Entitled simply , this manga does not reference the previous works by Itagaki and more closely follows the concepts and premises defined by the video-game franchise. The manga introduces A. C. Eos and his Wizard Acid, as well as battles with a Noise-corrupted Spade Magnes and Jack Corvus. As of the January 2009 issue of CoroCoro Comic, the manga has concluded after only two chapters for unknown reasons. As two chapters is not enough to fill a single tank≈çbon, it's doubtful Takamisaki's version will receive a separate release unless it is picked back up for serialization in the future.

The coup overthrew the democratic government of ancient Athens and replaced it with a short-lived oligarchy known as the Four Hundred. In the wake of the financial crisis caused by the failed Sicilian Expedition of the Athenian military in 413 BC, some high-status Athenian men, who had disliked the broad-based democracy of the city-state for a long time, sought to establish an oligarchy of the elite. They believed that they could manage foreign, fiscal, and war policies better than the existing government. The movement toward oligarchy was led by a number of prominent and wealthy Athenians, who held positions of power in the Athenian army at Samos in coordination with Alcibiades. Background By the time of the Peloponnesian War, the democracy in Athens was approximately 100 years old.Kagan (1991), p. 253. Most of the upper class accepted this form of government, while either vying for positions of leadership within it or, remaining aloof outside of it. Until the war, most of the leading Athenian politicians had come from noble families. The democratic form of government in the city-state of Athens remained an anomaly, however, as the rest of the Greek city-states were run either as tyrannies or, most often, by oligarchies. Both Thucydides and Aristotle wrote that \\"the revolution was provoked by defeat in Sicily.\\"Osborne, R., Athens and Athenian Democracy, Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 273. Aristocratic cultural influences Despite the democracy in Athens, Greek tradition remained aristocratic, and the works of Homer celebrated an aristocratic world view, where the nobles made decisions and the commoners obeyed.Kagan (1991), p. 106. The poems of Theognis of Megara (from the sixth century BC) and the Theban poet Pindar (of the fifth century BC) were popular among the Athenian nobles at this time, casting democracy as an immoral and unfair situation where the good (which was equated with noble-birth) were artificially forced into equality with the base (which was equated with common-birth). These poems maintained that virtues such as judgment, moderation, restraint, justice, and reverence could not be taught, and that such inborn qualities were limited to a few, leaving the rest \\"shameless and arrogant\\". These poets compared the masses to the noble born, who were supposedly inherently superior. It was implied that the gap between them could not be overcome by education.Kagan (1991), pp. 106‚Äì07. During the war, a pamphlet entitled Athenian Constitution, was produced and credited to an author now known as the \\"Old Oligarch\\".Kagan (1991), p. 108. He derided the democracy writing \\"As for the constitution of the Athenians, I do not praise them for having chosen it, because in choosing it they have given the better of it to the vulgar people (poneroi) rather than to the good (chrestoi).\\" The constitution established a system that assigned safe, salaried positions by random lot, but left the hazardous jobs, such as that of the generals and cavalry commanders to election of \\"the best qualified\\".Pseudo-Xenophon, Athenaion Politeia, 1. 1, 3, quoted in Kagan (1991), p. 109. In contrast, such men praised the eunomia (\\"good law\\") of the constitutions of Sparta and Corinth. They longed for a time when Athens would adopt the ways of its neighbours and allow only \\"the best and most qualified\\" to deliberate public affairs and make the laws. They held that in such a situation the people would \\"fall into servitude\\" naturally.Kagan (1991), p. 109.Low, P., The Athenian Empire, Edinburgh University Press, 2008, p. 258. Fiscal burden The Peloponnesian war had brought on unprecedented fiscal burden on the propertied classes of Athens, a burden that continued to multiply as the war dragged on. The early costs to maintain the military had grown exponentially when the Athenians were countered by a Peloponnesian navy that threatened to cut off their food supply. To address this threat the Athenians had to keep at sea as large a fleet as possible throughout the year. At the same time the public expenditure going to citizens had not been decreased, but raised. Additionally, the loss of public revenue from tribute-paying states that rebelled, and a reduction in the collection of custom duties due to a drop in trade because of the war, put severe stress on the Athenian coffers. The damage to the economy was intense enough to cause a reduction in the number of citizens with enough wealth to take on the fiscal burden of state, religious and military service. Before the war, the number of men fit and able to afford to be on the hoplite census or above (and therefore, be qualified to perform the accompanying liturgies) was approximately 25,000. By 411 BC (thinned by plague, war casualties and economic drain) the number was nearer to 9,000. This was a radical drop in the number of citizens available to pay the expenses of the city-state. Historian Donald Kagan calculates from ancient records that the special war taxes, religious services, and other fiscal demands legally required from the wealthy by the city state during a seven- year period (411‚Äì404 BC) was 2.5 talents. Kagan reminds us \\"that a talent consisted of 6,000 drachmas, that a drachma was a very good day's pay in the late fifth century, and that in those years an Athenian citizen rowing in the fleet was expected to get by on half that amount.\\" Among the things expected of wealthy Athenians, besides special war taxes and religious obligations, were the production of comic and tragic dramas, paying for choral competitions, dancers, athletic contests, trireme races, equipping triremes for battle in the war, serving in positions such as trierarch, and contributing to the eisphora, and a tax on the wealth of the very rich‚Äîlevied only when needed‚Äîusually in times of war. Kagan points out that, according to ancient documents, \\"Nicias, one of the richest men in Athens, was expected to leave an estate of no more than 100 talents and that his son, not a notorious wastrel, left no more than 14 talents to his heir.\\" Kagan concludes \\"There is good reason to think that the fortunes of many Athenian families were seriously reduced by public services during the Peloponnesian War. By 411, and especially in the years since the sicilian disaster, the unprecedented expense would already have been strongly felt, and it would not take much imagination for the propertied classes to see that there would be similar and even greater demands in the future.\\" Despite the payments forced on the nobles, the fiscal situation of the Athenian empire remained in crisis. By June 411 BC, the Athenian leaders at Samos informed their troops that the city was no longer supplying them with money and they would have to get their own. The ancient historian Xenophon reports that, by that winter, the generals in the Hellespont had to set aside time to gather funds. Leadership turnover Causing further discontent was the fact that, by 411 BC many of the respected political figures from the nobility, such as Cimon, Pericles and Nicias, had been replaced by people of lower class, such as Cleon, Hyperbolus and the noble-born but disreputable Alcibiades. Alcibiades, in 415 BC, had been accused of defaming the god Hermes and sentenced to death in absentia, a sentence causing him to flee and join the services of Sparta to escape. With a lack of well-respected political leaders, division in Athenian society increased. By 411 BC the clubs known as hetairiai gained increasing political importance and were an outlet for those who opposed the system of democracy. With the military setback at Sicily, discontent with the city state's political institutions intensified even among the general populace. Previous rumours of plots The ancient historian Thucydides mentions that there was already a suspicion of a plot to overthrow the democracy before the battle of Tanagra in 457 BC and rumours of a conspiracy to replace the Athenian democracy just before the Sicilian expedition in 415 BC. Early involvement by Alcibiades Such was the attachment to the traditional full democracy and the recognition of its general support, that despite the perceived foolishness of military and fiscal policies, incompetence in seeing them through, the vacuum of respectable leadership, the terrible fiscal burden placed upon them, and the fear of total annihilation, it was not the aristocrats of Athens who instigated the 411 BC coup. Instead, the idea was instigated from outside the city, by Alcibiades.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, The Peloponnesian War. Alcibiades, ostensibly working for the Spartans at the time, encouraged the ideas developing among the oligarchs by claiming he could secure much needed funds for Athens from Persian satraps in western Anatolia, such as Tissaphernes (who was giving him protection) under the promise that the democracy would end). This also would open the way for Alcibiades to be allowed to return to Athens from his exile. His negotiations with the Persians already had raised suspicions among the Spartans, who worried he was concerned only with his own self-interests. He also had angered one of the two Spartan kings, Agis II, reportedly by seducing his wife. Alcibiades sent communications to the important Athenian generals, trierarchs and others with influence, asking them to mention him to \\"the best people.\\" They were to note his influence on Tissaphernes and state that he wanted to return, but only if the base and unfair democratic system that had ruled against him was replaced with an oligarchy. He then would return to Athens bringing the support of Tissaphernes with him. The Athenians did not know that Alcibiades' relationship with Tissaphernes was precarious, for each man was pursuing his own interests, and it was only a matter of time before their association was abandoned. Events on Samos The ancient historian Thucydides notes that the ploy by Alcibiades worked, \\"for the Athenian soldiers at Samos perceived that he had influence with Tissaphernes,\\" and sent envoys from their camp to speak to him. Thucydides does not place all the blame on Alcibiades, maintaining that the coup eventually would have gone ahead without his ploy ‚Äì \\"But even more than the influence and promises of Alcibiades, of their own accord, the trierarchs and the most important men among the Athenians at Samos were eager to destroy the democracy.\\" Samian delegation Historian Donald Kagan notes that the response at Samos to Alcibiades was split. Some wanted to side with him as a means to bring about oligarchy, others, such as the trierarch Thrasybulus, abhorred oligarchy, but felt that Alcibiades should be allowed to return in order to serve Athens, even if that meant making adjustments to the government of Athens that would make it less broadly democratic. A delegation was sent out to speak to Alcibiades and to gather more information. Included in the delegation was Thrasybulus, who was willing to make moderate changes to the Athenian system to secure aid from some Persian sources. Also in the delegation was Peisander, who had never favored oligarchy previously, both having a reputation as a demagogue and playing a large part in the prosecutions of the scandals of 415 BC. Another of those who had heard about Alcibiades' offer was Phrynichus, although there is no evidence that he was in the delegation that went to speak with the renegade. Phrynichus also was seen as a demagogue with no inclination toward oligarchy. He had made such a successful career as a democratic politician that he was voted into the position of general. According to the ancient historian Thucydides, Alcibiades promised the delegation that not only could he deliver the support of Tissaphernes, but also that of the Great King of Persia \\"if they did not retain the democracy, for in that way the King would have greater trust in them.\\"Thucydides, quoted in Kagan (1991), p. 120. Alcibiades apparently judged the more moderate mood of his guests and substituted the demand for an oligarchy with a request that the pure direct democracy in Athens no longer be retained.Kagan (1991), p. 121. Returning to Samos, the delegation and other notables, plus men from the ranks of hoplites stationed at Samos (who were among the thousands sent on the Milesian campaign), joined in a xynomosia (conspiracy) taking an oath and speaking on the proposal of Alcibiades. The delegation relayed what they had learned and decided to announce Alcibiades' proposal to all the military forces stationed at Samos. According to Thucydides, they were brought together \\"and openly told the many that the King would be their friend and provide them with money if they took back Alcibiades and were not governed by a democracy. ... The mob, ... even if it was somewhat annoyed at the moment by what had been done, subsided into silence because of the hopeful prospect of pay from the King.\\" Historian Donald Kagan holds that it is unlikely that they were motivated purely by greed for the Persian King's money, writing, \\"The salvation of their city was at issue, perhaps their own lives and those of their families, for they could not be sure that a victorious and vengeful enemy would not treat Athens as the Athenians had treated Scione and Melos.\\" By agreeing, however, \\"they could obtain the financial support that would allow them to carry on the war and win it.\\" Phrynichus' protest After addressing the military, the notables leading the movement gathered to decide whether Alcibiades' proposal should be accepted. Everyone approved of the idea except for Phrynichus, who completely opposed it. Phrynichus maintained that the Great King could not be convinced to side with the Athenians, as his interests opposed theirs. Since the Athenians no longer had a naval monopoly in the Aegean and had lost large cities to the Peloponnesians, there was no reason for the Persians to try to use money in order to garner good relations. There was a long history of animosity and open warfare between Athens and the Persians, with no such lingering memories between Persia and the Peloponnesians. In rebuttal, another notable held that perhaps if Athens replaced democracy with oligarchy, those cities that had rebelled against it would return, as many of them had adopted oligarchies. It was asserted further that this change would prevent other cities from moving into rebellion as well. Phrynichus rejected this reasoning, holding that none of that would come true, for none of the cities \\"will want to be enslaved with either an oligarchy or a democracy rather than to be free under whichever of these happens to exist [locally].\\" In addition such cities would see themselves as better off under the rule of a democratic power, as the upper classes profit most from empire and are less worried about following due process. Phrynichus' main argument was that Alcibiades could not be trusted, because he did not care about any form of government. He only wanted a change in the Athenian constitution so he then could get his partisans in Athens to demand he be allowed to return. Phrynichus felt that should he return, this would cause violent civil unrest, which was the last thing they needed in the current circumstances. Phrynichus' advice was to continue on their current path and reject the overtures of the dangerous enemy, Alcibiades. With the current state of crisis, Phrynichus' proposal to stay the course was rejected, and the group decided to accept Alcibiades' offer. They appointed an embassy under Peisander to go to Athens and to end the current democratic system to allow the return of Alcibiades and win over the support of Tissaphernes. After the meeting, Phrynichus sent a letter to an enemy, Spartan admiral Astyochus, informing him of the plan and of Alcibiades' role. He excused his own betrayal of Athens, saying for a man \\"it was pardonable to plot evil against a man who was his enemy even to the disadvantage of the state\\". Uprising at Samos According to Thucydides, in 412 BC when the Samian people heard of the plot against the democracy, they went to some of their leaders, including Thrasybulus, \\"who seemed always to be especially opposed to the conspirators.\\" Thrasybulus and his companions then rallied the Athenian sailors to defend the Samian democracy. The conspirators were overwhelmed and the democratic factions made all of the soldiers swear loyalty to the democracy, particularly those who had been involved with the oligarchs. Newly sworn, the democratic army deposed its generals and elected new ones who were reliably democratic. Thrasybulus was one of these newly elected generals. Historian Donald Kagan holds that Thrasybulus and his supporters were not willing to abolish democracy completely, but were willing to curtail its powers temporarily in order to deal with the immediate emergency of possible annihilation by enemies of Athens. Therefore, when they went to meet with Alcibiades, he \\"no longer used the offensive word oligarchy but promised to return and perform his wonders 'if the Athenians were not under a democracy.' The subtle shift in language was probably real and a concession to men [such as] Thrasybulus who were prepared to alter the constitution but not to move to oligarchy.\\" Despite knowing Alcibiades' conditions for his return, Thrasybulus persuaded the Athenian forces at Samos to vote to grant him immunity, recall him to duty, and elect him general. He then sailed across to Tissaphernes and brought Alcibiades back to Samos. The ancient historian Thucydides records, \\"He brought Alcibiades back to Samos thinking that the only safety for Athens was if he could bring Tissaphernes [and the Persian fiscal support] away from the Peloponnesians and over to their side.\\" Role of the probouloi When news of the military defeat at Sicily reached Athens, the populace was sure that the Sicilians would press their advantage and send an invasion fleet to Attica. Not only did a successful conclusion to the war seem remote to the Athenians, but the total annihilation of their city-state seemed possible. To offset these dreadful worries, action and determination were called for. In light of this perceived emergency, a board of elders was elected in 413 BC to secure funds and lumber (for ships and defences) and take measures to end the economic slump. These elders also would act as preliminary advisers (probouloi) whenever the situation seemed to demand it. They were seen as prudent men countering the panic of the general populace within the democracy. Judging from the comic play Lysistrata by Aristophanes, these probouloi, in their role as preliminary councillors, took over many of the prerogatives that used to be the realm of the council. This included ensuring order, arranging ambassadors, and allocating funds for the navy. in his work Politics, Aristotle discusses the implications to a democracy concerning the use of such probouloi. The orator Lysias recorded that Theramenes was a leader involved in the adoption of an oligarchy, and his father, who was one of the probouloi, \\"was active in this business\\". Aristotle, in a discussion in his Rhetoric, recalls that one of the probouloi, the tragedian Sophocles, admitted approving of setting up the 400, saying that although it appeared like a bad thing to do, \\"there was nothing better to be done.\\" Those favouring oligarchy persuaded the assembly to allow commissioners to rewrite the Athenian constitution. According to the historian Thucydides, there were ten of these commissioners, while Aristotle puts the number at 20 and specifies that these commissioners were in addition to the ten probouloi. The new constitution replaced the previous council with one consisting of 400 men who would not be paid by stipend (thus barring the lower classes). Five men would be chosen for the role of \\"presidents\\", and together they would choose 100 men for the council, each of these, in turn, would choose three others, producing a total of 400. It was claimed that this organization was \\"according to the ancestral constitution\\". The 400 would have the power to choose 5,000 Athenians who would be the only citizens eligible to partake in assemblies. Coup The oligarchs plotted two coups: one at Athens, and one at Samos, where the Athenian navy was based. The coup at Athens went forward as planned, and \\"[o]n the fourteenth day of the Attic month of Thargelion, June 9, 411, ... the [conspirators] seized the reality of power.\\"Kagan, Donald, The Fall of the Athenian Empire, p. 147. Cornell University Press, 1991. . The city came under the control of the oligarchic government of the Four Hundred. According to W. G. Forest: Unlike in Athens, the plotters in Samos were thwarted by Samian democratic and pro-democratic leaders in the Athenian fleet. The men of the fleet, upon learning of the coup at home, deposed their generals and elected new ones in their place. They announced that the city had revolted from them, not they from the city. The new leaders of the fleet arranged the recall of Alcibiades to Samos, and declared their intention to carry on the war against Sparta.Kagan, Donald, The Fall of the Athenian Empire, p. 173. Cornell University Press, 1991. . Internal division and fall The government of the Four Hundred in Athens suffered from instability, as conflict soon arose between moderates and extremists among the oligarchs. The moderates, led by Theramenes and Aristocrates, called for the replacement of the Four Hundred with a broader oligarchy of \\"the 5,000\\", which would include all citizens of zeugitai status or higher. Under pressure, the extremist leaders opened peace negotiations with Sparta and began constructing a fortification in the harbor of Piraeus, which they might have considered handing over to the Spartans. After the leader of the extremists, Phrynichus, was assassinated, the moderates grew bolder and arrested an extremist general in Piraeus. A confrontation ensued, which ended with the hoplites in Piraeus tearing down the new fortification. Several days later, the Four Hundred were replaced officially by the 5,000, who ruled for several more months, until after the Athenian victory at Cyzicus.Kagan, Donald, The Fall of the Athenian Empire, p. 195.

SPG stands for \\"Society for the Propagation of Gospel\\" which was renamed \\"Church of South India\\" in the 1960s. History The school was established in the 1850s as an adjunct to the Protestant Church which is located a few hundred yards from the school. In the 1950s the Principal of the school also functioned as correspondent (manager) of the church and was provided accommodation on church premises. The church grounds had a small dormitory for boys and living quarters for the warden. The grounds were available as playground for the school's students. In later years the association between the church and the school appears to have become weaker and the Principal lived elsewhere in the city. A girls school by the same name offering instruction from class 1 to 8 was located near Manohar cinema a few hundred meters from the boys School. The girls school admitted boys also up to class 4. Boys could transfer for class 5 to the boys school. The medium of instruction was English (but in the 1950s and 1960s the medium of instruction was both Telugu and English). It was one of the few schools in Telangana that provided an option to register Tamil as the first language. This option was available to students in the English medium classes and for Tamil language classes the students would move to a different room. Due to the preponderance of Defence and Railway installations in Secunderabad, there was a large Tamil speaking population and this school catered to its needs. The school had one of the best football teams in the twin city. The NCC in the school was also one of the best in the twin cities and on 15 August and on 26 January every year a special parade of the three wings was held. Now its premises are used as a parking lot for a nearby hotel.

Early controversies Until 1920, the RCMP's forerunner, the Royal Northwest Mounted Police, operated only in Western Canada and the North. The new organization was created by an amalgamation with the Dominion Police, giving the RCMP a national security mandate as a departure from its earlier role as a frontier police force. Early controversies grew from its preoccupation with Communism and the labour movement. Following from its operations in the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, the RCMP intervened in labour disputes, not as an impartial law enforcement agency, but to assist with breaking strikes. In one incident, RCMP officers clashed with striking coal miners for 45 minutes in Estevan, Saskatchewan in 1933 and killed three miners during the Estevan Riot. Part of its strategy against labour organizing included extensive use of spies for surveillance of suspected Communists, which was revealed at the court trial that convicted the leadership of the Communist Party under Section 98 of the Criminal Code in 1932. Political surveillance activities were conducted out of its Criminal Investigation Department until a separate branch, the RCMP Security Service, was established in 1950. The RCMP was also the force used to stop the On-to-Ottawa Trek by precipitating another bloody clash that left one Regina city police officer and one protester dead in the 1935 Regina Riot. The Mounties were frequently criticized for these activities by labour and the left, including one of its most prominent surveillance targets, Member of Parliament J. S. Woodsworth. A dispute with the Government of Alberta over prohibition led to the creation of a separate Alberta Provincial Police from 1917 to 1932. Killing of Inuit- owned sled dogs There have been many Inuit accounts related to the alleged killings of sled dogs during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, as well as the impact of the federal government's efforts during that time to relocate Inuit into modern settlements. Theft of dynamite In April 1971, a team of RCMP officers broke into the storage facilities of Richelieu Explosives, and stole an unspecified amount of dynamite. A year later, in April 1972, officers hid four cases of dynamite in Mont Saint-Gr√©goire, in an attempt to link the explosives with the FLQ. This was later admitted by Solicitor General Francis Fox on October 31, 1977. Intelligence mole In 1972, it was suspected that there was a Soviet infiltrator in the ranks of Canadian intelligence. Suspicion initially fell upon Leslie James Bennett. With Bennett's personal leftist politics, and past acquaintanceship with defector Kim Philby, he was pilloried as the most likely suspect by the RCMP themselves, although the RCMP was asked to investigate Bennett by James Jesus Angleton of the CIA.Michael Howard Holzman, James Jesus Angleton, the CIA, and the craft of counterintelligence (U of Mass Press, 2008) p. 218 The accusations and interrogations by the police led to the breakdown of Bennett's marriage and early retirement.Sawatsky, John. \\"For Services Rendered: Leslie James Bennett and the RCMP Security Service\\", 19782 In the 1980s it was discovered that the mole had actually been Sergeant Gilles Brunet, the son of an RCMP assistant commissioner. Barn-burning scandal On the night of May 6, 1972, the RCMP Security Service burned down a barn owned by Paul Rose's and Jacques Rose's mother in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Rochelle, Quebec. They suspected that separatists were planning to meet with members of the Black Panthers from the United States. The arson came after they failed to convince a judge to allow them to wiretap the alleged meeting place. This was later admitted by Solicitor General Francis Fox on October 31, 1977. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rod Stamler later said that the barn-burning operation was \\"morally wrong and unlawful\\" and if the police leadership condones such actions, it will lose control of the (police) force.\\" Staff Sergeant Donald McCleery (1934-2014) was involved in the operation, and following his retirement from the RCMP ran his own \\"investigation and surveillance\\" company in Montreal, Quebec. The firm was acquired by Gardium S√©curit√© in 2008. Theft of PQ members list In 1973, more than thirty members of the RCMP Security Service committed a break-in to steal a computerized members list of Parti Qu√©b√©cois members, in an investigation dubbed Operation Ham. This was later admitted by Solicitor General Francis Fox on October 28, 1977. John Starnes (RCMP), head of the RCMP Security Service, claimed that the purpose of this operation was to investigate allegations that the PQ had funneled $200,000 worth of donations through a Swiss banking account. Break-ins and bombing  A series of more than 400 illegal break-ins by the RCMP were revealed by Vancouver Sun reporter John Sawatsky in his front-page expos√© headline \\"Trail of break-in leads to RCMP cover-up\\" on December 7, 1976. The story won the Vancouver Sun the Michener Award that year. It wasn't until the following year that it was uncovered that the October 6, 1972, break-in at the Agence de Presse Libre du Qu√©bec office, had been the work of an RCMP investigation dubbed Operation Bricole, not right-wing militants as previously believed. The small leftist Quebec group had reported more than a thousand significant files missing or damaged following the break-in. One RCMP, one SQ and one SPVM officer pleaded guilty on June 16, 1977, but were given unconditional discharges. A similar break-in occurred at the same time, at the office of the Mouvement pour la D√©fense des Prisonniers Politiques Qu√©b√©cois. In 1974, RCMP Security Service Corporal Robert Samson was arrested at a hospital after a failed bombing - the bomb exploded while in his hands, causing him to lose some fingers and tearing his eardrums - at the house of Sam Steinberg, founder of Steinberg Foods in Montreal. While this bombing was not sanctioned by the RCMP, at trial he announced that he had done \\"much worse\\" on behalf of the RCMP, and admitted he had been involved in the APLQ break-in. On April 19, 1978, the Director of the RCMP criminal operations branch, admitted that the RCMP had entered more than 400 premises without warrant since 1970. Inquiries In 1977, the Quebec provincial government launched the Keable Inquiry into Illegal Police Activities, which resulted in 17 members of the RCMP being charged with 44 offences. In the same year, a Royal Commission was formed by Justice David McDonald entitled Inquiry Into Certain Activities of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate allegations of vast wrongdoing by the national police force. The inquiry's 1981 recommendation was to limit the RCMP's role in intelligence operations, and resulted in the formation of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service three years later. Excessive use of force at the 1997 APEC Summit In 1997, the APEC summit was held in Vancouver, British Columbia. Controversy arose after officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police used pepper spray and strip searches against protesters, who were objecting to the presence of several autocratic leaders such as Indonesian president Suharto. A subsequent public inquiry concluded that the RCMP was at fault, showing a lack of professionalism and a failure of planning. The report also charged that the Canadian government interfered with police operations, possibly in an effort to shield certain leaders from being publicly embarrassed by the protests. Killing of Darren Varley In 1999 RCMP Constable Michael Ferguson fatally shot local resident Darren Varley after being attacked inside the holding cells at a Pincher Creek police station. Ferguson was prosecuted twice for murder, resulting in two hung juries, and was then convicted of the killing and found guilty of manslaughter.  RCMP bombing in Alberta, scapegoating farmer  The RCMP bombed an oilsite in Alberta on October 14, 1998, on the instructions of the Alberta Energy Co. No injuries were caused or intended. The Crown lawyers, representing the government, accepted that the allegations were true. An Alberta farmer was blamed for the bombing. He had been complaining about oil pollution causing a nuisance. The court held him and another farmer without bail. Torture scandal: Ahmad El Maati, Abdullah Almalki and Maher Arar On September 26, 2002, during a stopover in New York City en route from a family vacation in Tunisia to Montreal, Maher Arar was detained by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, acting upon information supplied by the RCMP. Arar was sent to Syria where he was imprisoned for more than 10 months, tortured and forced to sign a false confession that he had trained in Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. A public campaign ended in his release and won a public inquiry into his case, which found that he had no ties to terrorism. Like Arar, Ahmad El Maati, Abdullah Almalki and Muayyed Nureddin are Canadian Muslim men who were detained and tortured overseas while under investigation by Canadian investigators. They were all detained when they arrived in Syria and taken to the same Syrian detention centre ‚Äî the Far' Falastin, or Palestine Branch ‚Äî of the Syrian Military Intelligence. All were tortured. All were interrogated by the same Syrian interrogation team, who accused them all of links to terrorism using information and questions that could only have originated with Canadian agencies. The Arar Inquiry has already determined that the RCMP sent questions for Abdullah Almalki to his Syrian interrogators. As in the case of Arar, unnamed Canadian officials used the media to publicly accuse El Maati and Almalki of having ties to al-Qaeda. No Canadian official has admitted to making these accusations in the media, and many years later, no evidence has ever been produced to back their claims. Like Arar, El Maati and Nureddin were eventually released without charge. Almalki was cleared, acquitted and released. When they returned to Canada, they all called for a process which would expose the truth about the role of Canadian agencies in what happened to them, and which would help them clear their names and rebuild their lives. Their stories and the story of the RCMP investigation likely responsible for what happened to at least three of them are told in a new book by Kerry Pither called Dark Days: The Story of Four Canadians Tortured in the Name of Fighting Terror. On September 28, 2006, RCMP Commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli issued a carefully worded public apology to Arar and his family during the House of Commons committee on public safety and national security: > Mr. Arar, I wish to take this opportunity to express publicly to you and to > your wife and to your children how truly sorry I am for whatever part the > actions of the RCMP may have contributed to the terrible injustices that you > experienced and the pain that you and your family endured. In a subsequent December 2006 appearance in front of the Commons committee, Zaccardelli said the timeline‚Äîregarding what he knew at the time and what he told government ministers‚Äîgiven in his first appearance in September was inaccurate. He resigned the following day. On January 26, 2007, after months of negotiations between the Canadian government and Arar's Canadian legal counsel, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a formal apology \\"for any role Canadian officials may have played in what happened to Mr. Arar, Monia Mazigh and their family in 2002 and 2003\\" and announced that Arar would receive $10.5 million settlement for his ordeal and an additional $1 million for legal costs. Ahmad El Maati and Abdullah Almalki, meanwhile, still await answers in their cases from the secretive Iacobucci Inquiry into the RCMP and other Canadian agencies' alleged role in their overseas detention and torture. Pension fund scandal In 2004, Andrew McIntosh, an investigative journalist at The National Post, revealed a secret audit that detailed misuse of millions of dollars by the RCMP of its own members' pension fund. He also revealed that several people had been forced from their jobs because of the scandal, but that there had not been a proper probe into the irregularities. The same day his story was published, Commissioner Zaccardelli announced the force would pay back to the pension fund the millions misused and that he called for a police probe by Ottawa Police Force, though Zaccardelli somehow managed to maintain control over the probe and nobody was subsequently charged. After Zaccardelli's resignation in 2007, a public accounts committee heard several testimonies from former and serving RCMP officers alleging serious fraud and nepotism at the upper management level under Zaccardelli. The fraud allegations go back to 2002 and are related to RCMP pension and insurance plans for members of the force. Zaccardelli launched and then two days later cancelled a criminal investigation into the matter, which was resumed by the Ottawa Police Service after his resignation. That investigation found serious nepotism and wasteful spending. A follow-up investigation by the Auditor- General found millions of dollars inappropriately charged to the pension and insurance plans. A subsequent investigation conducted by a former head of the Ontario Securities Commission strongly criticized the management style of Zaccardelli, who, he said, was responsible for \\"a fundamental breach of trust\\" and called for a major shake-up of the force. Specifically, RCMP members and employees who attempted to address the pension fund issue suffered \\"career damage\\" for doing so, according to the investigators findings. Interim RCMP Commissioner Beverley Busson concurred with the recommendations and promised that individuals that the upper ranks attempted to silence would be thanked and recognized. Constable Justin Harris and the Prince George RCMP Following the 2002 case of a Prince George judge, David Ramsay, who pleaded guilty to misconduct with young prostitutes, similar allegations were made against Constable Justin Harris and other RCMP officers. Harris was accused of having touched an underage prostitute, paying a prostitute for sex, and refusing to pay at all, between 1993 and 2001.Accused RCMP officer says force acted too late against him, CBC, Tuesday, October 3, 2006. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act forbids a hearing from taking place more than one-year after a senior officer has been made aware of such allegations, but because the allegations had been made against nine officers with little evidence, the RCMP did not launch a criminal investigation against Harris and did not launch a misconduct hearing until 2005. On October 4, 2006, the RCMP disciplinary board decided to stop all proceedings against Harris because the investigation conflicted with the RCMP Act. (This decision has since been appealed by the senior RCMP officer in BC)Hearing dismissed for Mountie accused of having sex with teen prostitutes CBC, Wednesday, October 4, 2006 Public outcry from people like Daisy Kler of Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter criticized the RCMP's internal investigation policies. Ian Bush incident On October 29, 2005, Ian Bush, 22 was arrested in Houston, British Columbia. At the RCMP detachment office, Bush died due to a single gunshot wound to the back of the head. Constable Paul Koester and Bush were alone in the interrogation room. Koester claimed Bush attacked him, and that he was being choked from behind to unconsciousness and acted in self-defence. An investigation was conducted by an RCMP team brought in from another region. That investigation was reviewed by several agencies including the Ministry of the Attorney General of BC, and the federal Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Koester was cleared of any wrongdoing. The Coroner's Inquest into the death reached the same conclusion. Conflicting evidence was given at the inquest. The analyses of the blood spatter evidence by an RCMP forensics officer, Jim Hignell, and Edmonton police constable, Joseph Slemko, differed; the former supporting Koester's account, the latter contradicting it. Robert Dzieka≈Ñski taser incident The Robert Dzieka≈Ñski Taser incident occurred when a Polish immigrant who arrived at the Vancouver International Airport on October 14, 2007, and waited 10 hours at the airport before being taken into police custody. He died after being tasered a total of five times by a group of four RCMP officers and then placed face down with several officers sitting on top of him. The cause of death was ruled to be positional asphyxia. Police have been heavily criticized for their handling of the incident, and the incident has revived debate concerning police use of tasers in Canada. , a public inquiry is evaluating the use of conducted energy weapons (Tasers) in British Columbia, and to provide the public with a complete record of the circumstances of Robert Dziekanski‚Äôs death. Royal Inland Hospital taser incident In May 2008, at Royal Inland Hospital in Kamloops, an RCMP officer used a taser on 82-year-old Frank Lasser while he was in his hospital bed. He was reportedly \\"delirious\\" and wielding a knife. Allegation of political bias against Insite In October 2008, it was revealed that the RCMP had used taxpayer money to pay individuals to write negative, politically biased reports about the Vancouver safe injection site, Insite. In addition to this, memos were distributed referring to British Columbia's Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS - a nationally renowned repository of some of the top AIDS research in the world - as the \\"Centre for Excrements\\", and suggesting stacking radio shows with callers against Insite.  Mountie takes woman home from jail  In 2011, a northern Manitoba RCMP officer took an intoxicated woman he had arrested out of a cell and to his home to \\"pursue a personal relationship.\\" Several of his colleagues witnessed this but only two reported it. The constable admitted to the allegations, got a reprimand and lost pay for seven days. The Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation has called for an independent investigation. Criticism from SCC on failure to protect wife who hired hitman In January 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada criticized the RCMP for pursuing charges against Nicole Doucet Ryan (also known as Nicole Patricia Ryan) after she attempted to hire an undercover officer as a hitman to kill her husband. The criticisms were based on her post-arrest courtroom allegations of abuse, which proved highly controversial since the judges based their decision and criticism entirely on her testimony that she had called the RCMP to report the abuse but received no help. The former husband was never called to appear in court but refuted that he was abusive. After an internal investigation the RCMP stated that no allegations of abuse were ever brought forward by Nicole Ryan. On February 6, it was announced that The Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police would investigate the allegations.  High River weapons search  On June 21, 2013, High River, Alberta suffered major flooding; the residents were evacuated, and the town searched for anyone stranded. By June 24, High River RCMP reported to Edmonton that they had completed their search of every home in town, 3,337 in all. After June 24 the RCMP checked approximately 1900 homes for firearms. The check continued until July 10.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEQiCDYowi4 - Sun News documentary \\"Broken Trust\\" - YouTubehttp://www.torontosun.com/2014/04/11/kicking-down-doors-of-high-river- gun-controversy - column by Lorne Gunter; on the High River gun grab - Toronto Sun  Discrimination against women  Janet Merlo claim of misconduct In 2007 Janet Merlo filed a claim of harassment and misconduct against the RCMP stating that their continual abuse over a decade of service had led to depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. In 2015, hearings were held to determine if her case should be elevated to a class action, as nearly 400 other women officers had asked to join it. Sherry Lee Benson-Podolchuk In 2007, Sherry Lee Benson-Podolchuk wrote and published Women Not Wanted, which detailed her experiences with frequent harassment during her 20-year career as the sole female officer in the Prairie region at the time. Benson- Podolchuk sued the RCMP, eventually settling out of court in 2009. Catherine Galliford claim of sexual harassment In November 2011, Corporal Catherine Galliford, a former spokeswoman for the British Columbia Division, came forward with a claim that she had been the victim of sexual harassment by senior officers as far back as 1991, when she graduated from the RCMP Academy. Sexual harassment settlements In October 2016, RCMP commissioner Bob Paulson apologized for what he referred to as \\"shameful conduct\\" by the organization. An internal investigation determined that up to 20,000 female officers and civilian employees since 1974, may have been the victim of harassment, discrimination, and/or sexual abuse. Additionally, the organization has set aside a $100 million compensation fund for victims. They did not however address the matter of SSgt Caroline O‚ÄôFarrell, who brought a separate suit due to her treatment while part of the iconic Musical Ride in the late 1980s. On July 8, 2019 the National Post announced that a $100 million settlement was reached in a class-action lawsuit against the RCMP for sexual harassment. The Federal Government of Canada and the RCMP have entered into a Settlement Agreement in the Tiller et al., vs Her Majesty the Queen (Federal Court File Number T-1673-17) to compensate qualified claimants who have been subjected to the gender or sexual orientation based discrimination and/or harassment. The previous similar 2017 Merlo and Davidson Class Action Settlement only compensated female members and a limited number of public servants. Compensation for proven claims over the 45-year period would range from $10,000 to $222,000 each. The 2016 settlement for $100 million covered female officers who had been sexually harassed in the RCMP since September 1974. A second settlement in 2019 for $100 million was for women in non- policing roles at the RCMP. According to the CBC in 2019, around 2,500 women were expected to claim claims under both of the settlements. The payouts are only allowed for living officers, with payments denied to the families of Mounties who had committed suicide since coming forward about the harassment. Animal abuse In 2017, allegations of animal abuse against horses used for the RCMP Musical Ride emerged. Following the allegations, the riding master conducting the musical rides, Mike C√¥t√© was removed from his post and restricted to administrative duties. This revived previous allegations going back as far as 2004 that the officer severely beat a horse until it was bleeding, punching another horse and ramming another into a wall. Other previous claims of public concerns were cited that he was promoted to a horse master. Four years earlier, Staff Sgt. Caroline O‚ÄôFarrell filed a lawsuit against thirteen colleagues in the musical ride alleging physical and sexual abuse. Kinder Morgan pipeline in Canada During early stages of the construction of the controversial Kinder Morgan pipeline which was met by massive protests and physical resistance, the RCMP was brought in to disperse them. This resulted in a number of arrests. Amongst those arrested were Member of Parliament Elizabeth May and Tamo Campos, grandson of David Suzuki, which the activist made a speech against, and criticized the RCMP's actions. Opponents of the Kinder Morgan pipeline alleged that the RCMP deliberately targeted them for arrests.

In 1973, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It was designated a Florida Heritage Landmark in 2012. The museum complex sits just south of the city's central Plaza de la Constituci√≥n at 20 Aviles Street (formerly Hospital Street), the oldest archaeologically documented street in the United States. It is located at the center of Old Town, the city's oldest continuously occupied community. Since 1939, the property has been privately owned and managed by The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America in The State of Florida (NSCDA-FL). Through their efforts, it was restored and interpreted to reflect its function as a fashionable boarding house during Florida's first tourist boom, which began after 1821. The property is a historic house museum, furnished and presented to tell stories of the visitors who lodged there, the women who owned and managed it, and how people lived during Florida's territorial period.  Historical background and context  Louisa Fatio purchased the boarding house from Sarah Petty Anderson. Andres Ximenez The two-story main house was built by Andres Ximenez (an alternate spelling of Jimenez), a merchant of Spanish birth who married Juana Pellicer, daughter of Francisco Pellicer, a leader of the Minorcan community in St. Augustine. The property's modern name references Ximenez as well as the last historic owner of record: Louisa Fatio (FAY-she-oh), who ran the boarding house as Miss Fatio's. Louisa purchased the house in 1855, becoming the last of three successive women owners during its years as a boarding house. Their success contributes to the historical significance of the property, because this was a time when few American women owned property in their own names or managed a respectable business. The house's adaptability to commercial activities is due in part to its size and central location near the plaza and the bayfront. Andres Ximenez built the structure to accommodate his family upstairs and support them through undertakings housed downstairs. His wife Juana probably assisted him in running a general store, tavern, billiard table and lottery. The Ximenez family did not occupy the house for long. By 1806, both parents and two of their five minor children had died. For a number of years following, Juana's father managed the property on his grandchildren's behalf. The Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819, in which Spain settled a border dispute and ceded Florida to the United States, brought big changes to St. Augustine. The only city on the Florida peninsula, it became a destination for curiosity- seekers and consumptives on doctors' orders to escape cold northern winters. The presence of Castillo de San Marcos, a coquina fort built by the Spanish and now controlled by the U.S. military and renamed Fort Marion, brought a larger military presence to town. A decade after Florida became a U.S. territory in 1821, the need for more and better visitor accommodations became pressing. Local residents began advertising rooms for rent with board (meals) included. This kind of lodging was in most cases a step above staying at a hotel. Margaret Cook While small-scale boarding houses were the norm, the times were favorable for a more ambitious approach. In 1830, Margaret Cook completed the process of purchasing the Ximenez House from its heirs. Cook had relocated to St. Augustine from Charleston with her second husband Samuel in 1821. A widow again by 1830, she had the freedom not routinely granted to married women of her day to transact business in her own name. She secured these rights through legal documents signed by her husband before his death. Architect Herschel Shepard verified that the house was converted to add extra bedrooms during Cook's ownership. Cook hired Eliza Whitehurst ‚Äî a widowed friend from Charleston who may have also been a close relative ‚Äî and opened the house to boarders.Florida Herald, St. Augustine, November 18, 1829, E.B. Gould, publisher. Available at St Augustine Historical Society Research Library, Microfilm File Cabinet - Drawer 11 Reels 2-6. Under Eliza's management, \\"Mrs. Whitehurst's boarding house' developed a reputation for high standards and good food. One guest noted, \\"...we were very fortunate in getting board at Mrs. Whitehurst's, considered the best in town.\\" In 1835, 23 guests were recorded as having stayed at the house, with the majority coming from the northeast. Sarah Petty Anderson Eliza Whitehurst succumbed to illness in 1838, as did Margaret Cook's daughter. That year, Cook sold the boarding house to Sarah Petty Anderson for $4,000. She also sold Anderson an adjacent piece of property that she had purchased at auction the year before.St. Johns County Deed Book N, p. 28. This piece of land measured 57¬Ω feet along Green Street (now Cadiz) to the west of the boarding house.St. Johns County Deed Book N, p. 220. Anderson and her husband George were among the many newcomers to Florida in the early 1820s. Anderson's mother, Frances Kerr, had purchased 450 acres of land west of the Tomoka River in 1818 for a plantation known as the Ferry. In Kerr's will dated September 2, 1820, Anderson and her husband were named the heirs of the Ferry plantation.East Florida Papers, will of Frances Kerr, Bundle 318Q3 - Reel 145, St. Augustine Historical Society. In 1829, the Andersons bought Mount Oswald, a 1,900-acre plantation at the junction of the Halifax and Tomoka rivers.St. Johns County, Deed Book H, p. 329. They later bought a third plantation, which was burned during the Second Seminole War. The ruins of this Dunlawton Plantation and Sugar Mill still stand on Nova Road, west of Port Orange, Florida. The site was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Louisa Fatio By the end of the 1830s, Anderson was a widow living in St. Augustine. In the early 1840s, she hired Louisa Fatio to manage the Ximenez House as a boarding house. She retained Fatio as manager until 1855. That year, Fatio purchased the house for $3,000. Louisa Fatio was the granddaughter of Francis Philip Fatio, Sr., co-founder and later sole owner of the 10,000-acre New Switzerland plantation on the St. Johns River west of St. Augustine, as well as two other large properties in North Florida. She was highly educated for a woman of her time. In 1812, the family's plantation house was attacked and partially burned during the East Florida Patriot War. After they rebuilt between 1822 and 1824, Louisa ‚Äî who never married ‚Äî helped her frail stepmother run the household. The New Switzerland plantation was torched a second time during the Second Seminole War, which began in 1835. In 1836, Fatio moved to St. Augustine. The city was filled with military personnel and refugees from the war, and she found work managing boarding houses with her sister Eliza. Fatio's reputation for fine food and accommodations grew. First-hand accounts, such as Charles Lanman's Adventures in the Wilds of the United States, note her reputation as a hostess: \\"From personal experience I can speak of one‚Ä¶of these establishments kept by Miss Fatio, a most estimable and popular lady; and if the others are as home-like and comfortable as this, the ancient city may well be proud of her houses for the accommodation of travelers and invalids.\\" Under Fatio's management, the house on Aviles Street became known as Miss Fatio's. The establishment was a fixture in St. Augustine until her death in 1875. The Fatio House is a setting in Constance Fenimore Woolson's fictional story about visitors to St. Augustine. Titled \\"The Ancient City,\\" it was published in two parts by Harper's New Monthly Magazine in 1874 and 1875. Sometime after 1855, Fatio added a second floor of bedrooms above the one-story wing on the north end of the main house. For years, experts thought the addition was completed during Margaret Cook's ownership in the 1830s. The theory was overturned in 2009, when dendrochronology experts from the University of Florida and the University of Tennessee dated the wood in the framing of the upper-floor wing to the latter half of the 1850s. Eugenia Price made Louisa Fatio a major character in her 1965 (commemorative edition 2008) novel, Margaret's Story, the third volume in Price's \\"Florida Trilogy.\\" One of its settings is Fatio's boarding house in St. Augustine.  Architecture and design  The original detached kitchen with beehive oven is located next to the main house. Historic records and structural studies indicate that the main house and detached kitchen were built in 1798. Both are constructed of coquina rock quarried on nearby Anastasia Island. Coquina rock construction positions the house in the upper tier of St. Augustine residences of the Second Spanish Period. It is an exceptional example of St. Augustine Plan architecture. This hybrid style blends elements of Spanish Colonial architecture with more elegant Federal- style architecture introduced during Florida's British Period (1763-1784). The property's detached coquina kitchen with beehive oven is the only original 18th century detached kitchen in St. Augustine.

No longer impeded by an international border, Americans began traveling to Florida. Naturalists who visited reported exotic flora and fauna. Adventurers came in hopes of making their fortunes in the new territory. Physicians in northeastern states recommended Florida's mild winters to patients suffering from a variety of illnesses, especially tuberculosis (consumption). Although travel to the Florida peninsula was arduous, St. Augustine became a popular destination. Visitors often stayed for several months. Most were accustomed to a higher standard of living than the typical St. Augustine resident enjoyed, and preferred the more individual attention offered in a boarding house, as opposed to the city's public hotels. This era in St. Augustine's history ‚Äî after Florida was ceded to the United States in 1821 and well before the grand Flagler hotels opened in the second half of the 1880s ‚Äî was the beginning of tourism in Florida. By 1834, there were six boarding houses in the city. More would open in the years ahead. The central conflict during Florida's territorial period was with the Seminole. Earlier in the 1800s, a series of battles that was the first of three Seminole Wars sought to prevent Seminoles from harboring runaway slaves and to protect the right of white settlers to occupy land in Florida. A Second Seminole War began in 1835. It pivoted on the issue of Indian removal, a plan to move all Seminoles in Florida to land west of the Mississippi by 1835. A number of the Seminole chose to fight rather than leave their homes. In 1835, warriors led by Osceola began waging guerilla warfare. They attacked and burned plantations on the St. Johns River and elsewhere in Northeast and Central Florida. Local volunteers joined U.S. forces and state militia to fight the Seminoles. Fort Marion in St. Augustine became the center for U.S. military action, with Army officers often billeting at boarding houses and hotels in the city. Displaced settlers and families from nearby plantations sought refuge in St. Augustine. Visitors from outside Florida continued to travel to St. Augustine, though their numbers slowed during the heat of the conflict. During this tumultuous period, St. Augustine was crowded with people requiring room and board. In 1845, when Florida joined the Union as the 27th state, the boarding house industry was firmly established, with a reputation as a healing destination for invalids.  Archaeological discoveries  Caravaca cross from Spain was found during a 2003 dig on the property. The Ximenez-Fatio House has been the site of more than 15 archaeological digs ‚Äî more than any other property in St. Augustine, according to St. Augustine City Archaeologist Carl Halbirt. Archaeologists including Dr. Charles Fairbanks, Dr. Kathleen Deagan and others have found evidence of human occupation on the property dating back to the 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. A sub-surface sampling survey of the city conducted by Dr. Deagan in 1976 placed the Ximenez-Fatio lot at the approximate center of the 16th century Spanish settlement. In 2015, she observed that the property continues to invite exploration ‚Äî in part because, \\"there is occupation going back to the founding of St. Augustine, and so it's possible to really look at the whole spectrum of the city's occupation.\\" According to Halbirt and Deagan, the high-ground position of the site ‚Äî and artifacts discovered there ‚Äî suggest that the property was inhabited by St. Augustine's upper class from the beginning of the colonial period and that there was continual activity in the centuries that followed. Archaeological evidence of how people lived in 1800s St. Augustine helped to confirm the interpretation of the property as a boarding house. For example, animal bones in abandoned trash pits provided clues to what was served on the table, shards of china helped identify the pattern used during Sarah Petty Anderson's ownership, and a cache of silver buttons and pins led to the discovery of a laundry shed footprint. In 2003, archaeologists found a rare 17th century double-barred, white bronze Caravaca cross at the bottom of a 19th-century trash pit. Crafted in Spain, it predates the boarding house era by two centuries and is the most mysterious object found on the site to date. A major archaeological investigation began on February 3, 2015, at the front of the Ximenez-Fatio House property adjacent to Aviles Street. Led by Carl Halbirt, it concluded on March 14, 2015.  Historical research  The Ximenez-Fatio House has been carefully investigated by leading historians, preservation architects and archaeologists. After purchasing the Ximenez House in 1939, the Florida Dames were inspired by members of the Carnegie Restoration Committee to engage the most knowledgeable consultants available. Over the years, they have included architects Charles E. Peterson, Blair Reeves, Herschel Shepard, Charles Phillips and Joseph Oppermann; archaeologists Robert Steinbach, Dr. Charles Fairbanks, and, Kathleen Deagan; historians William Seale, Charles Tingley; and curator Robert Harper. Seale, who helped restore many historical American buildings, including a number of state capitals, conducted extensive research on the Ximenez-Fatio House in the 1970s. His research helped guide the Colonial Dames in their interpretation of the house during Florida's territorial days. Historic sources include early maps and deed transfers, letters, journals, wills, marriage licenses and sales records. Researchers have also traced activity on the property using city maps that show footprints of residences built in St. Augustine during Spanish and British colonial times. The first recorded Spanish owner of the property was Cristoval Contreras. Artifacts found during a dig are believed to date from his occupation and corroborate with documentary evidence that Contreras was from the upper echelon of St. Augustine society. Recorded deeds show four owners during St. Augustine's British Period. Evidence is strong that the Spanish Crown reclaimed the property after the British exited Florida in 1783, and that it was sold by auction in 1791. House historians point to a map (de la Rocque Map, on file at the St. Augustine Historical Society) from the period that depicts the ruins of a stone house on the site and a note on the 1791 transfer deed that reports a structure in shambles and a property assessed as \\"lot only\\". A later transfer deed shows that the new owner sold the property to local merchant Don Andres Ximenez in 1797. At that time Ximenez already owned a house with general store across the street.East Florida Papers, Bundle 373, Reel 171; Ximenez Testamentary Papers. First will October 19, 1802. Second will, April 10, 1806. The house with detached kitchen that he built on his new property was mentioned in his 1802 will, providing historians with a reference point to date construction. Ximenez's later will of 1806 lists the house and its contents, which included, \\"[a] grocery store and a billiard table with everything pertaining to it\\". Many of the store's contents appear to have been sold after his death. From sales records, historians have a window into a St. Augustine general store of that time. Ximenez sold tobacco, children's reading books, palm leaf brooms, assorted vases, empty bottles, reams of white paper and bone buttons. Legal documents help visualize the house as originally built. An assessment of the property taken shortly after the death of Andres Ximenez calculated the approximate quantity and worth of the masonry and wood elements. In a report dated July 8, 1806, the city's Master Carpenter Martin Hernandez documented 15 doors, 16 windows, wood for floors, ceilings and partitions, a stairway with pantry underneath, handrail and balusters, a roof with four windows and wood for moldings and trimmings. Hernandez also counted three doors, three windows and a shingle roof for the kitchen building and noted additional wood structures such as a privy, wash shed and wooden fences. Jose Lorente, Master Mason, calculated the overall measurements of the main house and warehouses that housed merchandise for the Ximenez store. In general, the main house that has survived into the 21st century matches up well with this 1806 assessment.  Restoration and interpretation  The dining room table is set with 19th century china patterns discovered during digs on the property. For three decades after they acquired the property, the NSCDA-FL worked on repairs. In 1970, the house was awarded a National Trust for Historic Preservation grant. It enabled NSCDA-FL to hire architect Charles E. Peterson, considered one of the founding fathers of historic preservation in the United States. Previously, Peterson had established the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) and was a founding member of the Association for Preservation Technology (APT). He visited the Ximenez-Fatio House twice in 1972. His observations were published in an article titled \\"Tour of Ximenez-Fatio House\\" in the St. Augustine Record on January 8 and 9, 1972. Peterson was a stickler for accurate restoration and truthful interpretation at a time when these were novel ideas. He taught the Dames how to find their interpretation period. Years of in-depth research followed. NSCDA-FL research committee members studied city maps, historic newspaper articles, letters and journals; compared details in related houses such as St. Augustine's Second Spanish Period Don Manuel Solana House; analyzed artifacts found underground; and consulted the findings of historians and architects. Their discoveries led them to focus on a little-known time in St. Augustine's history ‚Äî the boarding house era, which was at its peak during the 1830s and 1840s. Following Peterson's advice, the Dames also documented house features in detail, published information to attract interest from the academic community, and got the property listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Meanwhile, restoration efforts continued. Peterson introduced the Dames to architect Blair Reeves. Through Reeves, they hired architect Herschel Shepard. Shepard later helped restore the historic 1902 Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee, Fort Foster in Hillsborough County and other important sites in Florida. He was involved in Ximenez-Fatio House research and restoration from 1973 to 1979. Based on physical evidence such as construction details, nail chronology and saw marks rather than solely on stylistic features, Shepard believed that most of the remodeling undertaken to transform the residence into a boarding house occurred between 1830 and 1840. He investigated features throughout the house with the object of understanding how the house was modified over time. In 1975, the NSCDA-FL was awarded a National Trust for Historic Preservation grant to hire historical consultant William Seale. Seale was previously curator of cultural history at the Smithsonian Institution and a nationally known historian and author. He helped guide the Dames in their interpretation. Seale provided a summary of how he would interpret each room of the boarding house, including appropriate furnishings, room arrangements and resources for further research. The acquisitions committee then began a long search for house contents. Their primary guideline was that all pieces purchased for the house must be documented as having been available in St. Augustine during the interpretation period. Items were sourced from antique stores, estate sales and private collections in Northeast Florida, Southeast Georgia and elsewhere. Seale's most recent visit to the property was in 2006. In his follow-up report, he called the boarding house interpretation executed by the Dames in the 1970s \\"as valid as ever, reflecting current interests in the history field over the nation.\\" Seale conjectured that Ximenez-Fatio House Museum may be the first historic house in the country to feature the story of a succession of women surviving economically in what was considered a man's world, and commercializing their domestic skills to do so. Ongoing preservation of Ximenez-Fatio House is funded through grants, NSCDA-FL dues and private donations. Joseph K. Oppermann is currently lead architect for the house.  The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America in The State of Florida  Founded in 1891, The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America (NSCDA) is dedicated to inspiring understanding and respect for America's origins as a nation. The national organization and its 44 corporate societies are active in 43 states and the District of Columbia. Across America, Colonial Dames further their mission through patriotic programs, educational outreach, historical projects and in many other ways. For example, the NSCDA is a national leader in historic preservation, restoration and the interpretation of historic sites. The National Trust for Historic Preservation recognized its work at 85 historic properties with the Trustee Emeritus Award for the Stewardship of Historic Sites. NSCDA-FL, the Florida society of The Colonial Dames of America, owns and operates the Ximenez-Fatio House Museum in St. Augustine.

Recording The concept behind The Bradley Barn Sessions was to place Jones in the hands of traditionalist country producer Brian Ahern, record at Owen Bradley's legendary studios, compile a selection of the singer's greatest hits, and have him sing duets with not just some of the biggest names in country but also pop music as well. Although the album ‚Äì Jones fourth for MCA ‚Äì did not break the top twenty on Billboards country albums chart, peaking at 23, it features the first recorded duet between the singer and his ex-wife Tammy Wynette since their 1981 LP Together Again. The only single release from the album was \\"A Good Year for the Roses\\", a collaboration with Alan Jackson. As Jones noted in his autobiography two years later, \\"After the duets album was released, radio didn't know what to do with it...Alan was white-hot on the radio, and programmers wanted his voice. But some didn't want his if they had to take mine. The vast majority of Alan's other single records have gone to number one. His duet with me was his first not to crack the top 50.\\" It actually peaked at number 57. In June 1995, the song won the Music City News Country Awards \\"Vocal Collaboration of the Year\\". In addition to a who's who of past and present country stars, the album boasted two significant contributors from outside the country music field. The first was Mark Knopfler, primarily known as leader and guitarist for the rock band Dire Straits. A big country fan who had recorded an album with Chet Atkins in 1990, Knopfler played guitar and sang background on a remake of Jones's first number one country hit from 1959, \\"White Lightning\\", and can be heard laughing as Jones hams it up on the vocal. The other rock musician who sang with Jones was Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones on \\"Say It's Not You\\", which originally appeared on Jones's 1967 album If My Heart Had Windows. In a 2004 interview that was posted on his website, Richards said of the meeting, \\"That was a great experience...To sing with George ‚Äì and get away with it! ‚Äì was amazing. What a possum.\\" In a 1996 Rolling Stone interview Jones confessed to Chuck Dean, \\"I'll be honest with you: I love Keith Richards more than anything as a person. He's a character ‚Äì just fun to be around.\\" An hour-long documentary-style special was filmed in late 1994 to promote the duet album. It aired in 1995 on The Nashville Network. Among the guests were the duet partners, Tony Brown, Brian Ahern, and Owen Bradley. Several unreleased tracks recorded during this album's sessions were later included on Jones' 2008 duets album Burn Your Playhouse Down. Reception Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic calls The Bradley Barn Sessions \\"a stilted, nearly lifeless album. The production is too clean and polished, lacking any of the grit of true honky tonk records. Furthermore, songs like \\"A Good Year for the Roses\\" suffer from the stringless, stripped-down arrangements.

Sightings and potential damage The Surrey Puma refers to a clutch of sightings reported to police and newspapers of phantom cats categorised into slightly larger than domestic cats resembling Iberian lynxes to reports of large black cats from an early stage so identified in the press and by some sighters, as pumas: in the wild, barring escapees, a Pan-American genus. By the mid-1960s records included: *A plaster cast of a paw print less than five inches handed into Godalming Police Station where it was the public display piece of a minor priority 'big cats' file that centred on damage to livestock *A 1966, black-and-white photograph of a longer than usual cat by a former police photographer, Ian Pert, next to a house in Worplesdon. There followed an 18 year-hiatus in non-testimonial allegations with corroboratory evidence until a report to police with a hair sample of a puma taken from Peaslake, in the heavily wooded part of Greensand Ridge. Twenty-one years after this a colour video was recorded of a cat or big cat walking away beneath a branch. A Surrey Wildlife Trust officer in the local press at the time considered the animal filmed was not a \\"Surrey Puma\\" as the woman recording thought but was consistent with an Iberian Lynx, assessing this and the organisation's own reports of that year in its ranges in the borough to the north, the Borough of Guildford. The video was taken at Winkworth Arboretum (NT), Busbridge in the south-west of Surrey. The loosely corroborated sightings have been in south western Surrey (and one in a neighbouring part of Hampshire) from 1959 until about 2005. Anonymous and vague sightings in Surrey have been reported to the police, the local and national press sporadically since 1959. In 1975, an eight year old boy was playing alone in woodland in Chiddingfold (grid reference SU 96344 35611). The woodland backs onto a field, and it was from this field that a golden-coloured big cat entered the woodland. The cat walked in a westerly direction, staying close to the edge of the field. As it passed the boy, at a distance of approximately 10m, it turned its head and stared momentarily at him, but was disinterested and carried on walking. The boy, named Patrick, lived at the house now named \\"Bluebells\\" in Pockford Road. When asked if it could have been a dog, the boy replied \\"no, because it had a long curved tail, a wide head and it picked its feet up like a cat ... but it was the same size as a big dog\\".BBC Radio Surrey 19 December 2016 7.25am Scope Main reports ;1959 The first possible sightings were recorded in 1959, when police received a number of reports of big cats in the Farnham area, near the Surrey/Hampshire border. ;1962 and 1963 Two further sightings were recorded, in 1962, by water board personnel in Hampshire, and a third in the winter of 1962-3, a \\"cat-like beast\\" was seen at Bushylease Farm, Crondall, Hampshire. When a police officer sighted the supposed Shooter's Hill Cheetah in south-east London in 1963, media interest turned to other big cat sightings.\\"Alien Big Cats in Britain\\", Fortean Times (The World of Strange Phenomena), February 2003 from web.archive.org. ;Injured livestock of 1964, police-taken paw cast and naming of 'the Surrey Puma' In August 1964, a bullock at Bushylease Farm was found severely lacerated. Following press coverage, numerous reports of contact with the animal, dubbed the \\"Surrey Puma\\", came to the press, ranging from the fanciful to some taken seriously by the police; by naturalist and biographer Duff Hart-Davis under long article \\"Hoax! Hoax! Hoax!: The Fowey Skull (pictured) - Bodmin Beast or Piltdown Puss?\\" in NCJ column. Bigcats.org retrieved from Web.archive.org. at Godalming Police Station 362 reports were received in a two-year period. The station from this period kept a cast of a five-inch paw print on display identified as that of a puma by London Zoo. Reports noted that its size implied an extremely large specimen and that there were distinct differences between it and the alleged European prints of other pumas.\\"The Surrey puma: fact or fiction?\\", Illustrated London News, 27 August 1966 The investigation file was closed in the summer of 1967. ;1966 In August 1966, Pert took a grainy shot which he claimed showed the Surrey Puma in Worplesdon with the cat facing the camera and a longer-than-average cat length body.The Surrey Puma photograph of 1966 Worplesdon taken by former Police photographer Pert and reports of 1996 from the same village Thebrgs.homestead.com from Web.archive.org. ;1968 and 1970 In 1968, a farmer claimed to have shot a puma, but could not provide any evidence. Sightings gradually tailed off, although paw prints found in the snow in 1970 generated a flurry of further reports ;1970s Albury History Society has a 1991 publication, About The Hurtwood, interviewing Hurtwood Control's ranger, Bob Ware, who claimed several sightings. The Hurtwood spans Farley Green, Pitch Hill, Peaslake and Holmbury Hill. ;1984 In 1984 hair samples taken at Peaslake were identified as puma. In the previous year an unclassified big cat dubbed 'alien' featured in The Archers and the Beast of Exmoor made national headlines. ;1995 The Surrey Advertiser newspaper reported a sighting was recorded by police officer Steve Ashcroft in 1995 outside hilltop St Teresa's School Effingham. ;2003 Detective Constable Stephen Ashcroft saw the same or similar 'up at Holmbury (Hill)' in June 2003, an area with sightings logged within the following 12 months by Peter Hayes, warden of the Hurtwood which covers the hill and the ridge to its north and west. ;2004 The newspaper added residents of Abinger Common (the neighbouring woodland and farmland area) reported that in the 'last two weeks' they had seen a big cat, relying on the Big Cat Survey by the British Big Cats organisation. ;2005 Lynx A Mr Fowler, visiting with partner, Winkworth Arboretum, sent their video camera footage to a local newspaper, which they reproduced in stills. They described this animal as \\"gingery-brown colour, about the size of an alsatian dog but it definitely wasn't a fox\\". Surrey Wildlife Trust ranger Mark Havler having looked at this believed it was an Iberian lynx (lynx pardinus) and received 15 calls of sightings of similar in the two weeks thereafter, many much backdated. Reports that year logged at the Surrey Advertiser headquarters were of more than one non-native wild cat in the Borough of Guildford and neighbouring districts: some of \\"spots and a bob tail on a sandy-coloured animal, suggesting a lynx\\", others of \\"no spots and a long tail, which could mean a puma\\"; two residents walkers' names were included in their published overview report across the years since the 1960s. The reporter interviewed the Animal Liaison Officer of Marwell Zoo outside of the sightings' area to assess whether the old and new findings were linked, who explained the need for sufficient breeding pairs given these animal's wild lifespan, with say at a 1 in 99 likelihood in ideal conditions of having multi-generational offspring, if the first alleged sightings were true and he expressed doubt on the veracity of most reports. The report states that 'over 40 years ago, [thus around 1964]' it reported the first appearance of a \\"golden brown animal of around three to five feet in length while he was blackberrying one lunchtime\\" by George Wisdom, who described himself as a 'Munstead workman'.\\"Now Do You Believe There Are Big Cats Living in the Surrey Countryside?\\", Surrey Advertiser from Web.archive.org, reproduction of article of 23 May 2005.

The empire ruled South India, from their regal capital at Vijayanagara, on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in modern Karnataka, India. The empire built temples, monuments, palaces and other structures across South India, with a largest concentration in its capital. The monuments in and around Hampi, in the Vijayanagara principality, are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In addition to building new temples, the empire added new structures and made modifications to hundreds of temples across South India. Some structures at Vijayanagara are from the pre- Vijayanagara period. The Mahakuta hill temples are from the Western Chalukya era. The region around Hampi had been a popular place of worship for centuries before the Vijayanagara period with earliest records dating from 689 CE when it was known as Pampa Tirtha after the local river God Pampa. There are hundreds of monuments in the core area of the capital city. Of these, 56 are protected by UNESCO, 654 monuments are protected by the government of Karnataka and another 300 await protection.Global Heritage Fund Salient features Early 14th century Shiva temples on Hemakuta hill built during the rule of Harihara Raya I incorporates the stepped Kadamba style nagara shikhara (superstructure) The mid-14th century Vidyashankara temple at Sringeri, one of the earliest temples built by the kings of the empire Typical shrine at Hazare Rama temple in Hampi A typical Vijayanagara style pillared maha mantapa (main hall) at Someshvara temple at Kolar Pillared open mantapa incorporating Hoysala style \\"staggered square\\" layout at Vittala temple in Hampi Typical large open pillared hall at Ananthasayana temple in Ananthasayanagudi, Bellary district, Karnataka Kudure gombe (horse doll) pillars in a mantapa at Hampi An open mantapa with yali columns at the Vittala temple in Hampi Vijayanagara architecture can be broadly classified into religious, courtly and civic architecture, as can the associated sculptures and paintings.Hampi ‚Äì A Travel Guide, pp 36, Department of Tourism, India The Vijayanagara style is a combination of the Chalukya, Hoysala, Pandya and Chola styles which evolved earlier in the centuries when these empires ruled and is characterised by a return to the simplistic and serene art of the past.Art critic Percy Brown calls Vijayanagara architecture a blossoming of Dravidian style, A Concise History of Karnataka, pp 182, Dr. S.U. Kamath, History of Karnataka, Arthikaje For the approximately 400 years during the rule of the Western Chalukya and the Hoysalas empires, the most popular material for temple construction was chloritic schist or soapstone. This was also true for sculpture as soapstone is soft and easily carved. During the Vijayanagar period the local hard granite was preferred in the Badami Chalukya style, although soapstone was used for a few reliefs and sculptures.Their style was characterised by a return to the simplistic and serene art of the Badami Chalukya says Dr. S.U. Kamath about the sculptures in Vijayanagar style, A Concise History of Karnataka, pp 184, Dr. S.U. Kamath While the use of granite reduced the density of sculptured works, granite was a more durable material for the temple structure. Because granite is prone to flaking, few pieces of individual sculptures reached the high levels of quality seen in previous centuries. To cover the unevenness of the stone used in sculptures, artists employed plaster to give the rough surface a smooth finish and then painted it with lively colours.Hampi ‚Äì A Travel Guide, pp 42‚Äì43, Department of Tourism, India Temple structures Vijayanagara temples are usually surrounded by a strong enclosure. Small shrines consist simply of a garbhagriha (sanctum) and a porch. Medium-sized temples have a garbhagriha, shukanasi (antechamber), a navaranga (antrala) connecting the sanctum and outer mandapa (hall), and a rangamantapa (enclosed pillared hall). Large temples have tall Rayagopuram built with wood, brick and stucco in Chola style. The term Raya is added to indicate a gopura built by Vijayanagar Rayas. The top of the gopuram has a shalashikhara resembling a barrel made to rest on its side. Large life-size figures of men, woman, Gods and Goddesses adorn the gopuram. This Tamil dravida-influenced style became popular during the rule of king Krishnadevaraya and is seen in South Indian temples constructed over the next 200 years.New Light on Hampi, Recent research in Vijayanagara, edited by John M. Fritz and George Michell, pp 9 Examples of Rayagopuram are the Chennakesava Temple in Belur and the temples at Srisailam and Srirangam. In addition to these structures, medium-size temples have a closed circumambulatory (Pradakshinapatha) passage around the sanctum, an open mahamantapa (large hall), a kalyanamantapa (ceremonial hall) and a temple tank to serve the needs of annual celebrations.The elaboration of ceremonial observances produced a corresponding elaboration in the temple system, says art critic Percy Brown, A Concise History of Karnataka, pp 183, Dr. S.U. Kamath Temple pillars often have engravings of charging horses or hippogryphs (Yali) ‚Äî horses standing on hind legs with their fore legs lifted and riders on their backs. The horses on some pillars stand seven to eight feet tall. On the other side of the pillar are usually carvings from Hindu mythology.The attached colonnettes and sculptured animals are a significant artistic innovation of the reign of king Krishnadevaraya, New Light on Hampi, Recent research in Vijayanagara, edited by John M. Fritz and George Michell, pp 8 Pillars that do not have such hippogryphs are generally rectangular with mythology themed decoration on all sides. Some pillars have a cluster of smaller pillars around a central pillar shaft. The bottom supports of these pillars have engravings of Gods and Goddesses. Carvings of hippogryphs clearly show the adroitness of the artists who created them.A Concise History of Karnataka, pp 183, Dr. S.U. Kamath The Mandapas are built on square or polygonal plinths with carved friezes that are four to five feet high and have ornate stepped entrances on all four sides with miniature elephants or with Yali balustrades (parapets).An imaginary beast acting as parapet. These beautifully sculptured supports were used in entrances to temples and as flanks to steps and stairs in royal palace structures, New Light on Hampi, Recent research in Vijayanagara, edited by John M. Fritz and George Michell, pp 53 The Mantapas are supported by ornate pillars.A regular feature saya Prof. K.A.N. Sastri about the importance of pillars in the Vijayanagara style in A Concise History of Karnataka, pp 183, Dr. S.U. Kamath The 1,000-pillared style with large halls supported by numerous pillars was popular. The 1,000-pillared Jain basadi at Mudabidri is an example. Larger temples have a separate shrine for the female deity. Some examples of this are the Hazara Rama, Balakrishna and Vitthala temples at Hampi. Some shrines in the Vitthalapura area inside Vijayanagara were consecrated specifically for Tamil Alwar saints and for the great Vaishnava saint, Ramanujacharya. Architecturally they are different in that each shrine has an image depicting the saint for whose worship the temple was built. Each shrine has its own enclosure and a separate kitchen and pilgrim feeding hall.New Light on Hampi, Recent research in Vijayanagara, edited by John M. Fritz and George Michell, pp 35‚Äì36 The water storage tank inside the royal center, the [stepwell stepped tank] called, \\"Pushkarni\\", is a recent archaeological discovery. The stepped tank is fashioned with finished chlorite schist slabs arranged in a symmetrical formation with steps and landings descending to the water on all four sides. This is clearly a Western Chalukya- Hoysala style tank and is seen in many parts of present-day Karnataka.According to Dominic J Davidson-Jenkins in New Light on Hampi, Recent research in Vijayanagara, edited by John M. Fritz and George Michell, pp 89 The inscriptions on the slabs indicate the material was brought from outside the Vijayanagara area. Palaces Much of what is known today of Vijayanagara palaces is drawn from archaeological excavations at Hampi as no royal palace structures have survived.According to Channabasappa S. Patil, New Light on Hampi, Recent research in Vijayanagara, pp 51, edited by John M. Fritz and George Michell Most palaces stand in their own compound defined by high tapering walls made of stone or layered earth. Palaces are approached through a sequence of courts with passageways and doorways requiring multiple changes in direction. All palaces face east or north. The larger palaces have side extensions giving the complex a symmetrical shape. Palaces were built on raised platforms made of granite. The platforms have multiple tiers of mouldings with well-decorated friezes.A rectangular decorated panel of stone is called a frieze, A complete guide to Hoysala Temples, pp 93 Gerard Foekema. The decorations can be floral, Kirtimukha shapes (demon faces), geese, elephants and occasionally human figures. Pillars, beams and rafters inside the palace were made of wood as evidenced by ash discovered in excavations. The roof was made of brick or lime concrete, while copper and ivory were used for finials. Palaces commonly consisted of multiple levels with each flight of stairs decorated by balustrades on either side, with either yali (imaginary beast) or elephant sculptures. The entrance steps into palaces and temple mantapas were similarly decorated. Water tanks inside the palace complex have decorative water spouts such as the carved torso of the Nandi with a gaping mouth to allow water flow into the tank.According to Channabasappa S. Patil, New Light on Hampi, Recent research in Vijayanagara, pp 57, edited by John M. Fritz and George Michell Other structures commonly found inside a palace complex are wells and shrines. The courtly architecture generally show secular styles with Islamic influences. Examples are the Lotus Mahal palace, Elephant stables, and watch towers.New Light on Hampi, Recent research in Vijayanagara, edited by John M. Fritz and George Michell, pp 10. Courtly buildings and domed structures were built with mortar mixed with stone rubble. The impact of this style of architecture was seen well into the 17th century when the successive Nayaka kingdoms continued to encourage pillars with hippogryphs and granite became the main building material. Other famous temples in Karnataka While the empire is well known for its monuments in the regal capital Vijayanagara (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), it also built temples in other regions of Karnataka including the coastal region (called Karavali) where the Vijayanagara idiom mingled with local styles. A List of these temples and their approximate time of construction is given in the article List of Vijayanagara era temples in Karnataka. Famous temples in Andhra Pradesh In Andhra Pradesh the empire built the Mallikarjuna Temple at Srisailam, Upper Narasimha Temple and Lower Narasimha Temple at Ahobilam, Veera Bhadra Temple at Lepakshi and Venkateswara Temple at Tirupati and others. In Tamil Nadu the empire built the Vijayaraghava Permal temple modeled after the famous temples at Tirupati with statues of Krishnadevaraya in Thayar Sanithi pillars facing each other.

Boats of the squadron, under the command of Lieutenant Puckingthorne of San Domingo, rowed 15 miles upriver, where they found four armed schooners drawn up in line. The Arab (7), was run ashore and boarded by two boats from Marlborough, while San Domingos pinnace captured Lynx and Racer. Men from Statiras cutter and Maidstones launch captured . The attacking party lost two men killed and 11 wounded. Fantome had no casualties. A final distribution of headmoney for Lynx and Racer took place in February 1817. Following the capture of the privateers, the squadron continued up the Chesapeake, and Admiral Warren ordered Rear Admiral George Cockburn to penetrate the rivers at the head of the bay, taking Maidstone, Fantome, Mohawk, Highflyer, and three of the captured schooners. Cockburn also had a detachment of 180 seamen and 200 marines from the squadron's naval brigade, together with a small detachment of the Royal Artillery from Bermuda and under the command of Lieutenant Robertson. On 28 April, when Cockburn learned of stores of flour and military equipment at French Town on the Elk River, he embarked in Fantome and took Mohawk, Dolphin, Racer and Highflyer up the river. At 11 p.m. 150 marines and five artillery men left in boats to destroy the stores, with Lieutenant Lewis following in Highflyer as support. Unfortunately they were diverted into the Bohemia River and it was after 8 a.m. before they reached their destination only to discover that the Americans had erected a six-gun battery. The battery fired on the boats as soon as they appeared, but the boats' carronades soon silenced it. The British burned stores, which consisted mainly of cavalry equipment, and five vessels. Later the same morning Captain Lawrence embarked a number of cows after giving the owner bills on the Victualling Officer. He then rejoined Rear-Admiral Cockburn in Maidstone off the mouth of the Susquehanna River at the northern end of the Bay. After observing the Americans firing from hoisting an American flag at a newly constructed battery at Havre de Grace, the Admiral determined to attack it. Captain Lawrence commanded the operation. At dawn on 2 May boats containing 150 marines, and a small party of artillerymen attacked, drove off the defenders and captured the battery. A division of boats then rowed upriver to the Cecil or Principio Foundry, three or four miles to the north. They destroyed the buildings, machinery and guns they found there, as well as five vessels and a large store of flour. They returned to the ships by 10 p.m. after being away for twenty-two hours. The only casualty was Lieutenant Westphal, first of the Marlborough, who had received a shot through the hand. The gallantry, zeal and attention of Captain Lawrence was particularly mentioned in the Admiral's official letter, as was the behaviour of Lieutenant Reed of Fantome. On 29 April, boats from Dolphin, Dragon, Fantome, Highflyer, Maidstone, Marlborough, Mohawk, Racer and Statira went up the Elk River in Chesapeake Bay under the personal command of Rear-Admiral Sir George Cockburn. Their objective was to destroy five American ships and stores, and by some accounts, a cannon foundry at French Town. This took until 3 May 1813 to complete. On the way, after a battery at Havre de Grace fired on them from the shore, a landing party destroyed the battery and burned much of the town. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issue of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"28 April Boat Service 1813\\" to any surviving claimants from the action; the Navy issued 48 clasps. On 30 April Highflyer supported Fantome and Mohawks boats when the vessels gathered cattle for the fleet's use, paying with bills on the Victualling Office. The next day, the vessels secured more cattle from Spesutie (Spesucie) Island just south of Havre de Grace. On 29 April Fantome recaptured the English brig Endeavour of 110 tons and six men which an American privateer had captured while Endeavour was carrying wine from Guernsey to Gibraltar. The recaptured Endeavour reached Bermuda at the end of June.Lloyd's Marine List ‚Ññ4791. Fantome shared in the proceeds of the capture of Rolla and cargo on 29 May. Rescue of American Slaves While operating in the Chesapeake, Fantome rescued a number of families of enslaved African Americans who had escaped from plantations as part of the Black Refugee migration in the War of 1812. Fantome gave sanctuary to seven escaped slaves on 30 May 1813 who then joined Fantomes crew. Two of them used Fantome as a base from which to return to shore and rescue enslaved wives and children on 3 and 8 June.Thomas Malcomson, \\"Freedom by reaching the Wooden World: American Slaves and the British Navy during the War of 1812\\", The Northern Mariner, Vol. XXII, No. 4 (October 2012), p. 366.  Further captures  Fantome was among the vessels sharing in the proceeds of the Spanish brig St. Iago and cargo captured on 11 June, and the American schooner Surveyor captured the next day. The same ships shared in the compromise for the American ships Governor Strong and cargo (12 June), Emily and cargo (12 June), and Star and cargo (14 June). The vessels that had shared the capture of Rolla also shared the capture of Protectress on 18 June. Lastly, she was among the vessels sharing in the proceeds of the American ship Herman and cargo (21 June). Fantome recaptured the ship Seaflower on 9 July. Fantome also recaptured an unnamed brig that had been sailing from Newfoundland to Barbados.Lloyd's Marine List ‚Ññ4803. On 5 October Fantome and recaptured off Mount Desert Island, Maine, the former Nova Scotian privateer Liverpool Packet, then sailing as an American privateer under the name Portsmouth Packet, after a chase of 13 hours. At the time of her capture, Portsmouth Packet was armed with five guns, carried a crew of 45, and had sailed from Portsmouth the previous day. The recaptured schooner was brought into Halifax on 12 October.Lloyd's Marine List ‚Ññ4821. There her original owners repurchased her and restored the name of Liverpool Packet. Almost a month later, on 3 November, Epervier and Fantome captured Peggy, of 91 tons (bm), W. O. Fuller, master. she had been sailing from George's River to Boston with a cargo of timber and wood.Vice-admiralty court, Halifax (1911), p.145. Captain Lawrence was made a Companion of the Bath for his services.Marshall (1830), Supplement Part 4, p.123. In November 1813 Fantome came under the command of Commander Thomas Sykes.  Canadian trek  On 21 January 1814 Lieutenant Henry Kent of Fantome volunteered to serve on the Great Lakes and joined 210 volunteer seamen from Fantome, and . Seventy men left Halifax in Fantome on 22 January for Saint John, New Brunswick, then travelled with sleighs to Fredericton, a distance of 80 miles. From there they travelled along the ice of the Saint John River. After eighty-two miles, at Presque Isle, they exchanged sleighs for toboggans, and were supplied with snowshoes and moccasins. Leaving on 8 February they made between 15 and 22 miles a day through knee-deep snow along the St. Lawrence, reaching Quebec on the 28th, taking shelter in the frigate and the sloop Indian, frozen up in Wolfe's Cove. They finally reached Kingston, Ontario, on 22 March.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 33, pp.123-7. A few days later Lieutenant Kent joined the 42-gun frigate . In November 1813 Fantome came under the command of Commander Thomas Sykes. On 9 May 1814 Fantome captured the Spanish brig Danzic. Loss Prospect, Nova Scotia Prospect, Nova Scotia Fantome ran aground in Shad Bay near the village of Prospect, Nova Scotia, on 24 November 1814. The brig was escorting a convoy from British- occupied Castine, Maine to Halifax, Nova Scotia. On the evening of 23 November Sykes ordered that a course be set for the Sambro Light. At 2am the next morning he ordered a depth sounding and when it showed only 35 fathoms, ordered a change of course. An hour later, when he came back on deck he discovered that the pilot had countermanded his order. Soon after she struck. Sykes had the masts cut away and the boats hoisted over the sides, but Fantome rapidly filled with water. The crew took to the boats in an orderly manner and all reached the shore safely. The subsequent court martial reprimanded Sykes for failing to order frequent soundings and for relying too much on the pilot. It ordered Lieutenant John Fisher, the officer of the watch, to be more careful in the future, especially in keeping the captain aware of his ship's situation. It severely reprimanded the master, Joseph Forster, for not taking continuous sounding and for not informing the captain about his reservations concerning the course being steered. Lastly, the court martial severely reprimanded the pilot, Thomas Robinson, for countermanding the captain's order, and for sailing too close to the shore and without taking soundings. It ordered the pilot to lose all pay due him. Two schooners from the convoy, Industry and Perseverance, were lost at the same location. A transport brig from the convoy went aground elsewhere on the same night but was got off later. No lives were lost when the ships sank.Lloyd's List, no. 4935, - accessed 20 May 2014. Post-script Some treasure hunters have claimed the convoy that Fantome was escorting was laden with goods taken from the White House during the British raid on Washington, DC. However Fantome played no part in the Washington raid and historians agree that the convoy was carrying goods and customs revenue from Castine. The site of Fantome's loss is marked today by an inscription on a large granite boulder near the wreck site at Prospect.

The best-known species - and probably the only one - is Iriartea deltoidea, which is found from Nicaragua, south into Bolivia and a great portion of Western Amazonian basin. It is the most common tree in many forests in which it occurs. It is known by such names as bombona (which can also refer to other palms, e.g. Attalea regia) or cacho de vaca (which can refer to many other plants, like the Bignoniaceae Godmania aesculifolia or the orchid Myrmecophila humboldtii). In the Murui Huitoto language of southwestern Colombia, it is called j…®ag…®na or j…®a√¨g…®na,Mar√≠n-Corba et al. (2005) in western Ecuador it is known as pambil and in Peru it is known as the pona palm. These palms are canopy trees growing to 20‚Äì35 m tall. I. deltoidea is easily recognized by the prominent bulge in the center of its trunk, and the stilt roots, which form a dense cone up to 1 m in diameter at the base. It can thus be easily be distinguished from Socratea exorrhiza (which also bears stilt roots), as the stilt roots of the former are much less tightly appressed upon one another. The leaves are up to 5 m long, and pinnate. The numerous pinnae are fan-shaped, and held in various planes. The fruit is a 2-cm diameter drupe, and primarily dispersed by bats and toucans. The fruit are also eaten by humans, and the wood is used for construction and in handicraft. Toucan foraging behavior can have quite distinct signature in young second- growth forest regeneration. In certain cases seedlings growing around a mature fruiting Iriartea palms may actually come from dozens of different trees hundreds of meters away. Taxonomy and systematics Almost all species at one time placed in Iriartea have now been moved elsewhere or placed in synonymy with I. deltoidea. Dictyocaryum, Iriartella, Socratea and Wettinia were split off from the Iriartea but are close relatives, together with the present genus forming the tribe Iriarteeae. Less closely related palms which were at one time presumed to be Iriarteeae are members of the genera Ceroxylon, Drymophloeus, and the monotypic Deckenia nobilis. There remain a few somewhat dubious taxa, published in L'Illustration Horticole in 1881. These may be synonyms or good species, but probably the former: * Iriartea affinis H.Karst. ex Linden * Iriartea costata Linden * Iriartea glaucescens Linden * Iriartea pygmaea Linden (nomen nudum) * Iriartea xanthorhiza Klotzsch ex Linden * Iriartea zamorensis Linden Footnotes References * (2004): World Checklist of Arecaceae - Iriartea.

It occurs worldwide in subantarctic oceans. Although O. ingens was long attributed to the genus Moroteuthis, several authors have recently agreed that Moroteuthis is a junior synonym of Onykia.Bolstad, K.S.R. 2010. Systematics of the Onychoteuthidae Gray, 1847 (Cephalopoda: Oegopsida). Zootaxa 2696: 1‚Äì186. Preview Size and growth Mature female (38.4 cm ML, 1.875 kg weight) from the Chatham Rise The size of a fully grown O. ingens, inclusive of tentacles, is currently unknown. Many estimates, however, predict that the mantle may reach lengths of up to 94 cm (37 in). Research has found that egg sizes of the squid average 2.1 mm inside mature females, while juveniles average 4.6 mm or larger. Juveniles are presumed to live near the surface, until they reach a mantle length of approximately 200 mm, at which time they relocate to deeper water, and larger prey. O. ingens exhibit sexual dimorphism, with females growing linearly twice as fast as males, and reaching a fully mature size of more than five times that of male counterparts.Bolstad, K. 2003. Spotlight on: Moroteuthis ingens . The Octopus News Magazine Online. Penis elongation has been observed in this species; when erect, the penis may be as long as the mantle, head and arms combined.Arkhipkin, A.I. & V.V. Laptikhovsky 2010.

As such, deep water squid like M. ingens have the greatest known penis length relative to body size of all mobile animals, second in the entire animal kingdom only to certain sessile barnacles. Ecology It is generally accepted that there are large dietary variations between large and small O. ingens. One of the most common findings is that juvenile squid (>200 mm ML) consume a greater percentage of crustaceans and cephalopods compared to their size than mature squid, which consume a large percentage of fish and virtually no crustaceans.Phillips, K., P.

They are often listed as a heavy metal band but have never categorized themselves as such. They have gradually come to be acknowledged as an important part of Icelandic rock history. Today they command a cult following among many Icelandic rock enthusiasts. History HAM's first album was Hold, a controversial record which received no radio airtime. The band's attempt to get into the big league began when they warmed up for The Sugarcubes in five concerts in 1988. The following year they released the album Buffalo Virgin with One Little Indian records and held several concerts in New York. The album Pleasing the Pirahna was recorded in 1990 but was never released‚Äîsupposedly another album by the name Pimpmobile was also recorded but remains unreleased. In 1991-1992, the band participated in the making of the film S√≥d√≥ma Reykjav√≠k, with singer and guitarist Sigurj√≥n Kjartansson writing most of the soundtrack. HAM's participation in the making of this cult Icelandic classic played a significant part in the band's later notoriety. The album Saga rokksins was released in 1993, and on June 4, 1994, the band held its last concert in the now defunct night club Tungli√∞ in downtown Reykjav√≠k. The live concert recording was subsequently released as the album Lengi lifi. In 1995, the band's remaining studio recordings were released as the album Dau√∞ur hestur (Equus Mortus). HAM did not perform again until 2001, when it was clear that the German metal band Rammstein would be holding a concert in Iceland that summer. It was rumoured that Sigurj√≥n had spoken of HAM reuniting for a concert if Rammstein were to visit Iceland on tour. The band played in the Gaukur √° St√∂ng bar on June 14, 2001 and then again on June 15, with 5500 people in attendance. The Gaukur √° st√∂ng concert was later released as the live album Skert flog. HAM was to participate in the music festival Reykjav√≠k Rokkar in the summer of 2006 along with The Darkness and Mot√∂rhead. The festival was cancelled due to disappointing ticket sales, but HAM instead performed in the NASA club in downtown Reykjav√≠k on June 29 to a packed house. On October 28 the same year HAM performed at a north atlantic music festival in Copenhagen with bands from Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

Founded in 1842 as the College and Grammar School of St. James's, the school is a coeducational college preparatory school and the oldest Episcopal boarding school in the United States founded as a boarding school proper. History Saint James is the second iteration of an innovative type of school conceived by William Augustus Muhlenberg (1796‚Äì1877) who founded model schools on Long Island in 1828 and 1836. The founding Rector of Saint James was John Barrett Kerfoot (1816‚Äì1881), who was Muhlenberg's principal disciple for thirteen years before Muhlenberg sent him to Western Maryland to extend the mission. The models established at Flushing and College Point, Long Island, and in St. James, Maryland, were the mother lode for much subsequent prospecting. Staff from Saint James founded St. Paul's, Concord, New Hampshire, St. Mark's, Southborough, Massachusetts; and several other schools. Racine College in Wisconsin (1852) was modeled on Saint James and its celebrated rector James DeKoven recruited faculty from Saint James. Administration Saint James is one of twenty-four Episcopal Schools in the Diocese of Maryland.List, Diocese of Maryland, Schools. The school is governed by a Board of Trustees. A Prefect Council, made up of ten seniors elected by the students and the faculty, upholds the traditions of Saint James and assists faculty members and the Headmaster in the day-to-day operations of the School. Of this group, one member is elected Senior Prefect, and he or she leads the Prefects. The Sacristans and Chapel Vestry assist in the liturgy of daily services. The Senior Sacristan is the third ranking position for students on campus, following the Senior Prefect and the Yearbook Editor, and is the chief student assistant to the Chaplain, the Rev. Brandt Leonard Montgomery. Saint James School is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and the Maryland State Department of Education. The school is a member of: the National Association of Independent Schools, the Association of Independent Maryland Schools, Cum Laude Society, the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, and the National Association of Episcopal Schools. Faculty The school is led by the headmaster of twenty-eight years, the Rev. Dr. Donald Stuart Dunnan. Dunnan was appointed Rector & Headmaster of Saint James School in July 1993. A teacher and chaplain at both the school and university levels before he came to Saint James, he is one of the few Episcopal priests still serving as the head of a secondary school in the United States. Campus Saint James School is situated in a rural area. The Georgian-style buildings are in farmland containing a natural spring, fields, and streams. Total acreage exceeds 800 acres.

The name Otodus comes from Ancient Greek (, meaning \\"ear\\") and (, meaning \\"tooth\\") ‚Äì thus, \\"ear-shaped tooth\\". Anatomy This shark is known from its fossilized teeth and vertebral centra. Like other elasmobranchs, the skeleton of Otodus was composed of cartilage and not bone, resulting in relatively few preserved skeletal structures appearing within the fossil record. The teeth of this shark are large with triangular crown, smooth cutting edges, and visible cusps on the roots. Some Otodus teeth also show signs of evolving serrations. lingual (tongue-side) view of a lateral O. obliquus. Size estimation The fossils of Otodus indicate that it was a very large macro-predatory shark. The largest known teeth measure about in height. The vertebral centrum of this shark are over 12.7 cm (5 inch) wide. Scientists suggest that this shark at least reached in total length (TL), with a maximum length of . Distribution Otodus had a worldwide distribution, as fossils have been excavated from Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. Diet Otodus likely preyed upon large bony fish, other sharks, and from the Eocene until the genus' extinction during the Miocene, marine mammals. It was among the top predators of its time. Evolution It is widely believed that the genus originates from a lineage of sharks belonging to the genus Cretalamna, due to strong similarities in tooth morphology. Scientists determined that Otodus evolved into the genus Carcharocles, given substantial fossil evidence in the form of transitional teeth. Some teeth have been excavated from the sediments of the Nanjemoy Formation in Maryland, USA, Ypres clay in Belgium, and western Kazakhstan, which are morphologically very similar to Otodus teeth but with lightly serrated cusplets and a serrated cutting edge. These transitional fossils suggest a worldwide evolutionary event, and support the theory that Otodus eventually evolved into Otodus aksuaticus and thus initiated the Carcharocles lineage. A more recent study of Megalolamna's taxonomic relationships demonstrates the possibility that Otodus needs to include the species sometimes assigned to Carcharocles (i.e., the megatoothed lineage, including megalodon) in order to be monophyletic.

Meanwhile, Fox Television Stations (which owned several UPN-affiliated stations in large cities that were blocked from affiliating with The CW) signed up with MyNetworkTV, a new network owned by then-parent company News Corporation's Fox Entertainment Group. Background In January 1995, The WB Television Network and the United Paramount Network were launched, each hoping to recreate the success of the Fox network, which had launched in October 1986 and became one of America's \\"major\\" networks through the successes of several early series (such as The Simpsons, Married... with Children and Beverly Hills, 90210) and its 1993 deal with the National Football League (NFL) to assume the broadcast rights to the National Football Conference from CBS. Like with Fox at the time, The WB targeted a mostly teenage and young adult audience; UPN, however, aimed its programming at a broader demographic of adults between 18 and 49 years of age. All three networks had been joint ventures between major Hollywood studios and large owners of previously independent stations ‚Äì The WB was owned by the Warner Bros. Entertainment division of Time Warner, in a joint venture with the Tribune Company, and UPN was founded by Chris-Craft Industries, in a programming partnership with Paramount Pictures. In October 1993, Chris-Craft and the Paramount Stations Group reached affiliation agreements with most of the independent stations owned by the respective groups to serve as charter UPN affiliates. That November, Tribune cut affiliation deals with The WB for all eight independent stations it owned at the time (including stations in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago) ‚Äì as well as a station in Boston that Tribune bought from the Gannett Company the following year, though only seven would join the network at launch due to the company's Atlanta station affiliating with CBS (its New Orleans station would follow suit in 1996, switching its affiliation to ABC); Chris-Craft and Paramount also each owned independent stations in large and mid-sized markets (with the former owning stations in New York City and Los Angeles). Both new networks launched to limited fanfare and generally poor results. Over the course of 11¬Ω seasons, despite a number of minor-hit or cult-hit series such as Star Trek: Voyager, 7th Heaven, Gilmore Girls, Girlfriends, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Kids' WB's airing of the anime Pok√©mon, neither network was able to attain the stature that Fox had gained in its first decade, much less that of the longstanding \\"Big Three\\" television networks (ABC, CBS and NBC). By early 2006, both networks were losing money, although The WB had been profitable a few seasons earlier; in slight contrast, UPN had never turned a profit and had already lost $800 million in its first five years of operation. Reports indicated that the prospects for both networks were fading quickly. A further complication was the various shifts in network and affiliate ownership at UPN. Shortly before its launch, Paramount Pictures' corporate parent Paramount Communications was purchased by Viacom, which later purchased a 50% stake in UPN in December 1996, and acquired CBS in 2000. Viacom was permitted to keep interests in both networks, in effect, resulting in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) lifting its long-standing ban on television station duopolies. Chris-Craft's relations with Viacom were strained in February 2000 when the latter firm exercised a contractual right to force Chris-Craft to either buy Viacom out of UPN, or sell its stake in the network to Viacom within a 45-day grace period. Chris-Craft subsequently filed a lawsuit against Viacom in the New York Supreme Court to block the CBS merger on grounds that a pact reached between Chris-Craft and Viacom in 1997 disallowed either company from owning \\"any interest, financial or otherwise\\" in \\"any competing network\\" through January 2001, however New York Supreme Court judge Herman Cahn ruled against Chris-Craft's move for a permanent injunction motion in March 2000. Chris-Craft could not find a suitable partner and sold its interest in UPN to Viacom for $5 million that April. This had the adverse effect of making UPN one of the few networks not to have owned-and- operated stations in New York City and Los Angeles (additionally, UPN never had an O&O; in the Chicago market throughout its existence). Similarly, The WB had the distinction of being the only American broadcast network never to have had an O&O;, as although minority owner Tribune operated its core charter stations, Time Warner held majority ownership in the network (with a maximum interest of 77.5%, during the final years of The WB's existence). Time Warner did acquire Atlanta independent station WTBS (which served as the originating feed of then-superstation TBS) through its 1996 merger with the Turner Broadcasting System, however WATL (which Tribune would acquire in 1999) served as the WB affiliate for that market throughout the network's run. That August, when Chris-Craft put its television stations ‚Äì most of them UPN affiliates ‚Äì up for sale, it sold them to News Corporation's Fox Television Stations subsidiary instead of Viacom. At the time, Fox seemed to be a willing partner in UPN, but made no firm commitment. On September 24, 2003, Fox Television Stations renewed affiliation agreements for its nine UPN stations for three years through 2006. In December 2005, Viacom split into two companies: a new company keeping the Viacom name (which took the original company's film and most of its cable television properties), and CBS Corporation (essentially the old Viacom renamed, which retained the broadcast properties, along with Showtime Networks). In this \\"split\\", ownership of UPN went to CBS Corporation. The new \\"fifth\\" and \\"sixth\\" networks On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner announced they would shut down both UPN and The WB that fall. In place of these two networks, a new \\"fifth\\" network that would be jointly owned by both companies, would launch, with a lineup made primarily of the most popular programs from both The WB and UPN. The network was given the name \\"The CW\\" (\\"CW\\" representing the first initials of _C_ BS and _W_ arner Bros.). The CW immediately announced ten-year affiliation agreements with 16 WB affiliates owned by Tribune Broadcasting, and 11 UPN owned-and-operated stations under CBS ownership, giving the new network coverage in all of the top 13 markets and a reach of 48% of the country. The remaining affiliates were to be drawn from the pool of stations affiliated with UPN and The WB. The CW took on The WB's base scheduling model (two hours of prime time programming each Monday through Friday and five hours on Sundays, a two-hour daytime block on weekdays and a five-hour Saturday morning children's block), which was larger in scope compared to UPN, which aired prime time programming only on weekdays and a two-hour repeat block on weekends at the time of the CW announcement. It was immediately clear that most media markets which had stations that were owned by Tribune would receive the CW affiliation, leaving Fox Television Stations, UPN's second largest affiliate group (after the UPN O&Os; owned by CBS Television Stations), without any network programming during primetime hours. Rumors began to circulate that Fox would develop its own network for those affected stations and others left out in the merger. The rumors proved true, and on February 22, 2006, Fox announced the launch of its own network, MyNetworkTV, a programming service meant to fill the two nightly primetime hours that would open up on its UPN-affiliated stations after the start of The CW. Fox also offered the service to other stations. Stations Following the CW network announcement, the new network immediately announced ten-year affiliation agreements with the Tribune Company and CBS Television Stations. Tribune committed 16 stations ‚Äì including its flagship broadcast stations WGN-TV (channel 9) in Chicago; KTLA (channel 5) in Los Angeles; and WPIX (channel 11) in New York City ‚Äì that were previously affiliated with The WB, while CBS committed 11 of its UPN stations ‚Äì including WPSG (channel 57) in Philadelphia; WKBD (channel 50) in Detroit; and WUPA (channel 69) in Atlanta. These stations combined to reach 48% of the United States. Both groups also owned several UPN- and WB-affiliated stations that did not join The CW in overlapping markets. As part of its agreement, Tribune agreed to divest its 22.5% ownership interest in The WB ‚Äì a decision that the company made in part to avoid shouldering shutdown costs for the network ‚Äì and did not acquire an interest in The CW. The CW would eventually reach 95% of all television households in the United States. In markets where both UPN and WB affiliates operated, only one station became a CW affiliate. CW executives were on record as preferring the \\"strongest\\" stations viewership-wise among The WB and UPN's existing affiliates. However, as the reorganization was structured not as a merger in the legal sense, but as a new network launching concurrent with the shutdowns of The WB and UPN, The CW was not obligated by existing affiliations with The WB and UPN. It had to negotiate affiliation agreements from scratch with individual stations. As a result, in some markets, the new CW affiliate was a different station than either the former WB and UPN stations. In Helena, Montana, Ion Television affiliate KMTF (channel 10; now PBS member station KUHM-TV) became a CW station. In Las Vegas, Nevada, independent station KFBT (channel 33, now KVCW) chose to affiliate with The CW. In Honolulu, Hawaii, The CW did not become available in the market until early December 2006, where it was carried on a digital subchannel of local Fox affiliate KHON-TV (channel 2). The network also affiliated with some digital channels, mainly newly launched subchannels of a local Big Four affiliate, in several markets. Under the new network, a new service called The CW Plus began serving Nielsen markets with rankings of 100 and lower, featuring a pre-supplied master schedule of programs acquired from the syndication market in addition to CW network programming. The CW Plus is structured similarly to The WB 100+ Station Group, which supplied locally branded WB-affiliated cable channels. In most cases, distribution for The CW Plus covers not only cable but broadcast television as well, including the digital subchannels discussed above. On March 1, 2006, five stations ‚Äì four WB affiliates and one UPN affiliate ‚Äì were the first outside the core CBS and Tribune stations to sign affiliation deals with The CW. By May 18, 2006, 174 stations had signed agreements to become affiliates of The CW, reaching 105 million households and covering 95.3% of the country (the latter two figures excluding the CW stations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Station groups that signed up a large number of their stations as CW affiliates included Pappas Telecasting Companies, ACME Communications and Sinclair Broadcast Group, although many other large groups, including Hearst-Argyle Television, Clear Channel Communications and Belo Corporation had signed up selected stations. Sinclair signed deals to carry the network in early May, despite reservations with The CW's reported demands for reverse compensation. While WGN-TV in Chicago became a charter affiliate of The CW, its former national counterpart WGN America never aired programs from The CW through a formal affiliation when it operated as WGN-TV's out-of-market superstation feed prior to December 2014 (although it did carry reruns of select CW series in marathon form in 2013), as the network has sufficient enough affiliate coverage that The CW did not need to use the national WGN feed to carry its programming; WGN America had previously carried WB programming from that network's January 1995 launch until October 1999, when Tribune Broadcasting and Time Warner mutually decided that The WB's national broadcast coverage had increased to a level that allowed the WGN national feed to discontinue carrying the network. Several affiliates changed their call letters to reflect their new affiliation with The CW (e.g. KPWB-TV (Des Moines) to KCWI, WNPA-TV (Pittsburgh) to WPCW-TV, WJWB (Jacksonville) to WCWJ, WHCP (Portsmouth, Ohio, serving the Charleston, West Virginia market) to WQCW, WEWB (Albany, New York) to WCWN, KWCV (Wichita, Kansas) to KSCW, WBDC (Washington, D.C.) to WDCW, KBHK (San Francisco) to KBCW, and KHWB (Houston) to KHCW). Some stations, however, retained call signs that referred to UPN and The WB, such as WUPA in Atlanta and KWBA-TV in Tucson, Arizona, respectively. In August 2006, CBS Corporation's CW stations dropped all references to UPN from their branding. Due to the availability of \\"instant duopoly\\" digital subchannels, and the overall lack of a need to settle for a secondary affiliation with shows aired in problematic timeslots, both The CW and MyNetworkTV launched with far greater national coverage than that enjoyed by UPN and The WB when they started in 1995. For several years, UPN had coverage gaps in the top 30 markets, and by 2005 had only managed to reach 86% of the population. This resulted in secondary affiliations with other networks (with some dual WB-UPN affiliates airing the latter network's programming immediately after The WB's primetime lineup, and vice versa) and diluted ratings when programs were shown out of their intended timeslots, or the lack of the program airing at all (a problem experienced by many Star Trek fans with Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise). Repercussions Comparisons to 1994 realignment The WB and UPN were the first major television networks to shut down since the collapse of the DuMont Television Network in 1956, although other small broadcast television networks have also ceased operations over the years. Given the merger of the two networks to create The CW (as well as the eventual launch of MyNetworkTV and the proliferation of digital subchannels), the scope of the realignment caused the largest single shakeup in American broadcast television since the Fox/New World Communications alliance of 1994, which preceded the subsequent launches of UPN and The WB the following year that drastically reduced the number of independent television stations in the U.S., some of which had been marketed and distributed as superstations as recently as the mid-1990s. While The CW's debut affected more markets, unlike the Fox/New World deal of the mid-1990s, it was unlikely to cause the same degree of viewer confusion as almost no affiliates of the four major networks dropped those affiliations to become CW affiliates. Only two former Big Four affiliates switched their primary affiliation, in both cases from Fox to MyNetworkTV: * In the Jackson, Mississippi market, Fox affiliate WUFX (channel 35) swapped affiliations with sister station (and the market's original Fox affiliate) WDBD (channel 40; The WB) in the summer before joining MyNetworkTV the following season after three seasons with Fox. Unrelated UPN affiliate WRBJ (channel 34), which signed on the air in early 2006, joined The CW. * In the Fort Smith-Fayetteville, Arkansas market, low-power Fox affiliate KPBI-CA (channel 46) switched to MyNetworkTV (along with KPBI (TV), channel 34). Fox had moved its affiliation to full-power KFTA-TV (channel 24), formerly a satellite of NBC affiliate KNWA-TV (channel 51). None of the three stations that were available (the two KPBI's and UPN affiliate KFDF-CA (channel 10)) joined The CW; they were all owned by Equity Broadcasting, which shunned The CW in every one of its markets (KFDF-CA joined the Equity-owned Retro Television Network instead). The CW would finally come to the market the following year on a cable-only channel available via Cox Communications (and eventually on digital subchannels of the market's ABC affiliate, KHBS/KHOG-TV, channels 40 and 29). Equity would eventually declare bankruptcy in 2009 due to a number of factors involving the digital transition and problems with RTV which led it to losing control of that network to Luken Communications. There were several other cases where Big Four affiliates picked up The CW, MyNetworkTV, or both as a secondary affiliation on their main channel or as a digital subchannel affiliation, even in markets where viable non-network affiliate stations remained. Network affiliation repercussions In media markets where there were separate affiliates of The WB and UPN, one local station was left out in the merger. Many of these stations signed with MyNetworkTV including the vast majority of the Fox stations acquired in the 2001 acquisition of BHC Communications (the former Chris-Craft stations). Additionally, MyNetworkTV signed with three Tribune stations that did not take the CW affiliation: WPHL (channel 17) in Philadelphia, WATL (channel 36) in Atlanta and KTWB (channel 20) in Seattle. Tribune had indicated interest in Fox-developed programming blocks such as MyNetworkTV for stations that did not pick up the CW affiliation; the company announced on May 15 that the aforementioned stations would join MyNetworkTV. In contrast, CBS initially seemed more hostile to MyNetworkTV, and announced its remaining UPN affiliates ‚Äì KTXA (channel 21) in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, WSBK-TV (channel 38) in Boston, WBFS-TV (channel 33) in Miami/Fort Lauderdale, and WUPL (channel 54) in New Orleans as well as WB affiliate WTCN-CA (channel 50) in West Palm Beach ‚Äì would all become independent stations. Four of the five stations, excluding KTXA, eventually all joined MyNetworkTV. Some stations bypassed by The CW that did not take MyNetworkTV instead opted to become (or revert to) independent stations. For example, the two remaining former Viacom-owned UPN stations ‚Äì WSBK and KTXA ‚Äì reverted to their roots as independent stations (the latter was constrained to independence in any event due to Fox-owned KDFI (channel 27), affiliating with MyNetworkTV). As a consequence, in three of the top 10 media markets ‚Äì Boston, Dallas/Fort Worth and San Francisco ‚Äì programs from The WB, UPN and MyNetworkTV were all available to viewers from September 5 to 17. MyNetworkTV affiliated with longtime former independent stations WZMY (channel 50) in Derry, New Hampshire (serving the Boston market) and KDFI, while in San Francisco the network affiliated with former longtime NBC affiliate KRON-TV (channel 4; WB affiliate KBWB channel 20, reverted to independent status). Other stations elected to become (or revert to) independent stations as well, particularly in situations where either more than two non-major network affiliate stations existed or another station picked up an affiliation with The CW or MyNetworkTV via a digital subchannel. Additionally, four former UPN affiliates became affiliates of \\"Big Four\\" networks themselves: * WJKT (channel 16) in Jackson, Tennessee and the digital subchannel of WBOC in Salisbury, Maryland joined Fox on August 21, 2006. * WLQP-LP (channel 25) in Lima, Ohio became the local ABC affiliate on September 1, 2006. * WSWG (channel 44) in Valdosta, Georgia became a CBS affiliate and added MyNetworkTV as a digital subchannel on September 4. Additionally, while some stations joined newly established or lesser-known broadcast networks such as RTV), whose now-defunct parent company Equity Broadcasting did not commit any of its WB affiliates to The CW, other stations (mainly digital subchannels, cable channels such as those that were WB 100+ cable channels, and struggling low-power stations) which received neither The CW nor the MyNetworkTV affiliation opted instead to cease operations entirely. For example, in Dayton, Ohio, the \\"UPN17\\" cable channel run by CBS affiliate WHIO- TV (channel 7) closed down at the end of 2006. Despite the launch of The CW on September 18, 2006, many households around the country were not able to see the new network when it premiered because stations in several markets, primarily those that chose to carry The CW on a digital subchannel of the station's primary affiliate, were unsuccessful in trying to strike a deal with Time Warner Cable to carry their CW subchannels on basic cable lineups, despite the fact that The CW was 50% owned by the provider's then-parent company Time Warner. These markets included Cincinnati; Honolulu; Charleston, South Carolina; El Paso; Corpus Christi; Palm Springs and Lima, Ohio. In late 2006, the Honolulu, El Paso and Palm Springs affiliates were made available on TWC systems in those markets. Network transition repercussions After the conclusion of the May 2006 sweeps period, as both The WB and UPN started shutting down, both programming schedules and on-screen graphics were affected, and on August 14, 2006 both networks stopped inserting their logo bugs into prime time programming in order to allow CW affiliates-to-be to add lower thirds and bugs promoting the new network during this time ‚Äì this practice was automatically used on WB affiliates' primetime programming. Also on August 14, 2006, UPN discontinued all promotional advertising for its programs during network time periods (except for audition promotions for America's Next Top Model that aired during that program), though some local stations still aired promos for the network's shows. The network also stopped customizing the closing credits of its shows to the network's standardized graphics scheme (perhaps in reaction to affiliate preemptions, see below), instead showing the program's studio credits full-screen with theme music intact (save for ANTM, where previews for the next episode and casting calls for future CW cycles were shown on the left side of the screen with the studio credits on the right). In contrast, at The WB, advertising for its shows continued during network time periods, with promos for The CW mixed in, and the network's standard closing credits format remained unchanged with promos in the upper two-thirds of the screen and credits in the lower third. The networks also filled spare timeslots with low-cost movies on some weeks (including UPN on Wednesday night and The WB during its infamous \\"Friday night death slot\\"), and reruns and unaired episodes of long-cancelled programs, such as the sketch comedy series Blue Collar TV on Wednesday nights, and repeat and unaired episodes of the dramedy Just Legal on Sunday nights (both on The WB). Prior to the MyNetworkTV announcement, many stations (including those snubbed by The CW) had reportedly begun to search for new programming to fill empty timeslots, which had been likely to further boost the fortunes of the syndication industry. Ironically, one of those syndicated offerings, Desire, eventually became part of MyNetworkTV's fall 2006 schedule. Other affiliate repercussions Following the CW announcement, the fate of many WB and UPN affiliates changed drastically. On January 27, 2006, KQEG-CA (channel 23) in La Crosse, Wisconsin dropped its UPN affiliation, becoming the first station to disaffiliate from a partner network due to the CW announcement; it retained its FamilyNet affiliation. Many affected affiliates took similar measures. Following the May 2006 sweeps period, many stations began to pre-empt UPN and WB programming for a variety of reasons. In the Green Bay/Appleton market, future MyNetworkTV affiliate WACY (channel 32), on June 5, opted to replace programs that aired during UPN's second hour of primetime (except for Veronica Mars) whenever possible with infomercials.http://img82.imageshack.us/img82/2289/titantv4ml.jpg In Cincinnati, eventual independent station WBQC-LP (channel 25) moved its UPN programming on July 4 to between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m. early Tuesday to Saturday morning, with the intention of promoting the station's \\"Independence Day\\" programming in its place.http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060625/ENT/606250308/1025/LIFE Another eventual independent station, KPNZ (channel 24) in Salt Lake City, dropped UPN programming in June 2006 with no replacement affiliate for the remaining two months (KPNZ is now an owned-and-operated station of Spanish- language network Estrella TV). In Springfield, Massachusetts, WB 100+ cable channel WBQT was at one point referred as a CW affiliate on the official website and even started advertising as such, but due to a lack of confirmation, the channel's call letters (which were fictional as WB 100+ stations were not licensed by the FCC due to being cable-only services) were removed. However, on August 29, 2006, WBQT signed a formal affiliation agreement with The CW as a member channel of The CW Plus. In 2015, WBQT was dissolved, with The CW Plus moving over-the-air to NBC affiliate WWLP's second subchannel. Before the merger, the cash-strapped Granite Broadcasting Corporation had reached an agreement to sell its WB affiliates in San Francisco and Detroit to AM Media, a unit of private equity firm Acon Investments. With The CW choosing to affiliate with CBS-owned UPN stations in those markets, the Granite-AM Media deal eventually collapsed, and Granite responded by deciding to instead sell the stations to DS Audible, LLC for a lesser price. Granite later announced that it would sue CBS and Time Warner over the failed deal. On July 18, 2006, the deal to sell to DS Audible also fell apart, and on December 11, 2006, Granite filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization after missing an interest payment on its $400 million+ debt. Granite emerged from bankruptcy in June 2007 under control of Silver Point Capital, which also took over another bankrupt broadcasting company, Communications Corporation of America (a key Fox affiliate group in smaller markets within the Southern U.S.), later that year. As of 2019, Granite has since sold both stations to separate parties. In New Orleans, CBS filed a lawsuit against Belo, owner of market-dominant CBS affiliate WWL-TV (channel 4), in February 2006 over allegations that Belo tried to renege on the terms of buying WUPL after Tribune-owned WNOL (channel 38) was named the market's CW affiliate (but before WUPL's affiliation with MyNetworkTV was announced). The deal, already complicated in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina which caused catastrophic damage to much of the Greater New Orleans area, would have created a duopoly between WWL-TV and WUPL with both stations merging into WWL's longtime studios on Rampart Street in New Orleans' French Quarter. All matters were eventually settled, and the deal closed in February 2007. However, the Belo purchase of WUPL delayed that station's transition to high definition until mid-2010 as the secondary master controls for WUPL at the WWL-TV facility were only capable of pillarboxed 4:3 standard definition broadcasts until the recent upgrades took place (the Gannett Company purchased WUPL and WWL-TV in 2013 as part of their acquisition of Belo, and has since been spun off to Gannett's broadcasting successor, Tegna). UPN and The WB closures UPN UPN quietly ceased operations on Friday, September 15, 2006, with its usual airing of WWE Friday Night SmackDown; in addition, some stations aired the network's usual, but optional, weekend repeat block. The low-key closure was not surprising given that in nine media markets, including the three largest, UPN was not available because the local affiliates were owned by Fox Television Stations and switched to its new network, MyNetworkTV, on September 5. UPN programs stopped airing on WPWR (channel 50) in Chicago and KUTP (channel 45) in Phoenix on September 1, and on the other seven Fox- owned stations (including WWOR-TV (channel 9) in New York City and KCOP (channel 13) in Los Angeles) the day before, August 31. Several CW affiliates began airing Smackdown and some other CW-renewed UPN programming a few weeks early to replace UPN affiliates that had switched to MyNetworkTV. Otherwise, it was unclear whether MyNetworkTV affiliates would air UPN or WB programs at all. Additionally, Tribune-owned Fox affiliate WXMI (channel 17) in Grand Rapids, Michigan aired Smackdown on tape delay between WXSP-CA (channel 15)'s switch to MyNetworkTV and the launch of WWMT (channel 3)'s digital subchannel as the local CW affiliate. The WB The WB closed on Sunday, September 17 with a five-hour block of pilot episodes of the network's past signature series, including Felicity, Angel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (which was a two- hour episode) and Dawson's Creek. Commercial breaks shown on the network that evening featured re-airings of past image campaigns and network promotions, promo spots given to cable networks that carried these shows in off-network syndication, as well as ads for each series' TV-on-DVD box set. After its final commercial break, a montage featuring stars of several of The WB's shows over the years was broadcast just prior to the network's shutdown, ending with a silhouette of former mascot Michigan J. Frog taking a final bow. This was followed by the studio credits for the pilot of Dawson's Creek;. September 17, 2006. the credits for the other three pilots that aired were shown in the network's standardized credits format. The final night of WB programming netted relatively low ratings, mustering only a share of 2, meaning just 2% of viewers were tuned into The WB on its final night. The reasoning for the low ratings was due to the fact that WB affiliates in certain areas had already affiliated with MyNetworkTV at that network's launch, which rendered The WB's programming unavailable in these markets during its final two weeks of broadcasting. It also aired against the second ever game (a Cowboys‚ÄìRedskins rivalry game at Texas Stadium) of NBC Sunday Night Football, assuring fewer viewers due to the curiosity of the NFL's prime game now being on Sunday evenings. That evening, after The WB shut down, some Tribune-owned affiliates that would join The CW when it launched the following night acknowledged the pending switchover within their newscasts, with most adopting their new CW station brands immediately. WPIX in New York City aired a montage of all of the logos used throughout the station's history leading up to the introduction of its new \\"CW11\\" logo before the start of its 10:00 p.m. newscast,. May 8, 2009. Retrieved September 2, 2015. while KHCW (channel 39) in Houston aired a retrospective of the station's history during its 9:00 p.m. news. In Dallas- Fort Worth, KDAF (channel 33) had retitled its primetime newscast to CW33 News at Nine immediately following the end of WB programming, and featured a video clip of the signage being changed outside the station's studios (however, the old WB33 News at Nine bumper aired upon returning from the first commercial break that night). Post-realignment  The CW  Since 2006, The CW and MyNetworkTV have struggled significantly in the Nielsen ratings, despite The CW showing initial signs of promise. The CW has usually finished fifth in the Nielsen ratings, even falling behind Spanish-language network Univision at times, though it has come close to beating out NBC (which had similar ratings challenges beginning in the 2004‚Äì05 television season, before moderating in the 2012‚Äì13 season) on several occasions. However, The CW has had some successful series (by the standards of the network's viewership, which has rarely peaked above 4 million viewers for a single episode), such as Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries and Arrow. Additionally in 2008, concerns regarding the future of The CW led Tribune to begin rebranding its CW affiliates in a way that deemphasized its network affiliation, and another major CW affiliate ownership group, Pappas Telecasting Companies, cited The CW's poor performance as a factor in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Pappas has since wound down operations, while most of Tribune's CW stations (with the exceptions of WGN-TV and KTLA, the latter of which only includes network references in promos for CW shows) began reincorporating references to their CW affiliation beginning in 2011. The merger of UPN and The WB to form The CW has led to instability of the airings of WWE SmackDown, which had aired on UPN for its first seven years. After September 26, 2008, WWE Friday Night SmackDown left The CW for MyNetworkTV in large part due to The CW's newfound focus on targeting 18- to 34-year-old female viewers, though WWE would later air the short-lived WWE Saturday Morning Slam on The CW Saturday mornings. SmackDown eventually moved to cable as part of WWE's contract with NBCUniversal for its other programs, initially to Syfy in October 2010, prompted by a move back to Thursday nights in November 2014 (where it had originally aired before 2005), then to USA Network (longtime home to WWE Raw, save for a five-year period on The New TNN/Spike TV from 2000 to 2005) in January 2016, followed again by another move only six months later‚Äîthis time to Tuesday nights‚Äîas part of the 2nd brand extension. SmackDown is scheduled to return to broadcast television on Fox in October 2019, accompanied by a return to Friday nights, as part of Fox's emphasis on sports and live event programming due in part of the sale of much of 21st Century Fox to The Walt Disney Company. The move of SmackDown back to broadcast television also poses a potential conflict of interest with Fox's largest affiliate group, the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which purchased rival wrestling promotion Ring of Honor in 2011 after SmackDown had moved to cable. In September 2008, The CW outsourced its five-hour Sunday block to Media Rights Capital (MRC) in order to concentrate on its weekday schedule. The MRC-programmed Sunday lineup performed poorly in the ratings and was replaced by reruns and movies programmed by the network that November; The CW eventually gave back its Sunday primetime slots to the network's local affiliates in September 2009, reducing its prime time programming to weeknights only (and the network's programming to six days a week overall, when its Saturday morning children's lineup and weekday daytime block is accounted). The CW's ratings struggles eventually subsided in later years: the network beat NBC for the first time in the key demographic of Adults 18‚Äì49 for a single calendar night on November 21, 2013. Other recent series successes (including the revival of the U.S. version of the improv comedy series Whose Line Is It Anyway?, The Flash and Jane the Virgin) helped The CW increase its ratings year-over-year by the 2014‚Äì15 season ‚Äì at which point, The CW posted its highest season average total viewership since the 2007‚Äì08 season with 2.15 million.  MyNetworkTV  Since its launch, MyNetworkTV has struggled to gain an audience. In 2009, it was announced that the network would convert to a syndicated programming service, and since SmackDown moved to Syfy in October 2010, MyNetworkTV has been devoid of first-run programming other than that shared with syndicators. In many markets (mainly in smaller and lower-tier mid-sized markets), it now shares channel space with other minor networks such as America One, This TV and MeTV and is more apt to air out of prime time on several affiliates (in Monroe, Louisiana, for instance, after their first affiliate left the airwaves completely and their second affiliate ended carriage to become a full-time religious station, it now is carried in the graveyard slot on a CW Plus subchannel of KNOE-TV, mainly to overlay dead time that would only be filled with paid programming). In September 2015, West Coast flagship KCOP-TV in Los Angeles moved MyNetworkTV programming to late night, both replacing it with lower-tier entertainment newsmagazines in primetime, and freeing Fox sister station KTTV of any in-house competition in primetime, though it returned to primetime after those programs flopped. In Chicago, WPWR-TV moved the lineup to nearly out of primetime on September 1, 2016, upon assuming the CW affiliation from WGN-TV which became an independent station. WPWR-TV would lose its affiliation with the CW in September 2019 and the network's programs would move to WCIU-TV. A similar move happened in Cleveland in July 2018 when MyNetworkTV affiliate WUAB unexpectedly assumed the CW affiliation from WBNX-TV while keeping its MyNetworkTV affiliation in the late-night hours temporarily; it was eventually bumped to sister station WOIO's MeTV subchannel in January 2019, immediately after Gray Television assumed ownership over the former Raycom Media stations.

The program was funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) under the technical direction of the Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC) during the period 1 January 1959 through 30 September 1963.  Project organization  The downrange facility was a Liberty-class merchant vessel renovated and converted for its technical assignment. Its measurement equipment complex included C-band, L-band and UHF radars; digital and analog recorders; gyroscope stabilization; timing generators; mode switching; telemetry acquisition apparatus; radiometers and riometers; boresight cine-TV and other photographic systems; communications and Transit Satellite navigation system. As a complementary measurement facility to the DAMP ship, the Electromagnetic Research Laboratory at Moorestown, New Jersey, contained C- and L-band radar measurement equipment complete with digital and analog recording system in a range-support-tower combination for full-scale cross- section measurements under static conditions with orthogonal polarizations. Recorded analog data from this facility were provided for immediate use. Data from both measurement facilities underwent necessary processing at the Riverton, New Jersey, data reduction center, a part of the Data Analysis Laboratory. Foremost among DAMP Program objectives were to: * Support AMM system designs. * Support penetration aids program. * Support AICBM weapon- system evaluation * Provide scientific information on space environments and hypersonic flight * Advance the general fund of knowledge on re-entry physics and dynamics and the plasma phenomena association with re-entry. * Develop new data acquisition and processing techniques for expanded data quality.  USAS American Mariner  The DAMP Project ship, the USAS American Mariner at anchor Clarence Bay, Ascension Island, 1962 The DAMP ship, the USAS American Mariner, was essentially a floating measurements laboratory that employed various types of sensors, recording apparatus, and technical support equipment. It operated under conventional maritime regulations in the impact area of ballistic missile test firings, primarily in the Caribbean area and in the South Atlantic Ocean, near Ascension Island. During 1962, however, it operated in the Pacific Ocean in order to perform tracking duties during Operation Dominic atomic testing. The shipboard crew, provided by Mathiasen Tankers Corp., was complemented by approximately sixty technical personnel provided by RCA and Barnes Engineering Corporation, who operated and maintained the radar and support equipment. Each mission required a minimum of 36 hours of on-station preparation and pre- and post-flight calibration. Targets were those of opportunity fired on missile ranges as part of the overall ballistic missile test program, which at the time was in its infancy. The DAMP ship participated in numerous missile test operations on the Atlantic Missile Range, as well as on the Pacific Missile Range during 1962 in support of the Operation Dominic atomic tests with emphasis on radio frequency and radar electromagnetic effects. In addition, the DAMP ship served in support of the Ranger Program on the Atlantic Missile Range for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Activities included vehicle tracking during and subsequent to final burnout to supply designation data for the Deep Space Instrumentation Facility. During its operation in the Atlantic Missile Range, the DAMP ship stopped at various ports for logistical support and requirements. Such ports included Recife, Brazil; Antigua, West Indies; Cape Town, and Monrovia and Senegal in Africa. While on the Pacific Missile Range, the DAMP ship was based out of Honolulu, Hawaii, and operated in the Johnston Island area.  Electromagnetic Research Laboratory  The Electromagnetic Research Laboratory (ERL) was located near the Missile and Surface Radar Division plant of RCA in Moorestown, New Jersey. The C-band, low-power, cross- section-measurement system in conjunction with two static range configurations was used for full-scale targets weighing up to 4,000 pounds rotated through 360 degrees. Since measurements must be made on targets as if they were located in free space, returns from other than the target were reduced to 10‚àí5 m¬≤, the general background level of one tower-terrain combination. The low- power radar was capable of transmitting any linear, circular, or elliptical polarization at C-band frequencies. It could receive the horizontal and vertical components of backscattered energy simultaneously. Cross-section data was recorded in analog form on Sanborn and Scientific Atlanta strip-chart recorders and on Ampex magnetic tape. Digital cross sections were also recorded on a specially-designed CEC magnetic tape recorder. Other important functions of the ERL were the training of technical personnel, development and checkout of new equipment and techniques, and satellite tracking using a modified FPQ-4 radar. L-band measurement capability, similar to the C-band equipment, was introduced in late 1963.  Data Analysis Laboratory  The Data Analysis Laboratory (DAL) was, in general, devoted to preparation of DAMP data for dissemination to the many users. These data are submitted to many forms that require numerous reduction processes. Thus, the DAL was divided into three basic operational areas, namely: (1) the Data Reduction Center in Riverton, New Jersey, (2) the Data Interpretation Group in Moorestown, New Jersey, and (3) the Plasma Analysis Group in Moorestown, New Jersey. Raw data from the DAMP ship's sensors was delivered to the data reduction center for reduction, smoothing, and conversion to forms appropriate to interpretation. Equipment used in this data processing cycle included a digital tape translator, an IBM 709 computer, an analog computer, various tape and card converters and card punches, analog and digital playback equipment, data plotters, chart and film readers, oscilloscope cameras and oscilloscopes, a photo darkroom, and miscellaneous support equipment. The processed data would be disseminated directly or would be submitted to the Data Interpretation Group for study, interpretation, correlation, and comparison with theory. The data interpretation group was concerned with annotating basic data with interpretative comments to aid the ultimate data user. Objectives were to investigate every avenue for enhanced data output and maximum data accuracy and usefulness. Theoretical studies and experiments were made to augment the data comparisons and evaluations; such studies embraced the computational areas of numerical, mathematical, and statistical analysis, analog and digital simulation, and computer programming as well as the many physical sciences associated with missile flight and atmospheric re-entry. One of the most important facets of re-entry physics is the interaction of plasmas and ionized wakes with electromagnetic waves. Work was being conducted in both the theoretical and practical nature of plasma physics as related to radar and associated phenomena; the following subcontract organization and consultants were active in support of phases of this research: # RCA Victor, Ltd. Research Laboratories, Montreal, Canada. # Keller and Lewis, New York University under the technical cognizance of Plasma and Space Applied Physics, RCA, Princeton, New Jersey. # General Applied Science Laboratories, Inc., Westbury, New York. To evaluate the effects of plasma and wake on EM propagation, flow field studies were performed to generate plasma density contours. These theoretical results were used for comparison with measured data for analysis. Laboratory experiments and simulation studies were conducted to investigate complex phenomena such as turbulence in the plasma flow field.  DAMP ship characteristics  The DAMP ship, the USAS (United States Army Ship) American Mariner was the primary data collection facility of the DAMP Project. Pertinent ship's characteristics include: * Overall length - . * Beam - . * Displacement (full load) - 10,650 tons. * Speed - 8-10 knots. * Fuel oil capacity - 9,507 barrels. * Fresh water capacity - Tanks - 296,556 gallons - Evaporators - 19,750 gallons/day. * Accommodations - Technical personnel - up to 91. * Accommodations - Crew - Officers - 12 - Other - 55. * Normal endurance (port-to-port) - 45 days.  DAMP ship instrumentation  The DAMP ship was instrumented with various systems designed to locate and track incoming ballistic missiles in the predicted impact area, as well as instrumentation to record raw data. Radar One of the two AN/FPQ-4 radars aboard the DAMP ship permitted the tracking of beacon-carrying targets to an unambiguous range of . The L-band and UHF radars, which shared a common antenna, permitted observation of the target by illumination to supplement the C-band. The AN/FPS-12 radar permitted surveillance of the general vicinity of the DAMP ship as well as vectoring of aircraft which may be assigned to the ship. The telemetry acquisition system was a passive acquisition aid operated on the interfereometer principle which gives angular position of the target relative to the ship. It was not a direct source of range information. Telemetry data was recorded on Magnetic tape at 7.5, 15, 30 and 60 ips from Nems Clark 1432 receiver. The acquisition director, which comprised the RADAP-C Computer together with associated input and output devices, served as an acquisition aid, as means for checkout and calibration of associated electronic equipment, and, in the TRANSIT mode, as an aid to the navigation of the DAMP ship. The Transit system of navigation consisted of the Transit satellite, a worldwide network of tracking stations to observe and determine the orbital elements of the satellite, and suitable receivers and Autonetics Recomp computers aboard the navigating vessel to receive the stable frequency radio signals broadcast by the satellite, to observe the Doppler frequency shift, and from this information, plus the approximate location of the vessel, compute to within one mile (1.6 km) the exact location of the vessel. The quartz Reference Oscillator was the heart of the shipboard system, and operated at 1 MHz and 100 KC with a short term stability of 5 parts in 10 to the tenth averaged over a one-second interval, and a long term stability of 5 parts in 10 to the tenth per day.  Data recording  The Video Integrator accepted the radar video signal returns from a pulsed, range-gated radar system (AN/FPQ-4) and improved the signal-to-noise ratio of the radar video, thereby extending the acquisition range of the radar system. The video is continuously integrated and the output is in realtime. In order to utilize fully the data gathering capabilities of the DAMP ship, it was necessary that the data gathered be stored in a form which permitted easy retrieval at the data analysis facility. Therefore, all data obtained at the DAMP ship was stored only on certified and designated CEC digital recorders, Ampex recorders, a Sanborn recorder, an RCA video recorder and a Mincom recorder. Timing was provided by two Hermes Hycon Eastern timing generators, one primary and one back-up. Timing signal outputs were 24-bit pulse absence code, 17-bit pulse absence code, and 13-bit pulse width code. Both generators were synchronized with Bureau of Standards, WWV, time standard. Raw test data recorded included time, sync and control, tracker 1 and 2 radar data, L-band and UHF radar data, gyro and server data, telemetry, voice, video and any other data designated by the test director. One of the two Mk 51 Mod 3 gun directors, suitably modified and fitted with M-7 elbow telescopes (8-power, 6\\" field) was employed to furnish designation information to the AN/FPQ-4 tracking radars in \\"optical\\" mode. These directors had an azimuth travel of plus/minus 370 degrees and elevated from -20 degrees to +90 degrees. Azimuth and elevation data output was furnished at 1- and 36-speed from two (size 23) 400-cycle synchros. Maximum position error was 0.5 mil.  Communications equipment  Communications aboard the DAMP ship served several purposes: to communicate with administrative offices in New Jersey, to receive, immediately after launch, predicted impact data from the launch agency firing the ballistic or intercontinental missile, and, after completion of impact tracking, to report \\"quicklook\\" data back to the ERL in New Jersey so that it could be evaluated and a summary report be forwarded on to the project sponsor, ARPA. During this period of operation, communications via satellite did not yet exist. As a result, communications between the DAMP ship and New Jersey was through the use of single-sideband (SSB) radio, generally through the use of a 10 kW transmitter. The DAMP ship generally transmitted upper sideband (USB) voice and/or lower sideband (LSB) frequency-shift keying radioteletype in the area of 16 and 22 MHz when atmospheric conditions were favorable. When communications became difficult because of atmospheric conditions, the DAMP ship shifted to carrier wave (CW) transmission using standard Morse Code. In addition, because the ship could be out to sea for extended periods, such as a month or so, the DAMP ship carried an amateur radio room and equipment, which technical personnel could use to communicate with their families back home in the States via short wave radio. For local area communicating ‚Äì for example, when in the Ascension Island area in the Atlantic or the Johnston Island area in the Pacific ‚Äì the DAMP vessel had the capability of transmitting and receiving USB voice and LSB radioteletype to/from such island locations. The DAMP ship could also communicate with aircraft and nearby islands using various VHF or UHF radio configurations. Various antenna were employed to obtain maximum range from ship-to-shore. The UHF transceiver used a discone, while the VHF transceivers used ground plane antennas. The 1 kW HF transmitter used a remotely tuned whip antenna, while the 3 kW HF transmitter used a vertical cage antenna., and the 10 kW transmitter employed a discone antenna. The vessel contained numerous state- of-the-art receivers, which were fed from an antenna distribution system from three whips. The DAMP ship also carried advanced cryptographic equipment which could be used to encode or decode messages of a confidential or secret nature. Details of such equipment is classified and not described here. As required by law, the ship's Merchant Marine Master had a radio room and a radio operator who was responsible for ship's business but was not associated in any way with the operation of the radio system used for technical purposes.  Tracking Pedestals  Four modified TALOS AN/FPW-2 Guidance Pedestals were slaved to either or both of the AN/FPQ-4 tracking radars in order to provide optical, infra-red and other supplementary instrumentation for the observation of re- entry bodies.  Mission Completion  On September 30, 1963 the U.S. Army Advanced Research Projects Agency DAMP mission and contract expired, and the U.S. Air Force assumed operational control of the USAS American Mariner. On January 1, 1964, it became an integral, but temporary, part of the U.S. Air Force's Eastern Test Range in the Atlantic Ocean, and was placed under the control of the Missile Test Project (MTP) based out of Patrick Air Force Base, Florida. (See Eastern Test Range for details.) Eventually, the ship was removed from missile tracking service and sunk in the Chesapeake Bay while being used as a target by U.S. Navy pilots from the Patuxent River Naval Air Station.

The Noongar name for the plant is mindiyet. Hardy and adaptable, with a dense crown of leaves and prolific heads of pink or purple flowers in late spring and summer, it is one of the most commonly cultivated melaleuca shrubs. Description Melaleuca nesophila is a large shrub or small tree growing to in height by in width. It has greyish- white, papery bark and a dense crown which often reaches to the ground. Its leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, flat, elliptic to narrow egg- shaped with rounded ends.

Distribution and habitat Melaleuca nesophila occurs in the Gairdner River and East Mount Barren districts as well as nearby offshore islands, in the Esperance Plains biogeographic region. It grows in sand near quartzite rocks, usually in dense scrub. Ecology This species is naturalised in some parts of Victoria where it is considered a serious environmental weed because it replaces indigenous vegetation. Conservation This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Melaleuca nesophila is cultivated as an ornamental plant by plant nurseries, for use in gardens and drought tolerant landscaping. It is planted as a flowering shrub, or with training, as a small ornamental tree. It grows in full sun to part shade, in sandy or clay loam soils.

In 1900 the mission director, D. A. Robinson, died from smallpox. William A. Spicer, at thirty-five years old, became the director. He was editor of the Oriental Watchman, the first Adventist periodical to be published in a completely non-Christian land. His leadership of the field was brief. In 1901, while attending the General Conference, Spicer was appointed as the secretary of the Foreign Mission Board located in the United States. John L. Shaw took over the leadership of the India field. Shaw came from the principalship of the church's South African school at Cape Town. With a few brief absences, he remained in India for twenty-three years. The first of the Seventh-day Adventist Mission Quarterlies focused on the need for evangelism in India's major cities. Many people of India, still under British rule, spoke English. The 1912 Quarterly included a thrice repeated appeal from Shaw. He emphasised the need for missionaries who could preach in English.

The term can be used to refer to a very specific Seat of State in the \\"Hall of Supreme Harmony\\" (also known as the \\"Hall of Highest Peace\\"). This is a uniquely crafted object which was used only by the Emperor.Ricalton, p. 308. When European and American military forces pushed their way into the Peking after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, they were the first men from the West to appear in the presence of the Dragon Throne since Isaac Titsingh and Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest were received with grace and ceremony by the Qianlong Emperor in 1795.Ricalton, p. 309. William Elliot Griffis was among those who did actually stand with cameras and notebooks before the Dragon Throne on a sunny September day in 1900; and he described what he saw: ::There was the throne itself, a great three-leaved affair. Over the ample seat in the centre, with a high reredos, two great wings spread off from the central division. All was white marble and jade, liberally sculptured according to the canons of Chinese art. Along the top lay and leered dragons, each one \\"swinging the scaly horror of his folded tail\\" toward the central seat, his head projecting outward in the air. Below the throne were the three steps, on the broad second one of which the suppliant performed the nine prostrations or knocks of the head.Griffis, William Elliot. (1901). In the Mikado's Service: A Story of Two Battle Summers in China, p. 358. History In Imperial China, the seat of power was called the Dragon's Seat or the Dragon Throne.Griffis, William Elliot. (1911). China's Story in Myth, Legend, Art and Annals, p. 57. The process of accession, the ceremonies of enthronement and the act being seated on the Dragon's Throne were roughly interchangeable.\\"Chinese Coronation: Coronation of Taou-Kwang, the new Emperor of China,\\" pp. 332-335 in The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Miscellany.] (East India Company). Vol. 13 (1822 January‚ÄìJune). The Dragon Throne was an hereditary monarchy in China before 1912. In much the same sense as the British Crown, the Dragon Throne became an abstract metonymic concept which represented the monarch and the legal authority for the existence of the government. According to tradition, the Chinese Empire began with the Qin dynasty in 221 BC; and the chronology of the emperors continued in unbroken succession until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912. For a short time in 1917, to whatever extent the Chinese emperor was held to be as symbol of the state and its people, the Dragon Throne would have been construed as a symbol of a constitutional monarch. Rhetorical usage This flexible English term is also a rhetorical trope. Depending on context, the Dragon Throne can be construed as a metonymy, which is a rhetorical device for an allusion relying on proximity or correspondence, as for example referring to actions of the Emperor or as \\"actions of the Dragon Throne.\\" The Dragon Throne is also understood as a synecdoche, which is related to metonymy and metaphor in suggesting a play on words by identifying a closely related conceptualization, e.g., * referring to a part with the name of the whole, such as \\"Dragon Throne\\" for the mystic process of transferring Imperial authority, e.g., ::In 1368, \\"[o]ne of the Hongwu Emperor's first acts upon ascending the Dragon Throne was to set up a network to spy on his subordinates and to register the entire population of China for the first time.\\"Levathes, Louise. (1996). When China Ruled the Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne, 1405-1433, p. 59; see also Williams, Samuel Wells. (1848). The Middle Kingdom: A Survey of the Chinese Empire and Its Inhabitants, p. 313-314. * referring to the general with the specific, such as \\"Dragon Throne\\" for emperorship (or the supreme autocrat of China) or Imperial China itself, e.g., ::In 1418, \\"[t]he fleet moored just outside Malindi's coral reefs (off the east coast of what is today known as Kenya). From the belly of the big ships came small rowboats and men in lavish silk robes. And among the faces were some the king recognized. These men he knew. They were his own ambassadors whom he had dispatched months ago on a tribute-bearing mission. Now emissaries of the Dragon Throne were returning them home, and they brought wondrous things to trade. But had so many men and so many ships come in peace or had they come to make the citizens of Malindi subjects of the Son of Heaven?\\"Levathes, p. 19; cf. p. * referring to the specific with the general, such as \\"Dragon Throne\\" for the long reign of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1736‚Äì1795) or equally as well for the ambit of the Imperial system, e.g., :: In 1921, \\"... the movement for the restoration of the Throne will eventually have the hearty approval of the vast majority of the people. They will welcome it, not only because the Dragon Throne has been for ages an essential part of the Confucian system, inseparable from the ideas of an agricultural race born and bred on patriarchal Theism, but also because of the callous corruption and disorder with which the present administration has been identified all over the country.Bland, John.

It is a system of roads and ports developed by the Philippine government to connect the major islands of Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao. The nautical highway was opened to the public on April 12, 2003 as the Strong Republic Nautical Highway (SRNH). Detailed description and impact Its route covers the provinces and cities of Tagaytay and Batangas City of Calabarzon, Marinduque, Romblon and Oriental Mindoro in Luzon; Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Iloilo, Guimaras, Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental, Siquijor, Cebu and Bohol in Visayas; and Misamis Occidental and Misamis Oriental, Lanao del Norte, and Dapitan of Zamboanga del Norte in Mindanao. This system reduced the previous usual travel time by 17 hours to the different key cities, enhancing the accessibility of the prime tourist destinations, and minimizing the handling expenses of goods, all over the country. (archived from the original on August 19, 2007). Several bus companies operate routes using the nautical highway, including ALPS The Bus, Partas, RORO Bus Transport, Ceres Transport, Bachelor Express, Gasat/Valisno Express and Philtranco. Each operates multiple daily bus trips over the SRNH between Manila bus terminals sited in Cubao and Pasay City and Iloilo City, with connections available in Iloilo for onwards transportation. The SRNH segment between Manila and Iloilo runs by road to Batangas City, by ferry to Calapan City, by road to Roxas, Oriental Mindoro, by ferry to Caticlan (gateway to Boracay, located in Malay, Aklan) and onwards by road to Iloilo City. Private van transport is generally available for hire over individual SRNH road segments, and the ferry segments accept walk-aboard passengers as well as vehicles.

Biography Willemoes was born on 11 May 1783 in Assens on the island of Funen, where his father was a public servant. At the age of twelve he was sent to the Naval Academy in Copenhagen, where he was a mediocre student who chafed under and rebelled against the harsh discipline. He became a cadet in 1795 sekondl√∏jtnant in 1800. At seventeen he commanded a floating battery, \\"Flaadebatteri Nr. 1\\", during the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. After the battle, Willemoes became a member of the Danish Order of Freemasons before setting off to the Mediterranean Sea aboard the frigate Rota. After his return to Denmark, he began to study law but discontinued his studies in 1807 to briefly go into Russian service. After the Bombardment of Copenhagen and the British confiscation of the Danish fleet, he returned to Denmark where he enrolled on Prinds Christian Frederik, the only remaining Danish ship-of-the- line. On 22 March 1808, in the Battle of Zealand Point, the ship was driven onto the sandbar by a British. Willemoes was among the 69 Danish casualties, hit by a bullet to his head, and was afterwards buried at Odden Cemetery. Reputation and status His indominatable good cheer, courage and good looks combined to make Willemoes an instant celebrity in Northern Europe. Locks of his curly hair became a fashion item among ladies in Copenhagen and he was praised in verse by poet and politician N. F. S. Grundtvig. A frigate in the Royal Danish Navy is named for him.

When Usha was young, number of proposals came for her hand in marriage but Banasur accepted none and kept her inside Agnigarh located in Tezpur, Assam with fire burning around the place. One day, Usha saw a young man in her dream and fell in love with him. He was Aniruddha, the grandson of Lord Krishna. Chitralekha, through supernatural powers abducted Aniruddha from the palace of Krishna and brought him to Usha. When Krishna got to know about it, he came with a huge army and attacked Banasura. There was a severe battle. Banasura received a powerful boon from Lord Shiva that he will always protect him in any circumstances. When Banasura came to know that he will be defeated by the enormous powers of Lord Krishna he asked Lord Shiva to come in battlefield and help him. So, Shiva reluctantly helped Banasura by infecting the army of Krishna, thereby incapacitating Krishna's soldiers with fever. Krishna, in turn, restored his army by curing Shiva's disease.

The park was opened on Memorial Day weekend 1966 by photography studio magnate Myron M. \\"Mike\\" Weiss, Sr. as a built-to-scale Dodge City, Kansas, complete with a saloon, general store, Pony Express office, opera house and casino, undertaker, and barber shop, highlighted by cowboy actors who staged gunfights at high noon. History Weiss invested $2 million (about $13.5 million in 2010 dollars) to build the park, carving out a 200-acre oak hammock out of the 5,000 acres he owned between Flamingo Road and U.S. 27 in what was then rural southwestern Broward County. Architects and interior designers commissioned by Weiss worked on the park for two years before its opening, carefully examining Civil War era photos to perfect the architecture and design of the Old West. The railroad station at Pioneer City Weiss bought a 19th Century steam locomotive in Pennsylvania and two paddle-wheel boats built in Miami for the park, as well as refurbished antique fire engines and a Wells Fargo stagecoach. Gandy dancers laid almost a half-mile of narrow gauge railroadtrack for a train to carry visitors around the park. Weiss also dredged a lake and a canal for the paddleboats to ferry visitors from the parking lot into the park. In addition, Weiss surrounded the town at the center of the park with an Indian village, a gold mining area, and a petting zoo with pony rides. Demise Weiss, however, had no experience managing a theme park, and was unprepared for the heavy operating costs, summer thunderstorms, and difficulties posed by managing large crowds. It rained or threatened to rain 77 of the first 90 days the park was open; the area received 21 inches of rain in June 1966, the first full month the park was open. In addition, the park was located on a two-lane country road seven miles from the Florida Turnpike, the nearest major highway at the time. Faced with mixed box office results and depleted cash operating reserves, the park closed in February 1968. Most of the park was demolished to make way for the Kapok Tree restaurant and banquet facility, that operated on the site from 1974 to 1990. Today, the land is the site of the county-run Long Key Natural Area and Nature Center. The dredged lake and canal remain, and the railroad right of way still exists as a horse trail. The exhibit hall at the Nature Center contains a promotional poster and several old photos of Pioneer City.

It is an open, spreading shrub with narrow leaves, profuse pink or purple flowers in late winter and smooth, almost spherical fruits. Description Melaleuca radula is a spreading shrub, growing to tall with coarse bark. Its leaves are arranged in alternating pairs (decussate) so that they make four rows along the branches. The leaves are long, wide, linear to elliptic in shape with the sides turned up so that they are crescent moon- shaped in cross section. There are prominent oil glands on the lower surface. The flowers are white or more usually a shade of pink to mauve. They are arranged in pairs of up to 5, the flowers on opposite sides of the branches forming a spike up to long and in diameter. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. There are five bundles of stamens around the flower, each with 30 to 90 stamens giving the spike a fluffy appearance. Flowering mostly occurs from July to September, and is followed by fruit which are woody, almost spherical capsules, in diameter in clusters along the stem. Wongan Hills M. radula fruits and showing curved leaf margins Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca radula was first formally described in 1839 by John Lindley in an appendix to Edwards Botanical Register entitled A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet (radula) is derived from Latin word meaning ‚Äúa scraper‚Äù but it is not clear why Lindley chose this name. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in and between the Kalbarri, Perth and Norseman districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Murchison, Swan Coastal Plain and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy and gravelly soils often near granite or laterite and near creeks and streams. Conservation Melaleuca radula is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Aboriginal (Noongar) uses The leaves were boiled with water to make antiseptic mouthwashes for treating sore gums and for external application to sores and other skin problems. Internally, the decoction was used for upset stomachs and indigestion. Young leaves were chewed for headaches. The compound, terpinen-4-ol, is thought to be responsible for the antibacterial and antiseptic quality of the melaleuca oil.

He has published three novels, which are concerned with subjects including social atomization, music, political dysfunction, epistemology, ecology, and time. The Times Literary Supplement (London) called Dara \\"one of the most exciting American novelists writing today.\\" Widely believed to be using a pseudonym, Dara has given no interviews and has issued no photographs, and has chosen to publish his novels through his own press, Aurora. His work has been almost totally unacknowledged by the commercial American literary community‚ÄîAustralian critic Emmett Stinson has called Dara \\"the best-kept secret in all of contemporary American literature\\"‚Äîbut he has received exceptional acclaim from underground and alternative sites. His books have been the subject of numerous scholarly articles and theses, and have been taught in dozens of colleges and universities across the world. Four months after Dara‚Äôs first publication in Spanish, his work was included in a Madrid University course on the great American novel, where Dara's work was read alongside that of Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jack Kerouac, Philip Roth, Thomas Pynchon, and Toni Morrison. The only other writer of Dara's generation to be included in this survey was David Foster Wallace. In 1995, his first novel, The Lost Scrapbook, won the 12th Annual FC2 Illinois State University National Fiction Competition judged by William T. Vollmann.Poets & Writers, Inc. Grants & Awards 1995 September/October 1998. Accessed September 22, 2006. Dara's second novel, The Easy Chain, was published by Aurora Publishers in 2008. A third novel, Flee, was published by Aurora in 2013. On July 26, 2018, Dara released his first play, titled Provisional Biography of Mose Eakins. The play was only offered in eBook form (ePub, Mobi, and PDF), and the publisher stipulated that readers should download it for free and only make a donation after they finish it. Recently, the critic Daniel Green published the first comprehensive look at Dara's novels, called \\"Giving Voice: On the Work of Evan Dara.\\" Green writes that:  Anonymity  As opposed to other reclusive American writers such as J.D. Salinger, Thomas Pynchon, and Harper Lee, nothing is known about Dara's background or the reasons why he writes under a pseudonym. And unlike the pseudonymous Elena Ferrante, Dara has never given an interview or commented on his books. However, he has responded on separate occasions about the influence of William Gaddis on his style. In an indirect reply to a query from the critic Tom LeClair‚Äîin which he confirmed that he uses a pseudonym‚ÄîDara denied having read either The Recognitions or J R. In 2014, the critic Steven Moore followed up on this question: ‚ÄúAsked about Gaddis‚Äôs possible influence, Dara told me that while working on The Lost Scrapbook he heard that J R was a novel in dialogue and checked it out from The American Library in Paris: ‚ÄòTook the novel home, plunked it open, tapped it shut ‚Äî didn‚Äôt want the influence‚Äô (email January 19, 2014).‚ÄùWilliam Gaddis, Expanded Edition (NY: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 213 n.9  Writing  The first edition of The Lost Scrapbook was published in 1995 by Fiction Collective Two, or FC2, which was then based at Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois. The manuscript was originally brought to the publisher's attention by novelist Richard Powers, who described how he received it: ‚ÄúSeveral kilos of transatlantic, boat-rate typescript arrived on my stoop without prior warning of contents, and I‚Äôve been grateful ever since. Dara shows how a novel can be experimental, yet moral, rule breaking but emotional, and post-humanist while still remaining deeply human. This scrapbook builds in stretches until the whole police blotter cum family album lies open in aerial view. Monumental, unforgiving, cunning and heartfelt, it lets no one off the hook, least of all the reader.‚Äù The mystery surrounding Dara combined with the fact that Powers very rarely provides blurbs led some to speculate that Powers might be the man behind the nom de plume. Nonetheless, despite very little press coverage and limited publicity, the book has been taught at over 25 universities and been the subject of significant scholarly inquiry. In 2008, Dara released The Easy Chain through Aurora Publishers, a venture he founded along with another partner. He followed this up with Flee, which was published by Aurora in 2013. Dara published his first play, Provisional Biography of Mose Eakins, in 2018. It was translated into Portuguese in 2020.  Translations  A Spanish translation of Dara's The Lost Scrapbook was published by P√°lido Fuego in 2015, entitled El Cuaderno Perdido.

The plant was used to make baskets of different sizes and are very sturdy and durable. The plant sometimes can also be made into a cane or walking stick by using the roots for the handle; when made it sometimes resembles an animal with two horns or ears.  Terrain  The town has many beautiful sights. It is built around a seasonal stream that flows mostly during the rainy season (June to September). Up the canyon there are (\\"Boulders\\"). There are beautiful rock formations on each side of the stream which seem to be granite. At the top of the stream is an area that has an enclosed canyon called El Caj√≥n. This is a waterfall over high. The site is between three mountains and there is only one watercourse. The population is about 2000. Most of the residents own horses and most of them are middle-class people. People around Barranca de Otates own land and grow crops there. The most important crops are maize, sorghum, beans and agave.  Location  The town is located in southern Jalisco, about one hour south of Guadalajara. There are a few nearby towns, including Barranca de Santa Clara, Barranca de los Laureles and Pueblo Nuevo.

He also worked as a photographer, publisher, painter, naturalist, and environmentalist. He made a great impression in the Navya (\\"new\\") period of Kannada literature and inaugurated the Bandaaya Saahitya genre of protest literature with his short- story collection Abachoorina Post Offisu. He is the son of noted Kannada poet Kuvempu. At early stages of his writing career, Tejaswi wrote poems but later concentrated on short stories, novels and essays. His distinctive style of writing is credited with heralding a new era in Kannada literature. Early life Tejaswi was born on 8 September 1938 in Kuppali in Shimoga district of Karnataka. Although he was the son of \\"Raashtrakavi\\" Kuvempu, he came out of his father's shadow and established his own image at an early age. Tejaswi received best story award in the competition held by Prajavani Kannada newspaper on the occasion of Deepavali, for his first short story \\"Linga Banda\\", a look at the rainy Western Ghats from the eye of a boy. After completion of his education from Maharaja College of Mysore, one among the top colleges in India, due to his interests in nature and farming, he moved to Mudigere taluk of Chikmagalur District after buying a coffee estate. Apart from literature he was actively involved in painting, photography and philosophy. He was a keen learner of nature and his favourite pastime was to roam around in the forests of western ghats. Literary works Tejaswi has written in almost all forms of literature including poems, short stories, novels, travel literature, plays and science fiction. Nature and incidents related to nature enjoy major roles in most of his works. One of the most popular writers in Kannada, Tejaswi's works have continued to remain popular, going into multiple prints and often topping reader's charts. Karvalo is one such novel where the author participates in an adventure of discovering a flying lizard in the dense forests of Western Ghats. Tejaswi has translated a number of English books to Kannada enriching the depth of Kannada literature. His famous translations include the series on Kenneth Anderson's hunting expeditions and Henri Charri√®re's Papillon. Tejaswi wrote his first novel, Kaadu Mattu Kraurya, when he was a 24-year-old in 1962. The novel is expected to be in print for the first time towards the end of 2012. He had initially planned to name this work Nalini but later decided to go by its present title. Tejaswi was inspired to write the novel after visiting his wife Rajeshwari's maternal home in the forested Malnad region of Karnataka. The novel, whose manuscript was prepared by Rajeshwari, is the story of Linga, a migrant bonded labourer from north Karnataka who moves to a remote Malnad village where he struggles to cope with his new life and surroundings.

She was named for Dubuque, Iowa. She was launched 15 August 1904, by Gas Engine and Power Co. and Charles L. Seabury Co., Morris Heights, New York; sponsored by Miss M. Tredway. She was commissioned on 3 June 1905, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Augustus F. Fechteler. She was reclassified AG-6 in 1919; IX-9, 24 April 1922; and PG-17, 4 November 1940. Service history 1905-1911 Dubuque was used in various services to the US Government during its initial years. On occasion it was used for guarded transport of government supplies, as well as serving as official transport for bodily remains of deceased government dignitaries such as James Wilson, US Supreme Court. Dubuque cruised from her home port of Portsmouth, New Hampshire in Atlantic coastal waters and in the Caribbean protecting American interests and citizens, a group of whom she saved from depredations by Cuban bandits on the night of 18‚Äì19 May 1907. She arrived at Chicago, Illinois on 29 June 1911, and was decommissioned 22 July for use as a training ship by the Illinois Naval Militia. 1914-1919 Recommissioned on 4 August 1914, Dubuque sailed three days later for Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she was placed in commission in reserve 3 October. She was fitted out as a mine-training ship and on 30 July 1915 she returned to a fully commissioned status and was assigned to Mining and Minesweeping Division, Atlantic Fleet. She participated in training along the Atlantic coast and after American entry into World War I in April 1917, she installed and tended submarine nets in Hampton Roads and at New London, Connecticut. She also trained reserve officers at the Naval Academy. Assigned to temporary duty with the Cruiser and Transport Force, Dubuque made three voyages between New York and Halifax, Nova Scotia, as a convoy escort between 6 June and 14 July 1917. She arrived at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands on 3 August for duty with the French division of the Caribbean Patrol, investigating isolated harbors and inlets in the Caribbean and on the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia to prevent their use by German submarines. On 8 December 1918, she reported to the American Patrol Detachment, Atlantic Fleet, with whom she served along the East Coast until returning to Portsmouth 6 May 1919. She again went out of commission 27 May 1919. 1922-1945 Dubuque was recommissioned 25 May 1922 and sailed from Portsmouth 8 June for Detroit, Michigan, where she arrived 24 June. Attached to the 9th Naval District, she took Naval Reservists on cruises from her home port of Detroit into Lakes Superior and Michigan every summer. She was placed in reduced commission 1 November 1940 and on the 14th sailed for Boston, where she was assigned to the 1st Naval District and was modernized and refitted. She returned to full commission 1 July 1941 and patrolled on the New England coast until 14 October. Two days later she arrived at Little Creek, Virginia to serve as gunnery practice ship for the Armed Guard School there. Throughout her second war, Dubuque trained merchant ship armed guard crews in Chesapeake Bay. She was decommissioned 7 September 1945 and transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal 19 December 1946.

During the course of the tour, musicians have come and gone as the band continued to evolve. They amassed a huge fan base with some fans traveling from around the world to attend as many Dylan shows as possible. According to Swedish researcher Olof Bj√∂rner Dylan played his 2,000th show of the Never Ending Tour on October 16, 2007, in Dayton, Ohio. He played his 3,000th show of the Never Ending Tour on April 19, 2019, in Innsbruck, Austria. Dylan has attributed much of the versatility of his live shows to the talent of his backing band, with whom he recorded each of his 21st Century studio albums: Love and Theft (2001); Modern Times (2006); Together Through Life (2009); Christmas in the Heart (2009); Tempest (2012); Shadows in the Night (2015); Fallen Angels (2016); Triplicate (2017) and Rough and Rowdy Ways (2020). Name The tour's name was cemented when journalist Adrian Deevoy published his interview with Dylan in Q Magazine no.39, December 1989. The critic Michael Gray listened to Deevoy's interview tape, and points out in The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia that though Deevoy's article put the phrase into Dylan's mouth, in fact the label came from Deevoy in the following exchange: *AD: 'Tell me about this live thing. You've gone straight into this tour again ‚Äî one tour virtually straight into the next one.' *BD: 'Oh, it's all the same tour.' *AD: 'It's the Never Ending Tour?' *BD: (unenthusiastically) 'Yeah, yeah'.Gray, The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, 2006, pp. 173‚Äì174 Dylan has been dismissive of the Never Ending Tour tag. In the sleeve notes to his album World Gone Wrong (1993), Dylan wrote: In a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Dylan queried the validity of the term Never Ending Tour, saying: > Critics should know there is no such thing as forever. Does anybody call > Henry Ford a Never Ending Car Builder? Anybody ever say that Duke Ellington > was on a Never Ending Bandstand Tour? These days, people are lucky to have a > job. Any job. So critics might be uncomfortable with my working so much. > Anybody with a trade can work as long as they want. A carpenter, an > electrician. They don't necessarily need to retire. The tour was interrupted in 1997 when Dylan was forced to cancel dates after suffering a serious medical issue in May. CBS Records announced he was being hospitalized for a potentially fatal chest infection, histoplasmosis. Performances in Japan and the US were cancelled during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The book chronicles the first fifteen years of Dylan's Never Ending Tour from the point of view of a committed fan of the Tour, analysing how Dylan varies his interpretations of his songs, and exploring Dylan's possible motivations. In July 2013, Muir updated Razor's Edge when he published One More Night: Bob Dylan's Never Ending Tour: this book covers Dylan's touring activities from 1988 to 2011. The only complete live album of material recorded with the Never Ending Tour band is MTV Unplugged, recorded in 1994 and released in 1995. In 1994, Bob Dylan's performance of \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" was recorded at Woodstock '94 and released on CD and VHS. In 2001, Sony released Live 1961‚Äì2000: Thirty-Nine Years of Great Concert Performances which included six songs recorded on the Never Ending Tour between 1994 and 2000. The songs were: \\"Somebody Touched Me\\", \\"Dignity\\", \\"Cold Irons Bound\\", \\"Born in Time\\", \\"Country Pie\\" and \\"Things Have Changed\\". Dylan's performance of \\"Down Along the Cove\\" from the Bonnaroo Music Festival 2004 was released on the Bonnaroo 2004 CD by Sanctuary Records in 2005. Spanish TV station TVE2 broadcast three songs, \\"It Ain't Me Babe\\", \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" and \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\", from the concert that Dylan performed at the Rock In Rio Festival, in Madrid on July 6, 2008. Dylan's 2008 album, The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989‚Äì2006, included five live performances from the Never Ending Tour, recorded between 1992 and 2004. The songs were \\"High Water (For Charley Patton)\\", \\"Ring Them Bells\\", \\"Cocaine Blues\\", \\"The Girl on the Greenbriar Shore\\", and \\"Lonesome Day Blues\\". In 2009, former Never Ending Tour drummer Winston Watson released a DVD, Bob Dylan Never Ending Tour Diaries: Drummer Winston Watson's Incredible Journey, documenting his years touring with Dylan between 1992 and 1996.

(From left to right) Stu Kimball, Bob Dylan, Donnie Herron, George Recile, Tony Garnier and Denny Freeman performing in Bologna, Italy, November 10, 2005 For a two and a half year period, between 2003 and 2006, Dylan ceased playing guitar, and stuck to the keyboard during concerts. Various rumors circulated as to why Dylan gave up guitar during this period, none very reliable. According to David Gates, a Newsweek reporter who interviewed Dylan in 2004, \\"basically it has to do with his guitar not giving him quite the fullness of sound he was wanting at the bottom. He's thought of hiring a keyboard player so he doesn't have to do it himself, but hasn't been able to figure out who. Most keyboard players, he says, like to be soloists, and he wants a very basic sound.\\" Dylan's touring band has two guitarists along with a multi-instrumentalist who plays pedal & lap steel, mandolin, banjo, violin and viola. However since 2018/2019, Dylan has now stuck with one guitarist and back to 5 members since 2004. From 2002 to 2005, Dylan's keyboard had a piano sound. In 2006, this was changed to an organ sound. At the start of his Spring 2007 tour in Europe, Dylan once again began playing guitar. Currently, he plays organ and will play songs on guitar and take center-stage with just his harmonica and microphone. On June 30, 2012 Dylan incorporated an acoustic piano into his set. Most recently, in his October 26th, 2018 performance at the Walt Disney Theater at the Dr. Phillips Performing Arts Center in Orlando, FL, no acoustic guitar appeared in the performance. Dylan only played acoustic piano and harmonica or, during three songs, sang without performing an instrument. Currently, Bob Dylan's band consists of the following members: *Bob Dylan ‚Äî vocals, piano, harmonica, guitar *Donnie Herron ‚Äî pedal steel, lap steel, electric mandolin, banjo, violin *Charlie Sexton ‚Äî lead guitar *Tony Garnier ‚Äî bass guitar *Matt Chamberlain ‚Äî drums, percussion *Bob Britt ‚Äî guitar During a 2006 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Dylan spoke about his current band: \\"This is the best band I've ever been in, I've ever had, man for man. When you play with guys a hundred times a year, you know what you can and can't do, what they're good at, whether you want 'em there. It takes a long time to find a band of individual players. Most bands are gangs. Whether it's a metal group or pop rock, whatever, you get that gang mentality. But for those of us who went back further, gangs were the mob. The gang was not what anybody aspired to. On this record (Modern Times) I didn't have anybody to teach. I got guys now in my band, they can whip up anything, they surprise even me.\\" Other notable members include Stu Kimball (Guitar from 2004-2018), Denny Freeman (Guitar, Slide Guitar from 2005‚Äì2009), Larry Campbell (Guitar, Slide Guitar, Pedal Steel, Banjo, Cittern, Mandolin & Violin from 1997‚Äì2004), George Receli (Drums from 2001-2019), Freddy Koella (Guitar from 2003‚Äì2004), David Kemper (Drums from 1996‚Äì2001), Bucky Baxter (Pedal Steel from 1992‚Äì1999), John \\"J.J.\\" Jackson (Guitar from 1991‚Äì1997) and G.E. Smith (Guitar from 1988‚Äì1990). Between the years 2003-2004, Tommy Morrongiello, a technician on the tour, would frequently play guitar with Dylan & his Band. Charlie Sexton, who played the guitar from 1999 until 2002, returned as the lead guitarist in Dylan's band for the fall 2009 tour, replacing Denny Freeman. Sexton was in turn replaced by Duke Robillard for the first half of 2013, before returning on July 3, 2013. Sexton was replaced for seven concerts by Colin Linden before returning once again on July 26, 2013. Over the years, many artists have been special guests at shows, playing songs with Dylan & his Band.

He was father of one daughter, Kaikeyi (a queen of King Dasharatha), and seven sons. One of the important sons was Yudhajeet, who played important role in Ramayana. Exile of his wife Due to a boon, Ashwapati was able to understand the language of the birds. However, this was accompanied by a caveat that if he ever revealed the content of bird speak to anyone, even his own mother, that he would forthwith lose his life. One day, the King and his Queen were strolling through the palace gardens when Ashwapati happened to overhear the conversation of a pair of mated swans. The conversation so amused him that he laughed heartily, instigating his wife's curiosity. Despite being aware of the fact that Ashwapati could not divulge the content of the conversation to her without losing his life, Kaikeyi's mother insisted on knowing the cause of the King's mirth. When Ashwapati realized that his wife cared little for his life or well-being, he had her banished to her parents' home.

Construction and acquisition She was built as a private vessel, Lancashire Witch in 1878 by R. Steel & Co of Greenock to a design by St Clare John Byrne for the owner, Sir Thomas George Fermor- Hesketh, 7th Baronet. She was of composite construction, meaning she was built with an iron keel, stem and stern posts, and iron framing, all planked with wooden planking. She was rigged as a three-masted schooner, with square-rigged sails on the foremast only (a \\"barquentine\\" rig). A two-cylinder compound inverted steam engine of drove a single screw.

An island in Kachemac Bay, Cook Inlet was named after Sir Thomas and rocks were named Lancashire Rocks after the yacht. There were a further 3 owners between 1883 and 1892 including Frank Linsly James, and on 17 March 1893 she was sold to the British Admiralty. She was renamed Waterwitch and rated as a sloop for survey work. Royal Navy survey vessel Waterwitch on the Australian Station, some time after 1894Waterwitch was converted for use as a survey vessel, which included replacing her engine and boilers to provide 450 horsepower. She commissioned in 1894 for service on the Australia Station,Bastock, p.125. undertaking a series of surveys on passage to the Cape of Good Hope. Once on station she made lines of soundings in Esperance Bay, Fiji and the Tasman Peninsula in preparation for the running of telegraph cables.Day (1967), p.128 Between 1898 and 1907 she worked the coast of China, including Hong Kong, Weihaiwei and the Yangtze River. In early 1900 Commander Willoughby Pudsey Dawson was in command, succeeded by Lieutenant W. O. Lyne when she was re-commissioned on 16 February 1900. She formed part of the British naval contingent involved in relieving the Peking legations during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 and surveyed the north channel of the Yangtze prior to the battleship 's navigation of the river.Day (1967), pp. 128‚Äì129 & 187.

Seamew had been heading around the breakwater for her usual berth and paid little enough attention to the position of Waterwitch that she drove right at her. The launch's sharp prow pierced Waterwitchs wooden side, and she then compounded her error by putting her engines hard astern. Waterwitchs bridge collapsed, her mainmast fell over the port side, and the resulting gaping wound in her side allowed an overpowering in-rush of water.The Straits Times, 2 September 1912 Since her fires were out, no power could be raised, and so her anchor watch manned the pumps and a tug took her in tow. The wash from the tug increased the flooding and Waterwitch sank in of water. At low water, her masts, funnel, and the highest parts of her superstructure remained above water. Two members of her ship's company were drowned: Marine Sturgess knocked himself out diving overboard and was drowned, and an unnamed Chinese boy drowned between decks. A Board of Trade inquiry was held at Singapore from 20 to 23 September 1912 and found that the collision was due to the negligence of Seamews captain and, to a lesser degree, her First Officer and Chief Engineer. At a re-opened inquiry the following month, the two subordinate officers were exonerated. The wreck was raised on 10 September 1912 and taken to drydock at Tanjong Pagar. On 12 October 1912 Waterwitch was offered for sale \\"as lies\\" in drydock. Return to service The purchaser of Waterwitch, local Italian businessman Captain Giovanni Gaggino, ordered her refit at Tanjong Pagar as a private yacht. Renamed Fata Morgana, the yacht departed Singapore for the South Seas in early January 1914. Captain Gaggino died at Batavia, Dutch East Indies in February 1918. Myth of the White Ladye There are references indicating that HMS Waterwitch was formally White Ladye, at one time owned by actress Lillie Langtry. However, there is an audit trail from Lloyd's Yacht Register for the White Ladye showing that she was in private hands from the day she was built to when she was dismantled in 1935 and this is supported by contemporary newspaper articles.

It was first described by J. M. C. Vellozo in 1825 under the name Cassia parahyba. The species name likely refers to the Para√≠ba River in Southeast Brazil. Description The mature tree typically has a straight trunk, up to 40 meters tall and 80 cm wide, that branches out only near the top. The bark is smooth and gray-green except by the scars left by fallen leaves. The leaves are bipinnate, a metre or more in length, with a green stem and 30‚Äì50 opposite pinnae, each with 40‚Äì60 leaflets 2‚Äì3 cm long; they are clustered near the end of the branches, and fall off completely in the dry season. Young individuals, often unbranched and with leaves over 2 meters long, may be mistaken for ferns or palms. The numerous bright yellow nectar-producing flowers, about 3.5 cm in diameter, bloom from October through December in the Southern Hemisphere, after the leaves have fallen off. In Southeast Brazil they are visited chiefly by bees Centris labrosa, Centris varia, Xylocopa frontalis and Megachille species.I.

Plant Systematics and Evolution volume 281, issue 1-4, pages 247-250 The fruits ripen between April and June. Each fruit is a tadpole-like pod about 10 cm long, containing a single oval seed, smooth and brown. Diffusion Trunk of a young tree showing leaf-stalk scars. The native range spans from Central America to southern Brazil. It is sun-loving and prefers open and semi-open areas; it is quite rare in densely forested areas. Uses Necklaces made from yvapuruvu seeds in Tobati (Paraguay). The wood is odorless, straw-colored, soft and light (density 0.32 to 0.39 g/cm3, increasing with age). Formerly used for dugout canoes, it is now used for toys, boxes, shoe heels, the inner layers of laminated wood, and paper.Lorenzi, Harri (1992). \\"√Årvores brasileiras: Manual de identifica√ß√£o e cultivo de plantas arb√≥reas nativa do Brasil.\\" Editora Plantarum. 368 pages.

It received a Juno Awards nomination for \\"Best Pop Album\\" in 2002.JunoAwards.ca Similarly to Tori Amos' Strange Little Girls, which was released the same year, Girl Versions presented Gryner's reinterpretations of songs written by men. Unlike Amos' album, however, Gryner did not create characters to present the songs in an ironic or political context; instead, she simply chose some of her own favourite rock, heavy metal and punk songs and interpreted them in her own more pop-oriented style. The album was first recorded live in Sarnia's Imperial Theatre. Originally it was her and her piano. The recordings were allegedly lost and re-recorded at Umbrella Studios in Toronto by producer Chris Wardman and a cello was added to some songs. The attendees from that original show are credited in the liner notes. A song that was played at the show that was cut from the album was \\"I'll Stick Around\\" by The Foo Fighters. The concert included a cameo by Canadian astronaut and Sarnia local Chris Hadfield. He played guitar and sang a song about Canadian Tire.
