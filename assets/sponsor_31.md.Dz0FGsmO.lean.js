Launched in September 2010, it allows individuals and groups to make small loans to entrepreneurs in developing countries, and help them work their way out of poverty. It supports entrepreneurs in Cambodia, Togo, Benin, The Philippines, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Vietnam and Ecuador through partner microfinance institutions (MFIs). It does not charge any interest on the loans made to entrepreneurs by supporters - the MFIs do. By 2015, over 21,000 lenders loaned almost ¬£6m to around 17,000 entrepreneurs. The process Lendwithcare works with a number of partner microfinance institutions (MFIs) in the countries in which it operates. If the MFI is happy with an entrepreneur's idea or business plan, they approve the proposal and provide the initial loan requested. They also help the entrepreneur construct their profile for lendwithcare.org. Lenders can browse the list of entrepreneurs on the website, read about their businesses, see the value of the loan they have requested, the percentage of the loan already provided by other lenders, and then choose an entrepreneur to lend to. Once the entrepreneur's loan is fully funded, the money is transferred to the MFI to replace the initial loan already paid out to the entrepreneur. During this process lenders receive progress updates regarding the entrepreneur's progress. The entrepreneur gradually pays back their loan according to a repayment schedule. The MFI transfers these repayments to CARE International who then credits the payment into lenders' lendwithcare.org accounts. Lenders can then either withdraw their money using a PayPal account or can use the credit to provide a loan to another entrepreneur.

Initial body count was estimated in 10 dead and 80 injured, later updated to 20 and 122 respectively. The final count went up to 29 victims and 104 wounded. Ferrovie dello Stato train 587 was traveling southbound from Rome to Siracusa on the Salerno-Reggio Calabria railway. At 2.40 a.m., shortly after leaving Lamezia Terme station and heading to Paola, rammed into some loaded cars lost by freight train 40679, a 41-cars convoy from the same operator leaving Lamezia Terme for Reggio Calabria. The freight train had crossed Eccellente station without anyone noticing it lost 28 of its cars and was missing its tail lights, and later stopped at Vibo Pizzo station understanding something went wrong. The boxcars got detached from the convoy at kilometer 266+200, when a clamp broke and set the boxcars free. The runaway cars came to a stop on the tracks. Train 587 driver tried to brake at the last moment, but the train was traveling at 120 km/h and could not possibly be stopped in less than 1000 meters. Being in a dark night and the runaway cars missing their tail lights (electricity is provided by the engine), the available distance was far too short to stop the passenger train. The passenger train hit the cars and derailed, four of its coaches swerving on the northbound track. Despite the severity of the accident, the derailment most probably caused only injuries. Before the train conductor could call for an emergency, a second passenger train, Espresso 588 (the same passenger service, but traveling northbound toward Salerno) crashed on the derailed 587s engine at over 60 km/h. The first four coaches of the 588 train derailed and tumbled into an escarpment. Some of the southbound train's coaches were crushed or broken by the impact. First response An FS Class E656, similar to the two engines damaged in the accident. Vigili del Fuoco rescue teams were dispatched from Vibo Valentia, Lamezia Terme and Catanzaro, along with Polizia di Stato, Guardia di Finanza and Carabinieri. Railway crews immediately begun to remove and dismantle the damaged coaches, in order to allow recover of the wounded trapped in the wreck, aided by the security forces personnel. Hospitals in Lamezia, Vibo and Catanzaro were overrun by the medical emergency, but ultimately managed to sustain the pressure thanks to help from Soveria Mannelli and Tropea clinics taking over medical assistance for patients with less severe wounds. The rescue operations took two full days, allowing regular service from 24 November. The accident news coverage was short, since just two days later country newspaper's attention was diverted to the tragic Irpinia earthquake. Engine FS Class E656.075 was dismantled in July 1983, the first in its class to be written off. FS Class E656.280 dismantled a few days later. Causes A broken clamp is an unusual but not unheard of event. Steel clamps sometimes experience fatigue or corrosion damage, so a failure is accounted as a possibility. In case of a clamp failure the loss of a train section breaks off the pneumatic brake circuit: lack of pressure engages emergency brakes on both parts of the convoy and alert the engineers. Apparently the brake emergency system worked fine, but with the engine at full throttle and the train much lighter than expected the engineer didn't notice the emergency and the head of the train failed to stop. Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office charged the freight train drivers, the Eccellente stationmaster and a railwayman with involuntary manslaughter, for failing to notice the loss of the boxcars. Ultimately, station personnel was deemed guilty, not having followed proper procedures. An early technical survey showed that maintenance status of the rolling stock was fair, track infrastructure was good and adequate to current safety standards. The semi- automatic block signaling was active at the moment, but that system required a routine check of passing trains to be done by station personnel. The rule was well known and officially enforced at the time. Fully automatic block control would have avoided the tragedy (flashing a red light at the passenger train), but up until the 1990s was installed only on high capacity main lines (about 1/8 of the total network).

This work was finished on 1974 and represents a soundscape in which the composer recreates the relationship between himself and his mother when the latter was dying, to whom the work is dedicated. The lyrics were written exclusively for this composition by French poet Jean Paris. This is one of the most relevant works from the avant-garde period of Balada. This work was premiered on 1997 in Barcelona by the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra, together with the Coro Nacional de Espa√±a, and conducted by Lawrence Foster.  Structure  This work is written in two parts, which represent the only two movements of this piece. A typical performance of this work should last for about 40 minutes. * Part I * Part II In the first movement, the narrator describes death, not only from its tragic side, but also from a metaphysical point of view. The text contains quotes by many authors around the world, in different languages, such as Catalan, Spanish, French, English, and Italian, with the purpose of stating that death is universal. At the very beginning of the first part, the composer uses the tape of a wolf howling, while the choir tries to imitate its sound. All along the first movement, the author creates a mixture between tonal fragments and atonal fragments, with the intention of representing death in its bleakest aspect, that is to say, death is unavoidable, and there is no hope for us to dodge it. Then he randomly plays sounds of smashing glass, trees swaying and other types of sounds made by animals. According to Balada: \\"un sinn√∫mero de animales contribuyen con sus ruidos innatos a la sensaci√≥n de absurdidad que es el fatal curso de nuestra existencia\\" (a great number of animals contribute with their innate sounds to the sensation of absurdity that is the fatal course of our existence). Towards the end of the first part, everybody on the stage should remain still, which symbolizes the end in all of its dimensions. The second part of this piece is entirely written by Paris in English, though it is indicated that the text should be translated to the native language of the place where this piece is going to be played. In general terms, the same techniques are used, although the temperament of this movement is much more defiant and bright. The composer tries to represent the everlasting struggle against the undeniable truth, as well as he questions the existence of God or the fairness thereof.

The site was the principal supplier of gas to the City of Launceston before the importation of LPG in the 1970s. The gasworks produced gas by heating coal and siphoning off the gas that it released before refining and storing it on site in a set of 3, steel frame gasometers. The first buildings on site were the horizontal retort buildings built in 1860 from sandstone and local brick. The site was later used by Origin Energy as their Launceston LPG outlet.

This street and land on either side was later incorporated into the gasworks site Starting in 1826, Launceston was lit with lamps running on sperm whale oil. These lamps were unpopular and local butchers soon replaced these with \\"slush\\" lamps that burned animal fat. These lamps were still disliked by many so in 1844 a local man, Doctor William Russ Pugh (a statue of him is located in Launceston's Prince's Square), produced his own coal gas for his house and a year later Benjamin Hyrons lit the Angel Inn with methane gas. As early as 1854, the Examiner newspaper urged locals to consider the creation of a gasworks in Launceston pointing out the numerous benefits and cheaper costs of coal gas as a means of lighting. In 1856 the Launceston City Council engaged Scottish-born engineer, William Falconer of the Hobart Gas Company, to prepare plans for the proposed gasworks. At a public meeting at the Cornwall Hotel on the 18 May 1858, the Launceston Gas Company was formed. The company purchased a marshy paddock near Cimitier Street the same year due to its proximity to the North Esk River in order to build the new gasworks. Machinery from England and suitable builders were assembled in 1859 with the Horizontal Retort Buildings completed in early 1860. On the 5 April 1860, Launceston turned on its new gas street lighting for the first time and oil lamps were replaced by gas. The main source of gas was Newcastle Coal from New South Wales. The gas was extracted by heating the coal until gas was produced. The site of the gasworks was also directly opposite the TMLR rail yards on Willis Street which was also convenient for the delivery of coal. The demand for coal gas continued to grow even after the Duck Reach Power Station was commissioned in 1896. In 1932, the Vertical Retort House was added to the site to increase productivity. The site was expanded to the west in the mid 1900s which involved the removal of Wescombe Street and the historic cottages that lined it in order to make a 3rd gasometer and later an LPG cylinder yard when the site was taken over by Boral and eventually Origin Energy. In 2007 the site was sold and the 3 gasometers were largely dismantled. The cylinder yard has now been built over by the new Centrelink building and car park with additional developments planned to take place in the future. Notable buildings The company office and chief engineer's cottage from Boland Street after restoration  Chief engineer's cottage  The chief engineer of the site used to live in an ornate cottage on the NE corner of the site. The first engineer was William Falconer from Scotland and many more followed. An unusual feature associated with the cottage was the chief engineer's private, heated swimming pool. It is said to still be there, buried under the courtyard between the cottage and the gas laboratories. The pool was heated by the Vertical Retort Building's boilers and was strictly out of bounds to all workers unless they were needed to fix it. The cottage is now restored and serves as a private residence.  Company office  The company office is located next to the chief engineer's cottage, and once looked out across the North Esk until the levee system was built over the wharves. The original building was a brick cottage but in the 1880s it had its facade rebuilt in a Victorian style. The headquarters have now been restored along with the other buildings on the site's north facing Boland Street. Out in front of the company office is one of the original gas lamps used in the city. The company operated 123 gas lamps across the city as well as a special one outside the office. The lamps were removed when the city turned to electric lighting but during restoration work, an original lamp was located and returned to the site where it now stands.  Horizontal retort  Built from local brick with sandstone quoining and arches, the Horizontal Retort building was erected in 1860 and is one of the oldest buildings on site. The central portion of the building used to have a 39.3 m (129 ft) brick chimney and housed 18 retorts with room for an additional 6. On either side of the main building were two wings: the western one for the storage of coal imported form NSW and the other being a purifying house which also contained the \\"smiths\\" and gasfitters shops. A second coal store, located where the Carbureted Water Gas Building now stands, closely followed the same design. Gas produced in this building was stored in the 15 m (50 ft) diameter No.1 and No.2 Gasometers. The brick chimney was built by A Henderson with Francis and Miller being contracted to build the main building, all at a total cost of ¬£3333. In 1929, this building was flooded to a depth of 4 ft during the great floods of 1929, after which damage was repaired quickly. When the Vertical Retort was built in the 1930s, the Horizontal Retorts were removed along with chimney and replaced with a boiler and a large tar plant in the mid portion of the building with associated 3 oil tanks outside on the southern face. The brick and masonry portion of the eastern wing was re-fitted with 3 exhausters and the steel and galvanized iron portion upgraded to contain 4 more purifiers adding to a total of 8. Today the building is falling into disrepair despite minor restoration work being carried out a few years earlier and most of the sandstone is heavily eroded. The north face of the building is only partially original. The last restoration attempts from the 1980s saw the purifiers removed and converted to conference rooms; closing the originally open air structure with galvanized iron and plate glass bearing the new Gasworks emblem, based on the ventilation hole patterns in the Vertical Retort's walls.  Gasometers  Located along the southern perimeter of the site facing Cimitier Street, the gasometers were where gas produced at the gasworks was stored at pressure for later distribution. At present, three of the original five gasometers are on site in various levels of salvage. The newest No.5 Gasometer built in the mid 1940s is mostly untouched except for the gas bell has been removed and the pit filled. This gasometer is mounted on a concrete base with a 12 sided steel frame mounted on top that has been painted red. A few meters to the east are the brick and sandstone foundations of two smaller gasometers; the middle dating from the late 1800s and the furthest to the east being one of the original 2 built in 1860. These 2 gas holders were smaller than the newer one and were last painted Boral's yellow and green colour scheme before they were dismantled in 2007. Shortly after dismantling, a proposal was forwarded to council to develop all 3 gasometers as a single 6 storey apartment block but was cancelled. The other one of the first 2 gasometers on site was dismantled in the early 1900s with the foundations and water pit being converted into a covered tar and liquor well located in the easternmost corner of the site (now vacant). In the 1946 plan for the site, a final 250 000 cubic ft. gasometer was proposed to be built to the northwest of the No.5 Gasometer but was canceled along with the rest of the proposal.

(7079 cubic meters) Lift Segments: 3 Construction Date: 1946 (proposed) Current Condition: Never Built One of 2 J&J; Braddock Gasometers in the Governor Cottage  Governor cottage  Located on the south of the site bordering Cimitier Street, this small galvanized iron and timber building was used as the gaswork's distribution point. As with the rest of the southern half of the site, this building is in disrepair with all of its windows broken by vandals. Inside, most of the original machinery is still intact such as 2 miniature Braddock Gasometers which are largely intact and are ornately decorated. The miniature gasometer on the eastern side of the building is connected onto the inlet mains for the main Gasometers on site (from the point it leaves the purifiers in the Horizontal Retort Building), with the second being directly connected to the outlet mains between the Gasometers and the main governor. The main governor is located at the back of the building along with an exhauster and various meters and pressure gauges. The original governor was first installed in 1860 when the gasworks were first built and changed little since then though the building itself has been rebuilt. The governor originally distributed gas into 10 gas mains (2 large and 8 smaller) with the largest 2 just visible on the external surface of the building. As part of a development proposal from 2007, this building was meant to be restored as a public historic site with interpretive panels but was canceled in 2008.  Carburetted Water Gas Building  The Carburetted Water Gas Building is located next to the Vertical Retort House and was last used as the offices for Origin Energy after the Carbureted Water Gas Plant was removed from within. Though built later in the gasworks history (post 1940s), closely imitates the same style as the Vertical Retort through the use of steel and brick. The building is 3 storeys high with a small 4th level on the roof. When built in 1956, the building was primarily built around a single Carbureted Water Gas Plant with plans for a later second. The plant itself dominated the first 3 levels of the building with its massive steel furnace and generator blocks (steel structures lined with firebrick on the interior). The first floor (ground level) housed many associated machinery items including both electric and steam powered exhausters, a wash box and tram cart. The upper most level was used as a coal store with gravity feeders connecting it to the plant. As part of the current development, the Carbureted Water Gas Building is being restored and connected onto the Vertical Retort House via a glass atrium mimicking the profile of the buildings' rooflines.  Meter Shop  The Meter Shop was where the new gas meters were assembled and tested. By 1958, there were 6333 meters across Launceston. The Gas Fitters did the meter rounds by bicycle, often loading the bicycles with everything they needed from 20 ft pipes to plywood. The Engineering staff and the company fitters also used the building to write up the daily logbooks. The Meter Shop also played a secondary role as the staff training center and under Origin Energy ownership in the late 1900s, was solely used for this purpose. Gas Fitters, Meter Makers and Repairers had to do an apprenticeship that lasted 5 years with most men working for the company their whole life. Even the management stayed with a total of four Company Secretaries in 120 years. At its peak, the company employed up to 80 people. The company encouraged a family feeling among its employees, often organising annual Christmas picnics. coke extractors in the Vertical Retort Building's main hall in various levels of salvage before being scrapped in late 2012 Additional waste heat boiler (partially dismantled) in the rear room of the Vertical Retort Building. Note the insulated co2 flue connecting the boiler to the retort blocks.  Vertical Retort Building  The 29m high (not including stack height) Vertical Retort Building was built in 1932 as the primary gas production facility for the Launceston Gasworks site. The building was officially opened on 19 March 1932 and was described by the company director as a masterpiece of modern chemistry and engineering. During the opening ceremony, the buildings moving components were switched on and visitors were taken to the top of the retorts to view what was the most advanced gasworks of its time. During later operation, the building was described as a harsh place to work in due to blazing heat, noise and gas fumes. The vertical retort is the most recognisable building on site and is an iconic building in Launceston. The building is built with a steel frame forming a grid pattern, supporting individual \\"panes\\" of brick walls. The inscription \\"COOK WITH GAS\\" is written in the top floor's brickwork. The building climbs five stories with the coal conveyor still intact running up the front of the building, though the breaker pit at its base has been filled in. The original building was shorter in length and contained only 4 retorts but foundations for later extensions were included and soon used as the building was extended. The small rear section plus the first connected division of the building were part of this extension with the divide visible by a slight change in brick colour. Labeled cutaway diagram of the Vertical Retort House's internal components Inside, the coal was transported to the top level where it was deposited in a long hopper at the top level of the building (which also contains the conveyor drive and water tank). From the hopper, the coal was fed via a single chute into the vertical retort block which was then divided into 8 separate retorts, where it was heated by furnaces (and later an additional steel furnace in the back room) located on the first floor (ground level). The extracted gas was collected in two parallel \\"Collector Mains\\" running along the top of the retort block. Accumulated tar and liquor was drained from the collector mains into a small liquor separating tank on the 3rd floor on the western side of the building. The collected gas was forced through the retort governor (recently removed for scrap) and into the foul main that runs down the back of the retort house where it was purified elsewhere on the site. Like the Horizontal Retorts, the Vertical Retort was run on Newcastle Coal imported from New South Wales. In the 1950s, modifications were made to the gasworks to allow the site to use Fingal Coal from the Fingal Valley in north east Tasmania. Unlike many gasworks sites in Australia that were either demolished or stripped after closure, the vertical retort house in Launceston still retained most of its original machinery after it was abandoned. Both the electric coke extractor eccentric and conveyor drive remained intact within the building along with most of the fourth floor machinery. The waste heat boiler on sublevel 3 had been reduced in size due to salvage operations in the 1980s as with the waste heat boiler on the first floor (ground level) which was also partially dismantled. The original brick furnaces (producer blocks) at the front of the building were mostly dismantled with the exception of a now free-standing, brick archway which used to allow the conveyor to pass through the furnace block. Original lighting and electronic equipment still remained within the building both on the first floor and the electrical room on the 3rd floor at the back of the building. The coke extractors on the underside of the retort blocks were in various levels of salvage with the most complete being located at the rear of the building. Since it was abandoned in favor of LPG in 1977, the vertical retort was left to fall into ruin with large piles of droppings cover the floor and machinery due to the pigeons that used the building as a roost because of the many openings in its brickwork. In late July 2012, most of the building underwent cleaning to remove the accumulated waste from the interior before scrapping and internal demolition stripped the building of its heritage value to make way for a building proposal.  Laboratory and Workshop  Located between the Chief Engineers Cottage and the Vertical Retort, the Laboratory was an essential part of the site. Every day, samples of gas were tested in this building for quality. The laboratory was no safe place, before switching to Butane for town gas in 1978, the coal gas process produced many hazardous by-product gasses such as Ammonia and Hydrogen Sulfide which were always a potential hazard. This building was also fitted with a drafting table where the Lab Assistant drew up site plans when they were needed. All the distribution maps for Launceston's gas mains were produced here. During restoration in 2007, the iron-clad, timber frame building was lifted from its foundations to make way for a new laneway into the site. The building was relocated a few meters to the north where it was placed on new foundations and a new, modern section of similar proportions was added to it. The Laboratory and Workshop has since been restored and in one of its windows is displayed various items used on the gasworks site that were uncovered during restoration.  Redevelopment  Since the site was sold by Origin Energy in 2007, the Launceston Gasworks have become a potential site for development being located in the CBD close to Launceston's City Park and the Inveresk precinct. 2007 gasworks development The oldest buildings on the site: The horizontal retort buildings are visible with the foundations of one of the older gasometers in the foreground The gasworks have currently been partially developed as part of a large 3 part scheme costing $35 million. The first stage costing $8 million involving the restoration of the cottages on the north of the site as part of the new Centrelink complex has already been completed though the second and third stages were cancelled in 2008 due to the global financial crisis. The second stage was to involve the construction of a whole new set of buildings consisting of offices, retail outlets, restaurants, and apartments. These buildings were to be built on the south of the site facing Cimitier Street within the foundations of the gasometers as well as a free standing structure next to the Governor Cottage and a glass office building connecting the Vertical Retort House to the Carburetted Water Gas Building. As part of the second stage, the Governor Cottage and Horizontal Retort were meant to be restored to allow access to the general public. The third stage was disapproved by the Launceston Council but was to involve the development of the abandoned Origin Energy parking lot across Willis Street into more shops but has been converted into a public parking lot instead. 2012 restaurant proposal In June 2012 a proposal by developer Ross Harrison was put forward to the Launceston City Council to incorporate the Vertical Retort House and Carburetted Water Gas Building into a restaurant and bar with additional commercial space. In late July 2012, the site changed zoning from industrial to commercial and work commenced on cleaning the building of the accumulated pigeon droppings and polystyrene blocks that were dumped inside it. In mid-September removal of the Corrugated Asbestos Roofing started. On the 10 October 2012, the original 1932 machinery was blow-torched out of the building to be taken away followed by disassembly of the fire-brick retorts except for the coke extractors which were partially retained for aesthetic value. The completed works now link the two buildings with a glass atrium as the earlier proposal had intended. A bar and reception area are currently located on the 1st floor (ground level) of the Vertical Retort House under the former retort blocks with restaurant space occupying the area between the two buildings and into the Carburetted Water Gas Building. The upper levels of both buildings have been remodeled to support retail and office spaces. The machinery within the Vertical Retort House underwent a heritage survey to assess the historic value of the surviving equipment and from that, local architectural firm, ARTAS, was left to incorporate this into the final design. Removed machinery was intended to be kept as museum exhibits but has yet to be utilized for such purposes. At present all the machinery in the Vertical Retort has been removed except for a few components on the ground level and the waste heat boiler on the floors above, with salvaged components stored in the Horizontal Retort House.

Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. (CEFR). By making the CEFR more accessible, English Profile will provide support for the development of curricula and teaching materials, and in assessing students' language proficiency. Development English Profile is a collaborative programme which involves a number of different partner organisations. The founding partners in English Profile are the University of Cambridge (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge English Language Assessment, the Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics), the University of Bedfordshire (CRELLA - the Centre for Research in English Language Learning and Assessment), the British Council and English UK. In addition to this, English Profile has a growing number of Network Partners including universities, schools, language training centres and government departments, as well as individual researchers and language specialists. The English Profile Programme is endorsed by the Council of Europe and financially supported by the European Union Lifelong Learning Programme 2007‚Äì2013. Cambridge University Press and Cambridge English Language Assessment are the main funding partners and together coordinate all aspects of the programme. English Profile combines three elements to develop a reliable approach to describing the English Language: ‚Ä¢ World-leading research ‚Äì from key specialists at the University of Cambridge (including Cambridge English Language Assessment and Cambridge University Press), the University of Bedfordshire (CRELLA), the University of Nottingham, as well as other researchers in applied linguistics around the world. ‚Ä¢ Data from actual use ‚Äì including the multi-billion word Cambridge English Corpus (CEC) and a range of other corpora from various universities and institutions around the world. ‚Ä¢ Analysis of existing courses ‚Äì such as popular English Language Teaching (ELT) course books, curricula, exam specifications/wordlists, etc. Benefits of using English Profile English Profile provides information for: ‚Ä¢ Curriculum planners ‚Ä¢ Teachers ‚Ä¢ Materials writers ‚Ä¢ Test developers ‚Ä¢ Researchers The English Profile Programme will provide these English Language Teaching (ELT) professionals with help through: ‚Ä¢ The English Vocabulary Profile ‚Äì a database of information on vocabulary for each level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). ‚Ä¢ The English Grammar Profile ‚Äì a database of information on grammatical structures for each CEFR level ‚Ä¢ The English Profile community website ‚Ä¢ The English Profile Journal ‚Ä¢ Word of the Week email updates ‚Ä¢ A series of research publications English Profile resources 2009-2012 To date, English Profile researchers have developed a number of resources designed to inform the English Language Teaching (ELT) community. English Profile community website The English Profile website is the main source of communication between English Profile partners and the programme‚Äôs widespread network. It is regularly updated with the latest news, events, research findings and resources emerging from the programme. There are also a wide range of interactive features available to visitors including a public forum, events calendar and preview of the forthcoming A1-C2 level English Vocabulary Profile. Visitors to the website are given the opportunity to register to receive monthly e-newsletters, subscribe/unsubscribe to Word of the Week email updates, and to contact the internal team with any queries, comments or feedback they have relating to the website and/or the resources made available to them. English Vocabulary Profile The English Vocabulary Profile is a reference source for teachers, materials writers, test developers and anyone involved in syllabus design. The resource provides a fully searchable listing of words and phrases in English at each level of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). Based on extensive analysis of word frequency and real learner language use, they offer reliable information at both word and sense level. The English Vocabulary Profile: ‚Ä¢ contains words, phrases, phrasal verbs and idioms ‚Ä¢ presents the level of each meaning of a word in CEFR order, to suggest learning priorities ‚Ä¢ provides detailed dictionary-style entries with clear definitions, grammatical information and guidewords to meanings ‚Ä¢ includes audio and written pronunciations ‚Ä¢ contains many real examples, from dictionaries and from actual learners at an appropriate level ‚Ä¢ can be searched according to different filters, including parts of speech, grammar, usage, topic and affixes English Vocabulary Profile research has been substantially but not exclusively corpus-informed. English Profile researchers have used the Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) ‚Äì a corpus of written learner English that forms part of the Cambridge English Corpus (CEC). The CLC includes student writing from 203 countries worldwide and across all six levels of the CEFR. In combination with this corpus evidence, researchers have monitored a range of classroom-based sources, including wordlists from leading coursebooks, readers‚Äô wordlists and the content of vocabulary skills books. They have also referred to the Vocabulary Lists for the Key English Test (KET) and Preliminary English Test (PET) examinations, which have been in use since 1994 and have been regularly updated to reflect language change and patterns of use. Finally, even though it was published thirty years ago, the Cambridge English Lexicon Hindmarsh, R. (1980). Cambridge English Lexicon: a graded word list for materials writers and course-designers. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. by Roland Hindmarsh proved invaluable as a checking source, where the language has not evolved over time. The A1-C2 English Vocabulary Profile is now available on the project website and available to all for a limited time for free after registration. Word of the Week is a free subscription service which offers the public an insight into the English Vocabulary Profile during its closed period of validation and testing. The Word of the Week feature is available on the English Profile website and displays an entry from the English Vocabulary Profile, along with a short commentary by the Chief Research Editor working on the resource. English Grammar Profile English Profile researchers developed the English Grammar Profile, which provides data-driven guidance on which grammatical features characterise learners‚Äô output at each level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). Using data from the Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC), the EGP has analysed which aspects of English Grammar - both structural and functional - are typically mastered at each CEFR level. This information is publicly available free-of-charge for non- commercial use on the English Profile site: http://www.englishprofile.org/english-grammar-profile English Profile Information Booklet/Handbook In April 2011, English Profile launched version 1.0 of the English Profile Information Booklet. This booklet provides information on the different strands of the English Profile Programme and is aimed at teachers, curriculum planners, writers and other English Language Teaching (ELT) professionals. The booklet is intended to help them make decisions about which English language points are suitable for learning at each level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). A more substantial handbook, which will include comprehensive information on the research emerging from the English Profile Programme, is currently in development and will be publicly available from January 2012 at English Profile seminars, ELT events and in a downloadable format on the English Profile website. English Profile Journal In September 2010, Cambridge Journals Online and the English Profile Programme launched the first volume of the online English Profile Journal. Articles in the English Profile Journal are freely available to all, and future articles will be published on an incremental basis. The English Profile Journal will publish research emerging out of the English Profile Programme. The first volume contains an introduction by the editors, in which they set out the journal‚Äôs mission statement, a series of papers on English Profile research that were presented at the February 2009 English Profile seminar, and a report by Professor John Trim (Council of Europe) on the February 2010 English Profile seminar. English Profile Studies series The English Profile Studies series is jointly produced by the Cambridge English Language Assessment and Cambridge University Press. The series publishes volumes focusing on important developments related to the comprehensive objectives of the English Profile Programme. Titles in this series are designed to be of interest to a wide range of users who are interested in English language, language learning and linguistics; including teachers, curriculum designers and educational policy- makers, as well as language test developers, academic lecturers and researchers. The first in this series of publications is entitled Criterial Features in L2 English.Hawkins, J. A. & Filipovic, L.(2012). Criterial features in L2 English: Specifying the Reference Levels of the Common European Framework. English Profile Studies, vol. 1. Cambridge: UCLES/Cambridge University Press. This volume by Hawkins and Filipovic introduces the concept of criteriality, i.e. the properties of learner language which are characteristic and indicative of L2 proficiency at each level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). The second volume in the series, Language Functions Revisited Green, A. (2012). Language functions revisited: Theoretical and empirical bases for language construct definition across the ability range. English Profile Studies, vol. 2, Cambridge: UCLES/Cambridge University Press. by Antony Green, introduces the theoretical and empirical bases for defining English language learning levels in functional ‚ÄòCan-Do‚Äô terms. The third volume in the series, is Immigrant pupils learn English, by Bronagh Catabusic and David Little. This volume reports on a longitudinal study of the acquisition of English L2 by children from immigrant families in Ireland. The study explored the extent to which these children's L2 development confirmed the learning trajectory hypothesised in the English Language Proficiency Benchmarks (pdf), the officially sanctioned framework developed for Irish primary schools. The Benchmarks are an adaptation of the first three levels (A1 - B1) of the CEFR. Cambridge English Profile Corpus (in development) The Cambridge English Profile Corpus (CEPC) is a corpus of learner English produced by students worldwide, and is being built by Cambridge University Press and the Cambridge English Language Assessment, in collaboration with a network of participating educational establishments across the world. These establishments include schools, universities, and private language schools, along with research centres, government bodies (such as ministries of education) and individual education professionals. The CEPC aims to provide 10 million words of data, covering both spoken and written language. Both General English and English for Specific Purposes are included. Written data is being collected via the online English Profile data collection portal. The corpus covers Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) levels A1-C2, and attempts to maintain a balance across a number of variables, including proficiency level, first language, and educational context. The CEPC allows a number of filtering options: ‚Ä¢ educational contexts (e.g. primary or secondary, monolingual or bilingual) ‚Ä¢ task type e.g. letter, email, report, essay (written data) ‚Ä¢ type of interaction e.g. casual conversation, formal presentation, oral exam, classroom discourse, role play etc. (spoken data) ‚Ä¢ specific domains (e.g. medical English, business English) ‚Ä¢ first language of learners ‚Ä¢ age range of learners, and other demographic information ‚Ä¢ country of data collection The CEPC will allow the development of an innovative and unique methodology for describing the English language. This methodology, based as it is on corpus research, will be empirical and non-‚Äòlinguacentric‚Äô; that is, not solely concerned with the English spoken by native speakers.

Personal life Khalil is a software engineer by trade. Early activism Wael Khalil joined the Revolutionary Socialists in 1992 but left them in 2011 after Hosni Mubarak resignation by few weeks. Khalil began his activism in 2000 as part of the Egyptian anti-war and anti-globalisation movement. He believes that political reform is rooted in the anti-war and Palestine solidarity movements.http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/1/1/worldupdates/2006-01-01T001411Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_-229981-1&sec;=worldupdates He also believes that dictatorship leads to imperialism. He was a protester from the Egyptian opposition movement Kefaya. He also co-founded the 20 March Popular Campaign for Change. In 2006 he criticized Egyptian police after at Sudanese refugees were killed at a squatter camp in Cairo. He said, \\"When you kill little babies, things have changed...We will try you, and you won't be able to travel abroad again.\\" Al Ahram photo scandal In September 2010 Khalil reported on an altered photograph in Al-Ahram in which editors had changed the position of president Hosni Mubarak from the back of a row of heads of state to the front. On his blog Waelk.net Khalil posted the photoshopped image alongside the original taken by Associated Press, which showed Mubarak actually behind Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Jordanian King Abdullah II, and United States President Barack Obama at a media event at the White House. Egyptian Chronicles blog commented, \\"The photo scandal of the week which is making headlines worldwide is another triumph to the Egyptian blogosphere as the one who discovered from all the world is Egyptian follow blogger Wael Khalil...I repeat the one who discovered is Wael Khalil...Who said that blogs are losing their power in Egypt !!??\\" 2011 Egyptian revolution Khalil was active during the 2011 Egyptian revolution and its aftermath. In May 2011 Khalil spoke out for a second wave of protests in support of a \\"Friday of rage\\" against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF). In an editorial in The Guardian, Khalil's criticisms of the SCAF focused on rumors about pardoning Mubarak and members of his regime, physical or violent reactions of security forces during protests, the army's use of military trials against civilians, use of trials against protesters and 'normal citizens', and he also noted the prior successes which resulted from large protests in Tahrir Square. He wrote, \\"The call for a 'second revolution' chimes with a growing restlessness and impatience at the pace of developments and the overall performance of the governing Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF)....We will be out again in Tahrir Square on Friday 27 May in order to assert that the interim power respect our rights and demands. The Egyptian people have earned their right to control the future of this country.\\" In July 2011 Al-Ahram profiled Khalil's presence at a meeting with Prime Minister Essam Sharaf, along with four other activists, which prompted a debate on Twitter about whether or not the activists represented to growing protests. Seven demands, agreed upon by several organisations, were presented to Sharaf. The meeting happened while in Tahrir square protesters gathered in their second major wave of activism. 2011 Budget policy Wael Khalil speaking at Tweet Nadwa about the 2011 Budget In a June 2011 editorial in The Guardian, Khalil criticized support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which included a $3 billion loan. He said, \\"But many people, myself included, were unhappy with this news and the impact such a loan will have on deepening the country's debt and mounting debt servicing burden.\\" Khalil equated help from the bank with \\"neoliberal[ism]\\", \\"imperialism\\", and the politics of the Mubarak regime. He blamed such policies for economic stagnation, deterioration, and growing inequality under Mubarak. Khalil cited IMF ex-employee and Mubarak regime finance minister Youssef Boutros-Ghali, who was sentenced to prison for corruption. He said, \\"I believe that this country's future lies not with the same highly paid, unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats of the IMF, nor with their sacred indicators of budget deficits and market economics. Our future lies with a new home-grown economics that caters for the majority of Egyptians, the schools where their children are educated, the hospitals where they receive healthcare, and the jobs that guarantee them decent and honourable living.\\" In July 2011, Khalil criticized a proposed increase in Egypt's minimum wage as insufficiently large. Khalil said the new wage, while \\"an improvement\\" represented an \\"example of the priority of the government to lean on the poor and working majority in order to protect the interests of businessmen and the established elite.\\" Khalil also supported the proposed budget's decreasing of the deficit but criticized the means to do so which he said put more burden on workers and pensioners rather than raising capital gains taxes. Khalil said, \\"We need to continue mass demonstrations to pressure the government, [because] it won‚Äôt stop with just the budget and the decision on minimum wage, but they will continue leaning on workers, on the country‚Äôs weakest side.\\" Khalil argued that in the movement for reform social rights were necessary as well as political rights. He said, \\"We must not only mobilize people, but also debate and explain specifically why social justice is important for [Egypt]. You cannot really say that you want democracy, and then after that you‚Äôll [work to] get social justice. No. If you do it in this order, you‚Äôll end up with nothing.\\"  See also  * Alaa Abd El-Fatah * Nawara Negm * Saad Eddin Ibrahim  References  External links ;Official sites  ;Media  ;Interviews   Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Egyptian Sunni Muslims Category:Egyptian democracy activists Category:Egyptian human rights activists Category:Egyptian revolutionaries Category:People of the Egyptian revolution of 2011 ","title":"Wael Khalil"},{"id":"32474973","title":"Within and Without (album)"},{"id":"32474976","title":"Wheelchair fencing at the 2010 Asian Para Games"},{"id":"32474984","text":"James Lawrence McDermott (25 May 1932 ‚Äì 29 August 2006) was an English professional footballer who played as a winger.

It was the fourth moon of Pluto to be discovered and its existence was announced on 20 July 2011. It was imaged, along with Pluto and its four other moons, by the New Horizons spacecraft in July 2015. The first image of Kerberos from the flyby was released to the public on 22 October 2015.  Discovery  Hubble discovery images of Kerberos Kerberos was discovered by researchers of the Pluto Companion Search Team using the Hubble Space Telescope on 28 June 2011, using the Wide Field Camera 3, during an attempt to find any rings that Pluto might possess. The search for rings was motivated in part by a desire to avoid damage to New Horizons when it passed through the Pluto system in July 2015. Further observations were made on 3 and 18 July 2011 and Kerberos was verified as a new moon on 20 July 2011. It was later precovered or identified in earlier archival Hubble images from 15 February 2006 and 25 June 2010, though Kerberos was obscured by diffraction spikes in those images. Kerberos's brightness is only about 10% of that of Nix, and it was only found because the discovery team took eight-minute exposures; earlier observations had used shorter exposures. It was officially designated S/2011 (134340) 1, and was informally referred to as P4.  Origin  Like Pluto's other moons, it is suspected that Kerberos coalesced from the debris of a massive collision between Pluto and another Kuiper belt object, similar to the giant impact thought to have created the Moon.  Physical characteristics  Kerberos has a double-lobed shape and is approximately across its longest dimension and across its shortest dimension. The larger lobe of Kerberos is approximately 8 km (5 mi) across while the smaller lobe is measured to be approximately across. The double-lobed shape of Kerberos is likely formed by two smaller objects merged, suggesting that Kerberos along with Pluto's other moons may have been formed by the coalescence of debris around Pluto. Kerberos has a high albedo or reflectivity similar to Pluto's other small moons, likely due to the presence of water ice on its surface. Before the New Horizons flyby, Kerberos was initially thought to have a larger size and a darker surface.  Rotation  Like the other small moons of Pluto, Kerberos is not tidally locked and its rotation is chaotic, varying quickly over geological timescales. The varying gravitational influences of Pluto and Charon as they orbit their barycenter causes the chaotic tumbling of Pluto's small moons, including Kerberos. At the time of the New Horizons flyby, the rotational period of Kerberos was about 5.33 days and its rotational axis was tilted about 96 degrees to its orbit. The high axial tilt of Kerberos meant that it was rotating sideways relative to its orbit around the Pluto-Charon barycenter.  Orbit  Observations indicate a circular, equatorial orbit around the Pluto-Charon barycenter at a distance of . All of Pluto's moons including Kerberos have very circular orbits with very low orbital inclinations to Pluto's equator. Kerberos orbits between Nix and Hydra and makes a complete orbit around Pluto roughly every 32.167 days. Its orbital period is close to a 1:5 orbital resonance with Charon, with the timing discrepancy being about 0.7%. As with the near resonances between Nix or Hydra and Charon (1:4 and 1:6, respectively), determining how close this relationship is to a true resonance will require more-accurate knowledge of Kerberos's orbit, in particular its rate of precession.  Exploration  The New Horizons spacecraft took images of Kerberos during its flyby of the Pluto system on 14 July 2015. Three months later, on 22 October, the first image of the moon was published. It is the last moon of Pluto to have its image released, revealing that Kerberos was small and had a bright surface contrary to the initial idea that the moon was covered in dark material.  Naming  Upon discovery, Kerberos received the minor planet designation S/2011 (134340) 1 because it was the first satellite (S) discovered orbiting the minor planet 134340 Pluto in 2011. It was initially called \\"P4\\", meaning the fourth Plutonian moon to be discovered. The convention for naming Plutonian moons is to use names associated with the god Pluto in classical mythology. To decide on names for P4 and P5, Mark Showalter and the SETI Institute, on behalf of the discovery team, conducted a non-binding Internet poll in 2013, in which the general public was invited to vote for their favorite names. The public could choose from a selection of Greek mythological names related to the god Pluto, or could propose their own names. After the initial announcement, William Shatner, the actor who played Captain James T. Kirk in the Star Trek franchise, proposed the names Vulcan and Romulus, ostensibly referring to the fire god Vulcan (a nephew of Pluto), and to Romulus the founder of Rome, but also alluding to the fictional planets of Vulcan and Romulus in the Star Trek universe. The 'Romulus' suggestion was discounted, because there is already an asteroid moon of that name, but Vulcan won the poll after Shatner tweeted about it, with Cerberus (the dog that guards Pluto's underworld) coming second and Styx (the goddess of the river of the underworld) coming third. The winning names were submitted to the International Astronomical Union. However, 'Vulcan' was unacceptable to the IAU because it was not the name of an underworld deity and had already been used for a hypothetical planet inside the orbit of Mercury, as well as having given its name to the hypothetical vulcanoids. Cerberus is already the name of an asteroid, 1865 Cerberus, but the Greek form of the name, Kerberos, was acceptable to the IAU. On 2 July 2013, the IAU announced that it formally approved the names Kerberos for P4 and Styx for P5. The names of features on the bodies in the Pluto system are related to mythology and the literature and history of exploration. In particular, the names of features on Kerberos must be related to dogs from literature, mythology and history. The provisional designation of the satellite varies based on the source used. The International Astronomical Union announced it as S/2011 (134340) 1, whereas the New Horizons mission website announced it as S/2011 P 1.New Horizons news, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, \\"Fourth Moon Adds to Pluto's Appeal\\" , 20 July 2011  Notes   References   External links  * Showalter, Mark.

Founded on May 23, 1970, the museum is best known for its exhibitions of Karun treasure. In the museum, items on display include sculptures, pitchers with beaklike spouts and stone axes from the Bronze Age, earthen dishes and glassware from the Hellenistic and Ancient Roman Period, and stelae from the nearby Roman ancient ruin site of Blaundus. The most interesting items are of the so-called Karun treasure belonging to the Lydian Period. Karun treasure The artifacts, making a collection of 363 pieces, date back to the 7th century BCE. They were illegally excavated by villagers in 1966 from the tomb of a Lydian noble woman, smuggled outside the country and sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met) in New York, USA. After their discovery in a catalogue of the museum in 1984, Turkish journalist √ñzgen Acar informed the Turkish government, which launched a judicial case against The Met. After a legal battle, the collection was returned in 1993 to Turkey. Museum theft case In 2006 two items in the Karun Treasure (Lydian Hoard) were discovered to be fakes, with the originals having been stolen. The pieces were a coin and a golden brooch in the form of a hippocamp (a winged sea- horse). Kazƒ±m Akbƒ±yƒ±koƒülu, the director of the museum, was accused of the theft, and he and 10 others were arrested. Akbƒ±yƒ±koƒülu admitted guilt, blaming gambling debts. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison. In November 2012, it was announced that the golden brooch would be returned to Turkey. The returned piece was temporarily displayed in Ankara's Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, before being returned to the U≈üak Museum of Archaeology.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Bolton, the archdeaconry of Bolton, and the diocese of Manchester. Its benefice is united with those of St Peter, Farnworth, Holy Trinity, Prestolee, and St Saviour, Ringley. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History St John's was built as a Commissioners' church between 1824 and 1826 to a design by Thomas Hardwick. The chancel and porches were added in 1873 by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin, and the church was restored, at a cost of ¬£4,000 (). In 1912 the pinnacles were removed from the tower. Architecture Exterior The church is constructed in stone and has slate roofs. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave, a three-bay chancel, a south vestry, an organ loft to the north, and a west tower. The tower is in four stages separated by string courses, and has octagonal buttresses rising to turrets at the corners. In the bottom is a doorway with a pointed arch, above which is a two-light window. In the third stage is a diagonal clock face, and the two- light bell openings are louvred. The parapet is embattled. On each side of the tower are two-light windows, and there are similar windows on the north and south sides of the church. The east widow has five lights. Interior There is a gallery on three sides of the church, supported by octagonal columns. On the west gallery are the royal arms of George I. The ceiling is flat and contains ribs and bosses. Between the chancel and the vestry to the north and the organ loft to the south are two-bay arcades. The reredos and pews date from 1874. The font is octagonal, standing on a moulded shaft, and has panelled sides. The wooden pulpit dates from 1907, and stands on a stone quatrefoil column. The stained glass in the east window depicts the Baptism of Jesus and the Crucifixion. Elsewhere there is glass by Heaton, Butler and Bayne of 1908, G. Wragge of 1923, Shrigley and Hunt of 1939, and W. Pointer of 1958. The three-manual pipe organ was built in 1894 by Peter Conacher and Company. In 1980 its action was changed from tubular-pneumatic to electro- pneumatic by H. Y. Ainscough. However, by 2002 it had become unreliable. It was mothballed and replaced by an electronic organ. There is a ring of eight bells, all of which were cast in 1954 by John Taylor & Co. External features The gates and gate piers to the churchyard dating from about 1826 or later are listed at Grade II. The churchyard contains the war grave of a Royal Army Service Corps soldier of World War I. The churchyard also contains the grave of Thomas Bonsor Crompton, inventor of the felted drying cylinder, which he patented in 1821. This allowed for the continuous drying of paper for the first time.http://thomasbonsorcrompton.info/ See also *Listed buildings in Farnworth *List of ecclesiastical works by Paley and Austin *List of Commissioners' churches in Northeast and Northwest England References Farnworth Farnworth Farnworth Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Greater Manchester Category:Paley and Austin buildings Category:Commissioners' church buildings Category:Farnworth ","title":"St John the Evangelist's Church, Farnworth"},{"id":"32475144","title":"List of regional anthems"},{"id":"32475162","text":"Georg Cracow Georg Cracow, Krak√≥w, Cracov, Cracau or Cracovius (7 November 1525, Stettin - 17 March 1575, Leipzig) was a German lawyer and statesman.

Book edited by Springer - New York, 260 pages, 2010. an application, to design an architecture, to refine detailed components down to RTOS or hardware description. The SIGNAL model supports a design methodology which goes from specification to implementation, from abstraction to concretization, from synchrony to asynchrony. SIGNAL has been mainly developed in INRIAEspresso team since the 1980s, at the same time as similar programming languages, Esterel and Lustre.  A brief history  The SIGNAL language was first designed for signal processing applications in the beginning of the 1980s. It has been proposed to answer the demand of new domain-specific language for the design of signal processing applications, adopting a dataflow and block- diagram style with array and sliding window operators. P. Le Guernic, A. Benveniste, and T. Gautier have been in charge of the language definition. The first paper on SIGNAL was published in 1982, while the first complete description of SIGNAL appeared in the PhD thesis of T. Gautier. The symbolic representation of SIGNAL via z/3z (over [-1,0,1]) has been introduced in 1986. A full compiler of SIGNAL based on the clock calculus on hierarchy of Boolean clocks, was described by L. Besnard in his PhD thesis in 1992. The clock calculus has been improved later by T. Amagbegnon with the proposition of arborescent canonical forms. During the 1990s, the application domain of the SIGNAL language has been extended into general embedded and real-time systems. The relation-oriented specification style enabled the increasing construction of the systems, and also led to the design considering multi-clocked systems, compared to the original single-clock-based implementation of Esterel and Lustre. Moreover, the design and implementation of distributed embedded systems were also taken into account in SIGNAL. The corresponding research includes the optimization methods proposed by B. Ch√©ron, the clustering models defined by B. Le Goff, the abstraction and separate compilation formalized by O. Maffe√Øs, and the implementation of distributed programs developed by P. Aubry. The Polychrony Toolsets The Polychrony toolset is an open-source development environment for critical/embedded systems based on SIGNAL, a real- time polychronous data-flow language. It provides a unified model-driven environment to perform design exploration by using top-down and bottom-up design methodologies formally supported by design model transformations from specification to implementation and from synchrony to asynchrony. It can be included in heterogeneous design systems with various input formalisms and output languages. Polychrony is a set of tools composed of: * A SIGNAL batch compiler * A Graphical User Interface (editor + interactive access to compiling functionalities) * The Sigali tool, an associated formal system for formal verification and controller synthesis.A.

He is a professor and has been for many years the Chair of the Recording Arts Department at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. He is best known for composing the score to the cult film The Room. Early life and education Born into a family of film- makers (his father Ognjen Milicevic was cinematographer and his mother Zlata Milicevic was film editor), Milicevic started playing piano when he was 6. He received a B.A. in music composition (1982) and an M.A. (1986) in music composition and multimedia arts from the Sarajevo Music Academy, in his native Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he studied with Josip Magdic. Milicevic came to the United States in 1986 to study with Alvin Lucier at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, where he received his master's degree in experimental music composition (1988). After Wesleyan, he went to study with Dennis Kam at the University of Miami in Florida, where he received his doctorate degree in computer and experimental music composition in 1991. He also studied for several summers at the Aspen Music School/Festival with Michael Czajkowski. Career In the nineties, Milicevic has concentrated on live interactive electronic music composition utilizing hyperinstruments. He was awarded several music prizes for his compositions in the former Yugoslavia as well as in Europe. Milicevic worked in Yugoslavia as a freelance composer for 10 years, where he composed for theater, films, radio and television, also receiving several prizes for this body of work. Since he moved to the United States in 1986, Milicevic has performed his live electronic music, composed for modern dances, made several experimental animated films and videos, set up installations and video sculptures, had exhibitions of his paintings, and scored for films. His film music can be heard at his website. He presents on variety of topics at many international conferences ranging from film, music, religion, psychology and neuroscience of (film, music, and religion,) sociology, aesthetics, cultural studies, and education. Milicevic is very interested in interdisciplinary connections among all these disciplines. For example, in education, he is using brain based learning in order to improve his teaching effectiveness. Milicevic's most popular class at Loyola Marymount University is Movie Music class, where he approaches film music from the neuroscientific and psychological point of view. Commercial work In the former Yugoslavia, Milicevic (using the alias Igor Krik) produced the 1985 pop band, VALENTINO, that sold platinum. In 2003, he composed the score for the cult film The Room, directed by Tommy Wiseau. He later wrote the score for Wiseau's 2004 documentary Homeless in America, and in 2015, scored a documentary about The Room, titled Room Full of Spoons. In 2009, he also produced an album entitled I‚Äôve Got a Song for You by Rade ≈†erbed≈æija and Miroslav Tadiƒá. For this work, he was nominated for the Porin award in Croatia as the best-produced album. He scored a documentary, Cuba: The Forgotten Revolution, which won an Emmy in 2016.

Life From the age of seven, he was put in the school of the \\"Fratres vitae communis\\" in Groninghe. He decided at the age of 17 to become a priest and became a monk in the abbey of Aduard. In 1540, he was sent by his community as a student at the University of Louvain to take theology courses so that he could one day be able to become abbot of a monastery. There he obtained his degree of license, but he was quickly drawn into the movement of active reformers in the University of Louvain.

Er verfasste mehrere theologische Schriften, sein Wirken aber war mehr durch seine Predigten bestimmt. Begraben ist er in der Gro√üen Kirche in Emden.  Seine Bibliothek  Hardenberg erwarb im Laufe seines Lebens eine reichhaltige Bibliothek, darunter Werke aus der Klosterbibliothek Arduard und aus dem Besitz von Francisco de Enzinas. Diese etwa 526 Druckschriften und 16 Handschriften umfassende Bibliothek ist als einzige private Gelehrtenbibliothek aus der Mitte des 16. Jahrhunderts in Nordwestdeutschland fast vollst√§ndig erhalten und bildet heute eine Sondersammlung der Johannes-a- Lasco-Bibliothek in Emden. Darunter finden sich bedeutende Einzelst√ºcke: zwei B√ºcher (von drei in Emden vorhandenen) aus der Bibliothek des Erasmus von Rotterdam, die √ºber den Zwischenbesitz von Johannes √° Lasco, der dessen Sammlung aufgekauft hatte, zu Hardenberg gelangten. Ab 1998 wurden die B√§nde in einem DFG-Projekt der Bibliothek in Zusammenarbeit mit der Fachhochschule Oldenburg/Ostfriesland/Wilhelmshaven, Standort Emden, Leer digitalisiert.

The French had landed on the island on 22 July, and on 5 September attacked and captured a fort protecting the town of Willemstad, Cura√ßao. The American consul sent for help, and on 10 September the Dutch governor of the island surrendered to a British frigate, , under the command of Frederick Watkins. On 22 September the American sloops and arrived, and on 23 September the Patapsco sailed into the harbor and landed troops to reinforce the garrison protecting the town. On 23 September and 24 September the French fired upon the defenders, consequently exchanging cannon and musket fire with them throughout the day and night. Though it appeared a French assault was imminent, French forces left the island during the night. Significantly, the French suffered many killed or wounded in contrast to two American wounded. The British took control of the island, and American forces sailed away. Background The island of Cura√ßao was important to American merchants in the Caribbean, and ships had been stationed near there to guard American interests since the start of the Quasi- War. The sloop was ordered to sail there in May 1800, and arrived in June and left soon afterwards. No American warships ships were stationed at Cura√ßao on 23 July when a French fleet arrived from Guadeloupe, consisting of 5 ships and 1,400 troops, sailors and Guadeloupean militia. The French forces landed and their commander demanded the surrender of the forts, which Governor Johan Lausser refused.Palmer 1987, p. 196. Siege An additional 10 vessels with more sailors and men had landed by 5 September, when the French forces attacked the forts protecting the town of Willemstad, capturing one and sending a note threatening to attack Americans. American consul Benjamin Phillips sent a messenger to St. Kitts, and the and Patapsco were sent to Cura√ßao on 14 September, arriving on 22 September. Meanwhile, the British frigate under Frederick Watkins had been sent to the island to prevent its capture by the French. On 10 September the ship arrived at the eastern point of Cura√ßao, and there chased away two privateers that the French commander had left cruising as pickets. After these vessels retreated into a bay that contained a further 15 privateers, Watkins sailed to Willemstad where he began engaging various targets that were firing from the town.Palmer 1987, p. 197 An American merchantman soon informed the British of the situation and that the Dutch were willing to capitulate to the British in exchange for protection. The British landed a force of twenty marines and accepted Governor Lassuer's surrender three days later.Palmer 1987, p. 198 The French still held two forts near the town, and on 22 September, prior to the arrival of the American forces, the French commander had demanded the surrender of the town within 24 hours. Battle On 23 September, to save the town and protect American property, the Patapsco sailed into the harbor, landed her marines, reinforced with twenty marines from the Merrimack. The troops also manned a gun battery and fanned out through the town. At approximately 17:00 the French forts and men fired upon the defending forces, which the cannon of the Patapsco answered along with the muskets and cannons of the defending forces. Two Americans were wounded with 150 French killed or wounded. On 24 September, the French again exchanged cannon and musket fire with the defending forces, and the volume of French fire led the defenders to expect an assault on the town. However, during the night the French abandoned their positions and sailed away. Aftermath On the morning of 25 September, the Merrimack discovered the French ships had sailed away during the night. The Nereid sailed into the harbour and the capitulation took effect. Thinking that the French would return, Watkins asked the two American captains to cruise off the windward side of the island while the Nereid secured the island. In ten days of cruising, the Americans captured only one French vessel before stopping off at Willemstad while on their return to Saint Kitts.Palmer 1987, p. 201 Upon their return to Cura√ßao, the Americans discovered that Watkins had failed to keep his word, and instead of protecting American property, had embargoed forty-one ships in the harbor of which seven were American. The Nereid commander also impounded a large quantity of specie belonging to Consul Phillips and set privateers cruising with orders to seize American shipping. In his reports, Watkins completely ignored the assistance the Americans had provided in seizing the island and failed to even mention their presence during the action. Watkins's treatment of the Americans was not approved by British officials and upon the appointment of a new commander for the British Jamaica station he was stripped of his command and the specie he had seized was returned.Palmer 1987, p. 277.

He was convicted of the attempted assassination of Atat√ºrk in ƒ∞zmir and hanged in Ankara on 26 August 1926. He also served as the chairman of the Turkish sports club Fenerbah√ße S.K. between 1916-18.Past Presidents Early life and the Balkan wars From a D√∂nmeh background, Nazƒ±m was born and raised in Salonica; his family were longtime residents of the city, successful in running various businesses, and he himself was the director of a hospital. Nazƒ±m had joined the Young Turks Movement, and when the Greeks occupied Salonica in October 1912 during the Balkan wars, he was imprisoned for eleven months in an Athens prison as a Turkish nationalist. The guards abused him and told him that his family had been killed, and that Constantinople was already occupied, while Anatolia would soon fall to the Greeks. Sent to Smyrna (Izmir) after a request by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), he was deeply troubled by his family's fate (and that of his baby daughter) and the exile from his hometown. In newspaper articles he called attention to Bulgarian atrocities committed against Muslims and \\"call[ed] for vengeance against the remaining Ottoman Christians\\". The Ottoman defeat and the ethnic cleansing of Muslims was traumatic for many Young Turks and led to a desire for revenge; Nazƒ±m's \\"transformation from a patriotic doctor into a rabid, vindictive nationalist... symbolized the fate of many others\\". Role in the Armenian Genocide Nazƒ±m was a leading figure in the Turkification of the Ottoman Empire. He was a member of the Te≈ükil√¢t-ƒ± Mahsusa (Special Organization in the Ottoman Empire). Many members of this organization eventually participated in the Turkish national movement and had played special roles in the Armenian Genocide.Taner Ak√ßam, T√ºrk Ulusal Kimliƒüi ve Ermeni Sorunu, ƒ∞leti≈üim Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 1992, p. 155. In a speech delivered on during the closing remarks of a Committee of Union and Progress meeting, Dr. Nazƒ±m has said: \\\\- access date 16 February 2013 ProfileRifat, T√ºrkiye, pp. 159‚Äì60, quoted in Sarkisian and Sahakian, Vital Issues in Modern Armenian History, p. 32. 40 And continued by saying, \\"the procedure this time will be one of total annihilation-it is necessary that not even one single Armenian survive this annihilation\\". During one of the secret meetings of the Young Turks, Dr. Nazƒ±m was quoted as saying, \\"The massacre is necessary. All the non-Turkish elements, whatever nation they belong to, should be exterminated\\". In February 1915, two months prior to the commencement of the Armenian Genocide, Dr. Nazƒ±m declared a new government policy which would \\"produce total annihilation\\" in which would be \\"essential that no Armenian survives\\". He has been noted to have said that the Ottoman Empire should be \\"freeing the fatherland of the aspirations of this cursed race\\" when referring to the Armenians. Nazƒ±m subsequently fled from the Ottoman Empire to Germany in October 1918. \\\\- Profile Due to his role in the Armenian Genocide, Dr. Nazƒ±m was sentenced to death in absentia by the Ottoman Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919‚Äì1920, but this was never carried out due to him having fled to Berlin. He moved to the newly founded Republic of Turkey in 1922 and was never executed for his crimes against the Armenians. However, in 1926, the Ankara Independence Tribunal ordered his arrest and ordered his execution for attempting to assassinate Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk.

From the time of its construction in 1888, the spire of the courthouse has housed a gigantic clock, visible from four sides. Until 1953 the clock had to be wound by hand twice a week by a building custodian who climbed into the tower to manually raise the 650 pounds of weights which kept the device in operation.\\"Time is Standing Still as Courthouse Clock is Being Modernized,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, vol. 46, no. 159 (Nov. 5, 1953), pg. 1. This process was modernized in 1953, when a small electric motor was installed to automate the process of raising the clock weights. Building purposes The basement of the courthouse has long housed the Benton County Elections Department, which under state law retained and stored ballot boxes and original ballots between one local election and the next.\\"Take Long Sleep: Ballots and Boxes Stored for the Next Election,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, vol. 20, no. 162 (Nov. 9, 1928), pg. 4. 1918 heating reconstruction By 1918 the original steam heating system had begun to fail after 30 years of use.\\"Court House to Have New Heating Plant,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, vol. 10, no. 91 (Aug. 15, 1918), pg. 1.

Only the original boiler was retained as part of the heating modification, which was completed that same fall. 1954 building remodel In 1954 the courthouse underwent a major remodeling, in which the large circuit courtroom was split in half, to form a new district courtroom, a judges' office, and a 182-square foot conference room.\\"Shiny New Circuit Courtroom Now in Use,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, vol. 47, no. 105 (Sept. 2, 1954), pg. 14.

The newly remodeled 35-by-50 foot room is said to have retained much of its large feel, making use of mahogany plywood and a light green color scheme. The 1954 makeover was also used to eliminate some 20 brass spittoons which had adorned the courthouse's hallways and offices since its original construction.\\"Modern Substitute: Urns for Spittoons,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, vol. 47, no. 170 (Nov. 18, 1954), pg. 1.

Constructed from 1924 to 1925, the building represents a distinctive example of the Italian Renaissance style by Portland architects Houghtaling and Dougan. It is one of several Oregon buildings the firm designed in the revival styles popular in the 1920s and 1930s. History Background After the decline of the Julian Hotel and other earlier establishments during the first years of the 20th Century, the small college town of Corvallis, Oregon found itself without a suitable modern hotel for visiting guests. Several proposals were floated by community leaders for construction of a new \\"first class, modern, fireproof\\" hotel during the first half of the 1920s, without success.\\"Hotel Benton Now in Process of Construction Will Be One of Most Modern in Oregon,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, vol. 16, no. 208 (Jan. 1, 1925), pg. 2. In the spring of 1924 the development of a modern downtown hotel was undertaken as a project by the local Kiwanis club, headed by President Ralph Lyman Bosworth, in the effort to establish an important public asset for the growing community. A committee of 7, headed by Bosworth and including bankers, an attorney, and newspaper publisher Claude Ingalls, was established as the Benton Hotel Corporation as a legal coordinating body for the project. These worked together with other local business and community leaders doing the initial planning work to get the project off the ground. Reflecting the progressive spirit of the early 1920s, this proposal was largely financed through public subscription and carried out by local contractors with a stake in the success of the project. Some 167 members of the community committed to the loan of $90,000 at 5 percent interest to provide half the financing for the project, with a like amount generated by a 6.5 percent bond floated in Portland by financiers there. Additional loan subscriptions made possible the total cost of construction, $250,000.\\"Quarter Million Hotel is Opened,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, vol. 17, no. 29 (June 3, 1925), pg. 1. This funding allowed for the construction of the planned 7 story concrete and steel edifice, complete with 120 rooms, over half of which contained either a shower or a bath. Floors were laid in concrete and partition walls covered with tile, making the building quiet and relatively safe from the danger of fire. Construction of the building began in 1924 and was completed during the first half of 1925.See the photograph of construction in progress in the Corvallis Gazette-Times, vol. 16, no. 208 (Jan. 1, 1925), pg. 2. Approximately 95 percent of the work on the building was carried out by Corvallis contractors and construction workers.[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4648966/ln_traver_general_contractor_full/ \\"L.N. Traver, General Contractor\\" (full page ad), Corvallis Gazette-Times, vol. 17, no. 29 (June 3, 1925), pg. 3. Opening Hotel Benton, coffee tavern, c. 1935 The hotel opened to the public on June 1, 1925. The opening was promoted with the printing of 50,000 letters of announcement, which were systematically mailed out to business leaders around the state, including a mailing by the dean of the Pharmacy department of Oregon Agricultural College to the state's pharmacists and another sent to every banker in Oregon in conjunction with a planned meeting there.\\"Announcements of Hotel Opening Sent Over State,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, vol. 17, no. 29 (June 3, 1925), pg. 6.

With its prominent location across the street from the Benton County Courthouse and one block from the train station, its easy visibility, and its sophisticated design, the Hotel Benton became a social and business hub of Corvallis for more than 30 years. Decline and repurposing The hotel's fortunes began to suffer after the termination of passenger rail service in the 1940s, and especially with the later rise of auto-oriented motels outside the downtown core. By the 1980s, the building was in use for low-income public housing..

The location was first settled in 1901 by Cipriano Hernandez, who farmed the area and built the original Castolon Store, now known as the Alvino House. History The area began to attract refugees from nearby Mexico who were fleeing the Mexican Revolution of 1910. The Castolon area was the site on a U.S. Army encampment, called Campo Santa Helena, to house units patrolling the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican border. However, by the time the camp was complete in 1920 the border was quiet and the camp buildings were never used by the Army. In 1921 the La Harmonia Company was established in the barracks, operating a trading post and farming cotton. The La Harmonia Company was established in 1918 by Howard Perry, who owned the Chisos Mining Company in Terlingua, in partnership with Wayne Cartledge. Cartledge and his son Eugene chose the name and managed the company. The La Harmonia Company lasted until 1961, when it was sold to the National Park Service. The store burned down in a fire in May 2019. Description Castolon is divided into two areas. \\"Old Castolon\\" comprises the Old Castolon Store, a cafe-residence and a shed. The Army Compound includes a barracks, now the Castolon Store, a recreation hall, latrine, two officers' residences, a granary and tack room, and the Magdalena, Garlick and Alvino residences. The Magdalena and Garlick houses post-date the Army construction and are associated with La Harmonia Ranch, while the Alvino house pre-dates the Army. All of the buildings are built with adobe walls, and most are roofed with corrugated metal roofing. A few use traditional vigas, latillas and a soil roof covering. Castolon was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 6, 1974.

It was an updated version of the 486 and 686/866The 686 had appeared after the war with a new name: approximately 2,050 of these 866s had been produced between 1946 and 1950. models which had first appeared in the 1930s and inherited its engines from those cars, although their engines in turn dated back to OHC units introduced in the mid-1920s. The car was launched in autumn 1950, and during the first year 1,787 were produced. In 1951 the company produced a further 2,666. The depressed state of the economy and the government‚Äôs punitive taxation policy, especially in respect of larger cars, saw to it that, at least in terms of units produced, 1951 was the car‚Äôs best year, however. 815 were produced in 1952 and only 197 in 1953. 1953 was the last year of production, but the company was still advertising new cars for sale at least until the end of 1954, which indicates that their financial problems may well have been exacerbated by the practice of systematically manufacturing more cars than they were selling earlier in the Anjou's life. The Anjou came with a large limousine-style body significantly modified when compared to its predecessors and characteristic of the times. A small number of two-door coup√©s were produced as well as a 2-door cabriolet, branded as the Hotchkiss Anth√©or. There was a choice of two engine sizes. Most cars were shipped with a four-cylinder ohc 2,312 cc water-cooled unit with one or, at the customer‚Äôs option, two carburettors. However, a longer-nosed version allowed space for the larger ohc six-cylinder 3,485 cc water-cooled engine that promoted the car into the stratospheric 20CV taxation class, but increased claimed maximum power from 72/75 hp to 100/125 hp, with a corresponding increase in claimed maximum speed from 130 km/h (81 mph) to 145 km/h (90 mph). Sources for the power output vary, possibly according to whether the engine was fed by one or two carburettors. Both cars were offered with so-called ‚Äúclassic‚Äù four-speed manual transmission, and the smaller- engined car was available with an optional electromagnetic ‚ÄúCotal‚Äù gearbox, which is seen by some as a precursor to more modern automatic transmission systems, and which would also have stood out from the crowd at any time on account of its having featured four forward speeds and four reverse speeds. In addition to the 5,465 Anjous produced, the company built about 40 of the 2-door cabriolet Anth√©or models.

Originally located in the historic building on Madison and 7th, the church now holds services from its 1962 location on the corner of Harrison and 35th.  History  The first recorded Episcopal service in Corvallis (then known as Marysville) was held by Dr. John McCarty in 1853. By 1871, occasional services had grown into a mission, St. Mary's School for girls. The school closed after two years, but the school chapel, named the Chapel of the Good Samaritan, remained in use until a church could be built.  Historic Building  In 1889, Wallis Nash, a lawyer from England who came to Corvallis to work on the railroad, constructed the area's first Episcopal church on the corner of Jefferson and 7th (later moved to Madison and 7th) using materials salvaged from the original school chapel. The same year, Bishop Benjamin Wistar Morris proposed to name it the Church of the Good Samaritan, and the vestry approved. The building was designed in the Carpenter Gothic style. In 1960, after the congregation moved to a new facility, the original church was sold to the Elks and converted to secular use by the Corvallis Arts Center. In 1970, it was moved to a new location. In 1971, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  New Location  In 1961, the Church of the Good Samaritan laid the cornerstone of a new church building on the corner of Harrison and 35th. In 1963, it began negotiations with artist Gabriel Loire of Chartres, France, for a series of stained-glass chapel windows expressing the church's commitment to healing; the project was funded in part by physicians in the parish. In 1968, the church contracted an additional 49 windows for the main sanctuary, entitled \\"The Revelation of Truth from God through Human Personality.\\" References Category:Episcopal churches in Oregon ","title":"Episcopal Church of the Good Samaritan"},{"id":"32475786","text":"The Julian Hotel, located in Corvallis, Oregon, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Neurohydrodynamics is a division of neurophysics that focuses on the hydrodynamics of the neurological system. It applies physical principles and design concepts to neurophysics seeking to close the gap between fluid mechanics and neurosurgical and neurological medicine. It combines fluid mechanics principles with neuroscience to improve neurological disorder healthcare diagnosis, monitoring and therapy. Neurohydrodynamics investigates the role of intracranial fluid hydrodynamics (e.g. cerebrospinal fluid, cerebral blood flow, and interstitial fluid) in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders such as hydrocephalus, Chiari malformation, syringomyelia, pseudotumor cerebri, cerebral vasospasm, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and cerebral aneurysm. Neurohydrodynamics is an emerging discipline within neurophysics. Such an evolution is common as a new field transitions from being an interdisciplinary specialization among already-established fields, to being considered a field in itself. Much of the work in neurohydrodynamics consists of clinical research and in vitro or computational modeling, spanning a broad array of subfields. Prominent neurohydrodynamic applications include the development of cerebral shunts, lumbar-peritoneal shunts, intrathecal pumps, neural drug delivery systems and various diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants. Neurohydrodynamics relies heavily on neuroimaging modalities such as flow sensitized MRI. Founding figures  * Anthony Marmarou (deceased) - Nemuth Distinguished Professor and Vice Chair of Research in the Department of Neurosurgery, Medical College of Virginia Hospitals of Virginia Commonwealth University. Well known for his commitment to research on Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), Dr. Marmarou was considered a world authority on fluid dynamics within the brain and spinal cord. Dr. Marmarou was the recipient of the prestigious Javits Neuroscience Investigator Award from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. * Salom√≥n Hakim (June 4, 1929 in Barranquilla, Bogot√° - May 5, 2011) was a Colombian neurosurgeon, researcher, and inventor. A descendant of Lebanese immigrants, he is known for his work on neurosurgery and for the precursor of the modern valve treatment for hydrocephalus. * Hans Chiari (September 4, 1851 ‚àí 1916) was an Austrian pathologist who described in 1891 a brain malformation that is characterized by abnormalities in the region where the brain and spinal cord meet, and it causes part of the cerebellum to protrude through the foramen magnum (bottom of the skull) into the spinal canal. This was to be called the Arnold-Chiari malformation, named after Chiari and German pathologist, Julius Arnold (1835 ‚àí 1915). The malformation was given its name in 1907 by two of Dr. Arnold's students.

It is a collaborative effort between the local community of Spiti and professionals from diverse backgrounds. History Ecosphere was founded in 2006 by Sunil Chauhan & Ishita Khanna, an alumnus of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, as a combination of three non-governmental organisations‚ÄîMuse, Spiti Trans-Himalayan Action Group (STAG) and Spiti Seabuckthorn Society (SSS). Development initiatives Responsible travel Nestled in the Trans-Himalayan range are high altitude cold desert regions, whose landscape, scarce vegetation and fiercely cold winters with temperatures dipping below -30 degrees, make living here a challenge. Ecosphere‚Äôs travels offer an insight into the culture, nature, history, ecology and legends of these valleys, while ensuring that visits to these pristine locales benefit their economy, conservation and development. All emissions that are generated are calculated and offset through investments in Ecosphere‚Äôs renewable energy initiatives in the region, ensuring that all trips leave a zero carbon footprint in the Himalayas. Ecosphere‚Äôs responsible trips offer glimpses of Tibetan Buddhism and culture, stays in authentic homestays, Mountain biking, treks and hikes, mountaineering expeditions and rafting, Birding, floral and wildlife expeditions, Educational and volunteering tours, and Culinary, special interest and signature tours. Seabuckthorne products Ecosphere endeavors to combine traditional Buddhist systems of healing and health with modern science. The Seabuckthorn berry, popularly known as the ‚ÄòWonder berry‚Äô, has a unique composition of vitamins, minerals, nutrients and essential fatty acids, typically only found separately in other sources. In order to create sustainable livelihoods and empowerment for women in the region, Ecosphere has developed a range of products from this berry that grows naturally in the Himalayas, taking in- depth measures to preserve its nutritive properties. The propagation of Seabuckthorn also benefits this cold desert region ecologically, given its soil-binding and nitrogen-fixing nature. Local handicrafts The Himalayas are home to unique handicrafts like Thangkas (paintings on silken canvas), Zama (mud craft) and Lingzay (woven shawls with traditional motifs). Ecosphere has enabled local groups to preserve these traditional art forms, generate alternate sources of income and improve the quality and marketability of such products. Green energy Due to the extreme winter climate, the residents of the Trans-Himalayas burn a lot of coal, wood and dung to cook and keep warm in winters. However, using the abundant solar energy in the region, they can minimize fuel-wood consumption, and reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and health problems associated with excessive smoke. Ecosphere‚Äôs green energy initiatives include: \\\\- Promoting green houses so locals can access fresh vegetables round the year, generate additional income and improve their nutritional intake. \\\\- Providing energy-efficient housing solutions through Solar Passive techniques, which reduce fuel consumption by 60%, help to mitigate global warming, keep the inner air smokeless, reduce cold-related illnesses, and enable income generation via indoor activities like handicrafts. \\\\- Promoting renewable energy options like Solar Geysers, Solar Passive Baths, Cookers and Lanterns, to reduce fuel-wood consumption and carbon emissions, enabling local homes and traveler accommodations to be more eco-friendly and improving hygiene levels. Awards and recognition  CNN IBN Real Heroes Award 2010  See Real Heroes Award Ishita Khanna, founder of Ecosphere, received the real heroes award from CNN-IBN in 2010, for her initiatives in the Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh, including the Tsering tea initiative, which helps generate sustainable incomes for women in the region.  Virgin Holidays Responsible Tourism Award 2010  Ecosphere received the Virgin Holidays Responsible Tourism Award 2010 for the best organization in a mountain environment. Virgin Holidays recognized Ecosphere as a self-reliant social enterprise that moved from being donor funded to self-supporting, and in enabling 55 out of the 66 villages in Spiti increase their incomes by up to 50% through Ecosphere's development initiatives.  The Sierra Club ‚ÄòGreen Energy and Green Livelihoods Achievement Award‚Äô 2009  In 2009, the Sierra Club, the oldest and largest grassroots environmental organization in the US, recognized Ecosphere for developing sustainable livelihoods for the local community and linking it to nature and culture conservation.  The Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy 2009  Ecosphere received the coveted Ashden Award - Global Energy Award Winners 2009, as a collaborator in the consortium of NGOs from Spiti and Ladakh, in a special ceremony held in London. The award was presented by Prince Charles.

The dam, built by the Kyushu Electric Power Co, Ltd. in 1938, was commissioned only in 1993. When built to a height of it was the highest gravity type dam in Japan, only to be surpassed later by the Kamishiba Dam raised in the uppermost reaches of the Mimi River. Geography The dam is located on the Mimi River which rises in the Kyushu mountain range. The river flows through a gorge section. The catchment area drained at the dam site is and is highly forested to the extent of 95%, whereas the agricultural area is only 1%. The river catchment lies in a temperate climatic zone. There is cascade of six dams built on the river with two dams in the upstream basin of the Tsukabaru Dam and three dams (Yamasubaru Dam, Saigo Dam, and Ouchibaro Dam) downstream of it. The uppermost dam is the Kamishiba Dam, the first arch dam in Japan which is the largest on the river followed by the Iwayado Dam. Features Tsukabaru Dam, a concrete masonry gravity dam is in height and has a length of at the crest. The gross storage of the reservoir created by the dam is 34,326,000 cubic meters and the live storage is 19,555,000 cubic meters. The reservoir has a water spread of and has an average depth of . The bridge over the dam has a particular design of its railing, and the identical turrets on both flanks of the dam give it an appearance of a medieval European castle or the Great Wall of China. In 2001, the dam was given the Early-Modern Civil Engineering heritage status by the Japan Society of Civil Engineering. In March 2004, the dam and Balgo and Morotsuka villages have been included in the List of Japan‚Äôs Registered Tangible Cultural Properties (Buildings). This inclusion was partly because of the heritage status as the first masonry gravity dam built in 1938, with unique features on the top of the dam, and the mechanized method of construction used for the first time. Energy generation from the hydroelectric power plant at the Tsukabaru Dam, operated by the Kyushu Electric Power Co., was 135,042 MWh in 2000, and the present and projected generation is 113,000 MWh. The Kyushu Electric Power Co., Inc. has assured that \\"it will maintain dam as a tourist resource and educational tool in cooperation with local governments.\\" Disaster management Typhoons in the upper region of the Mimi River basin have caused extensive debris of deadwood accumulation behind the Tsukabaru Dam and the two other on the upstream, which were flushed through the spillway structures of each dam. There were also large landslides in the vicinity of the dam requiring urgent attention to prevent vitiation of the storage behind the Tsukabaru Dam. Between August and September 2005, a temporary dam was created about downstream of the dam due to landslides. The amount of sediment deposited (including trees) was estimated at 3,250,000 cubic meters. An unusually high annual precipitation of 1000 mm has been recorded in recent years in the Kyushu region and assigned to climate change. Algal infestation and water quality Red tide algal blooms (blooms of single-celled algae) known as the Peridinium bipes, noticed to proliferate intensely at the Tsukabaru reservoir from the later part of the 1970s, is a serious environmental problem that has received due attention of the agency involved with the project. It is inferred that the algal development is not on account of eutrophication or unusual growth of plankton but is on account of accumulation of stable cyst on the surface of the reservoir caused due to the process of phototaxis at the inlet end of the reservoir and spread to cover the reservoir surface completely. Its annual occurrence was noted since 1990. This process created extensive cultivation of Peridinium bipes of dinoflagellate, which generated a foul smell and discolored the water surface area thus marring the scenic beauty of the reservoir. This necessitated instituting measures to eradicate the problem. Various alternative treatments were examined, such as cyclic aeration, treatment after collection, use of ozone and ultraviolet irradiation; the ultraviolet irradiation method has been chosen and put into practice. For this purpose a river craft was developed and named as \\"Red tide treatment ship\\". With the automated process operated from the ship, the red tides are eliminated almost completely using ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The irradiation process adopted involves pumping of surface water through irradiation chambers fitted on the boat, removal of organic material such as litter of leaves, and then subjecting the water surface to the UV irradiation. A nephelometer installed at the treatment facility provides feedback on the bloom density for adjustment of exposure time to UV radiation. The entire process takes about 5 hours and a success rate of 99% removal of the algae is reported, killing all cells over an initial treatment of two days. Unlike other methods of treatment, no chemical contamination is produced in the UV radiation process.

She entered the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them one and a half year before joining the Muskegon Lassies in the 1946 midseason. A good defensive outfielder with a strong throwing arm, she batted a .182 batting average in 117 games and reached the playoffs with Grand Rapids in 1945. In four postseason games, she went 4-for-15 for a .267 average.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book Following her baseball career, Elizabeth returned to Canada and worked as a newspaper office manager and a school secretary for many years. Her 60 year loving marriage lasted until Bill's death in 2005. They had one son, Bill Jr., and four grandchildren. Since 1988 she is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than individual baseball personalities. She also gained an honorary induction into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998.Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum Inductees Elizabeth Berthiaume Wicken died in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, at the age of 83 years.

He was labeled \\"The housewives champion\\" for his work in studying malnutrition and poverty.S. McLaurin, \\"The housewives' champion\\", Printability Publishing (1997) Life and career George Cuthbert Mura M'Gonigle was the only son of William M'Gonigle, vicar of Ellingham, Northumberland, UK. He trained at Newcastle upon Tyne Medical School, graduating from Durham University in 1910 (MD, 1913). From 1924 until his relatively early death from pneumonia in 1939, he was a general practitioner of medicine and served as Medical Officer of Health for Stockton-on-Tees, an industrial town which, during the Great Depression, suffered one of the worst unemployment rates in Britain, peaking at around 50%. M'Gonigle made it his life's work to document the effects of poverty on health. These focused on nutritional needs. Reports included Poverty, Nutrition and Public Health. This found that mortality rates increased when slum-dwellers were moved to new-built, healthier housing estates. This counter-intuitive finding was explained by poverty: M'Gonigle established that housewives could no longer afford a balanced diet for their families as household rents increased and income dwindled with unemployment. His book with John Kirby, Poverty and Public Health (1936) G.C.M.M'Gonigle and J.Kirby,\\"Poverty and Public Health\\" Victor Gollancz, London, 1936 brought these matters to the attention of politicians and social reformers, and set the Stockton studies in a broader context. The book summarized the poor state of health of the general population, drawing on government records. This highlighted the generally poor state of health of the English population. For instance, only around half the male population was fit for active military service in World War I. One third of children aged 5‚Äì12 (national survey, 1933) required medical treatment or observation for potential clinical conditions. Regional data showed health inequalities related to class, with the children from professional classes in Tyneside being both heavier and taller than those from the poorer areas. M'Gonigle and Kirby were among the first to point to the statistical correlation between income (and employment) and mortality. M'Gonigle's three major field studies in Stockton-on-Tees were also included. Thus, M'Gonigle and Kirby, using publicly available data together with empirical studies, demonstrated that \\"poverty, not ignorance, was the cause of morbidity and mortality amongst the poor and this poverty was not the fault of the individual families but of a society that provided inadequate wages and welfare benefits.\\" Reputation During his lifetime, M'Gonigle was recognized as a champion of public health, although his views did not accord with those of the medical establishment, and he was not honored by it. He became known to the general public with the publication of Poverty and Public Health.British Film Institute Enough to Eat? , 1936 http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/513824/index.html During the 1940s, his reputation was sustained, helped by a documentary film championing his work as Medical Officer of Health.One Man's Story http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/14101?view=synopsis The improvement in national nutritional standards through the 1940s-70s, especially through the provision of the National Health Service reflected the impact of his findings. He has been honored with a commemorative plaque in his home town.'The Housewives champion' However, his name did not figure widely in the history of public health until the 21st century. His reputation as a pioneer of public health is now being restored.Susan McLaurin, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, (2004) http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/60/101060875/Inauguration of the M'Gonigle Lecture Theatre, University of Durham, August 2012 http://www.dur.ac.uk/dialogue/signposts/staff/?itemno=15112'Frugal Food', Wellcome Trust, Wellcome library archive , 2010 http://wellcomelibrary.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/frugal-food.htmlP.Walker,\\"An unsung hero of public health\\" Health Matters, (2011) http://www.healthmatters.org.uk/?p=1021#more In 2012, Durham University named one of their medicine lecture theatres at Queens Campus, Stockton in honour of M'Gonigle and his work in the local area.

IBM Cloud includes infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) offered through public, private and hybrid cloud delivery models, in addition to the components that make up those clouds.  Overview  IBM cloud computing model IBM offers three hardware platforms for cloud computing. These platforms offer built-in support for virtualization. For virtualization IBM offers IBM Websphere application infrastructure that supports programming models and open standards for virtualization. The management layer of the IBM cloud framework includes IBM Tivoli middleware. Management tools provide capabilities to regulate images with automated provisioning and de- provisioning, monitor operations and meter usage while tracking costs and allocating billing. The last layer of the framework provides integrated workload tools. Workloads for cloud computing are services or instances of code that can be executed to meet specific business needs. IBM offers tools for cloud based collaboration, development and test, application development, analytics, business-to-business integration, and security.  History  IBM cloud computing emerged from the union of its mainframe computing and virtualization technologies. Known as the original virtualization company, IBM's first experiments in virtualization occurred in the 1960s with the development of the virtual machine (VM) on CP-40 and CP-67 operating systems. CP-67, a hypervisor used for software testing and development, enabled memory sharing across VMs while giving each user their own virtual memory space. With the machine partitioned into separate VMs, mainframes could run multiple applications and processes at the same time, making the hardware more efficient and cost-effective. IBM began selling VM technology for the mainframe in 1972. In February 1990, IBM released the RS/6000 (which later became known as POWER processor) based servers. The servers, in combination with the IBM mainframe, were built for complex and mission-critical virtualization. Power systems servers include PowerVM hypervisors with live partition mobility and active memory sharing. Live migration was introduced with POWER6 in May 2007. Next, IBM looked to implement standardization and automation in their technology in order to keep up with the proliferation of data produced by increasingly efficient hardware and data centers. This combination of virtualization, standardization and automation led to the development of IBM cloud computing. IBM began to develop a strategy for cloud computing in 2007, announcing that it planned to build clouds for enterprise clients and provide services to fill what it regarded as gaps in existing cloud environments. In October 2007, IBM announced a partnership with Google to promote cloud computing in universities. In addition to donating hardware and machines, the two companies also provided a curriculum to teach students about cloud computing. IBM claimed in April 2011 that 80% of Fortune 500 companies were using IBM cloud, and that their software and services were used by more than 20 million end-user customers, with clients including American Airlines, Aviva, Carfax, Frito-Lay, IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company, and 7-Eleven. On 4 June 2013 IBM announced its acquisition of SoftLayer, to form an IBM Cloud Services Division. By March 4, 2014 IBM acquired Cloudant.  IBM Cloud  The IBM SmartCloud brand includes infrastructure as a service, software as a service and platform as a service offered through public, private and hybrid cloud delivery models. IBM places these offerings under three umbrellas: SmartCloud Foundation, SmartCloud Services and SmartCloud Solutions. SmartCloud Foundation consists of the infrastructure, hardware, provisioning, management, integration and security that serve as the underpinnings of a private or hybrid cloud. Built using those foundational components, PaaS, IaaS and backup services make up SmartCloud Services. Running on this cloud platform and infrastructure, SmartCloud Solutions consist of a number of collaboration, analytics and marketing SaaS applications. IBM also builds cloud environments for clients that are not necessarily on the SmartCloud Platform. For example, features of the SmartCloud platform‚Äîsuch as Tivoli management software or IBM Systems Director virtualization‚Äîcan be integrated separately as part of a non-IBM cloud platform. The SmartCloud platform consists solely of IBM hardware, software, services and practices. IBM SmartCloud Enterprise and SmartCloud Enterprise+ compete with products like those of Rackspace and Amazon Web Services. Erich Clementi, vice president of Global Technology Services at IBM, said in 2012 that the goal with SmartCloud Enterprise and SmartCloud Enterprise+ was to provide an Amazon EC2-like experience primarily for test and development purposes and to provide a more robust experience for production workloads. In 2011, IBM SmartCloud integrated Hadoop-based InfoSphere BigInsights for big data, Green Hat for software testing and Nirvanix for cloud storage. In 2012, the then new CEO Virginia Rometty said the company planned to spend $20 billion on acquisitions by 2015. Users may build their own private cloud or purchase services hosted on the IBM cloud. Users may also purchase IBM hardware, software and services to build their customized cloud environment. By 2014, the name SmartCloud was replaced with products that have a prefix of IBM Cloud. A product called IBM Cloud Manager with OpenStack was IBM's integration of OpenStack along with a multitude of value additions that would serve enterprise customers. A product called IBM Cloud Orchestrator would serve the orchestration needs of an enterprise. The aforementioned SmartCloud products have been discontinued. By 2016, the aforementioned product called IBM Cloud Manager with OpenStack was discontinued, although the services organization may be using other versions of OpenStack for large scale cloud deployments. Public, private and hybrid cloud models IBM offers cloud delivery options including solely private cloud, solely public cloud, and variations in between. Private, public and hybrid clouds are not strictly distinct, as IBM allows the option to build a customized cloud out of a combination of public cloud and private cloud elements. Companies that prefer to keep all data and processes behind their own firewall can use private cloud services managed by their own IT staff. A company may also choose pay-as-you- go pricing. Hybrid cloud options allow for some processes to be hosted and managed by IBM, while others are kept on a private cloud or on a VPN or VLAN. IBM also offers planning and consultation throughout the deployment process. IBM offers five cloud provision models: * Private cloud, owned and operated by the customer * Private cloud, owned by the customer, but operated by IBM (or another provider) * Private cloud, owned and operated by IBM (or another provider) * Virtual private cloud services (based on multi-tenanted support for individual enterprises) * Public cloud services (based on the provision of functions to individuals) The majority of cloud users choose a hybrid cloud model, with some workloads being served by internal systems, some from commercial cloud providers and some from public cloud service providers. On August 25, 2011, IBM announced the release of a new hybrid cloud model orchestrated by IBM WebSphere Cast Iron integration of on- and off-premises resources. Enterprises can use Cast Iron integration to link their public cloud appliances‚Äî hosted on environments like Amazon EC2, Google Apps, Salesforce.com, Oracle CRM, SugarCRM and a number of others‚Äîto their existing systems or in-house, private cloud environments. Cast Iron Integration aims to reduce the time and effort needed for customized coding, in favor of simple workload provisioning through Tivoli Management Framework. The IBM public cloud offering, SmartCloud Enterprise, was launched on April 7, 2011. SCE is hosted IaaS with service level agreements (SLA)s, and can be offered in a private, public or hybrid model. The environment is hosted on IBM servers (System p or System x), with a standard set of software images to choose from. For customers who perceive that the security risk of cloud computing adoption is too high, IBM offers private cloud services. IDEAS International wrote in a white paper, \\"IBM believes that its clients are currently more comfortable with private clouds than public or hybrid clouds, and that many are ready to deploy fundamental business applications in private clouds.\\" For building strictly private clouds, IBM offers IBM Workload Deployer and Cloudburst as ready-to-deploy, ‚Äúcloud in a box.‚Äù Cloudburst provides blade servers, middleware and virtualization for an enterprise to build its own cloud-ready virtual machines. Workload Deployer connects an enterprise's existing servers to virtualization components and middleware in order to help deploy standardized virtual machines designed by IBM. For customers who prefer to perform their own integration of private clouds, IBM offers a choice of hardware and software building blocks, along with recommendations and a reference architecture, prior to deployment. Clients may choose from IBM virtualization-enabled servers, middleware and SaaS applications.  Cloud standards  IBM participates in several cloud standards initiatives within various standards development organizations involved in cloud service models IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, all of which work toward improvements in cloud interoperability and security. IBM is a member of The Open Group, a council that works for the development of open, vendor-neutral IT standards and certifications. Other members of the group include HP, Oracle, SAP and numerous others. IBM contributed the Cloud Computing Reference Architecture in February 2011 to The Open Group as the basis of an industry-wide cloud architecture. IBM's CCRA is based on real-world input from many cloud implementations across IBM. It is intended to be used as a blueprint/guide for architecting cloud implementations, driven by functional and non-functional requirements of the respective cloud implementation. HP and Microsoft have also published Cloud Computing Reference Architectures. Within the IaaS space, IBM is a member of the Cloud Management Work Group (CMWG) within the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF), which released a draft version of their IaaS APIs, called the Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI), on September 14, 2011. The CIMI APIs define a logical model for the management of resources within the Infrastructure as a Service domain. With these APIs, clients can create, manage and connect machines, volumes and networks. For PaaS and SaaS standards, IBM, Red Hat, Cisco, Citrix, EMC and others contribute to the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) technical committee within Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), which aims to provide a standardized way of managing the lifecycle of cloud services, for portability of cloud based applications. TOSCA's goal is to advance an interoperability standard that will make it easier to deploy cloud applications without vendor lock-in, while maintaining application requirements for security, governance, and compliance. IBM participates in a number of cloud security related standards including the DMTF Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) working group, and the OASIS Identity in the Cloud (IDCloud) technical committee. CADF is designed to address the need for a cloud provider to provide specific audit event, log and report information on a per-tenant and application basis. IDCloud aims to addresses the serious security challenges posed by identity management in cloud computing and investigates the need for profiles to achieve interoperability within current standards. IBM founded the Cloud Standards Customer Council (CSCC) in April 2011, with the Object Management Group (OMG) Kaavo, Rackspace and Software AG, as an end user advocacy group that aimed to accelerate adoption of cloud services and eliminate barriers to security and interoperability associated with the transition to the cloud. In addition to contributing standards requirements to various standards development organizations (SDO), the CSCC also creates guides that companies can use on their own path to cloud adoption.

Corruption in the form of bribery was common, primarily due to the paucity of goods and services on the open market. Ideology Soviet criminology was significantly influenced by the works of Stalinist prosecutor Andrey Vyshinsky who introduced a number of measures into the penal code and investigatory practice that were unusual in other legal systems. Law was to be perceived not as means of determining individual guilt but dialectically and as part of broader class struggle. Based on that premise, people could be convicted even with absence of actual crime but if they merely belonged to a vaguely defined bourgeois class or if their conviction would be broadly beneficial for the revolutionary movement. Apart from this judicial practice, the penal code of USSR contained a number of very specific crimes generally classified as \\"counter-revolutionary\\", such as contacts with foreigners or any other kind of opposition or criticism of the communist party. Article 70 listed \\"anti-Soviet propaganda\\". Article 83 - \\"illegally leaving USSR\\". Article 190-1 punished dissemination, \\"in verbal form\\", of \\"knowingly false\\" statements, defaming USSR or its social structure. Speculation, defined as any form of private trade with intent to make profit, was also a crime per article 154 of the Penal Code of USSR. Article 162 made a crime engaging in \\"banned\\" crafts or forms of employment. A basic premise of Marxism is that crime is a socio- economic phenomenon: Some Marxist theorists contended that the most immediate reasons for crime in the Soviet Union were mental retardation, poor upbringing, and capitalist influence. This led to novel inventions in the field of psychiatry (\\"delusion of reformism\\", sluggish schizophrenia) used as an instrument of repression against critics. Punishment In 1989 the Soviet Union had few prisons. About 99% of convicted criminals served their sentences in labor camps, supervised by the Main Directorate for Corrective Labor Camps which was under the MVD. The camps had four regimes of ascending severity. In the strict-regime camps, inmates worked at the most difficult jobs, usually outdoors, and received meager rations. Jobs were less demanding and rations better in the camps with milder regimes. The system of corrective labor was regarded by Soviet authorities successful in that the rate of recidivism was quite low. Prisons and labor camps, in the views of former inmates and Western observers, however, were notorious for their harsh conditions, arbitrary and sadistic treatment of prisoners, and flagrant human rights abuses. In 1989 new legislation, which emphasized rehabilitation rather than punishment, was being drafted to \\"humanize\\" the special system. Nevertheless, in 1989 conditions for many prisoners had changed little. Relocation of petty criminals outside of large cities was also quite common practice of crime management. Death Penalty The death penalty, carried out by shooting, was applied in the Soviet Union only in cases of treason, espionage, terrorism, sabotage, certain types of murder, and large-scale theft of state property by officials. Otherwise, the maximum punishment for a first offender was fifteen years. Parole was permitted in some cases after completion of half of the sentence, and periodic amnesties sometimes also resulted in early release. Collapse of the Soviet Union Near and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, crime statistics moved sharply and uniformly upward. From 1991 to 1992, the number of officially reported crimes and the overall crime rate each showed a 27 percent increase; the crime rate nearly doubled between 1985 and 1992. By the early 1990s, theft, burglary, and other acts against property accounted for about two-thirds of all crime in Russia. Of particular concern to citizens, however, was the rapid growth of violent crime, including gruesome homicides. Large parts of the Penal Code concerning crimes such as private trade (art. 154), criticism of the communist party and other political crimes (art. 58) were revoked in 1993.

The Fali are composed of four major groups, each corresponding to a geographic region: The Bossoum Fali, the Kangou Fali, the Peske‚ÄìBori Fali, and the Tingelin Fali. The Fali in Cameroon have been described as being centered on Garoua as well as the rocky plateaus and peaks of the Adamawa mountains in the country's north. The Fali are sometimes referred to as the Kirdi, meaning \\"pagan,\\" a term given by the neighboring Muslim Fulani; after they fought against the jihadists and rejected Islam. Today the Fali in Mubi North Adamawa state are predominantly Christians.Steven Nelson, From Cameroon to Paris: Mousgoum Architecture In and Out of Africa (2007). University of Chicago Press: p. 155. The term Fali is from a Fula word meaning \\"perched,\\" a reference to how Fali compounds appear on the sides of mountains.\\"Fali,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2011). The Fali in Nigeria primarily live in the Mubi District, Mubi Division of the former Gongola State. The Fali speak various unrelated languages. The Fali primarily engage in farming and hunting. Major crops include millet, chickpeas, peanuts (groundnuts), squash, tobacco, okra, and cotton. The Fali are exogamous, patrilineal, and hierarchical, with society being made up of clans with distinct territories and chiefs, and tracing their origin to a common ancestor. They observe virilocal residence. The Fali people trace their ancestry to the Ngomma, who founded the ancient capital of Timpil. Other accounts trace the Fali's origins to the Sao civilization on Lake Chad, which flourished from the tenth to the 16th centuries. The original Fali religion is traditional African. It has been identified as monotheistic, involving belief in a creator god, Muttaf, and a mother goddess, Ona, the Earth. Followers of the Fali religion make prayers and offerings to ancestors to intercede with Faw on behalf of the living. The Fali \\"conceive of Muttaf not only as creator and organizer, but also as a just God who is undepictable by human intelligence.\\" The religion also includes belief in supernatural beings, including genies, sacred crocodiles, and the black snake, the master of darkness. By 2009, increasing numbers of Fali were Christians although many converts maintain syncretic beliefs. The total population of Fali is over 250,000 people, with 99 percent being Christians (in Nigeria) and the remainder being Muslims and traditional believers. The dominant churches in Fali Land are Catholic, Baptist and EYN with few Pentecostal churches coming up in recent days. Cissus quadrangularis is significant to Fali in Cameroon, and the Fali are reported to wash their dead in a decoction of the plant.Hans Dieter Neuwinger, African Ethnobotany, Poisons and Drugs: Chemistry, Pharmacology, Toxicology (1996). CRC Press: p. 33. The Fali believe that the development of the plants is important to fertility; a C. quadrangularis is planted on proposed construction sites, and if the plant does not flourish, a new site is chosen.

The objective of the organization is to strengthen the regional network of parliamentarians who are committed to implementing the population and development agenda, particularly the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD PoA) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). AFPPD aims to achieve this through capacity building for parliamentarians and National Committees.  Background  With initiative from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), AFPPD was established in 1981 at the Asian Conference of Parliamentarians on Population and Development held in Beijing to promote the involvement of lawmakers in the Asia-Pacific region in addressing population and development issues such as sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), family planning, gender equality, active ageing, youth issues, urbanization, migration and HIV/AIDS. AFPPD envisions a world where demographic changes and population issues are taken into account in planning for sustainable development. AFPPD aims to realize its vision through parliamentary work by: * Advocating for and formulating/amending policies and legislation that promote reproductive health and rights, gender equality and women‚Äôs empowerment, investing in youth, active ageing, Universal Health Coverage (UHC), and other population and development issues; * Holding governments accountable for their commitments and implementation; * Advocating for increased financial resources in these areas. AFPPD provides capacity development support to its members, facilitating their networking at the national, regional and global levels. The organization is governed by the General Assembly; managed by the Executive Committee; advised by three Standing Committees on its strategic priorities; and supported by the Secretariat located in Bangkok, Thailand. As of April 2016, AFPPD consists of 29 member National Committees of Parliamentarians on Population and Development in Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Cook Islands, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tonga, and Vietnam. AFPPD is the oldest regional parliamentarian forum on population and development. It has been registered as an international nongovernmental organization, with the Ministry of Labour, Government of Thailand, since October 1994. As a recipient of the 2010 UN Population Award, AFPPD has the highest consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).  Standing Committees   Standing Committee on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment  The establishment of the Standing Committee‚Äôs main purpose is to share knowledge, advocate and exchange experiences among its members to advance gender equality and women‚Äôs empowerment across the region.

The first part aired on July 17, 2011, and the second part aired on July 24, 2011. Part 1 was written by Joel Anderson Thompson and part 2 was written by Melinda Hsu Taylor, both episodes were directed by Sergio Mimica-Gezzan.  Plot   Part 1  Anne, while examining a young boy, is held at gunpoint by the boy's father who asks for medicine. Anne fills up a bag with drugs but fights back. The man hits her and takes the bag. Tom, Weaver and Mike go after the family to convince them to stay. They fire back but are stopped by Terry Clayton, a member of the 7th Mass. The family runs away and gives back the medicine. Clayton meets with Tom, Weaver and Mike, all of whom seem to know him. Clayton tells them that the 7th Mass is no more as they were attacked by Skitters. Clayton tells them that he must take the kids of the 2nd Mass because Skitters are on their way and a move from the school is necessary. Tom is very reluctant against this move. Margaret, while getting medication from Anne for her friend, Sarah, gives Anne a gun for future protection and offers a shooting lesson. Ben seems to be recovering well as he performs 102 push-ups without breaking a sweat. He tells Matt that the Skitters cared for the kids and weren‚Äôt monsters, but a family. Hal overhears this conversation, seeming concerned. Hal addresses his concerns about Ben to Anne, telling her that Ben is like a different kid. Anne talks to Tom about Ben but Tom doesn‚Äôt see a problem with his son. Tom then tells her that he doesn‚Äôt want to take Clayton up on his offer. Jimmy asks Weaver if he can be put back in rotation. Weaver allows him to go on lookout with Parker. Anne takes Margaret up on her offer and goes shooting with her. Clayton talks to worried parents about his offer. He tells them that it is a ‚Äútemporary measure‚Äù. Tom interjects, still seemingly against the idea. Jimmy goes out on lookout with Parker, who sits alone in an abandoned school bus. A Mech quickly comes and kills Parker. The Mech‚Äôs fire alerts the soldiers. Jimmy is almost killed but manages to escape. Weaver, while looking for Jimmy, finds Parker‚Äôs body in the bus. Jimmy is attacked inside by a Skitter. Tom and Weaver hear him scream and they go to help. Before the Skitter can kill Jimmy, Weaver shoots it. Jimmy begins to cry and a reluctant Weaver comforts him. Clayton talks to Weaver and Tom after the attack and tells them that the next attack could happen soon. Weaver tells Tom that Clayton‚Äôs offer has to be reconsidered. Tom agrees. Ben is verbally attacked by an angry citizen who calls him a ‚Äúrazor-back‚Äù and the Skitters are attacking because of kids like him. Hal defends his brother and threatens the man. Ben goes to see his father. Tom asks Ben if he is happy to be back and Ben tells him that he is. Ben tells his father that he wants to go with Clayton to ease his father‚Äôs burden. Tom then goes and speaks to parents of the 2nd Mass, telling them that he is allowing Ben and Matt to go with Clayton and urges everyone else to follow. Ben looks at a picture of him and his family on holiday. He gives it to Hal and tells him that he can return it later. Later, Hal tells Tom that he wants to go with Clayton to look out for Ben and Matt. He tells Tom that the last time he saw his mother, she urged him and Ben to look out for each other. Hal says that he owes his mother the courtesy of keeping his promise. Outside the school, children of the 2nd Mass prepare to leave with Clayton. They go out on foot to a Ranch. Later that night, Eli, the young boy whose father attacked Anne, tells Clayton that he wants to see his parents. Clayton takes Eli to the woods where he is met by a ‚Äúharnessed‚Äù girl who tells him that she can take Eli to his family. Eli becomes frantic as he notices her ‚Äúharness‚Äù. A Skitter and a Mech come and shoot Eli unconscious. They communicate with Clayton using the girl. Clayton goes back to the Ranch, revealing an imprisoned Pope: Clayton beat the information out of Pope on where to find the 2nd Mass and their kids.  Part 2  The children of the 2nd Mass, now at Clayton's \\"Sanctuary\\" play a game of football (soccer). During an interval, Tessa, a member of the Sanctuary, is called by her father telling her to remember why the others are here. Later, Terry Clayton and Tessa's father go out to a hidden barn, where their prisoner, John Pope, is being held. Pope was forced to give up important information about the 2nd Mass, which allowed Clayton to win their trust. Clayton leaves and Pope, who has already used a piece of broken glass to cut the ropes that were binding him, knocks out Tessa's father but decides not to kill him. As he escapes he notices two dead bodies lying behind the barn. Tom becomes frustrated as the 2nd Mass have received no word from Clayton in 48 hours, seen no sign of the 3rd Mass nor the escorts. Weaver isn't happy that Tom is leaving with Dai on motorbikes to look for the kids, but he orders the pair to return to base camp that night. Back at the Sanctuary, Lourdes spots a backpack belonging to Eli Russell, a child from the 2nd Mass whom Clayton lured into the forest in the previous episode. She secretly meets with Hal and Mike about the backpack she found. Mike states that he trusts Clayton, however he later searches the locked barn and finds a pile of Eli's clothes. Clayton finds him and pulls a gun on him. He tells Mike how horrible it was to witness the 7th Mass be taken down. Clayton says that one of the kids, a girl named Megan, fell behind and was taken by Skitters. After that, the aliens left his team alone for a week. Clayton describes the behavior as though the Skitters were thanking them for Megan, for handing over one of their own. Clayton explains to Rick that like soldiers in a human army, each detachment of Skitters has its own assigned regions and sectors, and each has its own quotas to fill; in their case, the number of human children they are expected to capture and harness. The force of Skitters that nearly wiped out the 7th Mass decided that if their quota was being met or even surpassed, it didn't really matter to them that the remaining handful of the 7th Mass and their families were still free. So the Skitters offered Clayton an arrangement in which he'd collaborate with them, let the remnant of the 7th mass serve as a trap to quietly collect refugee human children, and in return the Skitters would leave his men and their families alone. Mike decides that it's time for the 2nd Mass to leave the Sanctuary. Hal realizes that Tessa knew about the plan the entire time, and she alerts her father and the rest of the men that the sacrificial kids are escaping. They run into the night with only an armed Mike and Hal to defend the group, while Hal takes Rick and leads the rest of the kids to safety. Before they leave, Mike tells Rick how much he loves him. Clayton comes behind Mike with a gun. In the forest, Hal hears a gunshot, implying that Clayton killed Mike. The next day, the 2nd Mass children wander into an unfamiliar area and break into an abandoned house. Ben believes he should move on ahead of the group, since he's not tired and can move faster. Hal agrees with his younger brother and tells him to follow the highway, back to the school base camp. Tom and Dai spot Ben on the road, and Ben tells his father about what's going on. The men from the Sanctuary have found Hal and children, and demand they give themselves up. Hal opens fire on the soldiers, while Lourdes leads the kids out the back. Pope defends Hal by shooting one of Clayton's men. He gets shot right before he notices Tom hiding among the trees. Tom walks up to the men and tells them that Porter is on the way. He offers himself as a hostage to spare the lives of the kids. He tells Hal to come out of the house, and they all become prisoners of Clayton's. They are escorted back to the Sanctuary but Weaver and other 2nd Mass soldiers have arrived. Clayton's and his men give up, but Clayton, in an attempt to kill Hal, is shot by Tom. In the final scene, the 2nd Mass offer a military funeral for Mike, who sacrificed his own life to keep his son and the other children alive. Tom says a few words in honor of his slain friend, and Rick receives the folded American flag at the funeral. He tells Ben that its in mankind's nature to kill and that \\"we\\" would never do that, implying that Rick now identifies as part of the skitter race. He then turns to Ben and tells him that Ben should feel the same way.  Reception   Ratings  In its original American broadcast, \\"Sanctuary Part 1\\" was seen by an estimated 4.27 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received a 1.4 rating among viewers between ages 18 and 49. \\"Sanctuary Part 2\\" was seen by an estimated 4.07 million viewers. The episode received a 1.4 rating among viewers between ages 18 and 49.  Reviews  Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, stating, \\"OK, this? THIS? This is what Falling Skies should be, people. Maybe it‚Äôs an anomaly, and we‚Äôll go back to mediocre basics next week. Maybe it‚Äôs the show finally learning what works and what doesn‚Äôt. Maybe it‚Äôs the story finally kicking into gear after weeks of world building. That television shows often come less than fully formed isn‚Äôt a revolutionary or unique observation. But when a show takes the leap from ‚Äúhaving potential‚Äù to ‚Äúliving up to it,‚Äù that‚Äôs something great to behold. Again: there‚Äôs no guarantee that ‚ÄúSanctuary, Part 1‚Äù is the new base standard for Falling Skies. But if it were to be that standard? I‚Äôd stand up and declare myself a fan of a show that‚Äôs largely disappointed me up until this point.\\" In his review for Part 2, McGee gave the episode a lower score of C, stating, \\"Last week, I annoyed more than a few by declaring that Falling Skies had potentially turned a corner with ‚ÄúSanctuary, Part 1.‚Äù I‚Äôm not in the habit of defending reviews or getting into the relatively arbitrary nature of grading individual episodes, but for those that have occasionally accused me of being a plant for a show they consider to be terrible, look no further than here to see that can‚Äôt possibly be true. Because if ‚ÄúSanctuary, Part 1‚Äù showed the best elements of this show, than ‚ÄúSanctuary, Part 2‚Äù amply demonstrated the show‚Äôs weakest aspects. The ideas are still solid, but the execution was put on autopilot for this hour.\\"  References  Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Falling Skies (season 1) episodes ","title":"Sanctuary (Falling Skies)"},{"id":"32476483","text":"Nonprimary motor cortex is a functionally defined portion of the frontal lobe. It includes two subdivisions, the premotor cortex and the supplementary motor cortex. Largely coincident with the cytoarchitecturally defined area 6 of Brodmann (human), it is located primarily in the rostral portion of the precentral gyrus and caudal portions of the superior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus, It aids in cerebral control of movement. Anatomically speaking, several nonmprimary areas exist, and make direct connections with the spinal cord.  Function  The nonprimary motor cortex exerts its motor control at a higher neural level than the primary motor cortex by commanding the laterality of muscular motor response to the brain. This is carried out by afferent nerves from the nonprimary motor cortex synapsing at the primary motor cortex. Both divisions of the nonprimary motor cortex receive inputs from the thalamus and are responsible for sensory guidance and motor preparation.  Supplementary Motor Cortex  The supplementary portion receives inputs from the thalamus. The thalamic nuclei supplying the supplementary motor cortex are distinct from those enervating the primary motor cortex. (Trends in Neurosciences) It is located above the cingulate sulcus inside the anterior paracentral lobule.  Premotor Cortex  Neural information to the premotor cortex is supplied by the cerebellum. It is located dorsally in and around the precentral sulcus. Laterally, this exists at the dorso-ventral level of the hand in the motor cortex. A ventral region may also exist, but its exact anatomical location is disputed. Like the primary motor cortex, corticospinal tracts begin in the premotor area.

In 1809, just after the French Revolution, Napoleon asked the famous French painter David to develop a new design of the Paris pattern. This deck was however not accepted. In 1811 Gatteaux adapted the design and it was produced until 1853. In 1813 Gatteaux made a new design which eventually became the new base Paris pattern This continued to be the standard Paris pattern until now. The only change that was made hereafter was that it became a design with double honour cards instead of single ones.

It contains one of the most important collections of its type in Mexico, covering traditions from around the country as well as the artesan√≠a and traditions of the state of Colima. Institution The museum is part of the University of Colima, north of the historic center of the city of Colima. It is part of a complex called the IUBA, which also houses the Pablo Silva Gar√≠a forum and the Explanada del Artesano (Artisan Esplanade) on the corner of Gabino Barreda and Manuel Gallardo Zamora streets in the La Atrevida neighborhood. The building was designed by architect Joaqu√≠n V√°zquez Agraz and modeled after the traditional houses of the city. It is two stories, centered on an open courtyard which is surrounded by corridors supported by arches behind which are rooms. The museum's collection is housed in these rooms and corridors, with the courtyard area filled with chairs and tables for visitors. The institution hosts an important permanent collection of Mexican handcrafts and folk art, called artesan√≠a, with the major branches of this tradition from all regions of the country represented. Notable artisans with works on display here include Guillermo R√≠os, Emilio Pinto, Pancho Mu√±oz and the Terr√≠quez and Morf√≠n families. The museum also promotes the artesan√≠a and regional traditions of the state of Colima. The handcrafts of Colima were shaped by Spanish colonialism and by the crafts of other regions of Mexico such as the Talavera pottery tradition of Puebla and the barro negro pottery tradition of Oaxaca. For this reason, a wide variety of handcrafts are produced in the state. The museographers of the institution have included Ma. Teresa Pomar A., Imelda de Le√≥n, Socorro S√°nchez Murgu√≠a and Jos√© Antonio Enciso N√∫√±ez, the current director. On the upper floor, there are rooms dedicated to temporary exhibitions of works by artisans, many of which are themed in accordance to the time of year. In 2011, the museum sponsored an exhibit dedicated to marionettes, which have a place in Mexico's tradition of oral storytelling. Services that the museum offers include a library with books and video related to handcrafts and the traditions of Colima. There are educational programs, guided tours and a workshop to make bru√±ido pottery. There is a gift shop. The museum has sponsored events to promote local artisans and works with the university providing cultural activities in which students can participate for credit. This includes participating in workshops such as those for producing ceramics, given by Guillermo R√≠os. Maria Teresa Pomar The museum has recently added the name of Mar√≠a Teres Pomar to its official title. Pomar founded the museum as part of a long career dedicated to the promotion of Mexican artesan√≠a. She began her career as an artesania collector with pieces from many traditions filling her home. She promoted the viewing of her collection encouraging people to appreciate the traditions behind the objects. She donated items to museums in Mexico and to the Museo de Arte Popular of Sao Paulo, Brazil. She was one of the founders of the Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesan√≠as as well as POPULART, AC, the organization behind the creation of the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City. In 2006, she received the Premio Estatal de Artes Diego Rivera (Diego Rivera State Arts Prize) from the state of Colima. Pomar died at the age of 90 in Mexico City in January 2010. Collection The museum has one of Mexico's important handicraft and folk art collections. Its collection includes utensils, religious and ceremonial items, and decorations. All the major branches of Mexican artesan√≠a are represented including woodworking, textiles and other weaving, leather- working, paper crafts, ceramics, metalworking, traditional toys, and jewelry making. There are spaces dedicated to folk paintings, especially those related to the indigenous groups of Mexico. The Sala Colima contains costumes used for the dances and processions that are practiced in the state with masks, musical instruments and more. It includes a representation of a traditional wedding from the north of the state. Another feature are ‚Äúmojigangas‚Äù which are used during charreada and bullfight events in Villa de √Ålvarez. The Sala de la Laca, or lacquer ware room, is dedicated to wood and other items that have been painted with lacquer to protect them from the area's humidity. Items on display include furniture, chests, gourds and other containers for food and other objects. These items are part of a craft tradition which extends from Michoac√°n and Guerrero into Colima, Oaxaca and Chiapas. The room contains some non-lacquered wood items, demonstrating the woodworking traditions of the Seris, Tarahumaras and Nahuas. The Textile Room features shawls called rebozos, especially those from Santa Maria del R√≠o in San Luis Potos√≠, made on backstrap and European pedal looms. Many of these are colored with natural dyes and elaborately embroidered. The Sala de Fibras Vegetales (Vegetable Fiber Room) focuses on basketry and other objects such as mats and hats. The materials used vary greatly from stiff branches to soft reeds. Leatherworking, amate paper, folk art, and more are displayed in the largest room of the buildings. It contains huarache sandals, belts, bags, amate paper cutouts used for ceremonial purposes from San Pablito Pahuatlan, Puebla. Ceramics traditions from San Bartolo Coyotepec, Metepec, Tonal√°, Tlaxcala, Veracruz, Guanajuato, Michoac√°n and other places are represented. Traditional toys and festival items are represented by Judas figures from the State of Mexico, dolls and miniature items made from wood and clay. Metalworking is mostly represented by articles from Oaxaca such as lead soldier figures and traditional tools. There is a display of objects made of seashell and snail shell by Socorro Sanchez.

He has graduated from Mumbai University, and although he didn't have any formal training in theatre, he has worked extensively with Satyadev Dubey, who considers him one of his foremost prot√©g√©s. In 1985, Shanbag founded the theatre company Arpana. Its work is characterised by \\"contemporary and original texts by Indian and international playwrights (in translation), strong performances, minimalist staging, and innovative use of music and design.\\" Plays Scene from a popular 2007 play \\"Cotton 56 Polyester 84\\" by Sunil Shanbag about life in Girangaon In 2007, Shanbag directed the critically acclaimed Cotton 56, Polyester 84 which won three META awards at the Mahindra Theatre Festival, including Best Original Script for its writer, Ramu Ramanathan. The play is a celebration of Mumbai, through the culture spawned by rapid industrialisation, specially in the mills of Girangaon. In 2010, Shanbag opened the play S*x M*rality & Cens*rship. The play revolves around the censorship woes faced by Vijay Tendulkar's Sakharam Binder in Mumbai in 1974, juxtaposing this against the sanitising of tamasha traditions by middle-class conservatism. The play was funded by a grant from the India Foundation for the Arts and underwent research and rehearsals for almost a year. Ultimately, it was nominated for nine awards at the META Awards, with supporting actress Geetanjali Kulkarni finally winning for her performance. Also in 2010, through his play Dreams of Taleem, Shanbag tried to cope with the death of playwright Chetan Datar by incorporating Datar's play 1, Madhavbaug in a narrative that dealt with the isolation felt by its gay protagonists. According to The Hindu, it did not seem to ask any new questions in the areas of theatre and sexuality, \\"despite its strong performances and a script that was otherwise quite seamless.\\" In 2011, Shanbag presented his musical, Stories in a Song. The show was conceived by noted classical vocalist Shubha Mudgal and percussionist Aneesh Pradhan for the 2011 Baaja Gaaja festival in Pune. According to Mumbai Mirror, the stories in the play \\"reflected the socio-historical times in which they happened, and are lightly lined with satirical or sympathetic comment.\\" In 2012, Shanbag was invited to perform a Gujarati adaptation of All's Well That Ends Well as part of the Globe to Globe festival in London, in which all 37 of Shakespeare's plays were performed in 37 different languages at Shakespeare's Globe. The play was well received in the UK press, with The Guardian giving it a four-star rating, and the Arts Desk stating, \\"Shakespeare's problem play is solved by a buoyant Gujarati staging from Mumbai.\\" Titled Maro Piyu Gayo Rangoon in India, the play had previously premiered in Mumbai, with veteran theatre critic Shanta Gokhale describing it as \\"a truly remarkable achievement\\". In 2014, the play was invited back to the Globe for another run of shows in a month that marked the 450th birth anniversary of Shakespeare. Films Shanbag has worked with Shyam Benegal and was a co-author, along with Shama Zaidi, for the television serials Yatra and Bharat Ek Khoj. In 1993, he produced Maihar Raag, which won the National Film Award for Best Non-Feature Film in 1994. In 2009, Shanbag directed the short film, The Sword and the Spear, which was based on an international tour undertaken by contemporary dancer Astad Deboo and his troupe of Thang-ta martial arts performers from Manipur.

It is essentially a clone of the popular video game Gauntlet where players controlled fantasy characters from a top down view. Unlike Gauntlet, each of the characters is given their own viewport onto the dungeon and can explore independently. Gameplay Dunjunz on the BBC Micro Up to four players are able to play simultaneously, sharing the keyboard to control their characters (ranger, wizard, barbarian, and female warrior). Each player views their character's progress via one of four viewports that divide the screen. As their character leaves a room, the viewport changes to show the new room. The objective is to reach the exit on each level, or the chalice on level 25, avoiding or killing enemies, collecting treasure and upgrades, and opening doors with the appropriate keys. Additionally, items of food can be collected to restore health, potions can be used to either increase or diminish health, and crucifixes will reanimate the most recently killed character, making it possible for players knocked out of the game to rejoin the action. If at least one character leaves the current level via the exit then all characters will be restored on the next level, but those that died will return with their initial attributes. As in Gauntlet, each of the characters starts with their own particular strengths and weaknesses. For example, the barbarian can initially fire only one axe at a time, but it carries the maximum amount of damage a projectile can have. During the course of the game, the characters will achieve parity in armour, damage and number of projectiles. However, only the ranger and wizard are able to cast a spell to destroy all enemies on screen, and the per-use cost of this in health is fixed throughout the game. On the Acorn Electron, a screen mode with a reduced colour palette was used, enabling the game to run as quickly as the BBC Micro version. Graphical niceties, such as the character status displays and the exit animations, are not present in this version. As with other Electron games, sound effects are limited by the capabilities of the Electron but are generally similar to those of the BBC Micro version. The BBC Micro disk version also includes a level editor that allows existing levels to be edited and new levels to be created.

She was also historically known as Chac Nik Ye (\\"Lady of Palenque\\"), from the family of Pacal the Great. Yax Ahau Xoc was a princess of Lakamha, and the daughter of Lord K'inich Hanaab Pacal II. Her only known sibling was her brother, K'uk Balaam (\\"Quetzal Jaguar\\"), who was Lord of Lakamha after his father. The name and origin of her mother is unknown. In her early teens, she married Lord Yik'in Chan K'awlil and bore him a son, Yax Pasaj Chan Yopat. Her husband died in 763 AD after thirteen years of marriage and her young son was crowned Lord of Copan. Yax Pasaj Chan Yopat reigned for fifty-seven years as the last ruler of Copan. By the end of his reign, tension between the upper and lower classes as well as inbreeding among the small number of noble families led to the loss of the Lords' influence over the common people. Shortly after, in the middle of the ninth century, the Classic Mayan cities collapsed due to deforestation, soil depletion, drought, over-hunting, and overpopulation. Cultural depictions A fictional portrayal of Yax Ahau Xoc is found in the young adult novel, Lady of Palenque: Flower of Bacal by Anna Kirwan. In the novel, the author gives Yax Ahau Xoc the fictional personal name Shana'Kin Yaxchel Pacal (\\"Green Jay on the Wall\\"). The book presents an account of the Lady's early days in Lakamha (modern-day Palenque) when she is thirteen years old, and her subsequent journey to Xukpi after she is engaged to Yik'in Chan K'awlil (Fire Keeper Serpent of Holy Lineages), who was twenty years her senior. The epilogue states that a year after their marriage, they had a son, Yax Pasaj Chan Yopat (New Dawn Sky Anther). The Lady's husband, Lord Fire Keeper, died at age 46 after thirteen years of marriage and left his kingdom to his 12-year-old son. It is suggested that the Lady may have married again and had another son after her husband's death.

When Germs Travel When Germs Travel: Six Major Epidemics That Have Invaded America Since 1900 and the Fears They Have Unleashed expands the scope of Quarantine! by chronicling American epidemics during the two \\"great waves of immigration\\" that helped shape the 20th century. Markel argues that the association of immigrants with infectious disease is a key component of that history, and that their stigmatization during 20th century American epidemics \\"reveal[s] much about our predispositions for dealing with the perpetual threat of contagious disease\\".Markel 2004, p. 6, p. 210 An Anatomy of Addiction Markel's An Anatomy of Addiction: Sigmund Freud, William Halsted, and the Miracle Drug Cocaine explores the lives and careers of Freud and Halsted through their relationship to cocaine. Having treated patients suffering from various forms of substance abuse, Markel thought that sharing Freud and Halsted's struggles (both personal and scientific) with cocaine would raise awareness of the perniciousness of addiction while illuminating an important chapter in medical history. Discussing his work with Science Friday's Ira Flatow, Markel said \\"they were so compelling, and I thought using their lives and their struggles I could really put a human face on this terrible disease.\\" The Kelloggs In August 2017, Pantheon Books published Markel's latest book, The Kelloggs: The Battling Brothers of Battle Creek. The book tells the story of the lives and times of the Kellogg Brothers of Battle Creek, Michigan. The Milbank Quarterly From 2013 to 2017, Markel was the editor-in-chief of the Milbank Quarterly, a peer-reviewed public health journal of population health and health policy. Academic and popular periodicals Markel has also contributed over 450 articles to scholarly publications and popular periodicals.  Government advice and media appearances  Influenza From 2005 to 2006, Markel served as a historical consultant on pandemic influenza preparedness planning for the United States Department of Defense. From 2006 to 2016 he served as principal historical consultant on pandemic preparedness for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Markel was one of many who advised the federal government's response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic on the CDC Director's \\"Novel A/H1N1 Influenza Team B\\" real-time think tank. He and a team of researchers at the Center for the History of Medicine collaborated with the CDC to publish a digital encyclopedia of the 1918 influenza pandemic, the largest available digital collection of materials pertaining to the deadliest pandemic of the 20th century and one of the largest collections of historical documents ever assembled on a single epidemic. The collaboration between Markel and the CDC continued with analysis and documentation of non- pharmaceutical interventions deployed during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic. Ebola During the 2014 Ebola epidemic, Markel contributed his expertise on the history of epidemics and quarantines to public forums such as NPR's All Things Considered, the BBC World Service, CNN/Sanjay Gupta MD, PBS NewsHour, and The New Yorker. He reminded readers in The New York Times that \\"we are a global village. Germs have always traveled. The problem now is they can travel with the speed of a jet plane.\\" Markel additionally sought to enhance public understanding of the Ebola outbreak through op-eds for Reuters Opinion and The New Republic. SARS-CoV-2 Markel wrote a piece in the New York Times criticizing the Chinese government for their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He argued that the Wuhan lockdown, which had completely shut all transportation in Wuhan and surrounding cities, was \\"too much too late\\", and that \\"Incremental restrictions, enforced steadily and transparently, tend to work far better than draconian measures.\\" Honors and awards Markel's historical, medical, and health policy research has been recognized with numerous grants, honors and awards. In 1996 he was a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Generalist Physician Faculty Scholar for his work on American Doctors and Foreign Patients; Health Care Delivery for Russian, Jewish, Mexican, and Chinese Immigrants to the United States between 1880 and 1995, while his work titled U.S. Immigration Policy and the Public Health, 1880-1995 received the National Institutes of Health's James A. Shannon Director's Award for 1997‚Äì1999. He was named a Centennial Historian of the City of New York in 1998 for his role in advising and planning the New York City 100: Greater New York Centennial Celebration. Markel was also an inaugural fellow at the New York Public Library's Center for Scholars and Writers from 1999‚Äì2000. In 2003 Markel's Quarantine!‚Äîby that time established as \\"a classic in the history of public health\\"‚Äîwas recognized by the American Public Health Association with The Arthur J. Viseltear Prize \\"for the outstanding book in the History of Public Health in America\\". In 2007, he received the Theodore Woodward Award from the American Clinical and Climatological Association for his presentation on \\"Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions Employed By Major American Cities During the 1918-19 Influenza Pandemic\\" and a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Investigator Award in Health Policy, also awarded on the basis of Markel's work on the 1918-1919 pandemic. In 2008, in recognition of contributions made throughout his career to the fields of medicine and public health, Markel was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. In 2011 he was appointed to the Institute of Medicine's Board of Population Health and Public Health Practices and was Chair of its Section on Social Sciences from 2013‚Äì2015. In 2015, the Institute of Medicine was renamed the National Academy of Medicine, of which Dr. Markel is an elected member. In 2015 Markel was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation for demonstrating \\"exceptional capacity for productive scholarship.

He is best known as a whistleblower after his December 2010 letter to Dmitry Medvedev, which exposed a corrupt scheme that included the construction of 'Putin's Palace' and challenged the Russian president to fight corruption.Corruption Free Russia After he left Russia, his revelations of large scale corruption in President Putin's inner circle led to investigations in major Western media Career Kolesnikov graduated from the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute in 1972, where he studied biophysics. He holds a doctorate from the Sergei Kirov Military Medical Academy, and spent 20 years as a scientist specialising in the applications of biophysics in medicine.–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ö–æ–ª–µ—Å–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤: –ü–æ—á–µ–º—É —è —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª –ø—Ä–æ –î–≤–æ—Ä–µ—Ü –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω–∞. ¬´–ú—ã –ø–µ—Ä–µ—à–ª–∏ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü—É –º–µ–∂–¥—É –¥–æ–±—Ä–æ–º –∏ –∑–ª–æ–º –≤ 2009 –≥–æ–¥—É¬ª ‚Äì –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤—å—é ‚Äì –¢–µ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã ‚Äì –°–Ω–æ–± In 1991 he and scientific colleagues combined with the St Petersburg health authorities to found a state enterprise to manufacture medical equipment which they had been developing. In 1992, when it became legal, they set up a joint stock company called Petromed, a joint venture with St Petersburg's Department of International Economic Ties, then headed by Putin. Petromed expanded through the 1990s from the manufacture of equipment to procurement, and from procurement to major health infrastructure projects. The election of Vladimir Yakovlev as Mayor St Petersburg was a setback for Petromed as the company did not enjoy as good relations with him as they had with Anatoly Sobchak. The publicly owned stake in the company was sold so that Kolesnikov and another of the co-founders, Dmitri Gorelov, each held a 50% stake. Putin's palace Kolesnikov's involvement in this is described in his letter to Medvedev and has been covered by the media, notably by David Ignatius in the Washington Post, who concluded from his investigations that 'Kolesnikov is one of those brave souls a journalist meets occasionally, who decides to expose what he sees as wrongdoing, regardless of the personal risks.' David Ignatius - Sergey Kolesnikov's tale of palatial corruption, Russian style In 2000 Gorelov was approached by Nikolai Shamalov, a close associate of Putin. Shamalov, on behalf of Putin, proposed the following scheme: Petromed would be commissioned to undertake a number of health infrastructure projects, funded by oligarchs, including Roman Abramovich. A portion of the donations would be siphoned into an investment fund, opaquely controlled by Putin. This scheme went ahead, including 'Project South', aka Putin's Palace, which Shamalov supervised. Kolesnikov claims that he became disillusioned when, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, he was instructed that all funds were to be directed to Putin's Palace and investment projects on which people's livelihoods depended were to be shut down. In September 2010 he left Russia having decided to become a whistleblower. After consulting lawyers and meeting with Washington Post columnist David Ignatius he published his letter to Medvedev, which met with official denials. The plausibility of these denials has been undermined by investigations by Novaya Gazeta, which revealed a paper trail going back to the Kremlin.Novayagazeta February 14, 2011 ‚Ññ16 740 square metre palace Asked by Masha Gessen why he had become a whistleblower he replied, 'On the one hand, it's a complicated question, on the other hand, it's simple. If you are a Russian, if Russia is your homeland, and if you have something you can do for her, then the act is perfectly natural. Sometimes I wondered whether I would be able, for example, to 'go over the top' as my father did. Well, I came to the conclusion that maybe I could.' On Russia today he is pessimistic, 'My analysis led to the conclusion that the country has no real positive development. The country is heading for collapse. Moreover, for a really serious collapse, possibly revolution. And considering that today Russia is a nuclear power, and that revolution in a country where there is a huge number of nuclear weapons is an incredibly dangerous thing for the existence of the whole world, I came to the conclusion that something had to be done. These were the main motives for my decision to write the letter. Well, in the end, let's say, I have lived most of my life, I've got children and grandchildren, and not just me, everyone.'

History  During the decades of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, El Norte gained important successes in exposing corruption in government. Due to its principles of independent journalism, the federal government cut the paper supply required to print the newspaper, so the company had to import it directly. At the end El Norte won the battle against the then government monopoly import of paper for printing (PIPSA). Grupo Reforma is 85 years old. It began with the founding of the newspaper El Sol in April 1922, followed by El Norte in 1938, the newspaper Metro in Monterrey in 1988 (and renovated in 1993). Four years later, in 1997, the newspaper Palabra was born in Saltillo, and the Metro in Mexico City. Mural, in Guadalajara, was founded a year later. In 2004 and 2005, Metro expanded to Saltillo and Guadalajara. In 2007 and 2008, Metro again expanded to State of Mexico and Puebla. La Reforma, a branch of El Norte, was founded in 1993 in Mexico City.  2012 attacks  On 10 July 2012, gunmen threw grenades into two buildings belonging to the paper. On 30 July, the El Norte headquarters in Monterrey was attacked by three masked men who subdued the security guard and set fire to the building's lobby. Two carried automatic weapons. A police car arrived on the scene, but did not attempt to apprehend the suspects. The attack was the third in one month against the newspaper, leading to speculation that the attack was retaliation by drug traffickers for El Norte's coverage of organized crime.

Wakeford was most known for working on Martin Scorsese's films Mean Streets and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, as well as on the films Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade and Wedding Bell Blues. Early life and career Wakeford was born in 1928 and grew up in south Los Angeles. While finishing up high school, Wakeford apprenticed with fashion photographer Earl Scott. Following his apprenticeship, Wakeford landed a job as a cameraman at The Douglas Aircraft Company. There he was responsible for filming new missiles, planes, and classified weapons tests at White Sands, New Mexico and Edwards Air Force Base becoming one of the early experts in super high speed cinema (5,000 to 8,000 frames per second). Wakeford's work at The Douglas Aircraft Company led him to the United States Army where he spent two years in the Signal Corp. as a motion picture cameraman in New York City and Germany. Following his time in the Army, Wakeford began shooting documentary films. One of his early documentary films was on Wernher von Braun whom Wakeford had met and developed a relationship with at Douglas Aircraft. He furthered his documentary career by shooting films with Willard Van Dyke, a leading social documentary filmmaker who later went on to be director of the Department of Film at the Museum of Modern Art.Moma.org Advertising career To supplement his documentary work, Wakeford began freelancing on commercial projects. One of his first jobs was as a cameraman for Danger is My Business, a reality show that traveled around California filming dangerous professions. During this time, he also created art films, including Fish which explored movement of color in synch to music and won an award at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. Later Wakeford began shooting live action that would be incorporated into animation. Wakeford quickly began working for animators in Hollywood including Jose Cuauhtemoc \\"Bill\\" Malendez (Peanuts), and Hanna & Barbera, among others. With this success, Wakeford started a commercial production company with John Orloff named Wakeford / Orloff Productions. Wakeford/Orloff Productions shot national commercials for brands including Budweiser, Mattel, Hot Wheels, Barbie, Boeing, Purina, Post Cereal,Chevrolet, United Airlines, Maybelline, Max Factor, Procter & Gamble, Rice-A-Roni, Gallo wine, Kellogg's, and McDonald's. Film career Wakeford's first major motion picture was Mean Streets (1973) directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro. Wakeford shot the film using handheld camera techniques to capture the self-destructive lives of shady characters in Little Italy New York. The Huffington Post called the cinematography by Wakeford \\"arguably the most original for this genre at the time and has been copied endlessly in other movies, down to his audacious tracking shots. The innovative handholding and lighting techniques used by Wakeford have since become mainstream practice in American cinema.\\" In 1997, the United States National Film Registry elected to preserve Mean Streets for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" Wakeford (right) on set with director Joel Hershman on Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me in 1992. Wakeford went on to shoot Alice Doesn‚Äôt Live Here Anymore (1974), directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Ellen Burstyn and Kris Kristofferson. The National Board of Review of Motion Pictures called Wakeford's cinematography \\"inventive.\\" The film won the Academy Award for Best Actress (Ellen Burstyn) and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Diane Ladd and Best Original Screenplay for Robert Getchell. Wakeford later transitioned back into commercial work by starting production company Kent Wakeford & Associates. He later spent a season shooting the television show L.A. Law. However, after 14 episodes he turned his attention to small independent films and shot over a dozen independent films over the next decade. Most of the films were action oriented using his gritty street-like sensibility from Mean Streets. He also shot short films such as the This Ain't Bebop segment of Imagining America, directed by Ralph Bakshi and starring Harvey Keitel and Ron Thompson.  Death  Kent L.

A health care sharing ministry does not use actuaries, does not accept risk or make guarantees, and does not purchase reinsurance policies on behalf of its members. Members of health care sharing ministries are exempt from the individual mandate requirement of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 Sec. 5000A(d)(2)(b)(i) (the individual shared responsibility provision was repealed in December 2017, effective in 2019). This means members of health care sharing ministries are not required to have insurance as outlined in the individual mandate. Approximately 30 states have safe harbor laws that distinguish healthcare ministries from health insurance organizations. Some of the larger health care sharing ministries include Christian Healthcare Ministries (founded in 1981), Medi-Share, a program of Christian Care Ministry (1993), Samaritan Ministries (1994), Liberty HealthShare (1998, originally established by Mennonites), United Refuah HealthShare, MCS Medical Cost Sharing Altrua HealthShare, Freedom HealthShare, and Trinity HealthShare (1997). History The idea behind health care cost sharing seems to date back at least a century. For many decades, \\"in Amish and Mennonite communities across the [US], people pooled their money to lighten the burden of debt for individuals during hard times.\\" In the late 20th Century, this broadened out to larger communities by larger cost-sharing ministries within the Christian community. Most health care sharing ministries are oriented toward practicing Christians and aligned with ideals or principles found in the Christian Bible, primarily translated to mean that believers have a responsibility to assist in meeting each other's needs. Such ministries often cite a biblical verse in the book of Galatians, from the New Testament, as a mandate applicable to medical costs, specifically Verse 2 in Chapter 6, in which the Apostle Paul wrote ‚ÄúBear one another‚Äôs burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ.‚Äù Some ministries view verses 44‚Äì45 in Chapter 2 of the Book of Acts, also from the New Testament, which states that early Christians \\"were together and had everything in common\\" and \\"gave to anyone as he had need,\\" as the basis for their founding. Other health cost-sharing organizations are more secular. For example, Sedera Health asks their members to \\"live a healthy lifestyle\\" but does not explicitly emphasize any religious obligations. Several states have tried to block health care sharing ministries on the grounds that they are selling unauthorized insurance.. For example, the State of Oklahoma contested Medi-Share in 2007 for marketing information that promoted the cost-sharing option as \\"insurance\\", but that issue was resolved when they changed their approach, and by 2010, Medi-Share was able to operate in Oklahoma once again. A majority of states, however, have enacted safe harbor laws specifying that the ministries are not insurance and do not need to be regulated as such. In addition, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issues exemption letters to ministries that have met the criteria to operate independently of the Affordable Care Act. In 2010, at the time the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed, there were estimated to be about 100,000 people belonging to some type of medical bill- sharing ministry. By 2014, it was estimated to be 160,000; and by 2018, that number in the US had grown to 1 million. The future of health care sharing ministries after Obamacare's individual mandate repeal was unclear, but a work published by Harvard Law School suggested that many people may continue to use them, and they could even expand for people ineligible for healthcare subsidies (i.e. above the income threshold). Membership According to Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries, a trade association of sharing ministries, over 1 million Americans participated in health care sharing , sharing more than $670 million in medical bills annually. A January 2015 op-ed in The New York Times stated that the four main healthcare ministries in the US have a total combined membership of about 340,000, that membership has grown significantly because of the healthcare ministries' exemption to the insurance mandate of the Affordable Care Act, and that monthly cost of membership in a health care sharing ministry is generally lower than the cost of insurance rates. The Seattle Times also reported that membership has grown significantly in recent years. Most health sharing ministries tend to have restrictions such as abstaining from extramarital sex, excessive drinking, and use of tobacco or illegal drugs. They usually require members to be in good health and make a statement of belief, as well. For instance, Samaritan Ministries requires a statement of Christian faith including belief in the true God and divinity of Jesus; Liberty HealthShare and Freedom HealthShare are more inclusive, accepting members with a wide variety of religious and ethical beliefs. United Refuah is the first and only Jewish healthcare sharing organization. All such ministries require that members subscribe to the principles of individual responsibility for their own health and of helping others in need. Requirements under the Affordable Care Act In order for members to be exempt from the tax penalties outlined in the Affordable Care Act, ministries must meet the following qualifications: * Must be a 501(c)(3) organization * Members must share common ethical or religious beliefs * Must not discriminate membership based on state of residence or employment * Members cannot lose membership due to development of a medical condition * Must have (or a predecessor must have) existed and been in practice continually since December 31, 1999 (a grandfather clause) * Must be subject to an annual audit by an independent CPA which must be publicly available upon request Sec. 5000A(d)(2)(b)(ii) The six ministries that meet these qualifications are: Christian Healthcare Ministries, Liberty HealthShare, Medi-Share, Samaritan Ministries, OneShare, and Trinity HealthShare. Freedom HealthShare claims to meet all of the qualifications above and claims that its members are now exempt from the Personal Penalty. MCS Medical Cost Sharing, founded after 1999, does not meet the qualifications, but offers to pay the tax penalties incurred by members. Altrua HealthShare has also been recognized as an qualifying health care sharing ministry, due to its merger with Blessed Assurance Bulletin. (Altrua achieved this via a merger with a smaller but older ministry) Anabaptist Healthshare is recognized as a health care sharing ministry by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. In 2017 United Refuah entered the scene. They are the first and only Jewish healthcare sharing organization and claims to be recognized as a healthcare sharing organization by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as well. In 2017 Freedom HealthShare was created to enhance health sharing with advanced technology. It is a recognized 501c3 charitable organization. Tax deductibility Monthly share payments are not deductible from US federal income tax as either a medical expense (because it is not a payment for insurance) or a charitable deduction (because it is a payment for goods and services). Member payment in excess of their required monthly minimum, however, may be deductible as a charitable contribution..

In the following years, he became President of Credito Industriale Sardo (1980‚Äì1989), Secretary-General for Economic Planning at the Ministry of Budget (1980‚Äì1982), Chief Executive Officer and then Managing Director of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (1989‚Äì1990), President of the Fondo Interbancario di Tutela dei Depositi (1990‚Äì1999), Impregilo, Gemina, Aeroporti di Roma and Consorzio Venezia Nuova (2000‚Äì2010). After having been vice president of Capitalia, at the moment of the merging with UniCredit, he was named president of Banca di Roma. Between 2000 and 2010, he was also a Board Member of RCS MediaGroup and Telecom Italia. Politically, Savona was inspired by Ugo La Malfa and thus involved in the Italian Republican Party (PRI), where he was close to Giorgio La Malfa, until the early 1990s. Savona served as Minister of Industry, Commerce and Craftmanship in the government led by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi (1993‚Äì1994), as Head of the Department for EU Policies of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers during the Silvio Berlusconi's third cabinet (2005‚Äì2006), under Minister Giorgio La Malfa, and, consequently, Coordinator of the Technical Committee for the Lisbon Strategy, which prepared the draft of the Italian plan for Growth and Occupation, presented to the European Commission in October 2005. In 2010, he was appointed President of Fondo Interbancario di Tutela dei Depositi for the second time and served as the Chairman of the Fintech startup Euklid Ltd until 2018. Savona also had several public offices in Italy and abroad, among which: member of the OECD Committee for the standardisation of financial statistics, and of the BIS Standing Committee on Eurodollars; President of the Technical- Scientific Council for Economic Planning, and of the Commission on Nuclear Power in Italy. In May 2018, the Five Star Movement and the League proposed Savona for the role of Minister of Economy and Finances. President Sergio Mattarella opposed his appointment, considering his outspoken support for Italy's covert exit from the Euro an overwhelming risk for the country's economy. The two parties refused to replace Savona with any other candidate, forcing appointed Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to give up on his task of forming a government. However, it was later agreed that Savona would serve as Minister of European Affairs after both parties agreed to reinstate Conte as their choice for Prime Minister and instead nominate economics professor Giovanni Tria, an associate of Savona, as Minister of Economy and Finances. Savona frequently denied being a Eurosceptic. Savona left his post as Minister of European Affairs on March 8 2019, in order to become President of the Italian Companies and Exchange Commission, the government authority responsible for regulating the Italian securities market.  Academic career  Savona was the academic dean of the Faculty of Political Science and International Relations, and director of the PhD in Geopolitics and Economic Geopolitics of the e-University Guglielmo Marconi, of Rome. He served also as Professor emeritus of Economic Politics at the LUISS \\"Guido Carli\\" University. He founded and directed with Michele Fratianni the Open Economies Review, and he is at present the Scientific Editor of the following journals: Economia Italiana, Journal of European Economic History and Review of Economic Conditions in Italy. He taught in the universities of Perugia and Rome Tor Vergata, and at Public Administration Superior School. His favourite research topics are the international monetary system, the effects of the growth of the derivatives market on the efficacy of the economic policy, and the gaps in productivity between the centre-north of Italy and its south. He is the author and joint author of several papers and books on the problems of the real, monetary and financial economy, and on methodological issues. Among his research, great relevance is attributed to the first econometric model of Italian economy M1BI, the first analyses on the international monetary base and Eurodollar, and on the macroeconomic effects of derivative contracts, which have all anticipated in a systematic way the happening of the dramatic events experienced by the Italian and international economy in the last forty years.  Awards  Savona won the prize awarded by Associazione per il Progresso Economico in 1976, the Premio Capalbio 1998 in economy, the Premio IDI 1999 for the small and middle enterprise, the Premio Pisa 1999 for essay writing with the book Che cos'e' l'economia, the Premio Speciale 2000 for the sector 'Economy' as part of Premi della Cultura awarded by the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, the Premio 2008 in International economy awarded by Camera di Commercio di Genova, the Premio Scanno 2009 in economy, the VII Premio Donato Menichella 2009 for socio-economic studies, and the Premio Fata Morgana 2010 in economy and finance. He is Chinese Eisenhower Fellow of Taiwan and Jemolo Fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford University.

Writing and teaching  Gorra‚Äôs Portrait of a Novel: Henry James and the Making of an American Masterpiece (2012) is a critical biography that uses its commentary on James‚Äôs 1881 novel, The Portrait of a Lady, as a point of entry not only into James‚Äôs life but also into the literary culture of the late nineteenth century. It was praised by Cynthia Ozick for presenting its subject with all ‚Äúthe sensuous immediacy of his quotidian reality: the rooms he lived in, the streets he trod, and the very texture of his inmost sensibility‚Ä¶. In Gorra's ingenious and capacious reading, James stands before us with a clarity of seeing and feeling given to no previous biographer.‚Äù His other books include The English Novel at Mid-Century (1990), an account of British fiction in the generation of Evelyn Waugh and Anthony Powell, which began as a doctoral thesis at Stanford University, where it won the English Department‚Äôs Alden Dissertation Prize. It was followed by a study of the postcolonial novel, After Empire: Scott, Naipaul, Rushdie (1997), and The Bells in Their Silence: Travels through Germany (2004), which grew out of a sabbatical year spent in that country. Edited volumes include The Portable Conrad and the Norton Critical Edition of William Faulkner‚Äôs As I Lay Dying.

A correlation exists between oil prices and the world Food Price Index. Following the 2007‚Äì2008 world food price crisis and a short lull in high prices during 2009, food prices around the world again started to rise in 2010. To reduce the volatility of food markets and increase market transparency, several measures were considered at the G20 summit in 2010. One of the outcomes was the establishment of the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) in 2011. In April 2011, the World Bank warned that the global economy was \\"one shock away\\" from an impending full-scale food price crisis. The high food prices have contributed to worldwide protests particularly in Africa. High food prices were also a major factor contributing to the Arab Spring unrest. The deflated FAO food price index reached an all time high in 2012. As a result of a very dry summer in the United States and Europe, corn and soybean prices reached all-time highs in July 2012 and prices remained high throughout 2012 One reason for the increase in food prices may be the increase in oil prices at the same time, leading to increased demand for and production of biofuels. For example, the use of Maize (Corn) for ethanol fuel production rose from 15% of total U.S. maize production in 2006 to 40% in 2012.

In 1976, supported by Dinna Bj√∏rn, he was the originator of the Bournonville Group which danced around the world presenting Bournonville's ballets. His first term as artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet was from 1985‚Äì1994. From 1995‚Äì1999, he was the artistic director of the Royal Swedish Ballet and from 2002‚Äì2008 he was again artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet. He has directed several productions of August Bournonville's ballets.\\"Artistic Director Frank Andersen - Person of the Year 2004\\" , Danish American Society. Retrieved 20 July 2011. Since 1997, he has been an advisor to the National Ballet of China, visiting the People‚Äôs Republic on many occasions.Renee Renouf, \\"Interview with Frank Andersen\\", Ballet Magazine, July 2002. His dancing has been qualified as conveying love of life, humour and charm in roles such as Geert in The Kermesse in Bruges, Gurn in La Sylphide, Frants in Copp√©lia, and Puck in John Neumeier's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1980).\\"Frank Andersen\\", Den Store Danske.

It has been observed in two streams in eastern Tennessee, Little Chucky Creek and Dunn Creek. The last observed specimen in Dunn Creek was collected in 1940 and the species is likely no longer present in that location. Because the species is endangered, and the number of known individuals is so low, there is no information regarding spawning conditions or diet. However, it is theorized that they may spawn in the early summer. Due to the dismal population size little is also known about the life history. The population is in decline most likely due to habitat degradation. The current management plan for the species seems to focus around maintaining the ecosystem it currently lives in. It is a federally endangered species.USFWS. Endangered Status for the Cumberland Darter, Rush Darter, Yellowcheek Darter, Chucky Madtom, and Laurel Dace. Federal Register August 9, 2011. Conservation Fisheries inc, initiated a captive breeding program in 2004. The fish is constrained to a 3 km (1.9 mi) stretch of Little Chucky Creek and does not expand from that region although there are suitable habitats nearby. This fish was described to science as a new species in 2005. It is in the elegans clade.Egge, J. JD, Simons, Andrew M. (2009) Molecules, morphology, missing data and the phylogenetic position of a recently extinct madtom catfish (Actinopterygii: Ictaluridae) Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 155 60-75, . Appearance and anatomy It is up to about 6.5 cm (2.6 in) long and pale colored with dark blotches.Burr, B. M., et al. (2005). Two new species of Noturus (Siluriformes: Ictaluridae) from the Tennessee River drainage: Description, distribution, and conservation status. Copeia 4 783.  Distribution  The chucky madtom has an extremely small distribution and is only known to live in two streams in the French broad river system in eastern Tennessee. Only one specimen has been found in Dunn Creek in Sevier County. The Dunn Creek specimen was found in 1940 and no other specimens have been found in that location since leading many to believe the population in Dunn Creek has been extirpated. The majority of the specimens have come from Little Chucky Creek in Greene county Tennessee. It is not known why these two small streams are the only place where the species is found, as there is similar habitat along portions of the Little Chucky Creek. Further surveys of surrounding areas with suitable habitat did not yield any more specimens. The streams contain mussels that are indicative of high water quality. Areas of slow riffles and some moderate flows characterize the portions of the Little Chucky Creek that the chucky madtom occupies. The beds of these streams usually consist of gravel or flat slabs of rock. Due to the small amount of specimens observed in the wild there is currently no information about the diet of the chucky madtom or whether or not it has any natural predators. The species the chucky madtom competes with is also unknown, although when chucky madtom species were collected there were other species of fish usually present. Species such as the central stoneroller, banded sculpins, greenside darters, redline darters, and banded darters. The current habitat has a few indicators of good stream health like the aforementioned mussels. Upstream from the known range of the madtom there is some impact on the land from agricultural use. Environmental pressures like siltation and destruction of the riparian zone may play a key part in the range of this endangered fish.  Life history and ecology  Due to the small range and lack of specimens, little is known about the life history of the chucky madtom. There is currently no information about diet, predators, spawning times, fecundity, or sex ratio. The low species count and protected status of this species makes it challenging for researchers to examine the diet of this species. Using other species one could potentially draw conclusions to the chucky madtoms feeding and reproduction habits. Other madtoms, such as the least madtom (Noturus hildebrandi), are not sexually mature until one year of age. Noturus hildebrandi and other madtoms breed in the late spring to early summer. Smoky madtoms usually selected nesting sites located under flat rocks. In smoky madtoms, mayfly nymphs comprised a significant chunk of their diet. Although exact feeding habits are unknown, it may be possible that the chucky madtom exhibit some of the same behaviors as these other species.  Current management plan  The chucky madtom is a federally endangered species and there is a recovery plan drafted up by conservation fisheries inc. Conservation fisheries inc (CFI), is a Knoxville- based non-profit organization that exists to reintroduce and rehabilitate natural species. The organization performs captive breeding programs with endangered fishes in order to preserve the biodiversity of southeastern streams. A captive breeding program was started with the chucky madtom, a male and female madtom was collected and lived in the facility. Unfortunately the female died before they could spawn.Conservation Fisheries Inc (2011) Recovery outline for Chucky madtom (noturus crypticus) . In the management plan CFI says that agricultural use of the surrounding land has most likely contributed most to the small range of the chucky madtom. According to the Tennessee Valley Authority Little Chucky Creek is ‚ÄúBiologically impaired.‚Äù If not properly practiced, some agricultural practices can lead to siltation of streams due to erosion of the streams banks as well as debris and particulates from runoff. Siltation affects bottom feeders like the chucky madtom as it removes hiding places as well as covering potential food. It is theorized that this sediment contaminating these streams are inhibiting both the feeding and reproductive practices of the chucky madtom. The Middle Nolichucky Watershed Alliance (MNWA) is currently responsible for carrying out the restoration plan for the chucky madtom. They plan to sustain the population by carrying out two objectives. The first objective is protecting the habitat by ensuring proper land use, This should help with the water quality problems by addressing point pollution as well as other factors such as faulty septic tanks and other pollutants. The second objective is to gather more information about the biology of this species. In order to continue, more information must be acquired so food sources and other factors can be managed if needs be. References Further reading *Egge, J. JD, Simons, Andrew M.

It prefers to live in small rivers and gravel-bottomed creeks. The average lifespan of the elegant madtom is two years. The elegant madtom is not listed on any federal or state conservation lists. However, scientists who have done surveys on the fish have recommended that it should be listed as threatened. Classification Until the 1990s and early 2000, Noturus crypticus and Noturus fasciatus were thought to be the same species as Noturus elegans. However, they are now considered distinct species. The chucky madtom, N. crypticus, is the only one of the three currently listed as severely threatened.Burr, B.M., And Walter W Dimmick. 1981. Nests, Eggs and Larvae of the Elegant Madtom Notorus elegans from Barren River Drainage, Kentucky (Pisces:Ictaluridae). Transmissions Kentucky Academy Science, 42(3-4), 116-118. Geographic distribution The elegant madtom is found primarily in Tennessee and northern Alabama, in the upper and lower portions of the Tennessee River, and also in the Roaring River, the Green River drainage, Dunn Creek, Tennessee, and in Piney Creek, Paint Rock River, and Flint River, Alabama.Taylor 1969. Natureserve. http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Noturus+elegans+ It can be found in lower north-central Tennessee rivers, such as at Little Chucky Creek in Greene County.Myers Enterprises II. 2009 - 2011. Global species. http://globalspecies.org/ntaxa/667251 The elegant madtom was also found in central Kentucky,Taylor 1969. Fishbase. http://www.fishbase.org/summary/Noturus-elegans.html in the Green River drainage. Its status in Alabama is unknown. N. exilis was misidentified in 1996 at Bear Creek, Alabama, as N. elegans. This mis-identification could be a reason for a small decrease in the overall population size. According to surveys there are very low numbers of the elegant madtom in the middle and upper Tennessee River drainage. The survey reports that these low populations could be due to the lack of available nesting sites, as it prefers habitats with riffles and rocks to nest under. However, the elegant madtom is common in the Green River and lower rivers in Tennessee that are close to Alabama. Ecology The elegant madtom from immaturity to adulthood is an invertivore, which means it feeds on invertebrates. The elegant madtom is a species that should be listed as threatened. It is only common in a few places, and faces predation from larger fish such as the largemouth bass and catfish. However, the elegant madtom does have a defense in its venom delivery system,GoFISHn. 2011. http://www.gofishn.com/content/madtom a venom delivery gland in its pectoral and dorsal spines to deter potential predators or competitors.Egge, J. J. D., and A. M. Simons. 2010. Evolution of venom delivery structures in madtom catfishes (Siluriformes: Ictaluridae). Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 102, 115‚Äì129. Competitors for invertebrate food sources include salamanders, lizards, and some snakes. The elegant madtom prefers to live in small rivers and gravel-bottomed creeks, with only minor ripples in the stream, and can be found most commonly underneath large rocks. There is little known about what abiotic factors influence where the elegant madtom will decide to nest. From investigation of a sister species in the same genus, Noturus baileyi, which lives in a similar habitat, it has been posited that the elegant madtom will prefer a pH of 6.2 to 7, and a temperature of . Dams, uplands habitats and waterfalls cause barriers for the elegant madtom. Human activity in flooding a river or changing its structure can ruin the habitat of the elegant madtom, which prefers shallow slow-moving freshwater.Taylor 1969. Florida Museum of Natural History. http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/catfish/ictaluridae/elegantmadtom.htm Dams can also affect the distribution of the species, isolating them and limiting their ability to change habitats or mate. The release of toxic chemicals or invasive fish into the stream can destroy small populations. Reproductive cycle Approximately a year after emerging from its egg, the elegant madtom will reach sexual maturity.PlanetCatfish. 1996-2011. http://www.planetcatfish.com/catelog/_species.php?species_id=300 Then, after this year of growth, a member of Noturus elegans will find a mate and make a nest beneath a rock in a river or stream. Rocks are very important for the elegant madtom, because without this substrate to lay their eggs under, they will not have the ability to make an effective nest that they can protect. The average brood size for the elegant madtom is 50 eggs. Not much is known about when or how often the elegant madtom mates. It has been estimated, again from data on sister species Noturus baileyi, that mating takes place once a year in the months of May to August. The average lifespan for the elegant madtom is two years.

The species was first described to the United States National Museum by Professors Jordan and Gilbert in the Big Pigeon River. The mountain madtom has a body that is characterized as being robust, and by the toxic sting that is associated with their pectoral and dorsal spines.Swain, J., and G.B. Kalb. 1883. A review of the genus Noturus with a description of one new species. Proceedings of the United States National Museum 5:638-644. Currently, the Pigeon River Recovery Project is working to try to restore the mountain madtom population that was lost in fisheries. Aside from the Pigeon River Recovery Project, there is little management being applied to this species, and it is currently listed on the threatened species list for the state of Tennessee. Geographic distribution The mountain madtom has a broad distribution. Its native range includes larger streams of the Mississippi River drainage for the Little River system of southeastern Oklahoma northeastward.Starnes, B., Lynn, and Wayne C. Starnes. 1985. Ecology and Life History of the Mountain Madtom,Noturus eleutherus (Pisces: Ictaluridae). American Midland Naturalist 114: 331-334. East of the Mississippi it appears through the Ohio drainage to western Pennsylvania. In the south-east it occurs in the Cumberland and Tennessee drainages. In the Tennessee, Cumberland, and Green systems it is confined to the Highland Rim. It is also found in the North Fork Holston, Clinch, and Powell rivers. Generally the mountain madtom is restricted to ridge and valley areas. In the Ohio river basin the mountain madtom and the northern madtom occur in very similar environments but usually not together.Thomas, R., Matthew. 2002. Morphological Discrimination of Notrus Stigmosus and N. Eleutherus (Siluriformes: Ictaluridae) In the Ohio River Basin. Southeastern Naturalist 1:325-338. It is not found on the Cumberland Plateau or the high reaches on the Blue Ridge mountain streams, due to large boulders found in the streams that lack vegetation. It is not generally found in glaciated regions, nor is it found with any other madtom species except the pygmy madtom (Noturus stanauli). It has also been reported to have been seen occasionally with stonecat madtoms (Noturus flavus) in Ohio. Ecology The mountain madtom is found in fast-flowing clear riffles that are shallow generally headwater streams. Because the mountain madtom is sensitive to siltation it is not found where there is sandy substrate. Human actions, like farming or logging, that cause siltation in streams degridate local populations. It likes an intermediate sized cobble substrate. In Pennsylvania it has been noted to be found in areas where there is dense vegetation. Mountain madtoms are found in streams with mainly limestone substrate that would affect the pH of the stream. Its diet is mainly mature aquatic insects. Out of 287 stomachs viewed the following contents were found; Plecoptera 1.0, Ephemeroptera 48.9, Trichoptera 10.8, Diptera 37.3, Miscellaneous 2.0. Based on its diet, it competes with Etheostoma blennioides, E. rfilineatum, and Cottus caroline. In all cases the mountain madtom is a nocturnal feeder and hides under large flat rocks during the day time. The entire genus Noturus has pectoral spines, some of which are serrated, some have a venomous sting, and some have both. The mountain madtom has both and these serve as an anti-predatory function, not to catch prey as previously thought.Egge, J. D., Jacob, and Andrew M. Simons. 2010. Evolution of venom delivery structures in madtom catfishes (Siluriformes: Ictaluridae). Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 102: 115-129. Human actions such as dam building can hurt mountain madtoms because they prefer fast flowing water. Life history Juvenile mountain madtoms are 20-30mm in length usually. Adult mountain madtoms range from 75‚Äì127 mm in length and the life span averages 4‚Äì5 years. It is uncertain what age they reach sexual maturity due to the secrecy of the species. One study located a nest and eggs were collected. In the study the nest was found in a moderately flowing stream, in a clean swept gravel substrate under a rock, 20m above a riffle. A male mountain madtom was seen guarding the nest. The estimated clutch size is 55-115 eggs per female Relative to other fish the mountain madtom has a small clutch size because they do provide a lot of parental care to the young. The breeding season was determined to be June‚ÄìJuly, based on the time the nest was found and how developed the eggs were. Human activity that puts silt in the streams can cause the eggs to suffocate which is detrimental to the population. The ideal temperature for the eggs to hatch is 24 C. Current management In Tennessee the mountain madtom is listed as threatened. Nationally it is listed as apparently secure. There is currently no specific management in effect for the mountain madtom. There is, however, The Pigeon River Recovery Project. This project has reintroduced many species of darters, mussels, and the mountain madtom to the Pigeon River. At one time there was a mill that pumped waste into the Pigeon River that killed almost all the organisms downstream of the mill.Coombs, A., Joyce. 2011. Bringing Back Aquatic Diversity: The pigeon River Recovery Project. pers. comm.. Because of the secrecy of the mountain madtom, the exact causes of its decline are not known. However, since it is very sensitive to silt, poor logging practices at the turn of the century are believed to have been detrimental to the population. The mountain madtom is not a sport fish or pan fish and is not favored by fishermen, except for biologists doing research, so overfishing is not a problem. Nothing has ever been noted to prey on the mountain madtom, due to its venomous sting and spines, so predation is not a problem for it either.

Ataxic cerebral palsy is caused by damage to cerebellar structures, differentiating it from the other two forms of cerebral palsy, which are spastic cerebral palsy (damage to cortical motor areas and underlying white matter) and dyskinetic cerebral palsy (damage to basal ganglia). Because of the damage to the cerebellum, which is essential for coordinating muscle movements and balance, patients with ataxic cerebral palsy experience problems in coordination, specifically in their arms, legs, and trunk. Ataxic cerebral palsy is known to decrease muscle tone. The most common manifestation of ataxic cerebral palsy is intention (action) tremor, which is especially apparent when carrying out precise movements, such as tying shoe laces or writing with a pencil. This symptom gets progressively worse as the movement persists, causing the hand to shake. As the hand gets closer to accomplishing the intended task, the trembling intensifies which makes it even more difficult to complete. Like all forms of CP, there is no \\"cure\\" for ataxic cerebral palsy. However, there are a number of diverse treatments which together have been used to limit the negative effects of the condition. Like all forms of CP it is most common for ataxic cerebral palsy to be congenital, resulting from errors in the development of the cerebellum and connexins during pregnancy. However it is also possible to be acquired via meningitis or even by head trauma, although the latter more often leads to one of the many forms of traumatic brain injury, which is categorically separate from cerebral palsy as a class. Signs and symptoms Due to impaired balance, patients who have ataxic cerebral palsy often walk with their feet unusually far apart (a wide gait). In addition, the low muscle tone caused by ataxic cerebral palsy causes people to appear very unsteady, as their body is constantly trying to counterbalance itself. Infants with the condition often take a significantly longer amount of time to be able to walk without support, and over 50% of all children with ataxic cerebral palsy experience some form of a learning disability or speech impediment. The condition, whether resulting from cerebellar malformation or injury, results in incomplete cerebral development and no two people are affected in the same way. In general, cerebral palsy is a physical impairment that affects posture and the development of movement. Ataxic cerebral palsy in particular, is manifested in the performance of movements with abnormal force, rhythm, and accuracy. Patients have hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), signs of ataxia (loss of full control of bodily movement), impaired balance and coordination, intention tremors, and a wide- based gait (in walking patients). Cerebral development typically occurs in the first two years of life when the infant is acquiring new motor and adaptive skills, consequently signs and symptoms of ataxic cerebral palsy begin to manifest during this time period. Typically patients fail to reach motor milestones and show a qualitative difference in motor development. During the neonatal period (first 28 days of life), children are noted to be lethargic, relatively immobile, and floppy. Moreover, hypotonia is greatest during this period, even though muscle tone increases with age, it never reaches normal levels. The limbs show weakness, incoordination in voluntary movement, dysdiadochokinesis (in inability to perform rapidly alternating movements), and titubation. Causes Approximately 2-2.5 per thousand children born in the western world have cerebral palsy, with increasing incidence in twin and premature births. Ataxic cerebral palsy accounts for 5 to 10% of all cases. The cause of cerebral palsy, in particular its ataxic subtype is unknown, but thought to be due to malformation or damage in the cerebellum and its many connections,. The majority of cases that present malformation of the cerebellum are congenital, however acquired ataxic cerebral palsy can result from meningitis, trauma, birth complications, and encephalopathies (septic, acute, disseminated, and toxic). In addition, maternal viral infections may cause damage to the fetal brain due to increase in inflammatory cytokines produced during infection. Brain injury can occur during prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal periods. Most cases of cerebral palsy, approximately 80%, are acquired prenatally from unknown causes. Incidence increases with decreasing gestational period‚Äîfewer than 32 weeks of gestation and birth weight less than 5 Ib 8 oz or 2500g. Diagnosis Diagnosis of ataxic cerebral palsy is based on clinical assessment using standardized assessment tools. Diagnosis begins with the observation of slow motor development, abnormal muscle tone, and unusual posture in children that fail to reach developmental milestones. Diagnosis differs in adults and children because a child‚Äôs brain is still developing and acquiring new motor, linguistic, adaptive, and social skills. The testing strategy is based on the pattern of development of symptoms, the patient‚Äôs family history, and any factors that might influence the diagnosis, such as injury or trauma. Associated disabilities such as those previously described under symptoms associated with ataxic cerebral palsy, i.e., sensory impairment and cognitive dysfunction, are also helpful in diagnosing the disease. In children, assessment of infantile reflexes is also a diagnostic tool, such as the Moro reflex and the Romberg Test. The Moro reflex is rarely present in infants after 6 months of age and is characterized as a response to a sudden loss of support that causes the infant to feel like it is falling. The infant will respond by abduction and adduction (or spreading and unspreading) of the arms, as well as crying. The Moro reflex is significant in evaluating the integration of the central nervous system and patients with ataxic cerebral palsy will show a persistence and exacerbation of the reflex. In addition, patients with ataxic cerebral palsy will rarely show a positive Romberg test, which indicates that there is localized cerebellar dysfunction. Physical diagnostic tests, such as cerebral imaging using Computerized Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and ultrasound are also useful, but not preferred to clinical assessments. These neuroimaging techniques can show brain abnormalities that have been found in previous patients with cerebral palsy, i.e., focal infarction and various brain malformations, however in a study of 273 children who were born after 35 weeks of gestation and underwent neuroimaging studies, one-third of the infants showed normal studies. In addition, infants undergo neuroimaging studies once the infant has neurological findings suggestive of cerebral palsy. For developmental diagnosis in children and infants, there are a number of milestones of motor, linguistic, adaptive, and social behavior, such as. # When the child could sit up on their own with or without support # Say their first words # Feed themselves # Play successfully with children of same age Prevention Current forms of prevention are focused during pregnancy, while others are focused immediately after birth. Some methods that have been used include prolonging the pregnancy using interventions such as 17-alpha progesterone, limiting the number of gestations during pregnancy (for pregnancies induced by assistive reproductive technology), antenatal steroid for mothers likely to deliver prematurely, high caffeine for premature births with extremely low birth weights. Treatment Although no cure exists, there are many different treatments which are currently being used to help control symptoms. These include short term treatment with some drugs (such as Botox) which relax the muscles, use of temperature changes to control muscle tremors, and a balanced approach of coordinated care and support involving physical therapists, orthopedic surgeons, and psychiatrists. Because there is no cure for ataxic cerebral palsy, current methods of treatment are diverse, often consisting of multiple focuses designed to limit the severity of symptoms. Many children suffering from ataxic cerebral palsy are treated by teams consisting of individuals from numerous disciplines, including physical therapists, occupational therapist, orthopedic surgeons, and psychiatrists. Treatment by such teams involves multiple approaches. Providing a primary care medical home to support children suffering from common symptoms of nutritional deficiencies, pain, dental care, bowel and bladder continence, and orthopedic complications is an essential aspect of treatment. In addition, utilizing diagnostic techniques to identify the nature and severity of brain abnormalities has become increasingly beneficial for treatment in recent years. Different medications have been used to temporarily treat ataxic cerebral palsy. Medications like primidone and benzodiazepine, while not recommended for long term use, can alleviate some of the tremor symptoms. Botox which relaxes tightened muscles has been effective in treating voice, hand and head tremors. A few recently published papers outlined a potential method for treating intention tremor which consisted of cooling the forearm by wrapping it in a cryomanchet using a circulating fluid. After the treatment most patients experienced reduced tremor for up to half an hour. This practical, however short-term treatment can facilitate performing normal daily activities like applying make up, eating, or signing documents. This potential treatment method is also significant in that it reduces one‚Äôs reliance on caregivers. History The first documented clinical interest in childhood cerebellar disorders was seen in 1861 when Friedreich published his paper titled ‚Äúfamilial spino-cerebellar degeneration.‚Äù His further studies of the late 19th century noted symptoms including tremor, hypotonia, diminished or lost tendon jerks, and slurred speech. It was in 1897 when Freud, having studied Friedreich‚Äôs work and other research of the time, suggested that there be a special category of cerebral palsy called ataxic cerebral palsy. Research Numerous recent publications have provided evidence suggesting that increased aerobic exercise for children suffering with ataxic cerebral palsy can improve physiological outcomes. More research is being conducted to better understand the specific mechanisms that may be responsible for this observation. Over the past half century, a significant amount of research has been focused on the use of stereotaxically placed lesions as a potential treatment method for ataxic cerebral palsy (the method had shown significant improvements in treating Parkinson's disease). Many studies suggested that lesions of the dentate nucleus produced an apparent reduction of symptoms, however the success of these studies did not attain the same level of success that was found when using the method to treat Parkinson‚Äôs disease. With the improvement of brain imaging techniques in recent time, it may be possible in the future to utilize these techniques to identify specific sites of imbalance within the brain which could be treated with stereotaxically placed electrodes. Improvements in both genetic studies and brain imaging techniques over the past few decades may suggest a promising future for treating ataxic cerebral palsy. It is now recommended by the American Academy of Neurology that all cases of cerebral palsy of unknown origin undergo neuroimaging. While this has been a somewhat controversial recommendation due to the lack of evidence behind the decision, it does appear that in the coming years neuroimaging will become an increasing aspect of both diagnosing and treating ataxic cerebral palsy. Genetic studies have recently played a significant role in the research on ataxic cerebral palsy specifically. While it is estimated that only 2% of all forms of cerebral palsy are genetic forms of the disease, 50% of ataxic cerebral palsy is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Gaining a better understanding of the genes behind the disease suggests a future possibility of prenatal/premarital testing families and will greatly increase our understanding of the disease.

The other regional centres are located at Kolkata, Guwahati, Mumbai, Nagpur and New Delhi. Established in the later part of the 18th century, the Chennai meteorological centre is considered one of the first modern astronomical-cum-meteorological observatory in the East, way before the establishment of the Indian Meteorological Department in 1875. History Madras Observatory in 1880 Systematic meteorological observations in Chennai started much earlier than the actual establishment of the India Meteorological Department in 1875. The city is home to one of the first modern astronomical and meteorological observatory in the East, established at Egmore before 1792. The Madras Observatory, as it was known then, was established by Sir Charles Oakeley, the then Governor of Madras under the East India Company, in 1792 \\"for promoting the knowledge of Astronomy, Geography and Navigation in India\\", marking the beginning of the history of Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai. Oakeley was supported by William Petrie, a member of the Madras Government, who had built an astronomical observatory at his own expense 5 years earlier in 1786. The primary purpose of the observatory was to spread astronomy among the masses, rather than weather observation. For over a century, it was the only astronomical observatory in India that exclusively worked on the stars. Among the astronomers at the observatory were Norman Robert Pogson, Michael Topping and John Goldingham. By 1899, it had been relegated to gathering weather-related data. The 15-feet tall granite pillar monument weighing 10 tons, which carried the original transit equipment, is still preserved and carries the name of the architect, Michael Topping Arch, and the year AD MDCCXCII. Inscriptions in Tamil and Telugu were carved on the pillar in order that \\"posterity may be informed a thousand years hence of the period when the mathematical sciences were first planted by British liberality in Asia\\". J. Goldingham, FRS, became the first astronomer of the observatory, who started recording the meteorological observations in 1796. In 1840, Captain S. O. E. Ludlow began recording meteorological observations on an hourly basis. In 1855, William Stephen Jacob of the East India Observatory in Madras found orbital anomalies in the binary star 70 Ophiuchi that he claimed are evidence of an extrasolar planet‚Äîthe first exoplanet false alarm. The \\"discovery\\" began a 140-year period of other exoplanet discovery false alarms, although no actual planets were discovered. From 1861, N. R. Pogson held the post of astronomer of the observatory for 30 years. He also held the post of meteorological reporter to the Madras government for many years, who was assisted in his work by his wife and daughter. In 1875, the India Meteorological Department, also known as the Met Office, was established at New Delhi, which is the chief body of national meteorological service in India and is the principal government agency in all matters relating to meteorology, seismology and allied subjects. The same year, daily weather reports started coming out at the Madras observatory. When the observatory moved to Kodaikanal, astronomical observations ceased at the Madras observatory, which was then used only for weather forecast. In 1899, R. L. Jones, a professor of physics at the Madras Presidency College, was appointed as part-time meteorologist of the observatory. The post was abolished in 1926 and a full- time assistant meteorologist was appointed. The observatory, which was issuing the Madras Daily Weather Report since October 1893 and supplying the time signal throughout the Indian Telegraph system, was reduced to the status of an ordinary pilot balloon observatory in 1931. The Regional Meteorological Centre at Chennai was established on 1 April 1945 under a deputy director general of the India Meteorological Department to supervise and co-ordinate meteorological services in the Southern region of India, which covers the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Union Territories of Puducherry and Lakshadweep. With the formation of the Regional Meteorological Centre, the storm-warning work for the seaports on the east coast of India from Kalingapatnam southwards was transferred to Chennai's Meenambakkam centre in 1945. The meteorological activities were bifurcated into marine and aviation for efficient functioning of the storm-warning services and separate storm-warning centre was established at Nungambakkam in 1969. The responsibility of storm-warning task for the ports on the west coast of India from Karwar southwards too was transferred from Mumbai to Chennai in 1969. Functions The Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai is located at 50 (New No. 6) College Road, Nungambakkam, between Good Shepherd School and Women's Christian College. The three meteorological centres in South India function at Hyderabad, Bangalore and Thiruvananthapuram serving the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala, respectively, under the technical and administrative control of the Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai. With the establishment of the additional cyclone-warning centres at Bhubaneshwar and Visakhapatnam, the storm-warning centres at Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai were named as Area Cyclone-Warning Centres (ACWC) and the storm-warning centres at Visakhapatnam, Bhubaneshwar and Ahmedabad as Cyclone-Warning Centres (CWC). CWCs at Visakhapatnam, Bhubaneshwar and Ahmedabad function under the control of the ACWCs at Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai, respectively. The ACWC supervises and coordinates the non-aviation forecasting work at the meteorological centres functioning under it. Aviation Data from the Chennai Doppler weather radar is currently being used by the Chennai airport. The aviation weather forecasting activities, which are required by pilots and airport authorities, are controlled and coordinated by the Aerodrome Meteorological Office at Chennai Airport in Meenambakkam. Seismology and hydrology Under RMC Chennai, conventional seismological observatories are functioning at Thiruvananthapuram, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Minicoy and Salem. In 1997, seismological observatories were established at Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram and Visakhapatnam under Global Seismological Network (GSN). In addition, an observatory under World Wide Standardised Seismological Network (WWSSN) functions at Kodaikanal and a broadband system functions at Mangalore. The hydrology section at RMC Chennai periodically inspects about 2,000 rain gauge stations maintained by organisations such as railways and state governments. Public forecasts and warnings The non-aviation forecasting work, including cyclone warnings, is supervised and co-ordinated by the ACWC at Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai, by means of the Cyclone Detection Radar. The Cyclone Detection Radars are located at Chennai, Machilipatnam, Vishakhapatnam, Karaikal and Kochi which track tropical cyclones over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. The cyclone warning bulletins are disseminated to remote centres in the coastal districts from the Cyclone Warning Dissemination System (CWDS) unit in Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai. The Regional Meteorological Centre and other Meteorological Centres periodically inspects the observatories to ensure the accuracy of meteorological observations and all the instruments at the observatories are calibrated at least once in 2 years. The Cyclone Detection Radar Station in Chennai is located at the Port Trust Building of the Chennai Port. Since 1978, Agromet Advisory Units are functioning at RMC Chennai and other meteorological centres under it. These units regularly issue Agromet Advisory Bulletins twice a week benefiting the farming community in their respective states. In 2018, the IMD revealed its plan to provide tailor-made weather forecasts for various sectors including agriculture, health, railways, power, and tourism. Specialised weather forecasts provided by the RMC could help in planning operations in the respective sectors and taking contingency measures during emergencies. Observation The Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai maintains 121 surface observatories of which 53 are departmental observatories and 68 are part-time observatories. In addition, it maintains 13 pilot balloon observatories, 10 Rawin stations and 1 Radiosonde station. There are also Port Meteorological offices at Chennai, Kochi and Visakhapatnam, which interact with masters of ships and shipping companies and other marine interests. Staff More than 1,400 personnel including 300 officers work in various offices under Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai which includes 3 meteorological centres, 1 area cyclone warning centre, 1 cyclone warning centre, 6 cyclone detection radar stations and 17 aviation meteorological offices (AMOs). The IMD also maintains Voluntary Observing Fleet (VOF) through the Port Meteorological Office at the Chennai Port comprising ships of merchant navy, Indian Navy and foreign agencies. In 1984, a training unit was started at RMC Chennai to conduct basic meteorological training courses, each course spanning 4 months. More than 1,000 trainees have been trained so far in about 50 batches. Additional services The Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai also issues Farmers' Weather Bulletin, a bulletin on weather-based agro-advisory services for the Cauvery delta zone in Tamil Nadu. This information is available both in English and Tamil on Tuesdays and Fridays based on the weather forecast received from the centre. Developments In June 1995, High-Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) direct readout ground station was established at RMC Chennai. This receives AVHRR satellite imageries and TOVS data from polar-orbiting NOAA satellites. The IMD has plans to replace its S-band 10 cm Cyclone Detection Radar (CDR) network with modern Doppler weather radars (DWRs) in a phased manner. Although the decision to set up the DWR network was taken in the 1990s and funds allocated, the first DWR units are being installed only in the 2000s. Two DWRs, METEOR-1500S, imported from Gematronik Gmbh, a German firm, at a cost of 130 million each, have been installed at the Regional Meteorological Centres in Chennai and Kolkata. The Chennai DWR is operational since 2001‚Äì2002. In the same period, a High Wind Speed Recorder (HWSR) was installed at the Chennai centre. In 2003‚Äì2004, a laser ceilometer was installed at Chennai airport for reporting data on height of base of low cloud for aviation. During the same period, automatic message switching systems was also installed at the Chennai International Airport. Chennai is one of the five state-of-the-art regional message switching centres connected with the central hub in IMD's National Meteorological Telecommunication Centre (NMTC) at New Delhi. Other regional systems are located at Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Guwahati. The city's first automatic weather station was installed at the RMC in Nungambakkam in 2007. As part of its 9,200-million modernisation plan, the Department of Meteorology plans to install Doppler Weather Radar in Chennai. At present, data from the manual observatory in Meenambakkam is being used for forecasting weather. The Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai will install an automatic weather unit at Meenambakkam in 2011 as part of its modernisation project, which aims to improve weather monitoring facilities. The department set up two more in the suburbs of Madhavaram and Ennore recently. With the new automated weather stations to be installed, the state of Tamil Nadu would have 42 such facilities. At present, the staff of Meteorological Department and of other government agencies such as Water Resources Department, manually measure the rainfall in facilities set up in some parts of the city. For the first time in the city, the department would create a mesoscale network of satellite-based automated rain gauges to cover areas within the radius of 5 km. In the first phase, 10 such facilities would be installed in various localities of the city. The localities where such rain gauges are to come up are Chembarambakkam, Avadi, Kolapakkam, Puzhal, Anna University, Taramani, Pallikaranai and Tambaram. The department is in the process of selecting one more site. In March 2012, following Delhi and Mumbai, RMC Chennai started installing ten 50-feet automatic rain gauge (ARG) stations to provide location-specific weather data. Equipped to measure humidity, rainfall and temperature, they will help make accurate forecasts, specifying the rainfall variability. Hourly data from the ARG stations are transmitted to a geostationary satellite, which re-transmits the data, which help to validate the measurements from the Doppler radar, to the receiving earth station at Pune. The ARGs are run on solar power. The first one was installed in Sholinganallur followed by Taramani, Anna University, Hindustan University, LMOIS Kolapakkam, Poonamallee, Chembarambakkam, Puzhal, Kattupakkam and Avadi.

Cases of spastic CP are further classified according to the part or parts of the body that are most affected. Such classifications include spastic diplegia, spastic hemiplegia, spastic quadriplegia, and in cases of single limb involvement, spastic monoplegia. Spastic cerebral palsy affects the motor cortex of the brain, a specific portion of the cerebral cortex responsible for the planning and completion of voluntary movement. Spastic CP is the most common type of overall cerebral palsy, representing roughly 80% of cases. Spastic CP is a permanent condition and will affect an individual across the lifespan. The brain injury that causes spastic CP remains stable over time, but the way spasticity affects a person can change. For example, with age they may develop bone deformities from the pull of spastic muscles, muscular deterioration, and loss of range of motion in a joint. Thus, individuals with spastic CP often have different support needs with time. Signs and symptoms People with the spastic type of CP typically have muscles that are \\"tight\\" or stiff due to high muscle tone. Symptoms of spastic cerebral palsy vary as the disability can affect individuals differently. However, they typically appear in infancy and early childhood and most children are diagnosed in the first two years of life. The main indicator of spastic cerebral palsy is a delay in reaching motor milestones. The following are some common early signs, though the presence of a listed symptom does not definitively mean that a child has spastic CP: Prior to 6 months * Legs crossing when a child is picked up, also called scissoring * Stiffness * Head \\"lagging\\" when the child is picked up 6‚Äì10 months * Fisting one hand * Difficulty rolling * Difficulty bringing hands together Older than 12 months of age * Difficulty crawling * Difficulty standing even with support Walking with an unsteady, uneven, or stiff gait Spastic CP is distinguished from other forms of cerebral palsy by its prominent symptom of spasticity or stiff, tight movements and gait patterns such as the scissor gait. However, spasticity as a symptom is also seen in other conditions such as stroke and multiple sclerosis. Thus, the presence of spasticity alone does not warrant a conclusive diagnosis of spastic cerebral palsy. Changes in spasticity and corresponding postures may also occur with other brain activity, such as excitement, fear or anxiety, or even pain, which increase muscle tension. A person with spastic CP will commonly show, in addition to higher muscle tone, persistent primitive reflexes, greater stretch reflexes, plantar reflex, and ankle clonus. A third of people with cerebral palsy have seizures - this is most common in spastic CP. Audiovisual, cognitive compromise and behavioral disorders can occur. Cause Spastic cerebral palsy is caused by malformation of or damage to the parts of the brain that control movement. What exactly makes some children susceptible to such brain damage is often unknown but it is believed that cerebral palsy may be the result of causal pathways, or chains of events that cause or increase the likelihood of brain injury. Most of the time, children are born with the brain damage resulting in spastic cerebral palsy, but a small percentage experience the damage shortly after birth following a stroke, head injury, or infection. The following are types of brain damage that can result in spastic cerebral palsy: * cerebral dysgenesis * periventricular leukomalacia * brain bleeds * Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy  Risk factors  The following medical conditions are associated with increased likelihood of spastic cerebral palsy, as well as with other types of cerebral palsy: * Preterm birth/ low birthweight * Multiple births * Incompatible blood type between mother and fetus * Exposure to toxins * Complicated labor  Diagnosis  There is no single test to diagnose spastic cerebral palsy. It is typically diagnosed by age 2, though milder cases may go undetected for a longer time. A doctor will typically use a series of tests to assess developmental progress in growth, muscle control, coordination, vision, hearing, and posture. Continuous loss of motor skills likely indicates a condition other than spastic CP such as a genetic muscle disease Some metabolic disorders mimic spastic cerebral palsy and can be ruled out using a Magnetic resonance imaging test (MRI). Some tests to assess a child suspected to have spastic cerebral palsy are: * Cranial ultrasound * CT scan * Magnetic resonance imaging These tests are imaging techniques used to produce pictures of the brain and to examine them for areas of damage that indicate a diagnosis of spastic cerebral palsy. A child with a spastic CP diagnosis will likely be referred to screening for other conditions associated with spastic cerebral palsy such as epilepsy (seizure disorder), intellectual disability, and visual impairment. Types Scientific classifications The types of spastic cerebral palsy are generally distinguished by the primary areas of the body that are affected. *Spastic hemiplegia Hemiplegia is a type of cerebral palsy affecting one vertical half of the body (such as one arm and one leg). The affected side of the body is opposite the affected area of the brain in hemiplegia. For example, if the right side of the brain is damaged, the person will have weakness or paralysis on the left side of the body. People with hemiplegia typically favor an arm or hand and may keep the weaker hand in a fist. Typically, people that have spastic hemiplegia are the most ambulatory of all the forms, although they generally have dynamic equinus (a limping instability) on the affected side and are primarily prescribed ankle-foot orthoses to prevent said equinus.Birol Balaban, Evren Yasar, Ugur Dal, Kamil Yazicioglu, Haydar Mohur & Tunc Alp Kalyon \\"The effect of hinged ankle-foot orthosis on gait and energy expenditure in spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy\\" Disability and Rehabilitation, January 2007; 29(2): 139‚Äì144 *Spastic diplegia describes spastic CP in which muscle tightness predominantly occurs in the legs. The arms may be somewhat affected or not affected at all. *Spastic monoplegia is one single limb being affected. *Spastic triplegia is three limbs being affected. *Spastic quadriplegia is all four limbs more or less equally affected. People with spastic quadriplegia are rarely able to ambulate without assistance and may not stand at all. Among the forms of spastic CP, quad CP is more likely to co-occur with seizures and mild to moderate intellectual disability. In spastic cerebral palsy in children with low birth weights, 25% of children had hemiplegia, 37.5% had quadriplegia, and 37.5% had diplegia. No one person with a particular type of spastic CP presents in exactly the same way. Treatment Baclofen There is no cure for spastic cerebral palsy and no way to reverse the initial brain injury. However, various treatments and assistive devices can help mitigate pain and allow those affected to have a higher quality of life. Different combinations of treatments are right for each individual and are determined by individuals and their care team. Some common interventions are: * Physical therapy- exercises to develop balance and strength and to learn skills such as walking, rolling, or driving a wheelchair. * Occupational therapy- therapy to help an individual develop strategies to complete activities of daily living such as dressing, toileting, and bathing either independently or with a level of assistance that is safe and comfortable. * Orthotics- braces and splints to improve posture and positioning (usually on legs or arms). * Assistive devices- Wheelchairs, crutches, and walkers may help someone with spastic CP navigate safely. Different devices may be used in different settings or for longer distances. People with cerebral palsy use 3-5 times the energy as those without when moving; thus, a device such as a wheelchair may reduce fatigue. * Speech therapy- Therapy to help someone speak more clearly, swallow more safely, or use a communication device such as a DynaVox * Medication- Certain medications can reduce stiffness from overactive muscles and decrease pain. Examples are botulinum toxin or baclofen, with the latter delivered orally or via an intrathecal pump. * Surgery- In some cases, orthopedic and/or neurological surgeries are recommended when pain and stiffness interfere with participation in meaningful activities and other treatments are not effective. Prognosis Every case of spastic cerebral palsy is different. Some people with this type of CP can accomplish activities of daily living independently, while some need the assistance of a personal care aide for certain tasks, and others need 24-hour support. About 1/3 of people with cerebral palsy cannot walk, about 1/2 have intellectual disabilities, and 3/4 experience some level of chronic pain. There is limited research on adults with spastic CP. The brain injury causing CP does not progress or change, but the functional impact and thus, one's needs may change with age. Some issues specific to adults with spastic and other forms of cerebral palsy are: * Premature aging * Fatigue * Pain * Arthritis * Depression and anxiety * Post impairment syndrome Regardless of their particular expression of spastic cerebral palsy, affected individuals can lead fulfilling lives. Improved physical accessibility in society and increased social acceptance can increase community participation. Workforce participation of people with CP has almost doubled in the last four decades. Social inclusion and the presence or absence of policy to address discrimination, in addition to medical intervention, influences the outlook for people living with spastic cerebral palsy.

The movement can be associated with cultural history, history of representations and histoire des mentalit√©s.Mucchielli, 1995 The new history movement's inclusive definition of the proper matter of historical study has also given it the label total history. The movement was contrasted with the traditional ways of writing history which focused on politics and 'great men'. The new history rejected any insistence on composing historical narrative; an over-emphasis on administrative documents as basic source materials; concern with individuals' motivations and intentions as explanatory factors for historical events; and the old belief in objectivity. The approach was rejected by Marxist historians because it downplayed what Marxists believed was the central role of class in shaping history.G. Bois, \\"Marxisme et histoire nouvelle\\", in Le Goff, ed. Nouvelle Histoire, 375‚Äì93. History in schools The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the Nouvelle Histoire, as disseminated in the 1960s and 1970s by Cahiers p√©dagogiques and Enseignement and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation p√©dagogique (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis Fran√ßois, dean of the history/geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education, advised teachers to provide historic documents and promote \\"active methods\\", which would give pupils \\"the immense happiness of discovery\\". Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterised traditional teaching and left bored students. Traditionalists protested loudly that it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.Abby Waldman, \\"The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s\\", History Workshop Journal Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199‚Äì221 online Germany The \\"Nouvelle histoire\\" became controversial after 1945 in German historiography, where it especially influenced medieval studies.Lutz Raphael, Die Erben von Bloch und Febvre: Annales-Geschichtsschreibung und nouvelle histoire in Frankreich 1945‚Äì1980 (Stuttgart, 1994) However most German historians considered the approach too positivistic for their taste, and not philosophical enough.Miri Rubin, The Work of Jacques Le Goff and the Challenges of Medieval History (1997) p 81 See also * Historiography Notes Further reading * Burgui√®re, Andr√©.

A dark folk song, it has been interpreted as an attack on Lennon's former business manager Allen Klein but Lennon was in fact addressing the song to himself, in a similar fashion to The Beatles' track Nowhere Man. The song contains a lick performed by violins and horns in the chorus that's reminiscent of Lennon's song \\"How Do You Sleep?\\", an attack on his former Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney. Recording In 1973, before work began on Mind Games, John Lennon recorded an acoustic demo of \\"Steel and Glass\\". While Lennon's ideas were taking shape, it was largely based on a single piano chord ‚Äì from the final studio recording. Before recording Walls and Bridges in July 1974, Lennon spent around 10 days in pre-production at Sunset Studios and Record Plant East, New York. During this time he rehearsed a few songs with the musicians he had recruited for the sessions. Lennon admitted to a Detroit radio station, during an interview in 1974, that he reused \\"licks\\" from a certain song, in response to the interviewer bringing up the similarity of \\"Steel and Glass\\", and what he was wondering could be a second part to the Paul McCartney dig \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" Release An alternative take of \\"Steel and Glass\\" was included on the posthumous collection Menlove Ave., released in 1986. Take 8 was released on the 1998 box set John Lennon Anthology. Take 9 was the master used for Walls and Bridges.  Reception  In a contemporary mixed review for Walls and Bridges, Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone found \\"Steel and Glass\\" \\"boring and needless\\" but added that \\"its unalloyed hatred is peculiarly compatible with the optimism of [\\"#9 Dream\\" and \\"Surprise, Surprise\\"].\\" Writing for the same magazine in 2010, David Fricke named \\"Steel and Glass\\" as one of Lennon's most underappreciated songs, stating that the strings sound \\"like piercing needles\\" and \\"the phasing on Lennon's voice makes him sound like a hissing snake.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called \\"Steel and Glass\\" one of the \\"best moments\\" on Walls and Bridges, praising how Lennon opens up with his emotions on the song.  Cover  The song was covered by American rock band Candlebox on the tribute album Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon. Anglo-Swedish rock band Alberta Cross have also covered the song.

Unity Dow (sometimes abbreviated Attorney General v. Dow) was a High Court case in the Republic of Botswana. The plaintiff, Unity Dow, was a citizen of Botswana, married to a non-citizen, whose children had been denied citizenship under a provision of the Citizenship Act of 1984. This Act conferred citizenship on a child born in Botswana only if \\"a) his father was a citizen of Botswana; or b) in the case of a person born out-of-wedlock, his mother was a citizen of Botswana.\\" The plaintiff claimed that this provision violated guarantees of the Constitution of Botswana. The High Court agreed, holding that the provision infringed: *the right to liberty; *the right not to be expelled from Botswana; *the right not to be subjected to degrading treatment; and *the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of sex. The Court concluded that the right to liberty had been infringed because the provision hampered a woman's free choice to marry a non-citizen and, in fact, undermined marriage. The Court also decided that the right not to be expelled from Botswana was infringed because, if the plaintiff's resident permit was not renewed, she would be forced to leave Botswana if she desired to stay with her family. Finally, the Court stated that the right not to be subjected to degrading treatment was infringed because any law discriminating against women constitutes an offense against human dignity. This decision was subsequently upheld by the Botswana Court of Appeal.

Early life and education A member of the Ga-Dangme people of Accra, Evans-Anfom was born on 7 October 1919 at the Evans family house, High Street, Accra. His father, William Quarshie Anfom, was of Shai and Nzema origin. His mother, Mary Evans, was the daughter of William Timothy Evans, a teacher-catechist of the Basel Mission Middle School or the Salem School at Osu. The Evans family was a well-known Euro-African Ga family on the Gold Coast. In 1925, he enrolled at the Government Boys School in Jamestown. He attended the Presbyterian middle boarding school, the Salem School at Osu where the principal at the time, Carl Henry Clerk encouraged him to apply for a Cadbury Scholarship for study at Achimota School instead of going the normal teacher-training route at the Basel Mission-founded Presbyterian teacher training seminary at Akropong, now known as the Presbyterian College of Education, Akropong. He was elected the School Prefect of Achimota School. In January 1939, he enrolled in the inter-preliminary medical course of Science at Achimota. In that course, he received advanced training in physics, chemistry, botany and zoology. At Achimota, he won a Gold Coast medical scholarship in 1941 to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1947. He also studied in a postgraduate diploma course in tropical medicine (DTM&H;), completing in 1950.  Medical career and professorship  Evans-Anfom worked in various hospitals in the government medical system: Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Dunkwa-On-Offin Government Hospital, Tarkwa Government Hospital, the Kumasi Central Hospital, Tamale Government Hospital and Effia Nkwanta Hospital in Sekondi. During his long medical career, he worked with other medical trailblazers such as Susan Ofori- Atta and Matilda J. Clerk, the first and second Ghanaian women physicians respectively. A pioneering medical educator himself, he was approached by the first Ghanaian surgeon, Charles Odamtten Easmon in 1963 for a teaching professorship position at the then newly established University of Ghana Medical School, an offer he eventually accepted. He also did medical outreach in the Congo in the 1960s. In 1996, he was adjudged the \\"Alumnus of the Year\\" by his alma mater, the University of Edinburgh for \\"his major contribution to the development of medicine in the Congo and to medical education in Ghana.\\" In 1958, Evans-Anfom co-founded the Ghana Medical Association together with Charles Odamtten Easmon, Silas Dodu, Anum Barnor and Dr. Schandorf. Term as Vice-Chancellor Dr Anfom served as the second Vice-Chancellor of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) from 1967 to 1973. At KNUST, Anfom first introduced the ceremony commonly known as \\"Matriculation\\" into the university entry ceremonies. He has chaired a myriad of committees, boards and missions, both locally and on the international scene in Africa, Europe and North America.  Commissioner of Education  Evans-Anfom served as the Commissioner of Education under the military governments of Fred Akuffo of the Supreme Military Council and later, Jerry John Rawlings led Provisional National Defence Council in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He was a member of the Council of State in the Hilla Limann government from 1979 to 1981. Emmanuel Evans-Anfom was also a Chairman of the National Council for Higher Education (now National Council for Tertiary Education), the Chairman of the Education Commission, President of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences (1987‚Äì90) and Chairman of the West African Examinations Council (WAEC).  Personal life  Evans-Anfom has four children with his first wife Leonora Evans, a West Indian American who died in 1980. In 1984, he married Elise Henkel. He became a Founding President of the Gold Coast Hockey Association in 1950. He has served as a Presbyter of the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, Osu, where he is a congregant.

His career also encompassed senior positions in the Irish Army School of Music and in the music department of Radio √âireann. Early years and education Duff was born in Dublin to John William Duff, a native of King's County (now County Offaly), and his wife Annie Kathleen Hickey. Duff was a chorister in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin and studied at the Royal Irish Academy of Music under Charles Herbert Kitson. He completed his education at Trinity College, Dublin where he obtained his primary degree in arts and music. In 1942, he was awarded a doctorate in music following an examination.Joseph J.

Compositions Arthur Duff was not interested in making grand statements in his music but preferred to explore what he termed \\"the laneways and the miniature\\". The lack of a strong classical music tradition in Ireland led him, like many of his Irish contemporaries, to seek guidance from the great names in English music.The Irish Times, \\"Irish composers have no genius to guide them\\", 31 March 1947 The influence of Peter Warlock and Frederick Delius, for instance, can be heard in his small output of orchestral compositions.The Irish Times, \\"Music of Arthur Duff\\", 12 September 1941 Duff started off writing for the human voice.

Ictaluridae includes bullheads, madtoms, channel catfish, and blue catfish. Noturus exilis is found in the central portion of the Mississippi River basin, but is most abundant in Ozarkian streams. Slender madtoms occur west of the Mississippi River in the Ozarks of Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Missouri north to southern Wisconsin and Minnesota. It also occurs east of the Mississippi River in the uplands of Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky in the Tennessee, Cumberland, and Green drainages. Nelson first described Noturus exilis in 1876. The slender madtom is moderately large with a terminal to sub terminal mouth, flat head, small eyes, and black marginal bands on the median fins. Most slender madtoms are less than . Noturus flavus and Noturus nocturnus are rather similar in shape and coloration to Norturus exilis. Slender madtoms inhabit small to medium-sized streams, in riffle and flowing pool habitats with coarse gravel to slab rock substrates. The presence of a shelter object, such as a large rock, seems to be important in habitat selection. Distribution Slender madtoms inhabit two disjunct areas of the Central Highlands: one in the Ozark Highlands ranging from eastern Kansas and Oklahoma to the southern tip of Illinois and including most of Missouri and northwest Arkansas, and another in the Eastern Highlands, from middle Tennessee and part of southeastern Kentucky, ranging into northern Alabama and Mississippi. The slender madtom also occurs as several smaller, isolated populations in Iowa, Illinois and southern Wisconsin and Minnesota. Slender madtoms have seen a decrease in population size from their previous habitat ranges. Due to habitat alteration along the small streams of the Tennessee drainage, this species may be in great danger of extirpation from Mississippi. It has also declined in the northern part of its range in Wisconsin, due primarily to agricultural runoff or alterations in river flow due to dams. The slender madtom's range has mostly likely decreased due to dam construction, channelization, and agricultural runoff. Ecology The slender madtom's diet consists of midges, mayflies, caddisflies, isopods, amphipods, and copepods, but ephemeroteran naiads and chironomid larvae make up a majority of their diet. Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) is a known predator of slender madtoms, which may be one reason why slender madtoms prefers a nocturnal lifestyle, seeking cover during the day when this visual predator is on the prowl. Embryo predation by Orconectes virilis (virile crayfish), Campostoma anomalum (central stoneroller) and Etheostoma caeruleum (rainbow darter) has also been noted. The slender madtom and the orangethroat darter (Etheostoma spectabile) also compete for and share the same diet. The slender madtom inhabits the rocky riffles and pools of creeks and small rivers, spending much of the day hiding under large rocks and emerging to feed at night. Slender madtoms feed preferably after dusk and before dawn. Slender Madtoms have also been observed in high percentages in vegetated patches and backwaters during late summer. The slender madtom can be found in streams with current speeds from 8‚Äì92 cm/s and can be found at depths between 5‚Äì42 cm. The slender madtom has never been a strong swimmer, which has reduced their dispersal over the centuries. Life history Mayden and Burr found that reproductive activity was concentrated from mid June through July at water temperatures of 23.5‚Äì29 ¬∞C in Southern Illinois. Large lowland rivers, such as the Missouri River and Mississippi River, have high silt loads, covering the gravel and rocks that madtoms require for nesting and diurnal refugia. Spawning sites are usually cavities excavated under large rocks, usually in pool areas. Nests have been found to contain 27‚Äì74 eggs and are protected by the male until the yolk sac absorbed by the juveniles. Hatching occurs within eight to nine days in 25 ¬∞C water. Individuals are one half the length of a one-year-old by three weeks. Summer is the season of greatest growth, particularly during the first two years of life, and in winter growth slows to a near standstill. Females are capable of spawning their first summer, especially in harsher northern conditions, as long as a critical size is attained (approximately 50 mm in southern Illinois). In contrast, males do not breed until two years of age. The ratio of ovary weight to adjusted body weight (GSI) increased in females in fall and spring, with greater rates of growth in mature adults. Slender madtom are usually or less in size with a maximum of about . Slender madtoms can live up to 5 years of age, but most have been collected between 1‚Äì3 years old. Adult slender madtoms are weak dispersers, with poor swimming abilities, a characteristic that may have contributed to the existence of two disjoint populations of the species. Current management Populations across the slender madtom's range have declined since the late 1970s. The species is nearly extirpated in Wisconsin, although once more widespread there than in Minnesota. Causes for decline may include siltation and turbidity in farming areas, and the dewatering of habitats by hydropower operations. Poor farming practices near streams could be contributing sediments and large amounts of nutrients into streams inhabited by slender madtoms and other species that make the overall ecosystem uninhabitable. Human uses have degraded the habitat and livelihood of the slender madtom and associated species. Predation and intraspecific and interspecific competition may also affect the survival of slender madtoms. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has done stream surveys but found very few slender madtom specimens. The slender madtom has not had a population assessment at the national level. The slender madtom is classified as endangered in Mammoth Cave National Park. The slender madtom is also classified as endangered in Wisconsin. No current management is being done to protect the slender madtom from outside pollutants and other detrimental factors. Some state agencies have surveyed streams for slender madtoms, but no management plan has been put in place. Sufficient research has not been collected on the slender madtom to determine the best method to create new habitat or restore the previous habitat to benefit the slender madtom for decades to come.

He was also a pioneer in engineering education in Ghana. Early life and education Robert Patrick Baffour (a.k.a. Papa Andoh) was born on 14 May 1912 in Elmina. His father was in the service of the British Civil Service in Nigeria as a Master of Schools. He was the first-born son of Robert Patrick Baffour Andoh and Maria Frederica Adwoa Kane (Okai). His paternal grandfather was the illustrious Chief Kweku Andoh of Elmina who served in Sir Garnet Wolseley's military campaign against Prempeh I, King of the Ashanti. He was made regent of Edina State upon the expulsion of Chief Kobina Gyan by the British. Baffour's paternal grandmother was the eldest daughter of Yaa Na Yakubu I of the Dagomba tribe named Napari. She was rescued from the Ashanti by Chief Andoh during the campaign against Prempeh and was given the name Efua Yendi. She was also known as Nana Awuyea. His maternal grandfather was Chief Nii Kofi Okai of the Gbese quarter, Accra, who was commonly known as Joseph H. Kane. He had a career as a scholar and a merchant. Baffour was also a great- grandson of George Emil Eminsang, who was the very first Western-educated lawyer on the Gold Coast. Between 1917 and 1926, Baffour attended various schools in Ghana and Nigeria: Catholic School in Elmina, Okar Government School in Nigeria and the Richmond College. Baffour attended the Mfantsipim School and obtained the Cambridge Senior School Certificate with exemption from London Matriculation. After secondary school, he achieved the singular honour of coming first in the Civil Service Examination of his time. Yet instead of joining the British Civil Service, he chose to continue his education at Achimota College to study engineering, where he was taught by Charles Deakin, a founding engineering instructor at the school. He became the first Ghanaian to obtain a University of London degree in mechanical engineering on Ghanaian soil. Career  Engineering and public service  Baffour began his career with the Gold Coast Railways and later became a lecturer of engineering at Achimota School. Among his inventions and innovations were the 'Descender gear‚Äô, an anti-slipping device for locomotives, '250 classes locomotive' and a navigational clockwork device for aircraft. He also held several administrative posts in the civil service, among them that of Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Transport and Communication. He was instrumental in the selection of the sites for the Akosombo Dam, the planning and expansion of the Tema city and Harbour, the Elmina Fishing Harbour Project in addition to the founding of the Nautical College and the Black Star Line. When Baffour worked at the Accra City Council, he was involved in automobile design, specifically the 'Ewurakua' and 'King Kong' cars. He was also involved in the planning of the Kaneshie Estates using pre-fabricated building technology. During his career, Baffour held several distinguished posts, including as chairman of the Integrated Iron & Steel Commission and the first chairman of the Ghana Atomic Energy Board. He was a driving force in the fundraising for he Opon Manse Steel Works. He was the instigator of the Kwabenya Nuclear Plant project that was halted, six months from completion, by the military coup against Kwame Nkrumah. In 1962, Baffour was elected president of the 6th regular session of the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Vice- chancellor Eventually during the Nkrumah regime, he was the principal actor in transforming the then Kumasi College of Technology into the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in 1960, becoming its first vice- chancellor in 1961. Baffour served as vice-chancellor of KNUST from 1961 to 1967. This was after he had served in the capacity of principal of the university's predecessor from 1960 to 1961.

This species dwells in small to medium-sized streams where they can be found under gravel, rubble, and slab rock. They feed mostly on insects such as: stone, cattus and mayfly larvae.Noturus fasciatus. Fishbase. Retrieved 2011- 11- 18 Geographic distribution The saddled madtom is found in the Duck River system and two minor tributaries of the Tennessee River in the western part of Tennessee and has not yet been found in other streams or states. It is believed that this species can be found in neighboring streams and river systems but until proper research is conducted, it remains a theory.Burr, M. Cook, K. Eisenhour, D. Taylor, C. 1996. Conservation status review of the saddled madtom in the Duck River system, Tennessee. Journal of the Tennessee Academy of Science. 1996. 71. 2: 41-46 Ecology A quantitative diet analysis has not yet been performed on the saddled madtom. However, using diet information of other species that are closely related to, even so closely related that they are known to interbreed with each other, suggest that they are invertivores, feeding mostly on insects, such as cattus, may, and stone fly larva.Hardman, M. Near, T. 2006. Phylogenetic relationships of Noturus stanauli and N-crypticus (Siluriformes: Ictaluridae), two imperiled freshwater fish species from the southern United States. Copeia. 2006. 3: 378-383 Feeding on these insects can present competition with other species, such as salamanders and trout species.Noturus fasciatus. Ecology of Life. Comprehensive description of Noturus fasciatus Retrieved 2011- 11- 18 The saddled madtom is a small species, which allows it to be prey to larger species such as: rock, small mouth, and largemouth bass. Other species that may prey on this species are larger, piscivorous fish, brown trout being a good example. Madtoms in general, have a distinct adaptation that allows them to secrete venom through delivery glands located on the dorsal and pectoral spines. This venom is intended to injure predators and keep them safe from predation.Edge, J. Simmons, A. 2011. Evolution of venom delivery systems in madtom catfishes. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society. 2011. 102. 1: 115-129 Another strategy that allows for less predation on the saddled madtom is that it lives in riffles under gravel and rubble. Life history The saddled madtom has not been researched enough to determine things such as when, where and how often it breeds, how long it takes to reach sexual maturity, or the life span of the species. Using sister species, such as Noturus elegans, crypticus, and baileyi, we can gather a general idea of its life history. Based on the sister species, the saddled madtom breeds between late May and August, breeding on rocks and gravel substrate. The average brood size would be around 50 and the average life span would be two years, reaching sexual maturity after the first year of life.Noturus fasciatus. Florida Museum of Natural History. Retrieved 2011-11-18 Human impacts on this species include dam construction, which prohibits the species from spreading. Also erosion and run off pollution from agriculture affect the health of this species. Management As of 2011, there were no specific management practices in place to protect the saddled madtom. The saddled madtom is currently listed as G-2, which is imperiled and is also believed to be on the decline in numbers due to pollution, erosion, and siltation problems.

MapleStory Adventures is a simplified version of MapleStory‚Äôs basic gameplay and includes creating an avatar, fighting monsters and completing quests. Although the gameplay is altered for the social networking conventions and includes freemium content, the main storyline of the game remains the same. MapleStory Adventures is free to play, but players have the option of purchasing premium content. On July 31, 2013, the game was shut down and removed from Facebook. Gameplay MapleStory Adventures is a 2D scrolling social network game on Facebook. At the start of the game, players must create a customizable avatar and select a class. Players may choose to play as either a Warrior, a Magician, and, as of 8th March 2012, a bowman/woman or thief. During the game, players may move anywhere they wish across a 2D side scrolling representation of ‚ÄúMaple World.‚Äù The game is composed of ‚Äúquests,‚Äù which usually consist of killing a certain number of monsters and collecting various items that drop from their corpses. Players will receive some quests automatically, and others can be obtained by clicking on various NPCs (Non- Playing Characters). By clicking on a monster, the player delivers strikes which will cause the monster a certain amount of damage, dependent upon the player‚Äôs level and the equipment they wield. Each strike costs a certain amount of energy, drawn from a pool that slowly replenishes in real time. Also, the energy bar will decrease as you take damage from monsters. As players level up, this energy gauge will grow. Levels and skills When a player kills a monster, various items may drop from the corpse. These include blue stars, which may be collected to increase a player‚Äôs experience level, quest items, collection items, gold coins, and ‚Äúmystery boxes.‚Äù As a player's level increases, they can purchase better weapons, as well as challenge stronger monsters, obtain more crafting cauldrons, and more. As a player‚Äôs experience level rises, their power increases and they may use gold coins to purchase various skills. For higher-leveled skills, players will also need to obtain Skill Permits. Skill permits are available from monster drops and also from your friends. These skills can then be used to kill more difficult monsters in order to acquire better treasures. Equipment and items As a player levels up, they will have the opportunity to use gold coins to purchase various pieces of equipment that increase their attack power in the game. They may also purchase items that have purely cosmetic rare value. Other items that drop from monsters may be part of a ‚Äúgame collection.‚Äù Collections may be turned in for extra energy or other prizes at the shop. Monster collections, which are filled up as you slay more and more of those monsters allow you to get special powers over that monster such as the ability to tame it, the ability to summon it, and extra EXP from that monster. Mystery boxes provide a random gift when opened. These gifts can include a quantity of gold, consumables, or cosmetic clothing which do not increase attack power, and are for fashion only. Map MapleStory Adventures is played on a simplified version of Maple World. Areas in MapleStory Adventures that correspond to those in the original MapleStory game Victoria Island: include Henesys, Ellinia, Perion, Kerning City, Florina Beach And Skyscraper. Social interaction Like other Facebook games, MapleStory Adventures incorporates social networking aspects into the gameplay. Players may invite their friends to become adventuring companions. When they accept, each person may then hire the other to fight alongside them in the game. This grants the players extra energy during monster battles. Gifts Players may send each other free gifts. These include items that provide extra energy, keys to open mystery boxes, or objects that allow them to access higher level skills. Linking In the Open Beta phase of the game, players are allowed to link their MapleStory Adventures character to their PC Version MapleStory game to gain rewards for playing the Facebook version. Beta tests Nexon America held a Closed Beta Test for MapleStory Adventures from June 15 to June 26, 2011. Closed Beta keys were given to those who completed a survey on the MapleStory Adventures Facebook page within a designated period. Each participant was given five keys and encouraged to use the extras to invite friends to play. Additional keys were also given out periodically to Facebook fans throughout the Closed Beta. At the end of Closed Beta, Nexon America announced that the MapleStory Adventures Open Beta would begin ‚Äúat the end of July, 2011.‚Äù Open Beta began on July 27 at 4:00pm PST.

The composition of the monument includes four items: Taras Shevchenko, and three bas-relief figures complementing the composition. The central monument, sitting on a granite base approximately high, holds a young version of a standing Taras Shevchenko. Dressed in a long coat, the fashion at that time, he holds a palette and three paintbrushes and looks out into the distance. The figure is high and weighs . Three shorter bases hold artistic creations from his poetry. One of the bas-relief figures, standing and weighing , represents Haydamaky (referring to Haidamakas) an epic poem of Shevchenko's about the Cossack paramilitary bands that rose up against the szlachta (Polish nobility) in right-bank Ukraine in the 18th-century. The next, Kateryna with child (, ), recalls his early ballad about a Ukrainian girl seduced then abandoned by a Russian - symbolic of the tsarist imposition of serfdom in Ukraine and refers to Shevchenko's painting Kateryna.Taras Shevchenko: Kateryna (1842) The last, Banduryst (, ), referring to the Kobzar and Bandura,The Composition of the Monument a traditional Ukrainian stringed musical instrument shaped like a lute.

A Philosophical View of Reform is a major prose work by Percy Bysshe Shelley written in 1819-20 and first published in 1920 by Oxford University Press. The political essay is Shelley's longest prose work. Analysis Shelley composed A Philosophical View of Reform between November, 1819 and 20 May 1820, meant to address political developments in England at that time.Sandy, Mark. \\"A Philosophical View of Reform\\". The Literary Encyclopedia. First published 21 March 2002 accessed 20 July 2011. He advocated non-violence and a moderate response to the repressive measures imposed by the British government. One of the events he addressed was the Peterloo Massacre, which occurred on 16 August 1819, in St. Peter's Field near Manchester, where a peaceful demonstration seeking parliamentary reform was attacked by militia. The bookseller Richard Carlile had been found guilty of blasphemy by a jury in November, 1819 for printing an edition of The Age of Reason (1794-6) by Thomas Paine. The ‚ÄúSix Acts‚Äù had been promulgated in December which placed restrictions on public gatherings and freedom of the press. It was during this unstable political period in England in late 1819 when Shelley started writing A Philosophical View of Reform. Shelley told John and Maria Gisborne on 6 November: \\"I have deserted the odorous gardens of literature to journey across the great sandy desert of Politics.\\" Shelley proposed five reforms:Ripley, Brian. \\"Percy Bysshe Shelley's 'A Philosophical View of Reform'\\": www.shelley.235.ca/ #abolish the national debt. #disband the standing army. #abolish sinecures. #abolish tithes, and make all religions, all forms of opinion regarding the origin and government of the universe, equal under the law. #make justice inexpensive, certain, and speedy, and extend the institution of juries to every possible occasion of jurisprudence. Shelley opposed revolution, advocating instead gradual change through non- violence. He argued that individual and institutional reform went hand in hand. He maintained that poets, writers, and philosophers would stimulate reforms of the social institutions that would benefit everyone in society. Shelley informed his publisher Charles Ollier on 19 December 1819 that he sought A Philosophical View of Reform \\"to be an instructive and readable book, appealing from the passions to the reason of men\\", informing him that he would not finish it \\"this season\\". On 26 May 1820 he asked Leigh Hunt if he could find a publisher for the work: \\"Do you know any bookseller who wd publish for me an octavo volume entitled 'A philosophical View of Reform'. It is boldly but temperately written ‚Äì & I think readable ‚Äì It is intended for a kind of standard book for the philosophical reformers.\\" Mary Shelley had a transcript made of the manuscript with plans to publish the work. The political essay remained unpublished, however, until 1920 when it appeared for the first time in print in an edition published by Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press, with an introduction and appendix by Thomas William Rolleston.

Though they were originally published in magazines in the early 1950s, they had never been published in book form and are quite rare, described by the publisher as \\"the literary equivalent of buried treasure\\". The stories were discovered by Charles D. Cohen, a Massachusetts dentist and a Seuss scholar and biographer, who also contributed an introduction to the collection. Plots The seven stories included in the book are as follows: *\\"The Bippolo Seed\\" (60th-anniversary edition): a duck finds a rare seed that can grant wishes, but when a cat tells him to wish for more than he needs, to get money they end up losing the seed in the process. *\\"The Rabbit, the Bear, and the Zinniga-Zanniga\\": a rabbit escapes being eaten by convincing the bear that he has a rare but serious disorder. *\\"Gustav, the Goldfish\\": a boy overfeeds a goldfish, causing it to grow until it fills a cellar. It was later adapted by Helen Palmer as \\"A Fish out of Water.\\" *\\"Tadd and Todd\\": two identical twins don't like being the same, so they try to be different by enhancing their looks but fail. *\\"Steak for Supper\\": a boy brags about his steak dinner, causing strange beasts to follow him home, but it turns out to be stew. *\\"The Strange Shirt Spot\\": a boy gets dirt on himself, to his mother's dismay, so he tries to get it off but fails. *\\"The Great Henry McBride\\": a boy dreams of having five jobs, all at once. Publication The collection was published by Random House on September 27, 2011. The stories originally appeared in magazines in 1950 and 1951. Dr. Seuss died in 1991, and the stories were later rediscovered by Charles D. Cohen, a Massachusetts dentist and Seuss scholar. Cathy Goldsmith of Random House encountered the magazine stories in one of Cohen's eBay auctions, around 2001. Random House published Cohen's book The Seuss, the Whole Seuss and Nothing But the Seuss: A Visual Biography of Theodor Seuss Geisel in 2003. He also contributed an introduction to this collection.  Analysis  Some elements of the stories in this collection appeared in later books. The story \\"Gustav the Goldfish\\" was the basis for the Beginner Book A Fish out of Water. The book was written by Seuss's first wife Helen Palmer Geisel, illustrated by P. D. Eastman, and published in 1961.Nel 2007, p. 164 \\"Gustav the Goldfish\\" rhymes, unlike A Fish out of Water. Seuss later reused the basic plot of \\"The Strange Shirt Spot\\" for 1958's The Cat in the Hat Comes Back. In both stories, a character tries to remove a spot from various household items but only manages to transfer the spot to one object after another.Nel 2007, p. 116 The story \\"The Rabbit, the Bear, and the Zinniga-Zanniga\\" was recorded by Marvin Miller and released on the 1965 album Dr. Seuss presents...\\"Fox in Socks\\" and \\"Green Eggs & Ham\\" on RCA Records.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The tower dates from the 15th century. In 1868‚Äì70 the church, other than the tower and three Norman arches, was rebuilt in Perpendicular style by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. This cost ¬£5,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ), and was paid for from the will of Felix Slade, after whom the Slade School of Fine Art was named, and who had lived in a house nearby. The church was damaged by a fire in February 1933, and was rebuilt in 1934‚Äì35 by Austin and Paley at a cost of about ¬£9,000. Architecture The church is constructed in limestone rubble with sandstone dressings, and has Westmorland slate roofs. The plan consists of a four-bay nave, north and south aisles with chapels, a two-bay chancel, a south porch, and a west tower. The tower is in four stages with diagonal buttresses and an embattled parapet. It has a west doorway with a pointed arch, over which is a three-light window. Above this is small ogee-headed window. The bell openings have two lights. The tower is surmounted by a 19th-century pyramidal spire and a lead finial. The windows on the sides of the church have two or three lights, and the east window has four lights with trefoil heads.

Biography Childhood Nado Makhmudov was born on January 1, 1907, in the village of Gharanlugh, now Martuni, in Armenia. Nado's mother, Tare, was of noble birth. She came from the family of a wealthy Kurdish landowner (bey) but, due to an illness that disfigured her face, she was forced to marry a shepherd named Khdo. After losing his father at the young age of 10, Nado became a duazho (a shepherd's aid) in order to feed his mother and his little sister, resulting in a difficult childhood. While Nado's dream was to become an educated person, he was instead forced to tend the cattle from morning to night and work in the house of a wealthy landlord. In exchange for his excellent work and obedience, Nado was permitted to sit in the corner of the room during the private lessons of the landlord's son, and follow along. This way the little duazho learned to read and write, and came closer to realizing his dream of getting an education. Education In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution it became possible for young, talented and active men of the people, be it a Kurd or an Armenian, to receive a free education. Makhmudov was an active member of a working youth organization, so he received the opportunity to study in Aleksandropol (now Gyumri) in the High (Communist) Party School. He graduated from the Transcaucasian Party University and from the High Party School in Moscow. In addition to his Party education, Nado also received a university education and graduated from the History department of the Yerevan State University.Hayastani krdakan azgain khorhrdi pashtonatere, 02.02.2009 Political and social life Through the 1920s and until the very end of his life, Makhmudov lead an active political and social life, holding numerous high governmental positions: he was the head of several regions of Armenia during different periods of time. He was the minister of the municipal economy and head of the cotton trust of Armenia, as well as the deputy minister of transport. He was elected several times as a deputy to the legislatures of the USSR and Armenia. For his great achievements and contributions, he received high national awards. Throughout his life Nado Makhmudov acted for the good of his Kurdish people as well. He played a leading role in the establishment of Kurdish schools, a Kurdish newspaper (Ria Taza), Kurdish broadcasting on Armenian radio, and in the development of Kurdish culture and literature. In addition, he was focused on the strengthening of Armenian-Kurdish literary and social ties. Delving deeply into questions of the past and present of Kurdish people, he published articles in various newspapers and magazines about issues that concerned his compatriots. While in the USSR, Mustafa Barzani expressed a wish to meet him. Their historic meeting took place in Armenia, at Makhmudov's home. Literary life Makhmudov was not only a statesman and a public figure but a writer as well. In 1959 Makhmudov published his monograph \\"Kurdish People\\", about the history of the Kurdish people beginning with their ancient history and leading up to the present. This monograph remains an important source for orientalists. Makhmudov is also an author of numerous stories, tales, essays and memoirs, which were published in Kurdish, Armenian and Russian. They were warmly received by readers from Armenia, as well as those outside of the country. Among Makhmudov's friends were distinguished Armenian writers and poets such as Avetik Isahakyan, Derenik Demirchian and Nairi Zarian. For his literary achievements, Makhmudov became the member of the Soviet Union of Writers. Personal life Playing a great role in all of Makhmudov's achievements and successes was his wife, an Armenian named Emma Makhmudova (born Nalbandian), with whom he lived 60 years in a happy marriage. Emma sacrificed her own career and became Nado's loyal friend and supporter through all of his projects. The doors of their warm and friendly home were always open all, primarily for those who needed their help and assistance. Emma was affectionately named ‚Äúour Mama‚Äù by the Kurds. Nado and Emma raised three children. Their eldest daughter, Donara Makhmudova, became the first Kurdish woman in the USSR to receive an academic degree in medical sciences. Their second daughter, Dolores Makhmudova, taught at the University of Foreign Languages, and is a specialist in German linguistics. The youngest of the children, Saladin Makhmudov, worked for many years in the Design Bureau of Automobile Transportation.

He was \\"often a critic of the conventional wisdom.\\" He was remembered by climate scientists as \\"a giant\\" who \\"was brilliant at articulating the connections among technology, economics, culture, policy and politics.\\" Education Schipper attended the University of California at Berkeley. He earned Bachelor's degrees in Physics and Music in 1968, and a Ph.D. in Astrophysics. Career Schipper worked at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) for more than 20 years. In addition, he worked at the Energy and Resources Group at UC Berkeley, Shell International in London, as well as being Fulbright Scholar at the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics in Stockholm. He was a guest researcher at the World Bank, VVS Tekniska Foereningen, the OECD, and the Stockholm Environment Institute. He worked closely with the Global Business Network and Cambridge Energy Research Associates. He served on the editorial boards of five major journals and was a member of the Swedish Board for Transportation and Communications Research. For four years he was a member of the U.S. National Academy of Science‚Äôs Transportation Research Board‚Äôs Committee on Sustainable Transport and Committee on Developing Countries. At the time of his death, Schipper was a senior research scientist at both University of California Berkeley‚Äôs Global Metropolitan Studies and at the Precourt Institute of Energy Efficiency at Stanford University conducting research and policy analysis on efficient energy use in transportation systems. Energy Efficient Housing Schipper's first seminal contribution came in 1976, when he published an influential paper in Science pointing out that Sweden consumed far less energy per unit of economic activity than the United States did. His work on the energy efficiency of Swedish housing culminated in his 1985 book Coming in from the Cold with Stephen Meyers and Henry Kelly. Schipper testified before Congress on this subject in March 1984.Review of federal policies and building standards affecting energy conservation in housing Transportation Schipper shifted his primary attention to transport in the 1980s and started the Berkeley Lab‚Äôs International Energy Studies group with Jayant Sathaye, and the two co-led the group for many years. He was co- founder of EMBARQ, the World Resources Institute Center for Sustainable Transport, and remained as a senior associate emeritus. Climate Change From 1995 to 2001, he was a senior scientist at the International Energy Agency in Paris. He contributed to the Second and Third Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. He was due to act as Review Editor for the chapter on Transport in Working Group III's contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report, released in April 2014.http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/press-releases/ipcc- wg3-ar5-authors.pdf Legacy John Holdren, later to become Science Advisor to President Barack Obama, was the first person to hire Schipper as an energy specialist, at Berkeley in the early 1970s. He said ‚Äò‚ÄòLee was one of the first people to point out that people don‚Äôt want to consume energy, but they want to consume energy services, like transportation, comfortable rooms, cold beer and so forth. And that there was an enormous variation in the amount of energy needed to perform those services.‚Äô‚Äô Mark Levine, who was Schipper‚Äôs superviser for most his career at LBNL, said: \\"Lee was the founding father of a school of energy analysts, a tradition carried on with vigor in the Energy Analysis Department at LBNL.... The work he did has been carried on here. He created an important tradition of understanding energy by studying it from the bottom up, which means by end user.\\" Schipper broke new ground by analyzing energy data sector by sector and end-use by end-use in various countries and comparing them. He demonstrated that energy intensity did not correlate with GDP in any simple way and was able to show why. Personal He was described as being an irrepressible iconoclast with a wonderful knack of turning a phrase to excellent effect.

For example, in his view the \\"cash for clunkers\\" program‚Äîwhich offered rebates to people who bought a new car with better mileage than their old one‚Äîdid little to save energy, although it may have reduced air pollution. In many cases, buyers used the rebate to buy something bigger and more high-powered than they would have otherwise. \\"The effect is inverse of what we were hoping for\\" he said.

He won The Law Society Gazette Centenary Award for Human Rights in 2003, and was knighted in 2007 for services to human rights. In 2011 he was appointed Queen's Counsel. Bindman is a patron of Humanists UK (formerly the British Humanist Association). Family and early professional life Bindman was born and brought up in Newcastle upon Tyne to a family descended from Jewish immigrants. His father Gerald (1904‚Äì1974) was a GP who married Rachael Lena Doberman in 1929. Bindman attended the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, and then left Oriel College, Oxford, with two degrees in law: a BA (later converted to MA) and a postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law in 1956, qualifying as a solicitor three years later. Bindman is the husband of research scientist Lynn Janice Bindman, formerly reader in Physiology at UCL.Interview with Dr. Lynn Bindman 2015, published 2018 for the Physiology Society Oral History Archive He became a legal advisor to the Race Relations Board in 1966, a job he retained for 17 years, also following its merger into the Commission for Racial Equality. He also served as a legal advisor to Amnesty International and represented satirical magazine Private Eye. In the late 1980s, Bindman visited South Africa as part of an International Commission of Jurists delegation sent to investigate apartheid and subsequently became editor of a book on the topic, South Africa and the Rule of Law. Geoffrey has a second cousin who owns another law firm, Bindman Solicitors LLP trading as Bindman & Co, in Whickham, Newcastle upon Tyne. His brother is Professor David Bindman (born 1940), emeritus Durning-Lawrence professor of the history of art at University College London and research fellow at the Hutchins Center for African & African American Research at Harvard University. Bindmans LLP In 1974, Bindman established Bindmans LLP as a firm with the aim of \\"protecting the rights and freedoms of ordinary people.\\" Since then, he has personally acted as lawyer for numerous high-profile people including James Hanratty, Keith Vaz and Jack Straw. Bindman also continued his international human rights work, acting as a United Nations observer at the first democratic election in South Africa and representing Amnesty International's interests in the British litigation regarding Augusto Pinochet in the late 1990s. In 2001, Bindman was fined ¬£12,000 by the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal for acting despite having a conflict of interest, as well as for breach of confidentiality. It was remarked at the time that he was the \\"most eminent\\" lawyer ever to be brought before such a tribunal. In 2012, Andrew Hopper QC, who was a leading prosecutor before the Tribunal until 2002, reviewed Bindman's case. He found the main charge was at worst \\"a 'bare conflict' having no adverse consequence\\" and said the Tribunal's verdict on its seriousness was \\"incomprehensible\\". He also suggested the decision to prosecute and the level of the fine were reactions to Bindman's \\"robust\\" defence to the charges against him. Hopper sympathised with the view that Bindman was treated \\"disproportionately because of his stature in the profession\\". In September 2012, Bindman told BBC Radio 4 he agreed with Desmond Tutu that British Prime Minister Tony Blair should be prosecuted on the grounds that starting the Iraq War was a \\"crime of aggression\\" in breach of the United Nations Charter.

National road 2 has a short part of motorway on its starting place and it is only 1 kilometer long and that means it is the shortest motorway in Finland and National road 2 has another bypass in Pori which is about 5 kilometers long. The bypass in Pori towards Helsinki History Before National Road 2 got its present line, it ran first from Helsinki to Nummi-Pusula's Saukkola on the same line as an old national road 1 which is now regional road 110. It turned north and ran to the Somero where it joined an old national road 10 in Somero's downtown, then it ran to the Jokioinen on the line of the current main road 52 and then it joined national road 10's present line in Jokioinen. There National road 2 turned to the west and went with National road 10 to the regional road 213's crossroad and turned to the north again. Then it ran on the current regional road 213's line through Yp√§j√§, Loimaa and Alastaro until it turned to the main road 41's present line in Virttaa. Then national road 2 ran to Huittinen where it faced Its present line where it ran on the same line to Pori where it goes in nowadays between Huittinen and Pori. National road 2, rebuilt in the 1960s, was constructed only 8 metres wide so it is narrower than almost every other national road in Finland. When it was completed, it was found too dangerous between Helsinki's Ring III and Vihti's Olkkala, so it was rebuilt again between Ring III and Olkkala in the 1970s, new line built from National road 1 and it is little longer but safer line than an old one. An old hilly and complex road between Helsinki and Olkkala was later numbered to the regional road 120. Later the only dangerous part between Olkkala and Karkkila was built to the 2+1 or 1+2 laned road.

The festival was an extension of WRFL's mission to provide a platform for non-mainstream, non-commercial music and other programming not found elsewhere in the region, featuring a variety of artists from both the region and from around the world. Genres tended to be experimental in nature, but also included everything from alternative rock, post-rock, electronic, hip hop, punk rock, metal, and psychedelic rock bands. Other festival features included dance performances, local craft booths, fashion and art installations, workshops, literary events and film screenings, with a special focus on the artists and arts organizers that make Lexington unique. Boomslang was primarily volunteer-run, relying on the efforts of WRFL staff members and led by WRFL's student Board of Directors.  Etymology  The name \\"Boomslang\\" was chosen in 2009 by a committee looking for a catchy word, after the highly venomous snake found in Africa. The coloration and \\"snake eyes\\" in the festival logo, designed by WRFL art director Robert Beatty, were inspired by the boomslang snake. The paper lanterns commonly associated with Boomslang  History   Creation  American avant-garde and minimalist composer, guitarist, and trumpet player Rhys Chatham at the 2010 Boomslang music festival. The inaugural 2009 festival was conceived and organized by WRFL DJs in the attempt to highlight Lexington's unique venues, artists and organizations, with an emphasis on the local counter-culture which WRFL has nurtured since its inception. The lineup included a couple of nods to the 1960s and 1970s with German krautrock pioneers Faust and masters of psychedelic Tropicalia Os Mutantes. The line-up was heavy on psychedelic and post-rock music, also including Mission of Burma, Papa M (the solo project of Slint guitarist Dave Pajo), The Black Angels, Bardo Pond, a mixed media presentation by Mark Hosler, a founding member of Negativland. The line-up also included the first live collaboration between Lexington-based Casino Versus Japan and Deerhunter frontman Bradford Cox (aka Atlas Sound), who would later tour together in 2010. Another key concept behind Boomslang was the inclusion of non-musical features, including a 2009 circus-themed fashion show and a carnival scene that took place in the parking lot of one of the primary venues, stretching the boundaries of traditional rock culture. The 2009 and 2010 events also included a tent for display of locally-made art for sale, games, and information tables for political and environmental non-profit groups promoting counter-culture and political awareness. It was announced on May 7, 2014 that WRFL would no longer host the festival, effectively ending it.  Satellite Events  Boomslang strove to provide a platform for Lexington's left-of-center creative community, hosting a number \\"satellite events\\" organized by various local artists and organizations. In addition to those listed below, Boomslang hosted a Dorkbot workshop on D.I.Y. music instruments. Stars with Accents Each year Accents, a WRFL radio show for literature, art, and culture, hosted Stars with Accents, a literary celebration supported by the Kentucky Women Writers Conference and The Carnegie Center for Literacy and Learning. Stars with Accents featured readings by authors such as Crystal Wilkinson, C.E. Morgan, Sallie Bingham, and more. An art installation piece at Boomslang's 2010 Neighborhood Series. Neighborhood Series Fashion Event Boomslang also teamed up with the Lexington Fashion Collaborative to bring innovative local fashion and art to the festival, with the second annual installation of The Neighborhood Series. The Neighborhood Series took place at Land of Tomorrow Gallery, a gallery owned and operated by University of Kentucky College of Design professors, and included eight installation pieces with coordinating fashion-forward costumes that reflected eight locally owned businesses. The materials used to create the works of art came straight from each business‚Äôs trash. Queerslang Boomslang 2011 marked the inaugural event of Queerslang, an all-day, multi- media, entertainment and education-based event, which strives to lift up the local, LGBTIQQA community. The mission of Queerslang is to create visibility for the LGBTIQQA community and to highlight shared interests in music, art and performance with the whole of the Lexington community. Queerslang (which has continued, outliving the original Boomslang festival) provides free \\"skillshare\\" workshops, film screenings in addition to the Queerslang dance party. Workshops are hosted by touring and local artists and speakers, and cover a variety of subjects both geared to the LGBTIQQA community and to a broader arts community. Skillshare workshops have covered such topics as safe sex, turntablism, tattoo art. Film screenings at the 2011 Queerslang included special guest Meredith Heil from UC Santa Cruz, who showcased her short documentary, \\"Whistlin‚Äô Dixie.\\" Kid-friendly Music Boomslang hosted two kid-oriented concerts, organized by the host of Ages 3 and Up!, a WRFL show geared toward kids of all ages. 2010's kid-friendly event featured children's artist and ukulele player Heidi Swedberg, perhaps best known for her role as Susan on Seinfeld. Film The festival teamed up with local film-oriented institutions Lexington Film League and KET to incorporate film into the fest, including a 2010 screening of \\"Heavy Metal Parking Lot\\" in the parking lot of the venue Buster's. Many other artists have incorporated film and video projections into their performances, including Sound/Vision, offthesky, Wooden Shjips, and Strangers Family Band.

It was established in 1842 in Berlin by Ernst Jakob Renz (1815‚Äì1892) as Circus Olympic and existed until 1897. The company had several stationary buildings in Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, Breslau and Vienna. Today several circus companies in Germany make use of the family name Renz. Among them, Circus Universal Renz and Zirkus Renz Manege are the biggest. Apart from them, there are other circusses of the name Renz out of Germany, e.g. Dutch Circus Renz International, Circus Renz Berlin and Circus Herman Renz, who are often falsely assumed to be linked to the famous dynasty.  The historical head office in Berlin  The circus' Berlin headquarters was established in 1842 as Circus Olympic. On 25 May 1867 Johann Strauss II and Benjamin Bilse' Band gave the Berlin premiere of The Blue Danube in that building. Because of the construction of Berlin Friedrichstra√üe station, the property had to be abandoned. On 20 April 1879 the circus moved into the former Berlin market hall (later Friedrichstadt-Palast). In 1888 the auditorium was augmented to 5.600 seats. Ernst Renz' son Franz had to close the company on 31 July 1897 due to financial difficulties. On 28 October 1899 Albert Schumann (1858‚Äì1939) took over the Berlin circus building and operated his own Circus Schumann until 1918. In 1940, Ernst Renz' great-nephew, Bernhard Renz, re-established a touring circus under the family name. When he died in 2012, he was the oldest recorded circus director at the age of 91. His descendants continue to lead their own circuses, carrying the Renz name.

It is owned and operated by the United Auburn Indian Community and designed by architect Edward Vance of JMA Architecture Studios, located in Las Vegas, Nevada. The resort opened on June 9, 2003. It was operated by Station Casinos from 2003 to 2010. The 275,000-square-foot (25,550 m¬≤) facility offers a variety of gaming including slot machines, live poker and various other table games. History Thunder Valley Casino Resort is owned by the United Auburn Indian Community, a Native American tribe consisting of mostly Miwuk and Maidu Indians indigenous to the Sacramento Valley region. In the 1950s and '60s, the United States government terminated 41 California rancherias‚Äîmini-reservations, including that of the Miwok and Maidu Auburn band. As a way to lift themselves out of poverty, the members of the tribe decided to build a casino after Congress restored the tribe's federal status in 1994, allowing the tribe to acquire land under tribal sovereignty. The United Auburn Indian Community entered into a tribal- state gaming compact with the State of California in September 1999 in order to conduct Class III gaming on trust land. This compact was later successfully renegotiated with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2004. Thunder Valley was designed by JMA Architecture Studios and built by the PENTA Building Group. The casino was opened in June 2003 and then expanded starting in March 2009 and finishing July 2010. The UAIC is known for their efforts to abide by state and local land-use laws, even though they are not obligated to do so under sovereignty law. For example, the UAIC chose to include the California Environmental Quality Act in its local agreement, something only a handful of tribes submit to.

Style of play FifaPlayerRatings.com described Mashamaite as a player stating that \\"his default approach is to contain his man due to his below-average aggression. In these cases it might be more advantageous to attempt to dispossess the attacking player, since he's a relatively savvy tackler. Tefu Mashamaite will occasionally read passing lanes and intercept opponent passes because of his comparatively high interceptions rating. He'll excel at smothering attackers on set pieces and corner kicks, and will typically be one of the first players to respond to changes within a play (e.g. clearing a rebound off the post) due to his relatively high reactions rating. Physically, he takes longer than most players to reach top speed, which only exacerbates his comparatively slow pace. He's not as strong as most defenders , but his above-average jumping ability will help him compete for headers. Personal life He has two sons Phetolo Nkosana (born 2010) and Tefu Kgosi (born 2016). He is currently engaged to Mpho. He got his BA in International Relations and Politics at Wits University in 2005 before joining Wits. His nephew played for the Orlando Pirates youth academy.

It included The College of William & Mary, the Richmond Professional Institute, the Norfolk Division of the College of William & Mary, Christopher Newport College, and Richard Bland College. Creation In 1960, The College of William & Mary (\\"The College\\") had two branch campuses, the Richmond Professional Institute (RPI), which it had operated since 1925, and the Norfolk Division of the College of William & Mary, which it had operated since 1930. The General Assembly of Virginia passed H.B. 466 creating The Colleges of William & Mary (\\"The Colleges\\") on March 3, 1960, and it took effect immediately. The president of The College, Alvin Duke Chandler, was chosen to be the administrative chancellor of the new system, with Davis Young Paschall replacing him as president. Operation As chancellor, however, Chandler attempted to manage the day-to-day operations of all five branches of The Colleges and, by doing so, began to alienate the presidents who served under him. The presidents of The College, RPI, and the Norfolk Division were originally to have more autonomy under the new system than they had had in the past. However, Chandler did not allow that to happen. For example, Chandler required Lewis Webb, president of the Norfolk Division, to seek his approval in matters of hiring faculty and staff, granting leaves of absence, reviewing scholarly publications, and budget requests. Chandler also referred to the five college system as his \\"empire,\\" reflecting his idea of his role at the top. He also maintained an office on the campus of The College, saying that he could not see how \\"the college chancellor possibly could conduct business away from the campus.\\" In addition, the Norfolk Division was granted accreditation in its own right from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools as a four-year college in December 1961 and was renamed the Norfolk College of the Colleges of William & Mary. RPI had been accredited in its own right since 1953. As four-year schools with their own accreditation, the presidents of each began to resent the level of influence Chandler had in their day-to-day affairs and began to look for ways to change it. Dissolution The General Assembly decided to split the system into three parts, with The College, RPI, and the Norfolk College each having their own Boards of Visitors and with Richard Bland College and Christopher Newport College remaining under the control of the Board of Visitors of The College of William & Mary. The bill for the dissolution of the system was introduced by Delegate Russell Carneal of Williamburg at the urging of some of the members of the Board of Visitors. However, other members of the Board of Visitors were opposed; there had been a vote of the Board against the dissolution of the system in December 1961. The dissolution became official with the passage of H.B. 156, signed into law by Governor Albertis Harrison on February 16, 1962. It specified that the system would be abolished as of July 1, 1962. Upon its independence, the Norfolk College became Old Dominion College, now known as Old Dominion University. RPI remained an independent state school until 1968, when it merged with the Medical College of Virginia to form Virginia Commonwealth University. Christopher Newport College remained an extension of The College until becoming independent in 1977, and became Christopher Newport University in 1992. Richard Bland College remains a junior college affiliated with The College. After the dissolution of the system, Alvin Duke Chandler served as the coordinator for Christopher Newport College and Richard Bland College; however, he resigned this position after only four months. He then became chancellor of the College of William & Mary, an honorary position that dates back to the founding of the College.

These tools are applied to physical phenomena which occur at a variety of length scales - from gravitational waves due to galaxy collisions to gamma radiation resulting from nuclear decay. Multipole radiation is analyzed using similar multipole expansion techniques that describe fields from static sources, however there are important differences in the details of the analysis because multipole radiation fields behave quite differently from static fields. This article is primarily concerned with electromagnetic multipole radiation, although the treatment of gravitational waves is similar. Electromagnetic radiation depends on structural details of the source system of electric charge and electric current. Direct analysis can be intractable if the structure is unknown or complicated. Multipole analysis offers a way to separate the radiation into moments of increasing complexity. Since the electromagnetic field depends more heavily on lower-order moments than on higher-order moments, the electromagnetic field can be approximated without knowing the structure in detail. Properties of multipole radiation Linearity of moments Since Maxwell's equations are linear, the electric field and magnetic field depend linearly on source distributions. Linearity allows the fields from various multipole moments to be calculated independently and added together to give the total field of the system. This is the well-known principle of superposition. Origin dependence of multipole moments Multipole moments are calculated with respect to a fixed expansion point which is taken to be the origin of a given coordinate system. Translating the origin changes the multipole moments of the system with the exception of the first non-vanishing moment. For example, the monopole moment of charge is simply the total charge in the system. Changing the origin will never change this moment. If the monopole moment is zero then the dipole moment of the system will be translation invariant. If both the monopole and dipole moments are zero then the quadrupole moment is translation invariant, and so forth. Because higher-order moments depend on the position of the origin, they cannot be regarded as invariant properties of the system. Field dependence on distance The field from a multipole moment depends on both the distance from the origin and the angular orientation of the evaluation point with respect to the coordinate system. In particular, the radial dependence of the electromagnetic field from a stationary 2^\\\\ell-pole scales as 1/r^{\\\\ell+2}. That is, the electric field from the electric monopole moment scales as inverse distance squared. Likewise, the electric dipole moment creates a field that scales as inverse distance cubed, and so on. As distance increases, the contribution of high-order moments becomes much smaller than the contribution from low-order moments, so high-order moments can be ignored to simplify calculations. The radial dependence of radiation waves is different from static fields because these waves carry energy away from the system. Since energy must be conserved, simple geometric analysis shows that the energy density of spherical radiation, radius r, must scale as 1/r^2. As a spherical wave expands, the fixed energy of the wave must spread out over an expanding sphere of surface area 4 \\\\pi r^2. Accordingly, every time-dependent multipole moment must contribute radiant energy density that scales as 1/r^2, regardless of the order of the moment. Hence, high-order moments cannot be discarded as easily as in static case. Even so, the multipole coefficients of a system generally diminish with increasing order, usually as 1/(2\\\\ell+1)!!, so radiation fields can still be approximated by truncating high-order moments. Time-dependent electromagnetic fields Sources Time-dependent source distributions can be expressed using Fourier analysis. This allows separate frequencies to be analyzed independently. Charge density is given by :\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty d\\\\omega \\\\, \\\\hat{\\\\rho}(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\omega) e^{-i \\\\omega t} and current density by :\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty d\\\\omega \\\\, \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{J}}(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\omega) e^{-i \\\\omega t}. For convenience, only a single angular frequency œâ is considered from this point forward; thus :\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x}) e^{-i \\\\omega t} :\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x}) e^{-i \\\\omega t} The superposition principle may be applied to generalize results for multiple frequencies. Vector quantities appear in bold. The standard convention of taking the real part of complex quantities to represent physical quantities is used. The intrinsic angular momentum of elementary particles (see Spin (physics)) may also affect electromagnetic radiation from some source materials. To account for these effects, the intrinsic magnetization of the system \\\\mathbf{M}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) would have to be taken into account. For simplicity however, these effects will be deferred to the discussion of generalized multipole radiation. Potentials The source distributions can be integrated to yield the time-dependent electric potential and magnetic potential œÜ and A respectively. Formulas are expressed in the Lorenz Gauge in SI units. :\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0}\\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\int dt'\\\\frac{\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x'},t')}{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2}\\\\delta\\\\left(t'-(t-\\\\frac{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2}{c})\\\\right) :\\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{4 \\\\pi}\\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\int dt'\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x'},t')}{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2}\\\\delta\\\\left(t'-(t-\\\\frac{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2}{c})\\\\right) In these formulas c is the speed of light in vacuum, \\\\delta is the Dirac delta function, and \\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2 is the Euclidean distance from the source point x‚Ä≤ to the evaluation point x. Integrating the time-dependent source distributions above yields :\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0} e^{-i \\\\omega t} \\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x'})\\\\frac{e^{i k \\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2}}{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2} :\\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{4 \\\\pi} e^{-i \\\\omega t} \\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x'})\\\\frac{e^{i k \\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2}}{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2} where k=œâ/c. These formulas provide the basis for analyzing multipole radiation. Multipole expansion in near field The near field is the region around a source where the electromagnetic field can be evaluated quasi-statically. If target distance from the multipole origin r=\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\|_2 is much smaller than the radiation wavelength \\\\lambda=2\\\\pi/k, then k r\\\\ll 1. As a result, the exponential can be approximated in this region as: :e^{i k \\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2} = 1 + O(k r) See Taylor expansion. By using this approximation, the remaining x‚Ä≤ dependence is the same as it is for a static system, the same analysis applies. Essentially, the potentials can be evaluated in the near field at a given instant by simply taking a snapshot of the system and treating it as though it were static - hence it is called quasi-static. See near and far field and multipole expansion. In particular, the inverse distance 1/\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2 is expanded using spherical harmonics which are integrated separately to obtain spherical multipole coefficients. Multipole expansion in far field: Multipole radiation At large distances from a high frequency source, \\\\lambda\\\\ll r, the following approximations hold: :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2} = \\\\frac{1}{r} + O(1/r^2) :e^{i k \\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2}=e^{i k (r - \\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x'} + O(1/r))}=e^{i k r - i k \\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x'}}(1 + O(1/r)) Since only the first-order term in 1/r is significant at large distances, the expansions combine to give :\\\\frac{e^{i k \\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2}}{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2}=\\\\frac{e^{i k r}}{r}(1 - i k(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x'}) + \\\\frac{(-i k)^2}{2}(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x'})^2 + ...) + O(1/r^2) Each power of \\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x'} corresponds to a different multipole moment. The first few moments are evaluated directly below. Electric monopole radiation, nonexistence The zeroth order term, \\\\frac{e^{i k \\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2}}{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2} \\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{e^{i k r}}{r}, applied to the scalar potential gives :\\\\phi_{\\\\text{Electric monopole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0} \\\\frac{e^{i k r - i \\\\omega t}}{r} \\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x'})=\\\\frac{e^{i k r - i \\\\omega t}}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 r} q where the total charge q=\\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x'}) is the electric monopole moment oscillating at frequency œâ. Conservation of charge requires q=0 since :q(t)=\\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x'},t)=\\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x'})e^{-i \\\\omega t}=q e^{-i \\\\omega t}. If the system is closed then the total charge cannot fluctuate which means the oscillation amplitude q must be zero. Hence, \\\\phi_{\\\\text{Electric monopole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = 0. The corresponding fields and radiant power must also be zero. Electric dipole radiation Electric dipole potential Electric dipole radiation can be derived by applying the zeroth-order term to the vector potential. :\\\\mathbf{A}_{\\\\text{Electric dipole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{e^{i k r - i \\\\omega t}}{r} \\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x'}) Integration by parts yields :\\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x'})=-\\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'} \\\\mathbf{x'}(\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x'})). and the charge continuity equation shows :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x},t)}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\left(-i\\\\omega\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right)e^{-i \\\\omega t}=0. It follows that :\\\\mathbf{A}_{\\\\text{Electric dipole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\frac{-i \\\\omega \\\\mu_0}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{e^{i k r - i \\\\omega t}}{r} \\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x'}) Similar results can be obtained by applying the first-order term, \\\\frac{e^{i k \\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2}}{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2} \\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{e^{i k r}}{r}(-i k)(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x'}) to the scalar potential. The amplitude of the electric dipole moment of the system is \\\\mathbf{p}=\\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x'}), which allows the potentials to be expressed as :\\\\phi_{\\\\text{Electric dipole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\frac{-i k}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0}\\\\frac{e^{i k r - i \\\\omega t}}{r}\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{p} :\\\\mathbf{A}_{\\\\text{Electric dipole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) =\\\\frac{-i\\\\omega\\\\mu_0}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{e^{i k r - i \\\\omega t}}{r} \\\\mathbf{p} Electric dipole fields Once the time-dependent potentials are understood, the time-dependent electric field and magnetic field can be calculated in the usual way. Namely, :\\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=-\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x},t)-\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)}{\\\\partial t} :\\\\mathbf{B}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{x},t), or, in a source-free region of space, the relationship between the magnetic field and the electric field can be used to obtain :\\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0}\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) :\\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\frac{i Z_0}{k}\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) where Z_0=\\\\sqrt{\\\\mu_0/\\\\epsilon_0} is the impedance of free space. The electric and magnetic fields that correspond to the potentials above are :\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\text{Electric dipole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\frac{c k^2}{4 \\\\pi}(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{p})\\\\frac{e^{i k r - i \\\\omega t}}{r} :\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\text{Electric dipole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=Z_0(\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\text{Electric dipole}}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{n}) which is consistent with spherical radiation waves. Pure electric dipole power The power density, energy per unit area per unit time, is expressed by the Poynting vector \\\\mathbf{S}=\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{H}. It follows that the time averaged power density per unit solid angle is given by :\\\\frac{dP(\\\\mathbf{x})}{d\\\\Omega}=\\\\frac{r^2}{2}\\\\Re(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{H}). The dot product with \\\\mathbf{n} extracts the emission magnitude and the factor of 1/2 comes from averaging over time. As explained above, the r^2 cancels the radial dependence of radiation energy density. Application to a pure electric dipole gives :\\\\frac{dP_{\\\\text{Electric dipole}}(\\\\mathbf{x})}{d\\\\Omega}=\\\\frac{c^2 Z_0}{32 \\\\pi^2}k^4\\\\|\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\|_2^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta where Œ∏ is measured with respect to \\\\mathbf{p}. Integration over a sphere yields the total power radiated: :P_{\\\\text{Electric dipole}}=\\\\frac{c^2 Z_0}{12 \\\\pi}k^4\\\\|\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\|_2^2 Magnetic dipole radiation Magnetic dipole potential The first-order term, \\\\frac{e^{i k \\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2}}{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2} \\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{e^{i k r}}{r}(-i k)(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x'}), applied to the vector potential gives magnetic dipole radiation and electric quadrupole radiation. :\\\\mathbf{A}_{\\\\text{Magnetic dipole / Electric quadrupole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{e^{i k r - i \\\\omega t}}{r}(-i k)\\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x'})\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x'}) The integrand can be separated into symmetric and anti-symmetric parts in n and x‚Ä≤ :(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x'})\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x'})=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left((\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x'})\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x'})+(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x'}))\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x'}))\\\\times\\\\mathbf{n} The second term contains the effective magnetization due to the current \\\\mathbf{M}_{\\\\text{effective}}(\\\\mathbf{x'})=1/2(\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x'})) and integration gives the magnetic dipole moment. :\\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\mathbf{M}_{\\\\text{effective}}(\\\\mathbf{x'}) = \\\\mathbf{m} :\\\\mathbf{A}_{\\\\text{Magnetic dipole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\frac{-i k \\\\mu_0}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{e^{i k r - i \\\\omega t}}{r}\\\\mathbf{m}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{n} Notice that \\\\mathbf{A}_{\\\\text{Magnetic dipole}} has a similar form to \\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\text{Electric dipole}}. That means the magnetic field from a magnetic dipole behaves similarly to the electric field from an electric dipole. Likewise, the electric field from a magnetic dipole behaves like the magnetic field from an electric dipole. Taking the transformations :\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\text{Electric dipole}} \\\\rightarrow Z_0\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\text{Magnetic dipole}} :\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\text{Electric dipole}} \\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{-1}{Z_0}\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\text{Magnetic dipole}} :\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbf{m}/c on previous results yields magnetic dipole results. Magnetic dipole fields :\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\text{Magnetic dipole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\frac{-k^2 Z_0}{4 \\\\pi}(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{m})\\\\frac{e^{i k r - i \\\\omega t}}{r} :\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\text{Magnetic dipole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\frac{-1}{Z_0}(\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\text{Magnetic dipole}}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{n}) Pure magnetic dipole power The average power radiated per unit solid angle by a magnetic dipole is :\\\\frac{dP_{\\\\text{Magnetic dipole}}(\\\\mathbf{x})}{d\\\\Omega}=\\\\frac{Z_0}{32 \\\\pi^2}k^4\\\\|\\\\mathbf{m}\\\\|_2^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta where Œ∏ is measured with respect to the magnetic dipole \\\\mathbf{m}. The total power radiated is: :P_{\\\\text{Magnetic dipole}}=\\\\frac{Z_0}{12 \\\\pi}k^4\\\\|\\\\mathbf{m}\\\\|_2^2 Electric quadrupole radiation Electric quadrupole potential The symmetric portion of the integrand from the previous section can be resolved by applying integration by parts and the charge continuity equation as was done for electric dipole radiation. :\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\left((\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x'})\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x'})+(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x'}))\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{-i \\\\omega}{2} \\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'} \\\\mathbf{x'} (\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x'})\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x'}) :\\\\mathbf{A}_{\\\\text{Electric quadrupole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\frac{-k \\\\omega \\\\mu_0}{8 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{e^{i k r - i \\\\omega t}}{r}\\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'} \\\\mathbf{x'} (\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x'})\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x'}) This corresponds to the traceless electric quadrupole moment tensor Q_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}=\\\\int d^3\\\\mathbf{x'}(3 x'_\\\\alpha x'_\\\\beta - \\\\|\\\\mathbf{x'}\\\\|_2^2 \\\\delta_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta})\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x'}). Contracting the second index with the normal vector [Q(\\\\mathbf{n})]_\\\\alpha = \\\\sum_\\\\beta Q_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} n_\\\\beta allows the vector potential to be expressed as :\\\\mathbf{A}_{\\\\text{Electric quadrupole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\frac{-k \\\\omega \\\\mu_0}{8 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{e^{i k r - i \\\\omega t}}{r}\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\mathbf{Q(n)} Electric quadrupole fields The resulting magnetic and electric fields are: :\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\text{Electric quadrupole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\frac{-i c k^3}{24 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{e^{i k r - i \\\\omega t}}{r}\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{Q(n)} :\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\text{Electric quadrupole}}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=Z_0(\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\text{Electric quadrupole}}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{n}) Pure electric quadrupole power The average power radiated per unit solid angle by an electric quadrupole is :\\\\frac{dP_{\\\\text{Electric quadrupole}}(\\\\mathbf{x})}{d\\\\Omega}=\\\\frac{c^2 Z_0}{1152 \\\\pi^2}k^6\\\\|(\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{Q(n)})\\\\times\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\|_2^2 where Œ∏ is measured with respect to the magnetic dipole \\\\mathbf{m}. The total power radiated is: :P_{\\\\text{Electric quadrupole}}=\\\\frac{c^2 Z_0}{1440 \\\\pi}k^6\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha, \\\\beta} Q_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}^2 Generalized multipole radiation As the multipole moment of a source distribution increases, the direct calculations employed so far become too cumbersome to continue. Analysis of higher moments requires more general theoretical machinery. Just as before, a single source frequency \\\\omega is considered. Hence the charge, current, and intrinsic magnetization densities are given by :\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{x})e^{-i \\\\omega t} :\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x})e^{-i \\\\omega t} :\\\\mathbf{M}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\mathbf{M}(\\\\mathbf{x})e^{-i \\\\omega t} respectively. The resulting electric and magnetic fields share the same time-dependence as the sources. :\\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{x})e^{-i \\\\omega t} :\\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=\\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\mathbf{x})e^{-i \\\\omega t} Using these definitions and the continuity equation allows Maxwell's equations to be written as :\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{x})=-\\\\frac{i Z_0}{k}\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x}) :\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\mathbf{x})=-\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{M}(\\\\mathbf{x}) :\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{x})=ikZ_0\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\mathbf{x})+\\\\mathbf{M}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right) :\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\mathbf{x})=-\\\\frac{ik}{Z_0}\\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{x})+\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x}) These equations can be combined by taking the curl of the last equations and applying the identity \\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\times(\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{V})=\\\\mathbf{ abla}(\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{V})-\\\\mathbf{ abla}^2\\\\mathbf{V}.

It is owned by McNaughton Newspapers. History The Daily Republic started out as two newspapers ‚Äì the Solano County Herald and the Solano Press. The County Herald was first created in Benicia in November 1855. It moved to Suisun City with its first publication there on October 2, 1858, with offices in a building on the south side of the city plaza. The Daily Republic was the first newspaper in the nation to editorially support Abraham Lincoln for president. The Solano Press was created in 1862. Seven years later, the Herald and the Press were consolidated and renamed the Solano Republican. \\"The Republican is a fearless defender of the rights of the people, and is a welcome weekly visitor to nearly every house in the upper portion of Solano County,\\" the 1879 History of Solano County stated. During the 1940s, the Solano Republican was housed at 607 Main St., Suisun City. The present home of the Daily Republic at 1250 Texas St. was built in 1940. Within the first year he owned the newspaper, Dean McNaughton increased the publication to five days a week, Monday through Friday, and renamed it the Daily Republic. Today, the newspaper publishes seven days a week. Ownership The Daily Republic had many owners through the beginning of the 20th century until 1919, when David A. Weir bought the newspaper. He owned the Solano Republican for the next 31 years. Weir was born in Sterling, Colorado in 1889. After working at The Denver Post and the Chicago Tribune, he published papers in Nebraska, Oregon and Porterville before buying the Solano Republican. Weir was also instrumental in establishing the local Lions Club, American Legion post 208 and the county's mosquito abatement district. Weir retired from publishing November 1, 1949, and sold the Republican to J. Clifton Toney. Toney operated the newspaper until 1960, when it was sold to the McNaughton family. Since the early 1960s, the newspaper has been owned by the McNaughtons, a family with roots in journalism that date back to the 1920s. F.F. McNaughton, grandfather of present-day CEO Foy McNaughton, graduated from Columbia University's first master's degree program in journalism. He went on to work for a New York City newspaper. A few years later, he returned to his home state of Indiana to purchase a small paper in Bicknel. After making it a success, he purchased the Pekin Daily Times in Pekin, Illinois. This became the flagship paper. His son, Dean McNaughton, joined the family business during the late 1940s. Dean McNaughton journeyed to California in 1960 and purchased the Solano Republican. In 1965, the McNaughtons purchased the Mountain Democrat in Placerville. In 1967, they bought The Davis Enterprise. Foy McNaughton joined the family business in 1973. His first job was in the composing room at the Mountain Democrat. Later that year, he moved to The Davis Enterprise pressroom. For the next six years, he worked in all areas of the publishing business until 1979 when he was named publisher of The Davis Enterprise. He assumed his present title of president and CEO of the McNaughton newspapers in 1986. He became publisher of the Daily Republic in 1995, a role in which he serves in as of November, 2017. Foy McNaughton's son, T. Burt McNaughton, was named co-publisher in early 2013. In addition to the Daily Republic, the family publishes The Davis Enterprise, the Mountain Democrat, the Winters Express in El Dorado Hills, Village Life in Cameron Park & Folsom, and the Georgetown Gazette in Georgetown, California.

He was born in Liverpool and moved to Hertfordshire at age 6. At 15 he began playing guitar and formed a band with school friends. That band later became SikTh.  SikTh  In 1999/2000 Weller and school friend Graham Pinney formed SikTh. They recruited singers Mikee W Goodman and Justin Hill, bassist James Leach and drummer Dan 'Loord' Foord. SikTh went on to become one of the UK's most influential Heavy Metal bands releasing 3 EP's and 2 Albums internationally. In 2011 The Guardian wrote that along with Swedish band Meshuggah, SikTh were the founders of the international Metal phenomenon Djent.Djent, the metal geek's microgenre Accessed: 4/26/2012Alexis Petridis on heavy metal and the Mercury prize Accessed: 4/26/2012 SikTh became very popular across the world and particularly in the UK, US and Japan. SikTh split up in 2008 but reformed in 2014, when they toured Germany, Japan, Nepal, and Britain and appeared at the BIG69 festival in Mumbai, India in 2015. The band also appeared as cover stars on the cover of the rolling stone in India.  Producing  Having worked with producer Colin Richardson on the first SikTh album, Weller became fascinated by music production. Three years later in Miami he handled production duties on the band's follow-up album Death of a Dead Day. Thus ensued a production career. Dan is well known as a long term collaborator with UK sonic pioneers Enter Shikari. He produced A Flash Flood of Colour, the third Enter Shikari album at Karma Sound Studios in Thailand, as well as featuring in the band's Phenakistoscope documentary. Dan had previously worked on the band's second album, Common Dreads and also produced follow-up singles \\"Destabilise\\" and \\"Quelle Surprise\\". Dan then went on to produce the three singles-EP Rat Race and the fourth album of the band, The Mindsweep, which was critically acclaimed. He produced the debut Young Guns album and the followup, Bones the lead single from which (Bones) achieved active number 1 in America along with being the official theme for WWE wrestlemania. Other bands on his CV include Bury Tomorrow, Babymetal, Emil Bulls, Kids in Glass Houses, Dead!, Monster Truck, Lostalone, Rise to Remain, Sharks, Gallows, Johnny Truant, Malefice, Max Raptor, Blitz Kids Piqued Jacks and more.  Writing  As of January 2016 Weller has been published by Bucks Music Group. He has co-written with countless artists and has a reputation for nurturing/developing talent. The Vienna-based synth-pop band Hunger was developed by Weller in a co-writing / production capacity. The band's first single, \\"Amused\\", was featured on the Netflix show 13 Reasons Why as well as being used on a Mitsubishi television commercial. Notably, Taylor Swift picked the song out for her \\"Taylor Likes\\" Spotify playlist. In March 2018, Weller and his regular collaborator Steven Battelle joined forces with another Dan Weller and travelled to the United States for a writing retreat.

This mountain range dominates the landscape at above sea level and the place is known for curious shapes of human faces and animals visible in granite rock. Discovery The place was first investigated by Daniel Ruzo during the 1950s and in an area of about 3 km2, several hundred curious shapes are found, which can be presumed as natural formations. The place is located at a height of about in the Andes Mountain. Features The plateau originated from a volcanic reaction. It is about in area, and is located almost high in Huarochir√≠ Province, east of Lima, Peru. Marcahuasi is home to a unique set of huge granite rocks with curious shapes resembling human faces, animals, and religious symbols. There are many theories as to their origins, including the assertion that their unusual shapes formed naturally through erosion. Some argued that they are sculptures shaped by ancient people but archaeologists clearly state that the shapes are the result of erosion over centuries. There are some small pre-Columbian structures, which are tombs of ancient people and some of which are robbed and vandalised. There is also a collection of ruins on the north side of the plateau. Over 50 structures stand in varying states of decay. The doorways are very small, some three feet high. Most of the structures are narrow since the use of arches was not known, therefore spans had to be covered with suitable rock that may have been quarried locally. There are also what appear to be burial tombs on the outskirts of the settlement.

It features Juliet Starling (voiced by Tara Strong), a cheerleader zombie hunter fighting zombies in a fictional California high school. A collaboration between game designer Suda51 and filmmaker James Gunn, the game was published by Kadokawa Games in Japan and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment in all other territories and was released on June 12, 2012 in North America, June 14, 2012 in Japan and June 15, 2012 in Europe. Gameplay Lollipop Chainsaw is a hack and slash video game in which players play as Juliet as she fights through hordes of zombies. Juliet can use melee attack, dodges and high and low attacks with her chainsaw. Zombies can be beaten into a groggy state, during which they can instantly be killed with a chainsaw attack. Gold medals can be earned by defeating zombies, smashing objects and rescuing classmates. These medals can be spent at Chop2Shop.zom stores found throughout each level where Juliet can purchase new moves and combos, as well as items that can increase her stats. Sparkle Hunting is achieved when Juliet kills three or more zombies simultaneously or in quick succession and rewards platinum medals that can be spent on other goodies such as unlockable costumes, music and artwork. As the game progresses, Juliet will also receive the Chainsaw Dash, which allows her to charge with her chainsaw and fly off ramps, and the Chainsaw Blaster, a long range weapon used for blasting enemies and obstacles. Throughout the game, Juliet can also collect lollipops which allow her to recover health. The maximum number of lollipops Juliet can hold depends on the difficulty setting. Juliet will die if she loses all her health or fails certain scenarios, though in the case of the former, Juliet may be able to come back to life by winning a roulette spin. Throughout her journey, Juliet is accompanied by her boyfriend, Nick, who is a disembodied head hanging from her waist. At certain points in the game, Nick's head can be attached to a decapitated zombie's body, during which the player will rhythmically press buttons in order to have him move about and clear the way for Juliet. By obtaining 'Nick Tickets', Juliet can activate the 'Nick Roulette' in which various moves can be performed using Nick's head, such as a bombarding attack or making masses of zombies groggy. By filling up her star meter by defeating zombies, Juliet can activate a special state which powers up her chainsaw for a limited period, allowing her to easily defeat zombies and obtain Sparkle Hunting more easily. Plot On Juliet Starling's 18th birthday, she goes to the front park of San Romero High School to meet her boyfriend Nick Carlyle, who is going to meet her family for the first time. Unfortunately, a zombie outbreak has occurred, which leads to Juliet fighting off hordes of undead on her way to meet Nick. When she arrives, Nick is bitten in her place to protect her from a zombie. To prevent him from turning, Juliet decapitates him. When he comes to, Nick discovers he is somehow still alive, despite being a severed head, and so Juliet reveals to him that she is a zombie hunter as well as her whole family, and that she performed a magical ritual on him to save his humanity. Juliet attaches Nick's head to her belt, and she meets her tutor, Junji Morikawa, who explains that the Universe is divided into three realms: Earth, the Land Beyond Words, a heavenly realm where souls reside, and the Rotten World, an infernal realm where demons and zombies reside, and that somebody has cracked open a portal between the realms to bring forth the zombie outbreak. Juliet and Morikawa encounter the person responsible for the outbreak, an evil goth named Swan, who summons five intelligent zombies called the Dark Purveyors to the world, which are stereotypes of different aspects of music centered on themes of rock and roll. Morikawa attempts to stop Swan but he is mortally wounded. Swan sends the first Dark Purveyor, Zed (representing punk rock), after Juliet, but she kills him and sends him back to the Rotten World. Zed, however, utters a Latin chant as he dies, which all the other Purveyors do as well upon their deaths. Morikawa tells Juliet to purify the school and kill the four remaining Purveyors to save the world before dying. Juliet hunts down the Purveyors, while being helped by her sisters Cordelia and Rosalind. Juliet encounters Vikke (viking-styled heavy metal), the second Dark Purveyor, whom she duels on board his airborne longship and sends back to the Rotten World. The longship crashes into a farm, where Juliet is attacked by Mariska (psychedelic rock), the third Dark Purveyor, but Juliet defeats her and sends her back to the Rotten World. Juliet's father Gideon arrives and takes her back to the city, where they infiltrate an amusement arcade to rescue Rosalind, who has been captured by Josey (funk), the fourth Dark Purveyor. Juliet defeats Josey and saves Rosalind. Finally with only one Dark Purveyor left, Juliet's family all team up to enter a cathedral in the heart of the city, where the fifth and final Dark Purveyor, Lewis Legend (original rock and roll), lurks. Upon accessing his lair, Juliet fights and kills Lewis. Swan appears and reveals that he allowed Juliet to kill all the Dark Purveyors so the true zombie lord could be returned to this world, and the Latin phrases they chanted when defeated were part of an incantation to summon him. Seeking revenge against the world for the bullying he endured at school and his unrequited love for Juliet, Swan shoots his head off to finish the ritual and is absorbed along with the rest of the undead into a black vortex, which solidifies into the zombie of all zombies: Killabilly. Juliet battles Killabilly and is contacted by the ghost of Morikawa, who gives her advice. Juliet enters the mouth of Killabilly and lands in the demon's stomach, where, in his heart, she finds Swan's headless corpse. She learns she must put Nick's head on top of Swan's body to destroy Killabilly, and tearfully does so after the couple express their love for each other. Killabilly explodes, and in a near-death experience Nick learns from Morikawa's ghost that it has been decided his selfless sacrifice grants him new life, with a new body. Nick is resurrected in Morikawa's body, but neither he nor Juliet really care. Together, Nick and the Starling family make their way home in return for Juliet's birthday. Should the player save all available classmates during the course of the game, Juliet's birthday will go swimmingly. If the player allows one or more classmates to die, however, Juliet's mother will be revealed to have been zombified. Development Cosplay model Jessica Nigri (pictured at E3 2012) dressed as Juliet Starling during the game's marketing campaign Before its announcement in July 2011, Lollipop Chainsaw was first mentioned as an unnamed game featuring \\"stylish action\\" in an October 2010 article on 1UP.com detailing Kadokawa Shoten's partnership with Grasshopper and Prope. Suda described it as featuring \\"really extreme twists\\" and being very funny. He declared that he thinks the game will be \\"a really big title in the worldwide market.\\" Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment published the game outside Japan and filmmaker James Gunn had a hand in developing the game's story and characters. Gunn has said that many of the people he works with in his films and other projects are also working on Lollipop Chainsaw. For the characters, the illustrator \\"NekoshowguN\\" (known for her previous works on music games GuitarFreaks and DrumMania) designed the characters for Lollipop Chainsaw and the chainsaw that Juliet Starling uses. On February 1, 2012, it was announced that Jimmy Urine from the electro-punk band Mindless Self Indulgence would compose the music for the boss segments. He also provided the voice for Zed, a punk-rock themed boss. On March 6, 2012, it was announced that one of the DLC available for the game will consist of different costumes for Juliet based on five different characters from four anime series: Rei Miyamoto and Saeko Busujima from Highschool of the Dead, Shiro from Deadman Wonderland, Many≈´ Chifusa from Many≈´ Hiken-ch≈ç and Haruna from Is This a Zombie?. These costumes can also be bought in the in-game shop. A special Lollipop Chainsaw Valentine Edition was released for Valentine's Day on February 14, 2013 in Japan. The re-release features additional content, including a \\"perfect unlock code\\", limited edition sleeve, and two bonus DVDs. The Happy Valentine Disc has PC items such as a desktop clock, wallpapers and a library of trailers; the Premium Movie Disc contains in-game movies and a Valentine's Day comic. Reception In Japan, the game received generally positive reviews upon release. Famitsu gave the game scores of 9 out of 10 from four reviewers, adding up to a total aggregate score of 36 out of 40. Dengeki PlayStation magazine had four reviewers giving the game scores of 75, 90, 90, and 80, averaging out to 83.75 out of 100. In the Western world, the game received \\"average\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN praised the look and feel of the game, but criticized its gameplay, calling it \\"Bland, slow, and unsatisfying.\\" Game Informer said, \\"The premise is exciting and imaginative, but the gameplay execution has too many holes to embrace completely.\\" GameSpot praised the game's jokes, gameplay excursions and boss battles, but criticized its crudeness, control and camera quirks and combat. Destructoid praised the combat of the Xbox 360 version, calling it \\"intuitive, solid, and made to raise a smile\\". Jim Sterling, reviews-editor for Destructoid and the reviewer for said console version, named it as one of his favorite games of 2012. 1UP.com commented that the same console version \\"feels just as empty and image-focused as the latest Tim Burton production\\". GameZone called the same console version \\"one of the most unique experiences I've ever got my hands on\\" and praised its combat, but criticized the camera, commenting that it's \\"obstructing the action when by a wall, and it would take a few seconds to recover and let me see the action again\\". The Daily Telegraph gave the Xbox 360 version a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and said, \\"Erratic, smart, puerile, limited but never less than a lot of fun, Lollipop Chainsaw is something of an endearing mess. Too often its satirical tone can run into trouble, and Grasshopper's hyperactive approach to game design can infuriate as much as it impresses. But Lollipop Chainsaws quirky edge and strong writing carries it through those shakier moments, leaving a candy-coated video game in possession of a sharp bite.\\" 411Mania gave the PlayStation 3 version 6.5 out of 10, saying, \\"It‚Äôs a shame that there isn‚Äôt a lot of steak to go along with the tremendous sizzle of Lollipop Chainsaw. The opening cutscene is fantastic, doing a great job of introducing you to the world of Lollipop Chainsaw and making you laugh. The world is so creative and fun to be in that it‚Äôs really unfortunate the gameplay is so mediocre. If you were to rate this game based off the combat alone this game would be rather terrible, but it‚Äôs everything else in Lollipop Chainsaw that makes it a passable experience and worth checking out.\\" Digital Spy gave the Xbox 360 version three stars out of five, calling it \\"silly, short-lived fun that won't appeal to everybody, but shouldn't fail to leave a lasting impression on players who stick with it to the end.\\" The Escapist also gave said console version three stars out of five, saying, \\"While it's difficult to ignore the surface appeal of an oddball title like Lollipop Chainsaw, what are merely workable mechanics and some overused humor can't keep the experience afloat.\\" However, The Digital Fix gave the same console version a score of five out of ten, saying, \\"While Lollipop Chainsaw could be seen as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on American hedonism, it arguably goes well past parody into the realm of uncomfortable skin-fest. Even worse, for all its excess it is just plain boring.\\" Lollipop Chainsaw has become Grasshopper Manufacture's most successful title to date, selling more than 1 million units worldwide.

It consists of a mask and air hose. The air hose ends with a fitting that allows quick insertion or removal from air manifolds equipped with quick-disconnect fittings. These air manifolds are located throughout the submarine. While connected to a manifold, the wearer of the EAB can breathe and can move about within a few feet of the manifold. To move any farther, the wearer must disconnect from the manifold, at which time the wearer cannot breathe, and locate another manifold with which to connect. Since the submarine may not be able to ventilate its atmosphere with fresh air for a long time, during which the submarine personnel must continue operating the submarine, all personnel undergo training to ensure they know locations of EAB manifolds and can locate them even if there is no lighting. One training exercise, known as \\"EAB races\\", has personnel assemble at one end of the submarine where they don EABs and are blindfolded. They must then make their way to the other end of the submarine without removing their EAB masks or their blindfolds. Other training exercises require the personnel to don EABs while operating the submarine and its nuclear reactor, and continue the operations without removing their EABs.

The resulting offspring would be an elephant‚Äìmammoth hybrid, and the process would have to be repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross- breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. Whether the hybrid embryo would be carried through the two-year gestation, is unknown; in one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing makes this method unfeasible.

In addition to the technical problems, not much habitat is left that would be suitable for elephant-mammoth hybrids. Because both species are [were] social and gregarious, creating a few specimens would not be ideal. The time and resources required would be enormous, and the scientific benefits would be unclear, suggesting these resources should instead be used to preserve extant elephant species which are endangered. The ethics of using elephants as surrogate mothers in hybridisation attempts has also been questioned, as most embryos would not survive, and knowing the exact needs of a hybrid elephant‚Äìmammoth calf would be impossible.

Frank supposedly first came to the U.S. in 1882 at the age of fourteen or fifteen. He returned to the Podho≈ôany area and married Karol√≠na in her village in 1892, bringing her to America around 1895. Several close relatives also moved to Chicago. In the United States, Frank worked as a painter while Karolina maintained the home.

She died in 1938. and a number of other children who were listening to an organ grinder a short distance from Mrs. Trampota's gate.The idea that organ grinders, who were often Italians, routinely kidnapped children and held them for ransom was as widespread a stereotype as that of gypsies stealing children: these non- Anglo foreigners were frequently accused of such \\"Black Hand\\" crimes, whether true or not. Margaret Sidney's bestseller Five Little Peppers And How They Grew, published in 1881 and a standard of children's literature by 1911, had as its core event a child Elsie's age kidnapped by an organ grinder. See also Ilaria Sera's The Imagined Immigrant: Images of Italian Emigration to the United States between 1890 and 1924 (Rosemont, 2009). When the organ grinder moved to the 23rd St. corner, the children followed him, but subsequently left while Elsie remained behind. Several hours later, Elsie's mother went to her sister's house to find Elsie had never arrived. As Elsie had many friends in the area, the women assumed she was visiting at another home, perhaps to spend the night and return the next morning. At 9pm that evening, Frank Paroubek returned from work and went to police at the Hinman Street station to report her missing. Police initially agreed that she was likely spending the night with friends, but when she had not returned by the following morning, Captain John Mahoney took personal charge of the search.

Healey that he had seen a gypsy wagon on Kedzie Avenue, a block west of Troy Street, with two women holding a little girl. The Chicago American repeated this story with the added detail that the girl seemed to be trying to get away and was being restrained; also, that police had reason to believe this was a \\"Black Hand\\" kidnapping.\\"Kidnaped Girl is trace by Story of Boy.\\" Chicago American, April 13, 1911, p. 1. There were several camps along the Des Plaines River near Kedzie and these were searched. Residents told investigators that one wagon had decamped and left on the morning of April 9. The \\"stolen by gypsies\\" theory gained credence because Elsie's disappearance was almost identical to that of Lillian Wulff, who had been found with gypsies four years earlier.Girl Rescued from Gypsies: Lillian Wulff Was Kidnapped from Her Chicago Home. New York Times, December 14, 1907, p. 1. Elsie's father, Frank Paroubek, offered his life savings, $50 (about $1,165 today), as a reward. Inspector Healey also ordered that drainage canals be dragged for the child's body on April 15, and Governor Charles S. Deneen asked the public to aid in the search. It was at about this time that Elsie's friend Emma Kubat, 14, told police she had last seen Elsie with the organ grinder.\\"Surround Gypsies in Girl Hunt.\\" Chicago American, April 14, 1911, p. 1. Detectives from the Maxwell Street station searched the Italian quarter at West 14th and S.

A full-length photo of Elsie appeared on the front page of the April 12 Chicago American. This photo, enhanced by artists, reappeared many times in the paper. On April 17, it was accompanied by photos of Frank, Karolina and Elsie's sister Julia. Investigation Detectives Joseph, Komorous, and Sheehan accompanied Frank Paroubek in his search for the departed wagon which was initially believed to be headed for Round Lake, Illinois, a village about 50 miles northwest of Chicago, where seven wagons were camped. Farmers in the area were alerted to be on watch. When local residents started asking \\"gypsies\\" about Elsie and attempting to search the wagons, they broke camp again and moved on to Volo, Illinois, 43 miles from Chicago. Volo residents reported a child matching Elsie's description and said she appeared to be \\"stupefied\\" or \\"drugged\\" and partly covered with a blanket. They also attempted to search the wagons, but the \\"gypsies\\" immediately broke camp and departed for McHenry, Illinois, about 60 miles northwest of Chicago. When police caught up with them at McHenry, they discovered the little girl was a \\"gypsy\\" and did not match Elsie's description. Meanwhile, Police Capt. Mahoney assigned men to drag the drainage canals near Elsie's home on April 12 and again on the 15th.\\"The \\"gypsies\\" had left Round Lake when we reached there and we traced them to Volo, Illinois, and then to McHenry, where we found the band,\\" said Det. Sheehan. \\"They had a girl about 5-years old with them, but she was not the missing child. Instead of having blond hair as reported by a number of persons, she had deep black hair and the dark complexion of the gypsies. She was the daughter of one of the gypsies and there was no other girl in the band.\\" \\"Return: Quest for Girl in Vain\\". Chicago Daily News, April 15, 1911, p. 2. In several instances, a child was found in a camp who did resemble Elsie, such that even Frank was momentarily certain it was his daughter and it would take some time to convince him it was a mistake. As late as April 24, when a little girl somewhat answering Elsie's description was found in a \\"gypsy\\" camp near 18th and South Halstead streets, Frank fell to his knees and prayed. The reason for her capture was attributed by police to \\"the natural love of the wandering people for blue-eyed, yellow-haired children\\". Elsie was consistently described as small, with light golden hair and blue eyes, wearing a red one-piece dress, lace shoes (shoes with laces rather than buttons), and black stockings. \\"The little girl is described as having long curly golden hair, blue eyes, and pink chubby cheeks with a prominent dimple in each. At the time she disappeared, she wore a red hat, a red dress, black stockings, and high top black boots.\\" - Chicago Daily News, April 12, 1911. \\"She was a very pretty child and passing strangers often stopped to pass admiring comment upon her.\\" - Rockford Daily Gazette, April 21, 1911. On April 17, Police Capt. Mahoney received an anonymous phone tip that a child answering Elsie's description had been seen accompanying a man to a Western Springs, Illinois, hotel. Again, detectives dispatched to the hotel found nothing.\\"Sent to Look for Missing Girl\\". Chicago Daily News, April 17, 1911, p. 2.

Meanwhile, Hinman Street police fielded reporters' questions about a $500 (nearly $13,000 in 2015) ransom note received by Karolina. They \\"denied official knowledge of the communication, but admitted it might be true.\\"\\"Search For Missing Girl Is Vain\\", Chicago Daily News, April 19, 1911. p. 2.The Oklahoma City Daily Oklahoman for April 21 reported the ransom note item as fact. On April 20, neighbors saw Frank Jr., age 6, lugging a pick and shovel out into South Troy Street and start digging. Upon inquiry, Frank said there had been a lot of construction on the street the day Elsie disappeared, and he had heard his parents discussing the possibility that she had fallen into a hole. As she struggled to climb out, she might have been buried under falling sand and gravel. Workers still fixing the street said that it was possible, but they would have noticed immediately. Meanwhile, people in the West End and a woman in Kings, Illinois, reported sightings of light-skinned girls traveling with gypsies. Lillian Wulff, who advised police on how to proceed in case Elsie Paroubek had been stolen by \\"gypsies\\". Chicago Daily News negatives collection, DN-0003451. Courtesy of Chicago History Museum. In the second week after Elsie's disappearance, Lillian Wulff, age 11, came forward to offer assistance. Wulff herself had been the subject of a similar manhunt four years earlier. She had been stolen by \\"gypsies\\" and held for six days, working as a beggar, until discovered walking behind a \\"gypsy\\" wagon by a farmer outside Momence, Illinois.Researching the disappearance of Catherine Winters, author Charlene Perry came to believe that Lillian's abductors were not Romany after all. The abductors, William and Irene Jones, were indigents who could not find work due to William's extensive criminal record. His wife, Irene, claimed he had stolen children to work as beggars before. Lillian, however, seemed to believe the Joneses to be \\"gypsies,\\" probably as it was reported that way in the press. Charlene Z.

She provided details of her experience of the culture's typical behavior and volunteered to lead a \\"rescue party\\".\\"I believe I could help a lot... O, I could lead the police there. I know every tree on that road. I remember it all. I dream about it lots of times.\\" One of the men who had kidnapped Lillian suggested asking Elijah George, who, he said, was King of the Gypsies. Elijah George was found in Argyle, Wisconsin, and was brought to Joliet but \\"failed to give the desired information\\", and was released. At that point, Inspector Healey again ordered the drainage canal dragged, along with a search of all wells and other places where Elsie could have fallen. On April 22, Gov. Deneen released a front-page statement to the Chicago American calling on \\"every person\\" to aid in the search. Also on April 22, John Muts, the town marshal for Trevor, Wisconsin, received a phone call regarding a blonde child in a nearby gypsy camp. Muts, along with saloonkeeper Carl Czdenek of Lyons, Illinois, met with the girl and Czdenek said he was able to speak with her in Czech and verify that she was Elsie. A Mrs. Alice Gould of nearby McHenry also identified the child as Elsie and said the \\"gypsies\\" had attempted to steal other children in the area.\\"Report Stolen Girl Is Found.\\" Chicago American, April 22, 1911. By April 23, Lt. John Costello of the Hinman Street station told reporters that every \\"kidnapping\\" clue had been exhausted. He was sure Elsie had been \\"attacked and mistreated\\", was now dead, and her body hidden in the cellar of an empty house or deserted barn. He brought detectives to begin investigating empty buildings, barns, sheds, elevators, catchbasins, and basements on or near South Albany Avenue. Several of the detectives brought spades planning to dig in every plot of earth that appeared to have been recently disturbed. Inspector Healey joined in this search along with Detectives Perry and Egan. At the same time, Costello sent two officers to the outskirts of the city on a lead which he had received by telephone but refused to reveal to reporters. Capt. Stephen Wood of the detective bureau was having all \\"gypsy\\" wagons followed and wrote to every police official in the vicinity of Belvidere, Rockford and Janesville, Wisconsin to be on the lookout for Elsie. However, he too was now certain Elsie was either being held for ransom, had been in an accident and was either dead or in some hospital, unable to speak, or had been \\"slain by some degenerate\\" from one of the shanties in the alley near her home. Also on April 23, a neighbor told police that she had last seen Elsie around 11 a.m. on the morning she disappeared, still with the organ grinder and engaged in conversation with a man on the opposite side of the street whom the neighbor did not know. The following day's Chicago Daily News devoted a full column to the search, calling it \\"one of the most extensive and far-reaching quests ever made for a missing child.\\" Twenty police officers and one hundred volunteers were involved in Lt. Costello's search, covering a radius of about a mile of the Paroubek home. It was judged to be \\"one of the most remarkable investigations of its kind\\" because of the intense public interest, but also due to the huge number of child volunteers. Many described themselves not just as casual acquaintances or playmates, but as friends of Elsie. These children offered to look into \\"out of the way places\\" for Elsie or evidence leading to her whereabouts. On April 29, Inspector Healey sent a detective to Zion City, Illinois, in response to a long-distance phone tip from the Zion City deputy sheriff. Again, a child resembling Elsie was seen in a \\"gypsy\\" camp, and again the child was found to be a \\"gypsy\\". By April 30, the superintendent of schools, Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, had requested that all schoolchildren in the Chicago area organize neighborhood searches during spring break. Meanwhile, Frank Paroubek, in desperation, consulted a psychic who said that Elsie was in \\"Argo, Wisconsin\\" (possibly meaning to say Argyle, Wisconsin). Chicago politician Charles J. Vopicka sent officers to the area she indicated, to no avail.\\"Sharp eyes and keen wits of 230,000 school children are enlisted in the search for Elsie Paroubek, kidnapped from her home a month ago. The public school children, with the sanction of Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, have been set at work to aid in finding the stolen girl. Parties are being organized among the children for systematic search of all parts of the city. The kidnapping of the little Paroubek girl has caused the introduction into the Illinois legislature of a bill authorizing the state to offer rewards in kidnapping cases as they now can for the apprehension of a murderer.\\" The search \\"jumped from Illinois to Wisconsin, and from Wisconsin to Minnesota, and then back again to Illinois\\", with no luck. A few days after Elsie's disappearance, Frank Paroubek began to receive anonymous, \\"insulting\\" letters. They were all written in English, which he could not read, so he asked neighbors to translate. The letters claimed that Elsie was hidden away by someone who \\"hated\\" the Paroubeks, accusing them of mistreating her. Frank was so infuriated by the accusation that he burned the letters.\\"Price Put On Murderer\\", Springfield Daily Illinois State Register, May 11, 1911, p. 2. Nonetheless, Detectives Zahour and Zalasky attempted to follow up on this lead. The Czech community rallied to support the Paroubeks. All Czech-speaking policemen were put into plain clothes and assigned to the investigation. The Chicago American revealed that not only Czech speakers were involved in this \\"international squad\\", but police officers Dagulski (Polish), Arens and Richter (German), McCauley (Irish) and Alexander (English) were assigned because they each spoke several languages and would be better able to question \\"every man, woman and child in the camps.\\"\\"Kidnapers Hunted by Linguists.\\" Chicago American, April 13, 1911, p. 1. The women's auxiliary of the Club Bohemia assisted in the search, creating an \\"endless chain letter\\" which was mailed to all parts of the city, with a request for recipients to mail copies to everyone they knew.\\"Try Endless Letter Chain in Search for Child.\\" Rockford Republic, April 28, 1911, p. 16. Various Czech-American politicians became involved. The Bohemian Charitable Association conferred with Mayor Carter Harrison, Jr. on April 22, then announced they would offer a reward of $500 (nearly $13,000 today) and however much more could be raised. Mayor Harrison contributed $25 (a little under $600 today) and sent out a special police squad from City Hall. A detachment also operated out of the Lawndale Avenue station in cooperation with the Hinman Street police. Anton Cermak, then a Chicago alderman, said that if Miss Paroubek were not found by the time of the next city council meeting May 1, he would call upon the city council to offer an even larger reward. At that time, state laws did not allow the offering of a reward for the apprehension of kidnappers as it did for murderers.\\"Emergency legislation permitting Governor Deneen to offer a reward for the safe return of Elsie Paroubek... was started in the general assembly at Springfield yesterday.\\" \\"Bann Kidnapping\\", Grand Forks, ND Herald, April 27, 1911, p. 3. On April 26, Governor Deneen said he planned to ask the legislature to revise the statutes so that a reward could be offered by the State of Illinois in addition to the personal reward fund. Judge Adolph J. Sabath held several interviews with Elsie's family and also contributed $25 (a little under $600 today) to the reward fund. By May 2, he had increased his contribution to $100 (around $2,500 in 2015) and arranged meetings with Czech societies to find ways to increase the fund. Many sightings of girls in a red dress living in a \\"gypsy\\" camp were phoned in to police and followed up. By May 1, police had all but abandoned the idea that she had been stolen by \\"gypsies\\", and were returning their efforts to searching wells and dragging canals.New Lost Girl Clew Fails: Child Seen at Judson, Ill. Gypsy Camp Proves Not To Be Elsie Paroubek. Chicago Tribune May 1, 1911, p. 3. Judge Sabath objected saying that the police hunt was becoming \\"listless\\" because Elsie's parents were poor. He was being \\"swamped\\" with mail, most of it containing contributions to the reward fund, from all over the country, and increased his personal contribution to $100.00 (around $2,500 in 2015) as well. Among the letters was one from Dr. G.T. Screeton of Carlisle, Arkansas which read in part: \\"Dear Judge: In relation to the strange disappearance of Elsie Parobek, I will say that a band of forty gypsy men and four gypsy women with eighteen children ranging in age from three months to eighteen years were seen in the union station at Little Rock, Arkansas last week. All these children looked as if they were not of gypsy parentage.\\" Meanwhile, Detectives Zahour and Zalasky sought a man residing near Madison and Robey streets, the suspected author of the anonymous, threatening letters Frank Paroubek had received. Lt. Costello, supported by Inspector Healey, flatly declared: \\"Elsie Paroubek fell into the drainage canal from the Kedzie Avenue bridge or near it. She was not murdered.\\" They believed the author of the letters to have witnessed this.\\"Police Seek West Side Man to Solve Paroubek Mystery: Believe Resident of District Near Madison and Robey Street Wrote Threatening Letters.\\" Chicago Tribune, May 13, 1911, p. 3. By May 7, twenty-five \\"gypsy\\" bands had been searched and many false leads followed. Police Capt. Mahoney announced his belief that Elsie was dead and that police would continue to search for her body.\\"I am convinced that she is dead, that her body is in the river, or in the drainage canal, or hidden somewhere. I intend to devote all further efforts to a search for her body.\\" Also on May 7, Judge Sabath ordered an investigation of Frank and Karolina themselves, in search of anything in their past that might have caused someone to kidnap Elsie.\\"All Clews to Girl False.\\" Chicago Examiner, May 7, 1911. Discovery Black and white photo of the Chicago drainage canal near the Lockport power plant. Taken between 1898 and 1910. Elsie's body was found in this area. Source: Library of Congress file #4a22397. Two days later on May 9, 1911, electrical engineer George T. Scully and other employees of the Lockport power plant near Joliet, thirty-five miles outside of Chicago, saw a body floating in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. At first, they thought it was an animal from one of the nearby farms, but three hours later, realizing it was a human being, sent out a boat to bring it to shore. Undertaker William Goodale, examining the body, said that it appeared to fit Miss Paroubek's description: \\"The description tallied to the shade of the hair, the texture of the stockings, and the stuff and tint of the dress of little Elsie.\\" He thought the body had been in the water for several weeks, although only slightly decomposed. Another report indicated that her body was \\"badly decomposed\\" but there were \\"no marks of violence\\" on her body.\\"Body of Paroubek Girl, Long Missing, Taken from River.\\" Chicago Inter-Ocean, May 9, 1911, p. 1. Goodale notified Chicago authorities who sent Police Lt. Costello to the Paroubek home. Karolina Paroubek cried \\"M√© drah√© d√≠tƒõ! (My dear child!)\\" and begged to be told Elsie was alive. Frank was taken to the Goodale funeral home at midnight. He said, \\"The clothes look like Elsie's. But the face -- I can't recognize it. Her mother alone can tell.\\" Another newspaper reported that Frank immediately said \\"That's Elsie,\\" and began to cry. Goodale Memorial Chapel, 912 S. Hamilton Street, Lockport, Illinois. Elsie's body was taken here. This funeral home is still in operation. Source: Wikimedia Commons. Karolina arrived at the funeral home by trolley car the following morning and positively identified Elsie, saying \\"It's you, my darling. Thank God we've found you and you're not in the hands of the gypsies.\\" For the next hour, she paced or sat nervously in an adjoining room with Frank holding her hands, weeping, and praying. Goodale, who had kept track of the disappearance in the papers, made this statement to police: \\"The body appears to have been in the water for about a month, which would tally with the date of Elsie Paroubek's disappearance. The child, when she left home, was without hat, and her clothing tallies in every respect with that found on the dead body. There was no ring or other ornament, and in that respect, the descriptions correspond. Excepting only as to the color of the eyes, which cannot be clearly observed as to color, the descriptions are identical.\\" Arrangements were quickly made for an inquest. The jury consisted of F.W. Wurst, Christian Radchiero, John A. Walter, William Woodale, Edwin Murray, and Patrick O'Brien. Coroner William Wunderlich of Will County officiated. As the post-mortem examination began, Frank Paroubek was the first witness. Disregarding questions put to him by the coroner, Frank plunged into charges his daughter had been murdered. Through a translator, he asserted \\"I am sure the gypsies stole my girl and then when they knew we were after them, they killed her and threw her body into the canal.\\" At this, Karolina ran from the funeral parlor screaming \\"My Elsie is dead. She was murdered, murdered.\\" Her husband and Det. Zelasky tried to calm her, but in her extreme distress she began running up and down the street, drawing a crowd of curious onlookers. She insisted she had known for three weeks that the \\"gypsies\\" had killed Elsie. Frank consoled her and assisted her boarding a trolley car for home. Meanwhile, the coroner said: \\"This case has attracted such attention that a minute examination will be made. We will be content with no perfunctory inquest such as this. The jury will refuse to state its convictions -- for it has none -- until after the autopsy has been held. We want the stomach of the little girl examined, and the lungs as well. The father charges murder. It is certainly possible that he is right.\\" Two physicians, E.A. Kingston and W.R. Paddock, confirmed that there was no water in her lungs, so she had not drowned. Kingston said she had been \\"attacked\\" (often a euphemism for rape) and murdered before her body was thrown into the water. Paddock said there was every evidence she had been \\"wounded\\" before being killed. Lt. Costello later told the press that she had been \\"mistreated,\\" seeming to indicate this meant her death was not the work of \\"gypsies,\\" and Inspector Healy added, \\"there seems to be no doubt that she was abused in the most fiendish way, and that fact established, the case is much simplified for the police.\\" They also found \\"deep cuts\\" on the left side of her face.\\"Girl Killed: Not Drowned.\\" Rockford Daily Register-Gazette, May 10, 1911, p. 12. Although these men reported \\"blue marks on the throat as though the victim had been choked,\\" another examination by Drs. E.R. LeCount and Warren H. Hunter of the Coroner's Office revealed that Elsie had been suffocated, not strangled, and there were \\"no distinct marks of violence on the body.\\" Despite this, newspaper headlines reporting the coroners' findings continued to report Elsie as strangled. The official cause of death was marked \\"unknown.\\" Coroner Peter Hoffman concurred with Mr. Paroubek as to the probable circumstances of Elsie's death. \\"It is our belief that the abductor of the child suffocated her to death, possibly by putting a hand over her mouth.\\" The coroner's report recommended that officials continue to investigate. Inspector Healey immediately detailed detectives to find out exactly what had happened. He told the Chicago Inter Ocean: \\"I have forty detectives at work today on the theory that the criminals lived in the neighborhood of the Paroubek home. We are investigating every incident of the lives of the Paroubeks since they came to Chicago in order to trace a possible enemy. It will surprise me if the criminals are not arrested within a week.\\" To the Chicago Tribune he stated, \\"We have one or two theories, but nothing specific enough to even talk about. I intend to place more men on the case tomorrow.\\" Lt. Costello returned to investigating the anonymous letters. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported Hoffman's and Paroubek's theory as fact. On the evening of May 9, Karolina was calmer and gave an interview upon returning home. Surrounded by friends and neighbors she told reporters, \\"Before the doctors found that Elsie's lungs were free from water and discovered reasons for believing she had been strangled, I knew she had been murdered. A picture of the crime has been in my mind since the second week of her disappearance, and I am convinced that when the truth is known, as it surely will be, it will be shown that she was choked to death a week from April 8 when she was kidnapped on her way to visit her 'auntie.'\\" Karolina called upon authorities to find and punish the killers. Following the inquest, Elsie's body was brought home. Her uncle Frank Trampota took charge of the funeral arrangements. Karolina told Judge Sabath that the search had exhausted the family's savings and they had no money to bury her. Judge Sabath gave her a check for $25 promising to raise more funds. Friends and family members continued to collect money for the Paroubek fund. Mrs. Sophie Johanes raised over $50 by giving a benefit party and soliciting donations from Bohemians on the West Coast.Chicago Foreign Language Press Survey, \\"Collection for Benefit of the Paroubek Family\\", page found 2011-11-23. Funeral Elsie Paroubek's funeral was held at 10:00 a.m. on May 12, 1911 on the lawn of the Paroubeks' home and attended by between 2,000 or 3,000 people. The Chicago Inter Ocean newspaper, however, gave the number of attendees as 5,000. Hours before the ceremony, Albany Avenue and the Paroubek back yard, along with the balconies and porches of nearby houses, were filled with mourners. There was no hall in the neighborhood large enough to hold them all. Frank had been offered the use of a hall, but he indicated the huge gathering and said \\"They have come to say goodbye to my Elsie. Don't let them be disappointed.\\" Reserves from the Hinman Street station were called in to keep order and prevent the crowd from breaking down the fence. Elsie's white coffin rested on two brass stands, surrounded by lilies of the valley, roses and carnations sent by Mayor Harrison, Judge Sabath and other city officials. Eight little girls dressed all in white, including Josie Trampota and her sister Mary, brought out huge sprays of lilies and roses and encircled the bier. Someone brought two chairs out of the Paroubek home, set them near the casket, and laid a board across them to hold the hundreds of floral offerings. Karolina was seated at the head of the coffin, while Frank and the other children stood nearby. Rudolf Jarom√≠r P≈°enka, Czech author and playwright, editor of the Chicago Daily Svornost (Concord) from 1909 until his death in 1939. As the Paroubeks were not Catholics but freethinkers,\\"...the Bohemians stood out from other Eastern Europeans by the high proportion who proved indifferent to Catholicism or any other religion... in the United States, the free-thought movement broadened its base and embraced a large number of Bohemian workers as well... Bohemian freethinkers greatly outnumbered Bohemian Catholics in Chicago.\\" Edward R. Kantowicz, \\"The Ethnic Church\\". In Ethnic Chicago: A Multicultural Portrait, Melvin G.

He spoke of the need to cooperate with police to find Elsie's killers. As the undertaker went to lift the coffin into the hearse, Karolina begged him to open it so she could see Elsie's face once more, but her relatives persuaded her not to insist on this and led her away. Most of the attendees followed Elsie's casket to Bohemian National Cemetery, where P≈°enka gave another address. Frank Paroubek was quoted as saying, \\"My little girl is at rest and nothing matters to her now, but I shall never rest until I see her murderers paying the penalty for taking her life.\\"\\"Little Girl Sought By Schoolmates Found Dead: Officials Think Murder.\\" Rockford Daily Register-Gazette, May 12, 1911, p. 1.\\"Thousands at Bier of Murdered Child: Great Crowd Assembles at Home of Paroubek Family to Witness Ceremonies at Funeral of 5-Year-Old Victim of Unknown Slayer.\\" The Inter-Ocean, 1911-05-12, p. 1.

Courtesy of Chicago History Museum. Police Chief John McWeeny vowed to devote the entire Chicago police force to finding the killer. Alderman Cermak asked Governor Deneen to increase the reward by $200, \\"as is possible under the statutes.\\" Cermak said, \\"I will also ask the governor to issue a proclamation calling upon all the people of the state to interest themselves in this case in order that her murderer be apprehended.\\" Coroner Peter Hoffman started a public reward fund, contributing $25. Considering where Elsie was found, detectives suspected the actual killer might be Joseph Konesti. According to the Rockford Republic, Konesti was definitely identified as the killer by detectives under the command of Police Capt. Wood. Described as a \\"bearded Bohemian\\" and a \\"hermit peddler\\",\\"Entering the house where the peddler had lived, the detectives found boxes, barrels, trunks, and bundles containing an assortment of odds and ends and women's and children's finery. There were hymn books, Catholic prayer books in Bohemian and English, ribbons, laces, pieces of silk, women's hats, beads and relics.\\" \\"Found Elsie's Murderer.\\" Rockford Republic, 1911-05-12, p. 13. he was said to have \\"frequently enticed little girls to his hut by the drainage canal,\\" on West 33rd St. and South Kedzie Ave., about a mile and a half from Elsie's home, and had \\"frequently been seen near the Paroubek home.\\"Children routinely visited peddlers to make purchases either for themselves or their parents. See Street Peddling, entry in The Encyclopedia of Chicago History, for some background on peddlers -- the ancestors of today's vendors -- and their connections to immigrant neighborhoods such as the Paroubeks'. Searching the shack, detectives found a green hair ribbon which they intended to take to Karolina for identification, along with \\"indications of a small hole dug in the ground\\" and \\"an old hemp sack, which might have contained the body.\\"\\"Seek Child Murder Clews on Dead Man: Police Think They Have a Link Connecting Unknown Who Died in Canal With Death of Little Elsie Paroubek.\\" The Inter- Ocean, 1911-05-13, p. 10. The owner of the shack,According to Hilda S. Polacheck in her book I Came a Stranger (University of Illinois Press, 1991), Chicago homeowners at that time often built \\"shanties\\" in their back yards and rented them to low income people. Mrs. David Shaughnessy advised police that she had complained to Konesti about his \\"bringing children around the house,\\" and had evicted him on May 9. Konesti threw himself in front of a train on May 10.\\"Found Elsie's Murderer.\\" Rockford Republic, 1911-05-12, p. 13. Five days later he was cleared of any wrongdoing. On May 13, the body of a well-dressed man was found in the canal at Willow Springs, some 20 miles from Lockport and 14 miles from Albany Avenue. He had no identification, only a Catholic holy card with a prayer in Polish, with the words \\"Sig. Hoff\\" written on it. Detectives believed this man also may have had some connection with Elsie's death. An anonymous letter was said to have been received by the detectives. The writer described having seen a little girl walking along the canal with a young man the day Elsie disappeared. On the same day, another loner living in a shack by the canal was identified as a possible person of interest. Mr. Kinsella, described as a \\"religious enthusiast,\\" was \\"supposed to be demented.\\" When he saw Detectives Gormley, Slad, and Froenicke approaching his home, he took off running, \\"making a move as if to draw a revolver.\\" Calling out that they only wanted to question him, the officers fired their weapons into the air. After a three-mile chase through gullies and underbrush, Kinsella escaped into the forest. On May 15, Frank Paroubek told police he had spoken to a man he did not know who told him he had seen Elsie late in the afternoon of April 8 on Kedzie Avenue, south of 28th St., long after she was supposed to have been taken by the \\"gypsies.\\" Lt. Costello assigned detectives to find the man. The previous reported sighting of Elsie had her walking toward the canal on South Troy St., a half block south of her aunt's house. If the unknown man told the truth, Elsie was only three blocks away from a bridge. Despite the coroner's findings, Lt. Costello had become convinced that Elsie's death was an accident and that she had simply fallen into the canal, although Inspector Healey had had the canals and drainage ditches dragged repeatedly during the search. Coroner Hoffman continued to insist Elsie was murdered. Apparently some confusion had occurred during the initial examinations. The first physician (probably Dr. Kingston) to examine Elsie on the night of May 9 told Lt. Costello that she had drowned, with no marks of abuse, and Costello had repeated this when he spoke to the family. However, the following day, the same physician's autopsy findings concluded Elsie had not drowned and that she appeared to have been suffocated. Detectives surrounded a house near Madison and Robey Streets, and threw a dragnet over the southwestern side of town for a former boarder in the Paroubek home. They continued to search for the anonymous writer of the nasty letters received by Frank Paroubek. Apparently neither the boarder, the writer, or the unknown man who had spoken to Frank were ever found. No one knows what really happened to Elsie Paroubek. Two years later, on the anniversary of Elsie's funeral, Frank Paroubek died. He was forty-five years old. Karolina lived until December 9, 1927. Both are buried with Elsie in Bohemian National Cemetery. Legacy Although Elsie's mysterious disappearance and death were once the subject of intense police investigation and journalistic focus, her story faded into obscurity until the death of Henry Darger in 1973. Michael Bonesteel, an art historian examining Darger's work, found repeated reference in Darger's Story of the Vivian Girls novel to Annie Aronburg, leader of a child slave rebellion, and to an inspirational picture of her that had been lost. Miss Aronburg had met a shocking yet heroic death at the hands of her captors. (The murder is described in detail, and is nothing like Elsie's death.) According to his diary, Darger really had lost a picture of a little girl and was desperate to get it back or replace it. He did not give the name but said it had appeared in the \\"Chicago Daily Noise , May, June, or July, 1911.\\" Bonesteel's search in the newspaper archives revealed Elsie Paroubek and her story. A portrait of Annie Aronburg by Darger shows a somewhat older blonde- haired girl. Her hair ribbon and the distinctive collar of her dress are similar to Elsie's in the photograph. In the novel, Darger describes children who are kidnapped and mistreated by adults, while the heroic little Vivians, Annie Aronburg and others form \\"rescue squads\\" to save them.Michael Bonesteel, Henry Darger: Art and Selected Writings.

Life and work Mary Anne Raywid married Raymond Lewis Scheele and raised their son Scott in Long Island, NY. She spent 30 years here as a tenured professor at Hofstra University, teaching Educational Administration and Policy Studies, beginning in 1959. During this time she began to publish her written work on education, releasing over 300 works in her lifetime. Notably, her book The Ax Grinder (1963) addressed the criticism of public education and advocated for reform of the system rather than the creation of mass charter and private schools. She served as the president of the Society of Professors of Education from 1978‚Äì1979. Raywid left Hofsta University of Long Island in 1996 to move to Honolulu, Hawaii, to care for her husband, until the end of his life. While there, she worked as an adjunct professor at University of Hawaii at Manoa, eventually chairing the League of Women Voters‚Äô Education Committee, from 1998 until 2008.

December, 1997 ‚Äì January 1998: 34 ‚Äì 37. She believed that ‚ÄúThe bigger the school, the more it loses its humanity.‚Äù In Kapaa Elementary she helped to found the School- Within-A-School system, creating multiple small, focused institutions inside of one building. With lower populations in both classrooms and schools, she believed, teachers would be able to teach to individual student needs rather than the uniform education present in larger classrooms. Creating smaller schools would also address the problem Raywid saw in the shift from teacher control of the classroom to state mandates of what and how education is to be taught in public schools. Smaller schools, she believed, would give the decision of the pedagogy and focus of children‚Äôs education to their families.Raywid, Mary Anne. ‚ÄúRestoring School Efficiency by Giving Parents a Choice‚Äù Educational Leadership.

Ed. William Ayers. Teachers College Press, 1995. The way that a teacher interacts with their students, she writes, impacts the ways students can discuss their grievances and their feelings of wrongdoings occurring in the classroom. Self- esteem, also, is created through the ways that teachers talk to and interact with their students. Raywid urges teachers to ‚Äúshare the power‚Äù of the classroom with the students, rather than keeping strong classroom power to themselves.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History The abbey was founded between 1110 and 1120. It was first mentioned in 1123 as monte de bono. It was founded in the wake of the 11th century Benedictine reform movement. While the exact date and circumstances of the foundation are unknown, it was probably supported by the Savoy abbeys in the Vall√©e d'Aulps and in the French Jura Mountains. The oldest surviving document mentioning the abbey is a deed of gift from the lords of Divonne and Gingins in 1131. The deed mentions, without elaboration, the presence of a monastic community at Bonmont in 1123, and makes clear that in 1131, six years after a visit of Bernard of Clairvaux to the area, the monastery had joined the Cistercian Order. In 1131, the foundation stone of the abbey church was laid. Construction continued until the end of the 12th century. The church was built during the transition from Romanesque to Gothic architecture and includes elements of both styles. The original architecture was kept simple and sober, according to the strict rules of the Benedictine Order and in accordance with the desires of the Cistercians. However, the simple design of the church and the simplicity of monastic life were quickly replaced by wealth. Numerous donations enlarged the possessions of the abbey and created ties between the monks and the local nobility. The area owned by the abbey stretched from the foot of the Jura to the C√¥te de Nyon and up to Aubonne. Under the protection of the House of Savoy in the 13th century, Bonmont Abbey was one of the richest monasteries in the Lake Geneva area. As the worldly wealth of the abbey increased, the strict rules of the Cistercians loosened. From the 14th century the church was decorated in vibrant colors, ocher yellow or black floral motifs, and also paintings, in disregard of the old rule that churches interiors should be covered in white lime plaster only. There was also a significant structural change: in 1488 the humble roof turret was replaced by a massive tower over the transept. With the conquest of Vaud by Bern and the Reformation the abbey was secularized in 1536. The monastic buildings were converted into agricultural ones or were demolished. The abbey church was converted for practical use: the wood flooring was torn up and used to create a wine warehouse on the ground floor and a granary above in the nave of the church. In the north transept, a cheese factory was established and in the south, a bakery. Just below the chancel arch there was room for a small chapel, which remained in operation. Because the church was put to secular use, it was saved from demolition. In 1761 the interior of the church was completely remodeled. The old hospital of the abbey remained in operation after the dissolution of the monastery until 1672. It was replaced in 1736 with a castle that housed the bailiwick administrative office. Following the Vaud Revolution in 1798, the abbey buildings became the property of the state, falling into private ownership in 1802. In 1820 the church was dramatically transformed. Two new entrances, one with a pointed arch and the other with a rounded arch, were built into the fifth bay of the southern side of the nave and the second bay of the northern side. Above the bakery a two-story residence was added. In 1942 the church was declared a National Monument. In 1982 it became the property of the Canton of Vaud, which carried out a thorough restoration that ended in 1995. The Bernese bailiwick castle and the castle grounds are still privately owned.

MHHSE is the oldest accredited high school in the state of Tennessee. The school incorporates grades 9-12. The school mascot is \\"Storm\\" the Ibis, students and faculty are known as the Hurricanes and the school colors are orange and black. The school had an enrollment of around 1,520 students as of the 2017-2018 school year. Joseph Ely is the head principal. History Morristown-Hamblen High School East entrance Morristown High School was built in 1923 and was admitted to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Isenberg-Siler Gymnasium was added in 1954 and the third floor was added in 1955. The south wing was added in 1968. A major renovation occurred in 1989 at a cost of 8.9 million dollars. A 1.3 million dollar library was opened in 2004 and was named in memory of Dr. Joe E. Gibson, Sr., a former School Board Member and East High supporter. A multimillion-dollar school-wide renovation/remodel occurred between 2010 and 2012. This included the addition of a new administrative wing, a new cafeteria, Freshman Academy, STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) Academy, and Health Wing. The school changed names in 1968 and has been known as Morristown-Hamblen High School East since that time due to the new high school, Morristown-Hamblen High School West for students who lived west of Morristown. The building is of traditional style and is located half a mile from the center of downtown Morristown. Morristown High School was known originally as the Golden Hurricanes but the name has been changed to the Hurricanes. The symbol used in earlier years was a tornado. However, the new logo is that of a hurricane, created for MHHSE by a design artist from New Jersey. The main building at Morristown East has dozens of classrooms, a cafeteria, an auditorium, a gymnasium, STEM Academy, Freshman Academy, Health and Wellness Center, and a library. In 2019, Principal Gary Johnson retired after holding the position of principal for 29 years.

He had a long and successful career in Paris from the 1850s up to his death. Life and career After his beginnings in provincial theatres, Christian made his debut in the French capital at the Th√©√¢tre des D√©lassements-Comiques in April 1847. His career took off with roles in Claude le Riboteur, Polkette et Bamboche, Sur la goutti√®re, La Bouqueti√®re des Innocents and in revue. He moved to the Th√©√¢tre des Folies- Dramatiques in 1849 and appeared in many plays, such as Les Filles en feu, Le Bal du sauvage, La Courte-paille, Le Festin de Balthazar, Le Postillon de Cr√®vec≈ìur.

Christian was popular with audiences through his reputation for his ad-libbing.Yon, Jean-Claude. Jacques Offenbach. √âditions Gallimard, Paris, 2000. He featured in other revivals such as La Grande-Duchesse de G√©rolstein and La belle H√©l√®ne (Agamemnon).

He appeared at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on from 1870 to 1872 and then briefly at the Vari√©t√©s before re-joining Offenbach at the Ga√Æt√© where he appeared in the premiere of Le Voyage dans la lune and in revised versions of Orph√©e aux Enfers (as Jupiter) and Genevi√®ve de Brabant (Golo). When the 'Th√©√¢tre-Lyrique' opened at the Ga√Æt√© after Offenbach‚Äôs departure, he even undertook the op√©ra comique repertoire, including La poup√©e de Nuremberg, Giralda (Don Japhet), Les rendez-vous bourgeois and Le sourd (Doliban).Noel E & Stoullig E.

In January 1875 he was withdrawn from the revival of Les brigands after a complaint from a government minister to the theatre management that Christian had introduced the actor playing Gloria-Cassis in the tones of catholic liturgy. Renowned for his constant wit, on the mirror of his dressing-room was pasted the inscription ¬´ Les raseurs sont pri√©s de ne pas moisir ici ¬ª (Bores should not hang around here). According to Vanloo, his over-the-top performance as a sea-sick passenger in the vaudeville Coco at the Th√©√¢tre des Nouveaut√©s in June 1878 led him to pun ¬´ Que diraient mes administr√©s s'ils me voyaient avoir le mal de maire ? ¬ª - as he was at the time the mayor of a commune near Chantilly.Vanloo, A.

Early life and family Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 4 August 1940, Geddes was educated at Holy Cross Academy. In 1965, he married Estelle Philomena O'Keeffe, and the couple went on to have four children. They emigrated to New Zealand in 1970, and Geddes was naturalised as a New Zealander in 1977.  University career Geddes began his career in the Department of Biochemistry of the University of Auckland as a senior lecturer in 1970, after obtaining BSc(Hons) and PhD degrees in chemistry ifrom the University of Edinburgh, and postdoctoral fellowships in physical biochemistry at the Australian National University (1967‚Äì69), and at Georgetown University, Washington, DC, (1965‚Äì66). In Auckland he investigated the structure and metabolism of glycogen, an energy storage polysaccharide, by physical biochemistry methods. His work provided evidence for the existence of a protein core, now known as glycogenin, within glycogen.Albert L. Lehninger, David Lee Nelson, Michael M. Cox: Principles of Biochemistry, 2nd ed 1993, Worth. He was deputy Dean of Science from 1982 to 1985 at the University of Auckland and subsequently Dean from 1986 to 1993. In 1994, he moved to Auckland Institute of Technology as its Dean of Science and Engineering. During his term as Dean, his faculty acquired a modern and attractive building, and the Institute became Auckland University of Technology, a transformation to which Geddes contributed significantly.Ken Scott: Farewell: Professor Roy Geddes 1940 - 2006. Geddes served on UNESCO committees as a New Zealand representative and provided consultancy to Ministry of Research, Science and Technology of New Zealand.  Friction stir welding  Geddes described himself as the catalyst, who had kicked off the industrialisation of friction stir welding in New Zealand, after obtaining consultancy about the process at TWI (The Welding Institute) during a trip to the United Kingdom. While working at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) he teamed up with New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE), Marine Industry Association (MIA), ION Automotive NZ, Circa Marine & Industrial and Ullrich Aluminium, to disseminate and utilise the know-how. At this time in 2004 it was announced that a number of 55 metre Protector-class inshore patrol vessels would be procured for use by the Royal Australian Navy and Royal NZ Navy - and now the opportunity existed for both Australia and New Zealand to be involved in building them. The naval architect of these vessels specified that a significant portion of the structure had to be friction stir welded.Stephan Kallee: NZ Fabricators begin to use Friction Stir Welding to produce aluminium components and panels. Paper published in New Zealand Engineering News, August 2006. The collaborators made a concerted effort on bringing New Zealand up to speed in this field by co-operative technology transfer. In mid-2005, the Donovan Group in Whangarei implemented friction stir welding for the manufacture of these vessels. The Donovan Group has since then modified a large CNC gantry milling machine to be used as a friction stir welding machine for large scale production, which is required for the patrol vessel building. AUT has also developed the application of friction stir welding in the production of alloy wheel rims and structures using thick aluminium alloy plates. All of the FSW carried out by AUT has been achieved on existing manufacturing equipment that the university has modified, as opposed to custom-built friction stir welding machinery. Contractually, the industrial uptake of friction stir welding was comparatively easy in New Zealand, since the Australian/New Zealand Standard on 'Welding of aluminium structures' had been issued.Reference AS/NZS Australian/New Zealand Standard on 'Welding of aluminium structures.' 1665:2004 This was one of the first standards that covers friction stir welding, although it actually focuses on arc welding. It includes an innovation clause within its first section, which states that 'The Standard can be applied to other welding processes such as friction welding, including friction stir, [‚Ä¶] provided all requirements of the Standard are met, as well as specific constraints of needs, demands and operation of the individual welding processes.'  Honours  Ribbon of the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal Geddes was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal, and in 1999 he was elected as one of the three inaugural Companions of the Royal Society of New Zealand. In the 2002 New Year Honours, Geddes was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to science and technology education. Death Geddes died in North Shore City on 25 August 2006, and his ashes were buried at North Shore Memorial Park.

Family Guy Online was free-to-play using the Unity game engine. The game launched into public beta in April 2012, but on December 21, 2012, the developers announced that the game would not be developed beyond beta status and would be permanently shut down on January 18, 2013. The shutdown took place as announced, and the game is now closed.Closure notice on the Home Page Retrieved February 7, 2013. Gameplay The player character receives a quest from Stewie Griffin, a character from the television series Family Guy that acts as a non-playable quest giver in the game. Family Guy Online uses cel shaded graphics. The game uses typical MMORPG character classes such as having Stewie act as a ranger, Peter as a tank, and Lois as a healer. Players create their own character in the game using the Griffin family as a template. The actual characters from the show are reserved as non-playable characters (NPCs) in the game in order to give the player quests and advance the storyline (pictured). The NPCs in the game are voiced by the same voice actors in the show. The game used two types of in-game currency: cash and clams. Clams are earned by completing in-game objectives. Development Family Guy Online was first revealed by 20th Century Fox through social media and through its official website on June 16, 2011, with initial plans to launch the game in autumn 2011. People wishing to join the beta phase for the game were invited to register on the website, although registration did not guarantee entrance into the beta. The game would use the Unity game engine to run within a user's web browser. IGN's Nick Kolan said that the game's use of cel shaded graphics showed potential for the game, but worried that it \\"could also be a total no-effort cash-cow.\\" Rather than licensing the rights to create a game based on the television series, Family Guy Online was developed directly by 20th Century Fox, in partnership with Roadhouse Interactive and Sleepy Giant Entertainment. The publisher of the game wanted it to appeal to both casual and hardcore gamers, and to this end chose to make the game using the Unity engine instead of developing it as a game for Facebook. The game was launched in 2012 and entered a public beta phase on April 17, 2012, but never moved out of beta. On December 21, 2012, an announcement posted on the Family Guy Online website stated that the game would be permanently closed on January 18, 2013. Real-money purchases that players had made within the 60 days prior to the announcement would be refunded to them. Critical Reception The game was universally praised by critics, with critics especially noting the high polygon count in Peter Griffin's face. IGN.com's Eric Goldman noted in his review: \\"While the gameplay, writing and game design leave a lot to be desired, Family Guy Online is worth your time just because of how gorgeous Peter's model looks. This truly feels like the next evolution of gaming, and I felt like I was really there.

He currently serves as director of the Molecular Neurobiology Unit at the Douglas Institute Research Centre and, co-founder and associate director of the Centre for the Studies on the Prevention of Alzheimer's disease at McGill University.  Career  He received his undergraduate training at the Universit√© de Montr√©al in biochemistry and clinical sciences. Shortly after, he joined Dr. Andr√© Barbeau‚Äôs group at the Clinical Research Institute of Montr√©al where he worked on the neurobiology of Parkinson's disease. He then moved to the Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Research Consortium of Southern California which is based at the Andrus Gerontology Centre, in Los Angeles. It is in California that he discovered the important role of apolipoprotein E, a cholesterol transporter that acts as a powerful modulator of brain reinnervation and a key player in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. In 1989, McGill University and the Douglas Institute recruited him back to Montr√©al to establish a research program specialized in the molecular biology of neurodegenerative diseases.  Significant contributions  Dr. Poirier has made some key contributions to the advancement of scientific research on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. He belongs to a short list of Canadian scientists who made milestone discoveries in Canadian Health Research history. He is internationally renowned for his works on the role of apolipoprotein E in the normal and injured brain and, in the genetics of Alzheimer's disease. Beside his seminal contribution in the field of the neurobiology and genetics of apolipoprotein E, he has been a pioneer in the establishment of the pharmacogenomic bases of brain diseases treatment. Dr Poirier is also the co-founder of several Canadian-based biotech corporations including Nova Molecular Inc. (1996‚Äì2000) and more recently Spectral Neuroscience Inc. (2004 -) which have been involved in the development and commercialization of pharmacogenomics services and gene-based therapy for biotech and pharmaceutical corporations.  Honours and awards  He received several international scientific awards in recent years including: the International Society for Neurochemistry Investigator Award in 1995, in Kyoto, Japan; the AAIC/First Parke-Davis International Award (now referred to as the AAIC Lifetime Achievement Award in Alzheimer's Disease) in 1996, in Osaka, Japan and the Galien Prize (1997). On national scene, he was the recipient of the Beaubien Award of the Alzheimer Society of Canada (1994) and, the Investigator Award (1994) and Innovation Award (1998) of Canadian College of Neuropsychopharmacology (CCNP). He was more recently awarded the Jonas Salk Award (1999) in honor of Dr. Salk, the inventor of the polio vaccine, the AstraZeneca/ASC/RxDx Award (2001) and the CSCC Award (2001) for his seminal work in the field of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. In the summer of 2004, he was nominated to the rank of Knight of the National Order of Quebec by the Premier of Quebec.

General statements * ‚Äî Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd wrote an op-ed for The Australian published 20 May 2011 entitled \\"Keep the faith with the Arab spring.\\" Rudd compared the struggle of Arabs demonstrating for political reforms and democratisation to the sputtering pro-democracy movements within Australia's geographic proximity in Fiji, Indonesia and Myanmar, as well as more successful democratisation efforts in India, South Africa, and Turkey. He also indicated Australian support for the protesters, writing, \\"The Arab democratic revolutions have made it clear that democracy is not something called for by the West. The call for democracy came resoundingly from within and to the complete surprise of the outside world. Now the international community has a responsibility to stand in support of Arab citizens in their call for democracy, human rights and the rule of law... That is why countries like Australia take a long-term approach to supporting democracy.\\" * ‚Äî At a seminar on 16 June 2011 held by the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, Permanent Secretary of Defence, Justice and Security Segakweng Tsiane, representing the Batswana government, called the Arab Spring a \\"wakeup call.\\" She said the popular uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia, and other countries indicated that those governments did not do enough to accommodate the desires of their citizenry. Tsiane expressed dissatisfaction with the way the Arab Spring has manifested, however, saying that inclusive national dialogue would be preferable to uprisings. * ‚Äî Canadian daily The Globe and Mail has suggested that \\"Canada's cautious approach toward the Arab Spring democracy movements is in contrast to many other G8 nations.\\" Despite his stiff criticism of crackdowns by the Libyan, Syrian, and Yemeni governments, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on 26 May that his government believed international aid to post-revolutionary countries should be provided by regional financial institutions such as the African Development Bank. Canada, he said, would not offer more direct financial assistance to countries revolutionised by the Arab Spring. * ‚Äî In an extended question-and-answer session posted on the Eritrean Ministry of Information website in late May and early June, President Isaias Afewerki said the events in the Arab world should be viewed as separate but inter-related, with corruption, socioeconomic stratification, and dependence on foreign governments being a factor common to many of the countries that experienced unrest. He blamed the United States for a Middle Eastern policy he said created \\"chaos...in a creative way to further their aims and interests\\". He criticised \\"external intervention\\" in the affairs of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and other countries affected by the uprisings and said, \\"The fact remains that every people must solve their own problems according to their own convictions and without any external interference.\\" Afewerki suggested that at least some of the protests were sparked and fueled by the West, saying, \\"These developments have served to teach a lesson to everyone about the wayward western policies in the last 20 years.\\" He accused the West of attempting to create a New World Order by manipulating organisations like the African Union and the Arab League into interfering with countries to Western countries' advantage. * ‚Äî Foreign Minister Alain Jupp√© spoke at the Arab World Institute for a symposium on the Arab Spring in Paris on 16 April. He took a tone of humility, acknowledging that the revolutionary wave came as a \\"surprise\\" to France and admitting, \\"For too long we thought that the authoritarian regimes were the only bastions against extremism in the Arab world. Too long, we have brandished the Islamist threat as a pretext for justifying to an extent turning a blind eye on governments which were flouting freedom and curbing their country's development.\\" Jupp√© compared the Arab Spring favourably to the Islamic Golden Age and said, \\"We mustn't be afraid of this 'Arab Spring'.\\" He said that while France does not have a policy of supporting \\"regime change\\", it intends to speak up for human rights in the Arab world and back transitions to democracy in North Africa, a region with which France has historically had close ties. He expressed confidence in protesters and concluded the speech by saying he was hopeful about the outcome of the Arab Spring. President Nicolas Sarkozy urged G8 countries to agree on a financial aid package to post- revolutionary Egypt and Tunisia on 26 May in response to requests by the transitional authorities in Egypt and Tunisia for money. Speaking at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., on 6 June, Jupp√© reiterated many of the main points of his 16 April address, saying, \\"Above all, we must not be afraid of the Arab Spring because it embodies universal values: dignity, freedom, respect for human rights, the right of people to choose their own leaders.\\" He took a shot at American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington's controversial book The Clash of Civilizations, which influenced Western thinking regarding Islam and the Islamic world in the post‚ÄìCold War era, claiming that \\"allowing the flame of hope kindled by the Arab Spring to go out would be vindicating the defenders of the clash of civilisations.\\" Jupp√© also made reference to Sarkozy's support for financial aid to Egypt and Tunisia, as well as its participation in international military efforts to end the civil war in Libya. * ‚Äî On 14 April, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman claimed that only economic stability would lead to political stability in the Arab world. He called the Arab Spring \\"an opportunity for the Arab world to move to democracy and prosperity\\" but emphasised that his government considers \\"the security of Israel,\\" with a history of political and ethnic tensions within the Muslim-majority Middle East, to be paramount. * ‚Äî Prime Minister Karim Masimov told Reuters on 2 April that his government is paying close attention to the protests and revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa. Masimov suggested that a lack of educational opportunities and social mobility, which he claimed were not major problems in Kazakhstan compared to in Egypt and Tunisia, had contributed to the revolutionary fervor gripping the Arab world. \\"What is the biggest difference between them and us?\\" Masimov asked rhetorically. \\"People in Kazakhstan, the young generation in Kazakhstan, have hope and they have an opportunity to go forward.\\" He admitted that the Arab Spring highlighted political reforms needed in Astana and said Kazakhstan would transition peacefully toward democracy without experiencing the turmoil that the Arab world was going through. * ‚Äî On 8 June, President Roza Otunbayeva addressed the World Economic Forum in Vienna, Austria, and spoke briefly about the Arab Spring. Otunbayeva, who came to power as Kyrgyzstan's interim leader after the 2010 Kyrgyzstani revolution and presided during a parliamentary election that gave a counter-revolutionary party a plurality, said: \\"After what happened in North Africa and the Middle East, slowly European countries started recognising that it's unacceptable, outrageous, that those dictators shoot their people,\\" and urged other Central Asian countries to follow Kyrgyzstan's example or risk experiencing a revolution like those in Tunisia and Egypt. * ‚Äî In a speech on Islam and moderation in Oxford, England, on 17 May, Prime Minister Najib Razak touched on the events of the Arab Spring, noting the \\"overwhelming\\" pace and scale of the unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. He added, \\"But amidst the chaos and the confusion we should not lose sight of the fact that these countries and peoples now face a fateful choice: the choice between extremism and intolerance ... and a peaceful, democratic moderation that will grant them more freedom of expression, not less.\\" In stating Malaysia's support for the Palestinian nationalist movement, he pointedly added, \\"In supporting the Palestinian and other righteous causes, Malaysia will not support violence against non-combatants, civilians, women, children, the aged and infirm.\\" Najib suggested moderates could prevail in the Arab Spring and break the cycle of violence and oppression in the region, comparing the situation to the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, the Indian independence movement, and civil rights struggles in South Africa and the United States. * ‚Äî On 2 August, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully expressed his government's optimism for a positive outcome to the Arab Spring, in his opinion; while also ultimately cautioning that \\"this transition process will not be straightforward [and] we cannot take the changes for granted.\\" McCully remarked on the unexpected nature of the uprisings and said: \\"What we do know is that we are now dealing with a series of very different leadership models and high expectations for a better future. While elites remain unchanged in many countries, Arab leaders will have to become more responsive to their people.\\" He also said New Zealand was engaging with Arab governments and had offered its diplomatic and economic support to transitional authorities in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. * ‚Äî President Dmitri Medvedev voiced consternation over the Arab Spring on 14 June, telling his Uzbekistani counterpart President Islam Karimov that he hoped it would bring about an outcome \\"that is clear and predictable for us.\\" He said the revolutionary wave could destabilise Russia and its neighbours. On 14 July, he compared the Arab Spring to the fall of the Berlin Wall and said it proved that \\"socioeconomic reforms, reforms that would take into account the interests of the widest majority of the population, must be carried out in due time\\". * ‚Äî At a summit in Istanbul in mid-March, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said the revolts in the region signified a popular \\"demand for change.\\" He warned that Arab governments would be well suited to be responsive to their people's demands and refrain from using violence or coercion. Erdoƒüan stressed that Turkey will not intervene in the affairs of other countries, but it \\"will continue to offer sincere and constructive criticism.\\" * ‚Äî Prime Minister David Cameron expressed both enthusiasm and caution about the Arab Spring at the G8 meeting in late May 2011, offering financial assistance to post-revolutionary Egypt and Tunisia and saying, \\"I want a very simple and clear message to come out of this summit, and that is that the most powerful nations on earth have come together and are saying to those in the Middle East and North Africa who want greater democracy, greater freedom, greater civil rights, we are on your side.\\" He warned that if Western governments did not provide aid, prolonged chaos in the region could breed Islamic extremism and accelerate the pace of immigration by North Africans to European countries, something Foreign Secretary William Hague said the UK believed to be unacceptable earlier in the month; however, with a note of caution; to be caught-amongst those supporting; & fighting against, greater involvement, with arab spring politics, in the larger towns; & cities of the UK-{in specific, the north}-is not a moorish pleasure to be sipped; & savoured; its pretty heated debate. **Just a day after Cameron's remarks, The Observer reported that British officers were training snipers and elite security forces in Saudi Arabia that had been deployed to squelch protesters calling for reforms in Saudi Arabia as well as neighboring Bahrain. On 17 June, Hague described the Arab Spring as a more transformational event than the September 11 attacks of 2001 and claimed that \\"the real nature of the Arab world is expressed in Tahrir Square, not at Ground Zero\\". * ‚Äî On 19 May, President Barack Obama gave a foreign policy speech to an invited audience and members of the press at the State Department in regards to the Arab Spring. He contrasted the ideology of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, recently killed by US Navy SEALS, with that of pro-democracy protesters in the Middle East and North Africa, saying: \\"By the time we found bin Laden, al Qaeda's agenda had come to be seen by the vast majority of the region as a dead end, and the people of the Middle East and North Africa had taken their future into their own hands.\\" Obama praised the demonstrators, comparing their efforts to bring about reform to the actions of the Boston Tea Party and Rosa Parks in American history. He criticized socioeconomic stratification in the Middle East, saying, \\"The nations of the Middle East and North Africa won their independence long ago, but in too many places their people did not. In too many countries, power has been concentrated in the hands of the few.\\" He added that \\"through the moral force of non-violence, the people of the region have achieved more change in six months than terrorists have accomplished in decades. Obama also pledged to continue U.S. security policy in the region, but said he would also emphasize the opposition of the United States to violent and repressive governmental responses to the Arab Spring and its support for human rights and democratic reforms, claiming, \\"Our support for these principles is not a secondary interest... [It] will be the policy of the United States to promote reform across the region, and to support transitions to democracy.\\" Varying reactions Harsh government responses to protests in many Arab countries have met international condemnation. However, there have been some notable exceptions. France, the former colonial ruler of Tunisia, refused to denounce President Zine el- Abidine Ben Ali's attempt to disperse demonstrators in his country by force in January 2011 prior to the Tunisian revolution; Foreign Affairs Minister Mich√®le Alliot-Marie said the French \\"must not stand out as lesson-givers\\" in Tunisia, while the French minister for agriculture defended Ben Ali, saying, \\"President Ben Ali is someone who's frequently judged badly, [but] he's done a lot of things.\\" The French government later took a leading role in supporting the opposition to Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi in Libya, forming a tripartite alliance with the United Kingdom and Lebanon on the United Nations Security Council to successfully lobby for international military intervention, though it was Peru that was the first country to sever bilateral relations with the government in Tripoli over the crackdown on Libyan protesters in February 2011. The government of Iran condemned the Egyptian government's response to protests and was harshly critical of the Bahraini monarchy's reaction to the demonstrations in the Gulf archipelago, but has virtually ignored President Bashar al-Assad's violent suppression of protests during the uprising in Syria and according to the U.S. government, has possibly provided aid to suppressing the protests. Conversely, while Qatar staked out its place as a primary backer of the attempted revolution against Gaddafi and a \\"key ally\\" of the partially recognized National Transitional Council, the provisional government of the self-declared Libyan Republic, it steadfastly supported the supranational Gulf Co-operation Council in its military intervention to quell protests in neighboring Bahrain, contributing troops to the Peninsula Shield Force mission there. The government of Morocco received praise from the U.S. government for its response to major protests, though the U.S. condemned the governments of Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, and Yemen for their actions in dealing with demonstrators. However, it has stopped short of calling for regime change in Bahrain alone among those states. Saudi Arabia was one of the first Arab countries to publicly condemn the Syrian government over its reaction to the uprising in that country, with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia giving a televised speech shortly after midnight on 8 August to announce the recall of its ambassador from Damascus and warn authorities to institute major reforms and stop all violence. However, it was also the largest contributor of troops to GCC operations to help suppress the Bahraini uprising, as well as a vocal supporter of Bahrain's embattled monarchy amidst protests and violence in Manama. Saudi Arabia also supported a GCC-sponsored transition agreement to bring peace to Yemen and phase out the incumbent government there, which was repeatedly rebuffed despite Saudi pressure. After an attempt on Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh's life, Saudi authorities allowed the wounded leader to undergo several months of hospital treatment in Riyadh, the Saudi Arabian capital, but eventually allowed him to return home despite earlier suggestions that he would be contained in Saudi Arabia. Reactions around the world turned many into activists from afar when the effects of the Arab Spring began to affect their loved ones still in these countries. After seeing the personal nature of the repression, many who were abroad began to speak out, creating a global network that would help hold these leaders accountable. While many citizens abroad typically feared coming out against their own government, by the time the Libyan government began to fall most were actively speaking against their government's oppression.Moss, Dana M. \\"Transnational Repression, Diaspora Mobilization, And The Case Of The Arab Spring.\\" Social Problems 63.4 (2016): 480-498. Academic Search Complete. Web. 14 Nov. 2016. For other countries in the region, foreign policy has been heavily shaped by the Arab Spring. For example, many in Turkey are calling for \\"zero problems with neighbors\\" approach which helps unify MENA countries by ending warfare and struggle across the region. This is a proactive response which recognizes a country like Turkey's unique influence in the region.Aras, B√ºlent, and Sevgi Akar√ße≈üme. \\"Turkey and the Arab Spring.\\" International Journal, vol. 67, no. 1, 2011, pp. 39‚Äì51. www.jstor.org/stable/23265964. Interest in the Arab spring had a different tone around the world. In South Korea, for example, there was political coverage that focused on the causes of the Arab Spring but never really went into in depth analysis. This important difference is between the United States vested interest in the country compared to other countries across the globe. South Korea, an ever-increasing world power, has very little use in covering this story. Most of the newspapers took tones that reflected a possible sentiment similar to what people would feel in China and in North Korea but never really sought far to compare the two. Political coverage in these far reaching parts of the globe was dim because of the lack of national interest in these states.Ha, Jae Sik, and Donghee Shin. \\"Framing The Arab Spring: Partisanship In The News Stories Of Korean Newspapers.\\" International Communication Gazette 78.6 (2016): 536-556. Academic Search Complete. Web. 18 Nov. 2016. In March 2011, just months after the protests started in Tunisia, Hillary Clinton commented on worldwide news sources, \\"Al Jazeera has been the leader in that are literally changing people's minds and attitudes. And like it or hate it, it is really effective.\\" Clinton's State Department even began tweeting in Arabic and Farsi. Global communication has become more prominent after Arab Spring to connect us all. A divided international response can be seen between the United States and Russia. While the United States openly supported any group looking for democratic representation, Russia took a much more hands-off approach. Russia, an authoritarian state, has been seen supporting other authoritarian regimes in more geopolitically convenient areas. Northern Africa did not pose enough of a threat or advantage for Russia to become actively involved in the regime change, but nevertheless was a point of contention between Russia and the west.Dannreuther, Roland. \\"Russia And The Arab Spring: Supporting The Counter-Revolution.\\" Journal of European Integration 37.1 (2015): 77-94. Academic Search Complete. Web. 18 Nov. 2016. Criticism of responses Some scholars and pundits, including Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek and Robert Fisk, have argued that the range of international reactions to the various protests, uprisings, and revolutions associated with the Arab Spring demonstrate hypocrisy on the part of governments in the Western world and elsewhere. ≈Ωi≈æek, a Slovenian political theorist, charged that the \\"western liberal reaction to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia frequently shows hypocrisy and cynicism\\". When asked if he considered Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president, to be an \\"authoritarian ruler\\" prior to the popular movement that ousted him from power, the United States' President Barack Obama replied that he tends \\"not to use labels for folks\\", called him a \\"stalwart ally in many respects to the United States\\", and claimed that Mubarak \\"has been a force for stability and good in the region\\", something American journalist Jeremy Scahill criticized. Scahill also claimed that \\"the day before US missiles began raining down on ... Libya ... security forces under the control of Yemen's US-backed president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, massacred more than fifty people who were participating in an overwhelmingly peaceful protest\\". The Obama administration has since called for Saleh to hand over power to his vice president and commit to a transition to plural democracy for Yemen, but its comparative sluggishness in supporting the Yemeni protest movement versus its swift backing of Libyan protesters and rebel fighters faced some criticism. American academic and investigative journalist Nir Rosen also criticized the U.S. government for more than doubling military assistance to Yemen between 2009 and 2010. During international operations in Libya, Irish journalist Patrick Cockburn called NATO's concern for Libyans \\"deeply hypocritical ... when they ignore or promote savage repression in Bahrain\\". Veteran British journalist Robert Fisk also condemned the relative lack of concern on the part of Western leaders over the security crackdown in Bahrain. American philosopher and counterculture commentator Noam Chomsky claimed, \\"The U.S. and its allies will do anything they can to prevent authentic democracy in the Arab world. The reason is very simple. Across the region, an overwhelming majority of the population regards the United States as the main threat to their interests.\\" It is known that the United States supported the regimes of Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen all the way up to and during the protests. The United States strategically changed its support when it became evident that the regimes were losing power. Israel considered these countries regimes a \\"strategic treasure.\\" Heilbrunn, Jacob. (2011). Israel and me Arab revolutions. The National Interest, February 14, http:// nationalinterest.org/blog/jacob-heilbrunn/israel-me-arab-revolutions-4872 Western leaders were not the only targets of rebuke from commentators for their reactions to the Arab Spring. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah's response to the uprisings also came under criticism, with Iranian academic Hamid Dabashi penning an op-ed for Al Jazeera in which he called Nasrallah a \\"once mighty warrior being bypassed by the force of history\\", accusing him of hypocrisy for supporting Shia protesters in Egypt and Bahrain but backing the \\"murderous\\" Shia government in Syria against peaceful demonstrators. Nasrallah, Dabashi claimed, had started out as a supporter of the Arab Spring when it appeared it would affect only allies of the West, but was deliberately silent on protests, including the Iranian protests, that sought to topple anti-Western governments. British journalist Brian Whitaker said King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia \\"[betrayed] more than a little irony\\" in his condemnation of Bashar al-Assad's regime, considering Saudi Arabia's dearth of political freedom. He concluded that the Saudi monarchy's positioning on the Arab Spring protests was part of ongoing efforts to outmanoeuvre and isolate its traditional rival Iran, an ally of Assad, as well as to limit the actual amount of political liberalisation occurring in the region. Whitaker criticised the Saudi-sponsored GCC initiative in Yemen, claiming it \\"was meant to prevent a genuine revolution, not help to accomplish it\\", and called Saudi Arabia's actions amidst the regional unrest a \\"monarchical insurance scheme\\" evident in its intervention to support the Bahraini monarchy. World economy As many of the world's major oil producing countries are in the Middle East, the unrest has caused a rise in oil prices. The International Monetary Fund accordingly revised its forecast for 2011 oil prices to reflect a higher price, and also reported that food prices could also increase. Additionally, concerns about Egypt's Suez Canal had raised shipping and oil prices. The World Bank's June 2011 Global Economic Prospects report estimated that the turmoil may reduce growth in the region by 1 percenthttp://go.worldbank.org/IMNFFGQXA0 or more, with countries such as Egypt and Tunisia registering growth rates 3 or more percentage points lower than what they would have been in the absence of the crises. Overall GDP in Egypt is projected to rise 1.0 percent in 2011.http://go.worldbank.org/J71A6G0841 Media coverage Al Jazeera won praise for its coverage of the protests, angering the governments in which countries faced protests. United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remarked: \\"Al Jazeera has been the leader in that they are literally changing people's minds and attitudes. And like it or hate it, it is really effective\\". She also stated that \\"viewership of Al Jazeera is going up in the United States because it's real news. You may not agree with it, but you feel like you're getting real news around the clock instead of a million commercials...\\" The use of social media has been extensive. As one Egyptian activist tweeted during the protests, \\"We use Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world\\". Internet censorship has also been a factor, and entire nation states were taken almost completely offline. In an attempt to quantify the likelihood of regime change in Arab World countries following the protests, The Economist newspaper created its \\"Shoe-Thrower's index\\". The name is derived from shoeing: throwing shoes, showing the sole of one's shoe, or using shoes to insult, all of which are forms of protest primarily associated with the Arab world. According to their index, Yemen has the highest likelihood of a revolution, whereas Qatar has the lowest. The index factors in the number of years the current ruler has been in power, the percentage of the population consisting of young people, per capita GDP, democracy index, political corruption, and freedom of the press. BBC News used its own \\"Unrest Index\\" in its analysis of the protests. Alen Mattich of the Wall Street Journal created the \\"Revolting Index\\" to rate the likelihood of revolts by state based on \\"social unfairness, propensity to revolt, and a trigger\\". Mattich readily admits, however, that \\"the methodology is crude. There's been no econometric work done\\".

The state was facing an invasion in the aftermath of the defeat of General Earl Van Dorn at the Battle of Pea Ridge. Immediately following the battle, General Van Dorn and his Army of the West had been ordered to the east side of the Mississippi to support what would become the Battle of Shiloh. General Van Dorn had stripped the State of Arkansas of all organized units and supplies. General Hindman was placed in command of the new Department of the Trans-Mississippi and immediate began organizing a new army. General Hindman's guidance to Major McNeill and others attempting to organize new regiments in Northeast Arkansas in the face of an imminent invasion threat was to organize rapidly and put each company in the field as soon as completed and attack the enemy. By June 13, 1862, Major McNeill reported from Madison to General Hindman: The companies which Major McNeill found and began to organize into a regiment were originally mounted. By June 18, 1862 Major McNeil reported the companies organized under authority given him to raise a regiment. On August 8, 1862, in Special Orders 60, Army of the South West, General Hindman appointed Major A. J. McNeill as commander of McNeill's Regiment of Arkansas Infantry with date of rank to June 18, 1862, the date that McNeill had first reported the formation of his regiment. Companies continued to be added to McNeill's command through the summer, but by July 10, 1862, General Hindman had ordered McNeill's command dismounted and its horses sent home. Major General Hindman, in a report of his activities in the Trans-Mississippi Department during the period May 31 to November 3, 1862, dated Richmond, Va., June 19, 1863, said, \\"The scarcity of supplies now caused great distress.

Hart 30th Arkansas The regiment fought in the Battle of Helena as part of McRea's Brigade. On July 2, Price's, including McRea's Brigade with the 30th Arkansas rendezvoused with Brigadier General Fagan's forces at Lick Creek, west of Helena, and the next morning Generals Holmes, Price, Walker, Fagan, and Marmaduke met in the Allen Polk farmhouse five miles west of Helena to discuss plans for the attack the following day. Holmes issued his general orders outlining the plan of attack on the Union garrison. Price's troops, with his brigades commanded by Brigadier Generals Dandridge McRae and Mosby M. Parsons were to advance by way of the Little Rock Road and attack Battery C atop Graveyard Hill, while Fagan's brigade was to attack Battery D atop Hindman Hill. Confusion in Major General Price's ranks crippled the Confederate attack. Price did not order his troops to resume their march until at least an hour after both Fagan and Marmaduke had begun their attacks. His two brigade commanders, Parsons and McRae, failed to maintain communications with one another and failed to attack, each expecting the order to come from the other. When Price's forces finally regrouped and began their attack, they stormed Graveyard Hill under fire from Batteries B, C, and D. Against Parsons' and McRae's assault, the 33rd Missouri infantry defending Battery C were ordered to spike their guns and retreat, and Graveyard Hill fell to the Confederate advance. Before General Price could have his own artillery moved up from his rear to defend Battery C and fire on Fort Curtis, Prentiss ordered the guns of Batteries A, B, and D, as well as the Tyler's artillery turned on the Confederate enclave. In the confusion, General Holmes disregarded the standard chain of command and ordered one of Parson's regimental commanders to attack Fort Curtis. The other commanders misunderstood and, thinking a general attack order had been issued, joined in the advance down Graveyard Hill, into the murderous crossfire of the Union batteries, the Tyler's artillery, and the reformed Union line. The Confederate assault broke and began to retreat in disorder. General McRae, meanwhile, gathered what men he could of his brigade and led them down the ravine separating Graveyard Hill and Hindman Hill to assist General Fagan's assault on Battery D.United States.

The Union defenders opened fire as McRae's troops started to climb Hindman Hill, and the attack collapsed before it had begun. The diversion did enable Fagan to make a charge and take the last line of rifle pits protecting Battery D, but they were unable to take the battery itself.BATTERY A SITE, BATTLE OF HELENA, HELENA, PHILLIPS COUNTY, Arkansas Historic Preservation Program, Accessed 22 August 2013, http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/historic- properties/_search_nomination_popup.aspx?id=558 The 30th Arkansas suffered a total of 8 killed, 46 wounded and 39 missing casualties at Helena.

Little Rock Campaign The unit was present with McRea's Brigade during the Little Rock Campaign in August and September 1863, but was not engaged in the fighting. The Union advance upon Little Rock was opposed mainly by the Confederate cavalry divisions of Generals Marmaduke and Walker. The Confederate infantry brigades were dug in on the north side of the Arkansas River. According to Captain Ethan Allen Pinnell of the Eighth Missouri Infantry, \\"Our works extend from the Arkansas river two miles below the city. to the eastern part of Crystal Hill, a distance of 6 miles.

The regiment, along with the other regiments in McRea's brigade, experienced a spike in desertions following the fall of Little Rock. This eventually led to Brigadier General McRea and several of his officers being detached from the army and sent into Northeast Arkansas to try to re- call troops to their units: Due to the high number of desertions in its ranks, the 30th Arkansas regiment was consolidated with the 32nd Arkansas in December 1863.United States.

Churchill's division reached Keatchie, Louisiana, in time to support Richard Taylor's main force who routed Banks' army in the Battle of Mansfield (Sabine Crossroads) on April 8, 1864. The next day, the Confederate forces united to attack the Union rear guard at Pleasant Hill on the afternoon of April 9. The Confederates had endured a long forced march from south central Arkansas to Mansfield, and another of ten hours to Pleasant Hill that day with only two hours' rest. The Union troops held a formidable position, and although the Arkansans and Missourians fought valiantly, they were repulsed and retreated six miles to the nearest water.Allardice, Bruce; \\"Re: Death of Col.

Performance  In early 2012, Lassry staged a warm-up with dancers from the New York City Ballet at the Hayworth Theater in Los Angeles.Ryan Trecartin (September 2012), Elad Lassry Interview. In September 2012, he debuted Untitled (Presence) at The Kitchen, an exhibition and corresponding performance under the same title. The performance work featured ten dancers from the American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet interacting with brightly colored moving walls that had cutouts similar to those in the gallery space and on Lassry‚Äôs billboard along the High Line. Karen Rosenberg reviewed the exhibition and performance in The New York Times, calling it \\"seductive and thought-provoking\\" and stating that \\"it encouraged you to think about the camera as a choreographer of vision.\\"Karen Rosenberg (September 27, 2012), Elad Lassry: ‚ÄòUntitled (Presence)‚Äô New York Times. Tim Griffin, director of The Kitchen, curated the exhibition.  Exhibitions  One year after graduating from the University of Southern California, Lassry mounted a solo exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago in the Film, Video and New Media gallery. The exhibition consisted of two films, Untitled (Agon), 2007 and Zebra and Woman, 2007. Solo exhibitions of Lassry's work have since been held at, among others, The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, Tramway, Glasgow, and an exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery, Canada, curated by artist Jeff Wall. His first major monographic exhibition in the United States, Elad Lassry: Sum of Limited Views, was on view at the Contemporary Art Museum of Saint Louis and subsequently travelled to Kunsthalle Z√ºrich, Switzerland. In conjunction with the 2010 show Sum of Limited Views, the Kunsthalle Z√ºrich published the exhibition book, Elad Lassry. Lassry‚Äôs work has also been included in numerous exhibitions worldwide, including institutions such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, CA; the Multimedia Art Museum, Moscow, Russia; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN; the Guggenheim Museum, New York, NY; the Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY; Museo de Atre Moderno, Medellin, Colombia; Centro de la Imagen, Mexico City; The New Museum, New York, NY; The Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, CA; and the Fondazione Prada, Venice, Italy. At the 54th Venice Biennale, Lassry debuted the film Untitled (Ghost), 2011, along with several photographs in the ILLUMInazioni - ILLUMInations exhibition at the Venetian Arsenale. His work was also included in the 2009 New Museum Triennial and the 2008 California Biennial. In 2012, Lassry created a billboard for the High Line in New York. The large billboard is an alluring image of two young women, both dressed alike, gazing out of two small portholes into a sea of green. The High Line Billboard was scheduled to overlap with Lassry‚Äôs exhibition and performance, Untitled (Presence), at The Kitchen.Elad Lassry, Women (065, 055), August 1 ‚Äì Friday, September 7, 2012 High Line, New York.  Recognition  Lassry was the winner of the 2007 John Jones Art on Paper Award. As part of the prize, Lassry exhibited several works at the 2008 Zoo Art Fair made over the 12-month period after receiving the award. In 2010, he was nominated to the Rencontres d'Arles Discovery Award (France) and exhibited his works. In 2011, art critic Sarah Schmerler wrote in Art in America: \\"[if] Elad Lassry hadn't come along at this particular moment in photography's history, theorists would probably have had to invent him.\\" In 2011, Lassry was nominated for the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Prize.

This discharge generates heat, which can break down the wire's insulation and trigger an electrical fire. Arc faults can range in power from a few amps up to thousands of amps, and are highly variable in strength and duration. Common causes of arc faults include faulty connections due to corrosion and faulty initial installation.  Location and detection  Two types of wiring protection are standard thermal breakers and arc fault circuit breakers. Thermal breakers require an overload condition long enough that a heating element in the breaker trips the breaker off. In contrast, arc fault circuit breakers use magnetic or other means to detect increases in current draw much more quickly. Without such protection, visually detecting arc faults in defective wiring is very difficult, as the arc fault occurs in a very small area. A problem with arc fault circuit breaker is they are more likely to produce false positives due to normal circuit behaviors appearing to be arc faults. For instance, lightning strikes on the outside of an aircraft mimic arc faults in their voltage and current profiles. Research has been able to largely eliminate such false positives, however, providing the ability to quickly identify and locate repairs that need to be done.Stephenson, James, Ph.D. \\"Eliminating False Positives in the Detection and Location of sub 3ms Faults on AC/DC Lines\\" presented at the 2011 Aircraft Airworthiness & Sustainment Conference on April 19, 2011.

Rivers subject to frequent flooding in this area included the Kiso River, Nagara River and Ibi River near Nagoya. Due to the difficulty of the project and due to malicious interference by shogunal authorities to make completion of the project more difficult, this order ultimately resulted in 51 Satsuma samurai committing seppuku, 33 samurai dying from disease and the responsible kar≈ç, Hirata Yukie, also committing seppuku. The river improvement project was finally completed in the Meiji period. The incident is also called the H≈çreki Age River Improvement Incident and the N≈çbi Plain River Improvement Incident. Three Rivers of N≈çbi from Mount Tado, From bottom, Ibi River, Nagara River and Kiso River taken in 2010Senbon Matsubara of Horeki River Improvement Incident Background The Shimazu clan of Satsuma Domain (present Kagoshima Prefecture) were once virtually independent rulers, and during the Sengoku period controlled nearly all of Kyushu. They opposed the rise of Tokugawa Ieyasu during the Battle of Sekigahara and with the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate remained a powerful Tozama han which the shogunate continued to view with suspicion. The shogunate often called upon various of its feudal domains to construct public works projects, partly because the expense would help weaken their power and influence The plain of Nobi had a number of big rivers with complicated geographical features, resulting in many floods. There was a strict rule that the levee or dike of the river should be lower than the levee of Owari Domain, which was held by one of the main cadet branches of the Tokugawa clan. The division of the rivers into three was originally planned by Izawa Sobei, the government head of Mino District in 1735, but his plan was not accepted. Instead, the Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieshige ordered a river engineering project to be conducted by distant Satsuma Domain, knowing that this would pose a significant financial burden on the domain. Summary of the project The formal order (Tetsudai Fushin), a special order from the shogunate such as building a castle and others, was issued to Satsuma daimy≈ç Shimazu Shigetoshi. The kar≈ç of the domain, Hirata Yukie (1704‚Äì1755) was assigned to supervise the construction, and was assigned 947 people. It was clear from the start or the project that this order was manifestly a harassment of Satsuma by the shogunate and some Satsuma samurai were of the opinion that they should fight instead of complying, but they were overruled. The domain at that time already had debts exceeding 660,000 ry≈ç in gold. Hirata Yukie sent a formal acceptance note on January 21, 1754 and borrowed 70,000 ry≈ç from bankers in Osaka using sugar cane from Amami-Oshima as collateral, and reached Mino on February 9. A project headquarters was established in a location named Motogoya, with an area of 4900 tsubo (about 16,200 square meters), and branch stations were established in four locations. The number of workers would eventually peak at 947 men. Harassment The river improvement works started on February 27. The enmity of the Tokugawa shogunate was obvious because they ordered the dike destroyed three times as it neared completion. Two of the leading samurai involved in the work, Nagayoshi Sobe and Otokawa Sadabuchi, committed seppuku in protest. Hirata deliberately concealed this protest from the shogunate, since it might seem to betray weakness and become an excuse for the attainder of the Shimazu clan. Funds ran out due to the unexpected additional expenses in reconstructing the dikes so many times. For lack of money, the food were restricted to one meal and one bowl of soup, regardless of working conditions. Neighboring peasants were forbidden to sell straw raincoats and straw sandals at a low cost, again attempting to maintain the illusion of a wealthy local economy. The cost eventually rose to about 400,000 ry≈ç, or more than 30 billion yen. An additional loan of 220,298 ry≈ç was obtained by the domain from Osaka. In August 1754, 157 persons were infected with dysentery, of whom 33 died. The project was completed on May 22, 1755. Hirata committed seppuku the following morning for losses that the domain incurred.. Completion of River Improvement in the Meiji era Johannis de Rijke, who completed river improvement in Meiji period Flooding worsened after the completion of the river improvement works. The project was re-engineered with modern technology in the Meiji period under the direction of Johannis de Rijke (1842‚Äì1913), a Dutch civil engineer and an advisor to Japanese government. Aburajima Embankment National Historic Site When the river was finally divided successfully in 1900, the Horeki Chisuishi (Horeki River Improvement Monument) was erected near the mouth of the rivers, and the Aburajima Embankment was planted with 1000 line trees from Kyushu. In 1938, a Shinto shrine, the Chisui Jinja, was also erected in this area to memorialize the 85 Satsuma samurai who died. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1940. Other memorials In the city of Kaizu there is a Horeki Chisui Historic Spot Preservation Society which has planted Kaikozu trees (Erythrina crista- galli), native to the Kagoshima Prefecture. These appear for along the Nanno- Sekigarara Route. The route was renamed \\"Satsuma Kaikouzu Street\\". In Kagoshima, there is also a monument to the victims and a statue to Hirata Yukie. Satsuma Gishiden (1977‚Äì1982), a gekiga drawn and written by Hiroshi Hirata, is a collection of fictional anecdotes revolving around the incident. The main theme of Satsuma Gishiden is the desperation and stoicism of the Satsuma samurai in the face of their ordeal. ≈ågure River, site of the river improvement incident Notes External links * Ëñ©Êë©Áæ©Â£´;Satsuma devoted samurais June 29, 2012 * Ê°ëÂêçÂ∏ÇË¶≥ÂÖâ„Ç¨„Ç§„Éâ„ÉªÊµ∑ËîµÂØ∫Ê¶ÇË¶ÅKuwana-shi, Sightseeing guide, on Kaizoji June 29, 2012 Category:Shimazu clan Category:Kaizu Category:History of Gifu Prefecture Category:History of Kagoshima Prefecture Category:1754 in Japan Category:Historic Sites of Japan ","title":"1754 H≈çreki River incident"},{"id":"32480458","text":"The Middle Georgia Raceway was a raceway located in Byron, Georgia, in the United States.

She is notable for her tomb and exceptionally well preserved remains discovered in 1968, alongside hundreds of valuable artifacts and documents, inside a hill known as Mawangdui, in Changsha, Hunan, China. Her body and belongings are currently under the care of the Hunan Museum, which has allowed occasional international exhibits. Life and death Xin Zhui lived an extravagant lifestyle for her time. She enjoyed having her own musicians for entertainment, who she would have play for parties as well as personal amusement. She may have enjoyed playing music as well, particularly the qin, which was traditionally associated with refinement and intellect. As a noble, Xin Zhui also had access to a variety of imperial foods, including various types of meat, which were reserved for the royal family and members of the ruling class. Most of her clothing was made of silk and other valuable textiles, and she owned a variety of cosmetics. As she aged, Xin Zhui suffered from a number of ailments that would eventually lead to her death. Along with a number of internal parasites, she also had coronary thrombosis and arteriosclerosis, most likely linked to excessive weight gained due to a sedentary lifestyle. A fused spinal disc probably caused her immense pain, which contributed to a decrease in physical activity. She also suffered from gallstones, one of which lodged in her bile duct and further deteriorated her condition. A total of 138 melon seeds were found in her stomach, intestines and esophagus. It is inferred that she died in summer, when fruits and melons ripen. The presence of melon seeds in her stomach also indicates that she died within two to three hours after eating the fruit.ÂçïÈ¢çÊñá. \\"È©¨ÁéãÂ†ÜÂ•≥Â∞∏ÁöÑÂèëÊéò‰∏é‰øùÂ≠ò.\\" ÁôæÂßìÁîüÊ¥ª, no. 7, 2015, pp. 56‚Äì57. Xin Zhui died around 50 years of age in 168 BC. She was buried in an immense tomb at Mawangdui in Changsha, with more than 1,000 items ranging from drink and food vessels, to silk clothing and tapestries, to figurines of musicians and mourners. Discovery The preserved body of Xin Zhui. Diagram of tomb no. 1, where Xin Zhui's body was found In 1968, workers digging an air raid shelter for a hospital near Changsha unearthed the tomb of Xin Zhui, as well as the tombs of her husband and a young man who is most commonly thought to be her son. With the assistance of over 1,500 local high school students, archaeologists began a large excavation of the site beginning in January 1972. Xin Zhui's body was found within four rectangular pine constructs that sat inside one another which were buried beneath layers of charcoal and white clay. The corpse was wrapped in twenty layers of clothing bound with silk ribbons. In the tomb of Xin Zhui, four coffins of decreasing sizes enclosed one another. The first and outermost coffin is painted black, the color of death and the underworld. All painted images sealed inside this coffin were thus designed not for an outside viewer but for the deceased and concern the themes of death and rebirth, protection in the afterlife, and immortality. The second coffin has a black background but is painted with a pattern of stylized clouds and with protective deities and auspicious animals roaming an empty universe. A tiny figure, the deceased woman, is emerging at the bottom center of the head end. Only her upper body is shown, for she is about to enter this mysterious world. The third coffin exhibits a different color scheme and iconography. It is shining red, the color of immortality, and the decorative motifs include divine animals and a winged immortal flanking three-peaked Mount Kunlun, which is a prime symbol of eternal happiness. Inside this tomb on top of the fourth and innermost coffin the excavators found a painted silk banner about two meters long. Yellow and black feathers are stuck on the cover board of the coffin. People at that time believed that in order to fly up to the heavens and become immortal, one needs to go through a \\"featherization\\" phase, which is growing feathers on the body. Many texts during and before that time mentioned the connection between growing feathers and becoming a celestial being. A celestial being is even referred to as a \\"feathered person\\" in some texts. One celestial being on Nanyang Han stone portraits also has feathers all over the body. The feathers stuck to the coffin was expressing the hopes that Xin Zhui would grow feathers on the body and enter the heavens to become immortal.ÈÉ≠Â≠¶‰ªÅ. \\"È©¨ÁéãÂ†ÜÊ±âÂ¢ìËë¨‰øóÁ†îÁ©∂.\\" ÂõõÂ∑ùÊñáÁâ©, no. 2, 1995, pp. 3‚Äì7. Xin Zhui's body was remarkably well preserved in an unknown fluid inside the coffin. Her skin was soft and moist, with muscles that still allowed for her arms and legs to flex at the joints. All her organs and blood vessels were also intact, with small amounts of Type A blood being found in her veins. There was hair on her head, with a wig pinned with a hair clasp on the back of her head. There was skin on her face, and her eyelashes and nose hair still exist. The tympanic membrane of her left ear was intact, and her finger and toe prints were distinct. This preservation allowed doctors at Hunan Provincial Medical Institute to perform an autopsy on 14 December 1972. Much of what is known about Xin Zhui's lifestyle was derived from this and other examinations. Xin Zhui's body was soaked in an unknown liquid that was mildly acidic with some magnesium in it. More than 1,000 precious artifacts were found with Xin Zhui's body. In Western Han Dynasty, elaborate and lavish burials were common practice. One reason was the notion of imperishability of the soul: it was believed that another world existed for the dead, and they needed food and accommodation just like the living. Therefore, the consecration for the dead should be the same as what was provided for the living, and all the necessities in life should be brought into the grave for use in the afterlife. The other was the emphasis on filial piety during that time. In Han Dynasty, filial piety had become an important approach to become an official, and elaborate and lavish burials are a significant way to show filial piety to one's deceased parents. These were among the main reasons why there were so many precious artifacts in Xin Zhui's tomb. Significance Xin Zhui's body and tomb are considered one of the most important archaeological discoveries of the 20th century. Besides having some of the best preserved human remains ever discovered in China, the contents of Xin Zhui's tomb revealed much information about life in the Han dynasty that was previously unknown. The discovery continues to advance the fields of archaeology and science in the 21st century, particularly in the area of preservation of ancient human remains. Scientists in 2003 developed a \\"secret compound\\" that was injected into Xin Zhui's still existing blood vessels to assure her preservation.

Built as a private recording studio for artists on the Fantasy Records label in 1971, it was opened to the public in 1980 for recording, mixing and mastering. It was permanently closed on September 15, 2018. Background  Fantasy Records  Fantasy Records and its subsidiary, Galaxy, were established in San Francisco, California, in 1949 by Max and Sol Weiss. The first artist on the label was Dave Brubeck.Johnson 2006, p. 37 With help from profits earned from his records the label went on to record Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, Cal Tjader and Vince Guaraldi.Gilbert, Andrew. \\"Fantasy is No Mirage.\\" The Monthly. April 2009 In addition to musical acts, the label recorded beat poets Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg and comic Lenny Bruce.  Creedence Clearwater Revival and expansion  Saul Zaentz, who joined Fantasy Records as a salesman in 1955, assembled a group of investors in 1967 and purchased the label from the Weiss brothers.Tate, Brian. \\"Digital media in fantasyland.\\" San Francisco Business Times,. February 1, 2008 In 1968 Fantasy Records signed Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), who soon became extremely profitable for the label. Within eighteen months, twenty of CCR's singles made Billboard Hot 100 list and nine were consecutive Top 10 singles in the US. The band also earned 21 RIAA-certified gold or platinum records with total sales of over 100 million worldwide.[ Creedence Clearwater Revival Album & Song Chart History], Billboard.com. . These successes for CCR made Fantasy the most profitable independent record company in the U.S.Johnson 2006, p. 49 and directly resulted in the expansion of Fantasy Records.Poet, j. (August 6, 2008). \\"Fantasy Studios: Alive and Well in Berkeley.\\" Crawdaddy! In 1971 Fantasy Records relocated to Berkeley, California. In addition to a lobby area, the building included a sauna, an exercise room and a lunch room, which until 1981 was catered daily by Narsai's Restaurant in Kensington. The sauna and exercise room were later rebuilt for other purposes. In the early 1970s, under the leadership of label president Ralph Kaffel, Fantasy Records purchased the catalogs of three independent jazz labels: Prestige, Riverside (established in 1953 by Bill Grauer and Orrin Keepnews) and Milestone, which Keepnews started in 1966 after the demise of Riverside. After the acquisitions the company became known as \\"Fantasy Inc.\\" Recording studios Present-day live room of Studio A Present-day view from control room to live room of Studio B Present-day main tracking room of Studio D after the new flooring was installed Fantasy Records built Fantasy Studios to accommodate its growing roster, which remained primarily jazz artists but included some in rock, soul and disco. The building went up at 10th and Parker Streets in the western industrial area of Berkeley. Because of the source of funding, it was nicknamed \\"The House That Creedence Built.\\"Johnson 2006, p. 126 Fantasy was the most profitable independent record company in the U.S. Jim Stern, who had served as producer for the Sons of Champlin and Van Morrison, was chief engineer from 1974 until 1981. Jesse Osborn was another early engineer along with Eddie Bill Harris and Don Cody.Johnson 2006, p. 229 Each of Fantasy Studios' three rooms were built to serve a specific purpose:  Studio A  At 1,344 square feet, Studio A could accommodate a big band, and included a DeMedio console.Johnson 2006, p. 228 Small audiences could be brought in to give a recording date the feel of a live album, as Keepnews did for a 1973 Cannonball Adderley session, resulting in the album Inside Straight.Johnson 2006, p. 127 Studio A also had a projection booth, pull-down screen and portable mixing console that was built for film mixes. During those early years Fantasy also had a film unit and its films (mostly promotional pieces for the label's artists) were mixed in Studio A. The film unit was headed up by Irving Saraf and Robert N. Zagone, two Bay Area documentary filmmakers. Feature films were mixed in Studio A as well, including Academy Award winners One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Apocalypse Now, Amadeus and The English Patient.  Studio B  Studio B, at 546 square feet, was used mostly for smaller acts and comedy records, and was typically used for overdub sessions. Like Studio A, it too used a DeMedio console.  Studio C  Studio C was built expressly for CCR, with a separate entrance. Parts of their albums Mardi Gras and Pendulum were recorded there, and the Live in Europe album was mixed there. John Fogerty recorded The Blue Ridge Rangers in Studio C and was in residence there until he left Fantasy in 1974. At 888 square feet, Studio C was also the site of a film soundstage and Foley pits. Studio C was the only studio at Fantasy which used an API console. Studio C was closed to the public in 2008 with the space taken over by another Zaentz Media Center tenant.  Studio D  From the profits of the 1975 Zaentz-produced film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Fantasy Studios expanded further in 1980 with the addition of an adjoining seven-story building which included a fourth recording room, Studio D. It also marked the point at which all rooms became open for use by the public for recording, mastering and film scoring. The new Studio D was designed by Tom Hidley and constructed by Sierra Audio. The control room featured an automated Neve 8108 board, Hidley monitors, Ampex 16 and 24 track recorders and a Studer 24-track recorder. At 1,500 square feet, the live room was built with multiple interior surfaces (unlike the other three rooms): one side of the room featured bass traps, cork and rock on the walls for a \\"dead\\" sound; the other featured hard wood floors and ceiling, and mirrored walls for a more \\"live\\" sound. One of first albums to be recorded and mixed in its entirety in the newly opened Studio D was Journey's Escape, which reached #1 on the Billboard 200 Chart. The album contained such hits as \\"Open Arms\\" (which reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 List), \\"Who's Crying Now\\" (reaching #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 List) and \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 List). Fantasy Studios' staff engineer Wally Buck worked as Assistant Engineer on the album.  Studio management  The expansion of the studios can be accredited to the leadership of a new Studio Director, Roy Segal, hired in 1980 by the label to manage the studios. One of his first initiatives‚Äîalong with the addition of Studio D‚Äîwas to purchase new equipment and perform an acoustical upgrade to the rooms. Such upgrades included removing carpet from the studio floors and installing bass traps and tiling for the walls in an effort to acoustically tune the rooms. Equipment upgrades included replacing the original consoles in Studios A and C with Neve 8108s and a Trident in Studio B. In 1982, Segal was asked to manage the three-year- old Saul Zaentz Film Center, at which point he brought in Nina Bombardier to manage the studios. Bombardier started with Fantasy in 1973 as a receptionist,Johnson 2006, p. 157 then moved to manage the Record Plant in Sausalito. She served as the director of Fantasy Studios from 1982 to 2007.  Today  Concord Records acquired Fantasy in late 2004 and the two labels merged to form Concord Music Group. Concord Music Group owned the studios through 2007, at which point the new owners of the Saul Zaentz Media Center, Wareham Property Group, purchased the studios. The role of Studio Director was filled by music producer Jeffrey Wood upon Bombardier's departure. The current staff engineers are Adam Mu√±oz, Jesse Nichols and Alberto Hernandez. At the time of closing, Studio A contained an SSL Duality SE console and Studio D used an SSL 4000E console. Studio B contained a Digidesign C24. In November 2011, Studio D saw an update to its floors wherein hardwood cherry flooring replaced the original half-wood, half-carpet installment. There were five working natural echo chambers of varying sizes and tones, accessible from all three control rooms. In addition to recording music, Fantasy Studios saw clients in the film, television, gaming and audio book industries for additional dialog recording sessions. All studios were ISDN-compatible, providing full-frequency audio and real-time connectivity to other recording studios around the world. There were two full-time mastering engineers on site: George Horn and Joe Tarantino. Over his career, Horn has remixed or remastered albums by artists such as Charles Mingus, The Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Santana. Joe Tarantino has mastered albums by artists such as Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins, Dave Brubeck, Charlie Parker and Miles Davis. To this day, both Horn and Tarantino work with clients on mastering new albums, as well as update classic records to have a modern sound. In 2018 Wareham Property Group decided to permanently close the studios.

It celebrates the return of the Stone of Destiny to Scotland, which was retrieved from Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day, 1950 by students.A fierce lifetime supporter of the nationalist cause, the bard wrote the 25 verse song in a single sitting immediately upon hearing the news of the stone's return, and some of the students involved visited him at his home to congratulate him on the song's composition in the weeks following. While √íran na Cloiche is sung to the tune of a fast reel (occasionally performed as an instrumental reel, including by Michael McGoldrick as the \\"Stone of Destiny Reel\\"), and is celebratory and exhilaratory in tone; upon hearing the news of the stone's return to England, the bard composed an accompanying lament, titled \\"Nuair Chaidh a' Chlach a Thilleadh\\" (\\"When the Stone Was Returned\\") to express his disgust. The full text of the poem was included in a posthumous collection of the bard's work, titled Sporan Dh√≤mhnaill - Gaelic Poems and Songs by the late Donald Macintyre, the Paisley Bard, published by Scottish Academic Press for the Scottish Gaelic Text Society in Edinburgh in 1968.

As a king of the 14th Dynasty, Merdjefare would have reigned from Avaris over the eastern Nile Delta and possibly over the western Delta as well.  Attestation Merdjefare is one of only four pharaohs of the 14th Dynasty to have left any attestation beyond the Turin canon, a king list compiled in the early Ramesside period.Darrell D. Baker: The Encyclopedia of the Pharaohs: Volume I - Predynastic to the Twentieth Dynasty 3300‚Äì1069 BC, Stacey International, , 2008, p. 203-204 Indeed, Merdjefare is mentioned on the stele of a royal seal-bearer and treasurer named Ranisonb. The stele, discovered in 1988‚Äì89, shows Merdjefare making offerings to Sopdharsopd and probably originates from Ranisonb's tomb at Saft el-Hinna in the southeastern Nile Delta. The stele is now in the private Krief collection.Jean Yoyotte, \\"Le roi Mer-Djefa-R√™ et le dieu Sopdu, Un monument de la XIVe dynastie\\", Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise d'√©gyptologie 114 (1989), pp.17-63 Chronological Position Merdjefare's relative position in the 14th Dynasty is somewhat secured by the Turin canon, which mentions him in column 9, line 5. According to this king list, Merdjefare reigned for 3 to 4 years, one of the longest reigns of the 14th Dynasty, and was preceded by Sehebre and succeeded by Sewadjkare III. At the opposite, Merdjefare's absolute chronological position is debated. According to egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker, Merdjefare was the tenth king of the 14th Dynasty, reigning c. 1700 BC for 3 to 4 years. Ryholt's reconstruction of the early 14th Dynasty is controversial however and other specialists, such as Manfred Bietak and J√ºrgen von Beckerath, believe that the dynasty started shortly before Nehesy c. 1710 BC rather than c. 1805 BC as proposed by Ryholt. In this case, Merdjefare would only be the fifth king of the dynasty.J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Untersuchungen zur politischen Geschichte der Zweiten Zwischenzeit in √Ñgypten, Gl√ºckstadt, 1964J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Chronologie des pharaonischen √Ñgyptens, M√ºnchner √Ñgyptologische Studien 46, Mainz am Rhein, 1997 Identity Since only Merdjefare's prenomen is known, attempts at attributing him any given nomen remain conjectural. Ryholt however proposed that Merdjefare's nomen may have been either Wazad or Sheneh. Indeed, according to Ryholt, a seriation of 14th Dynasty seals shows that both Wazad and Sheneh reigned after Nehesy. Since furthermore \\"only few of the kings who ruled between Nehesy and Yaqub-Har are attested by contemporary sources\\", Ryholt posits that Wazad may be identifiable with one of the successors of Nehesy with the longest reign, either Sehebre or Merdjefare.

It is nearly long.  Course  The Isenach rises in the northern Palatinate Forest, southwest of Carlsberg Hertlingshausen. Its source in the Diemerstein Forest on the southeast flank of a saddle between the peaks Krummes Eck, elevation , and Hohe B√ºhl, elevation , is marked with Ritterstein number 277, with the inscription \\"Isenach source\\". The first of the river flow in a southeasterly direction. After the Isenach passes the Isenachweiher reservoir, it flows east through a valley it shares with Bundesstra√üe 37, Kaiserslautern-Bad D√ºrkheim. In Bad D√ºrkheim, the Isenach breaks through the Haardt, the eastern edge of the Palatinate Forest, and enters the hills flanking the German Wine Road. It the flows northeast through the Upper Rhine Plain. Between Lambsheim and the Frankenthal district of Eppstein, the Isenach is joined by the Flo√übach from the right. In the city of Frankenthal, the Isenach turns northwards. It is then joined by the Fuchsbach from the left. It then flows through the suburb of M√∂rsch, where the Isenach is known as the M√∂rschbach, before passing through the southeast of Bobenheim-Roxheim into a loop of the Roxheimer Altrhein (Old Rhine) known as the Silbersee (Roxheim), and finally discharges into the Upper Rhine south of Worms.  History   Isenachweiher  A dam was constructed in the Isenach in 1736‚Äì37 at about from the source, forming a reservoir named the Isenachweiher. The aim was to ensure an even flow of the river. This was necessary because until 1850 the pumps of the Bad D√ºrkheim Salt Works (also built in 1736) were operated using the Isenach as a source of water power. The dam also ensured the water supply of a water wheel below the dam. The dam was renovated and restored in the mid-1980s.  Raising the river  In the mid-18th century a mill was constructed as Lambsheim, the . In order to provide this mill with a stronger gradient, the stream bed above the mill with raised by over a length of about , and some of the river's water was diverted into a new mill channel. However, the combination of this situation and a later straightening of the Isenach further upstream, caused floods in Lambsheim whenever it rained heavily. In 2008, after more than 250 years, the raising of the riverbed was reverted and the stream was restored to its old riverbed. The dirt excavated from the old riverbed contained naturally occurring arsenic and had to be treated as chemical waste. The mill channel was considered industrial heritage and was preserved. Water is continuously pumped into the channel to prevent it from falling dry. The total cost of the restautation project was ; the state of Rhineland-Palatinate contributed over .Source for the whole paragraph: Isenach breitet sich im neuen Bett aus, article in local edition of the Frankenthaler Zeitung, issue of 9 December 2008  Diversion  Until the 1780s, the Isenach flowed from the southern edge of Frankenthal to the east. However, when the city of Frankenthal had dug its (\\"Canal Harbour\\"), the Isenach and the Fuchsbach were diverted to fill it. For more than a century and a half, the Isenach flowed via the Frankenthal Canal into the Rhine. It 1944, however, the canal had to be closed due to severe bomb damage. The Isenach was diverted further north, to its current mouth, which is about from its original confluence with the Rhine.  Swimming pool  The first public swimming facility in the town of Frankenthal was a pond-like widening of the Isenach, just outside the southern edge of the city, near the Post Bridge. It was operated until the Frankenthal lido was opened in the east of the city in 1934.

There is widespread belief in ghosts in English-speaking cultures, where ghosts are manifestations of the spirits of the dead. The beliefs may date back to animism or ancestor worship before Christianization. The concept is a perennial theme in the literature and arts of English-speaking countries. Terminology The English word ghost continues Old English g√°st, from a hypothetical Common Germanic *gaistaz. It is common to West Germanic, but lacking in North and East Germanic (the equivalent word in Gothic is ahma, Old Norse has andi m., √∂nd f.). The pre- Germanic form was ', apparently from a root denoting \\"fury, anger\\" reflected in Old Norse geisa \\"to rage.\\" The Germanic word is recorded as masculine only, but likely continues a neuter s-stem. The original meaning of the Germanic word would thus have been an animating principle of the mind, in particular capable of excitation and fury (compare √≥√∞r). In Germanic paganism, \\"Germanic Mercury,\\" and the later Odin, was at the same time the conductor of the dead and the \\"lord of fury\\" leading the Wild Hunt. Besides denoting the human spirit or soul, both of the living and the deceased, the Old English word is used as a synonym of Latin spiritus also in the meaning of \\"breath, blast\\" from the earliest attestations (9th century). It could also denote any good or evil spirit, i.e. angels and demons; the Anglo-Saxon gospel refers to the demonic possession of Matthew 12:43 as se uncl√¶na gast. Also from the Old English period, the word could denote the spirit of God, viz. the \\"Holy Ghost.\\" The now prevailing sense of \\"the soul of a deceased person, spoken of as appearing in a visible form\\" only emerges in Middle English (14th century). The modern noun does, however, retain a wider field of application, extending on one hand to soul, spirit,\\" vital principle, mind or psyche, the seat of feeling, thought and moral judgement; on the other hand used figuratively of any shadowy outline, fuzzy or unsubstantial image, in optics, photography and cinematography especially a flare, secondary image or spurious signal.OED The synonym spook is a Dutch loanword, akin to Low German sp√¥k (of uncertain etymology); it entered the English language via the United States in the 19th century.Askoxford.com.

Alternative words in modern usage include spectre (from Latin spectrum), the Scottish wraith (of obscure origin), phantom (via French ultimately from Greek phantasma, compare fantasy) and apparition. The term shade in classical mythology translates Greek œÉŒ∫ŒπŒ¨,Liddell & Scott entry or Latin umbra,Lewis & Short in reference to the notion of spirits in the Greek underworld. \\"Haint\\" is a synonym for ghost used in regional English of the southern United States,Dictionary of American Regional English, Belknap Press, 1985 and the \\"haint tale\\" is a common feature of southern oral and literary tradition.Joseph M. Flora, Lucinda Hardwick MacKethan, Todd W. Taylor, The Companion to Southern Literature, Louisiana State University Press, 2001, pg. 304. The term poltergeist is a German word, literally a \\"noisy ghost,\\" for a spirit said to manifest itself by invisibly moving and influencing objects. Wraith is a Scots word for \\"ghost, spectre, apparition.\\" It came to be used in Scottish Romanticist literature, and acquired the more general or figurative sense of \\"portent, omen.\\" In 18th- to 19th-century Scottish literature, it was also applied to aquatic spirits. The word has no commonly accepted etymology; OED notes \\"of obscure origin\\" only. An association with the verb writhe was the etymology favored by J. R. R. Tolkien. Tolkien's use of the word in the naming of the creatures known as the Ringwraiths has influenced later usage in fantasy literature.

Ghosts in English tradition  Middle Ages \\"Hamlet and his father's ghost\\" by Henry Fuseli (1780s drawing). The ghost is wearing stylized plate armour in 17th century style, including a morion type helmet and tassets. Depicting ghosts as wearing armour, to suggest a sense of antiquity, was common in Elizabethan theater. Medieval ghosts in England were more substantial than ghosts described in the Victorian age, and there are accounts of ghosts being wrestled with and physically restrained until a priest could arrive to hear its confession. Some were less solid, and could move through walls. Often they were described as paler and sadder versions of the person they had been while alive, and dressed in tattered gray rags. The vast majority of reported sightings were male.Finucane, pp. 83‚Äì84. There were some reported cases of ghostly armies, fighting battles at night in the forest, or in the remains of an Iron Age hillfort, as at Wandlebury, near Cambridge, England. Living knights were sometimes challenged to single combat by phantom knights, which vanished when defeated.Finucane, pg. 79. Tudor period 19th century etching by John Leech of the Ghost of Christmas Present as depicted in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol One of the more recognizable ghosts in English literature is the shade of Hamlet's murdered father in Shakespeare's The Tragical History of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. In Hamlet, it is the ghost who demands that Prince Hamlet investigate his \\"murder most foul\\" and seek revenge upon his usurping uncle, King Claudius. In Shakespeare's Macbeth, the murdered Banquo returns as a ghost to the dismay of the title character. In English Renaissance theater, ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armor, as with the ghost of Hamlet's father. Armor, being out of date by the time of the Renaissance, gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity.Ann Jones & Peter Stallybrass, Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory, Cambridge University Press, 2000. But the sheeted ghost began to gain ground on stage in the 19th century because an armored ghost could not satisfactorily convey the requisite spookiness: it clanked and creaked, and had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators. These clanking ghosts being hoisted about the stage became objects of ridicule as they became clich√©d stage elements. Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass, in Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory, point out, ‚ÄúIn fact, it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of 'spirit drapery'.‚Äù An interesting observation by Jones and Stallybrass is that Stuart and Georgian periods Ghosts figured prominently in traditional British ballads of the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly the ‚ÄúBorder ballads‚Äù of the turbulent border country between England and Scotland. Ballads of this type include The Unquiet Grave, The Wife of Usher's Well, and Sweet William's Ghost, which feature the recurring theme of returning dead lovers or children. In the ballad King Henry, a particularly ravenous ghost devours the king's horse and hounds before forcing the king into bed. The king then awakens to find the ghost transformed into a beautiful woman.Helen Child Sargent & George Lyman Kittredge, English and Scottish Popular Ballads edited from the Collection by Francis James Child, Houghton Mifflin: New York, 1904. One of the key early appearances by ghosts in a gothic tale was The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole in 1764.Newman, pg. 135. Washington Irving's short story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow (1820), based on an earlier German folktale, features a Headless Horseman. It has been adapted for film and television many times, such as Sleepy Hollow, a successful 1999 feature film.Sleepy Hollow at Box Office Mojo. Retrieved January 29, 2009. Victorian and Edwardian periods (1840 to 1920) The ghost of a pirate, from Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates (1903). The \\"classic\\" ghost story arose during the Victorian period, and included authors such as M. R. James, Sheridan Le Fanu, Violet Hunt, and Henry James. Classic ghost stories were influenced by the gothic fiction tradition, and contain elements of folklore and psychology. M. R. James summed up the essential elements of a ghost story as, ‚ÄúMalevolence and terror, the glare of evil faces, ‚Äòthe stony grin of unearthly malice', pursuing forms in darkness, and 'long-drawn, distant screams', are all in place, and so is a modicum of blood, shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded...‚ÄùM. R. James. \\"Some Remarks on Ghost Stories,\\" The Bookman, December 1929. Famous literary apparitions from this period are the ghosts of A Christmas Carol, in which Ebenezer Scrooge is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague Jacob Marley, and the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come. Oscar Wilde's comedy The Canterville Ghost has been adapted for film and television on several occasions. Henry James's The Turn of the Screw has also appeared in a number of adaptations, notably the film The Innocents and Benjamin Britten's opera The Turn of the Screw. Oscar Telgmann's opera Leo, the Royal Cadet (1885) includes Judge's Song about a ghost at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario.Leo, the Royal cadet, Archive.org In the United States, prior to and during the First World War, folklorists Olive Dame Campbell and Cecil Sharp collected ballads from the people of the Appalachian Mountains, which included ghostly themes such as The Wife of Usher's Well, The Suffolk Miracle, The Unquiet Grave, and The Cruel Ship's Carpenter. The theme of these ballads was often the return of a dead lover. These songs were variants of traditional Anglo-Scottish ballads handed down by generations of mountaineers descended from the people of the Anglo- Scottish border region.Olive Dame Campbell & Cecil James Sharp, English Folk Songs From The Southern Appalachians, G. Putnam's Sons: New York, 1917 The Child ballad Sweet William's Ghost (1868) recounts the story of a ghost returning to beg a woman to free him from his promise to marry her, as he obviously cannot being dead. Her refusal would mean his damnation. This reflects a popular British belief that the dead haunted their lovers if they took up with a new love without some formal release.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 227, Dover Publications, New York 1965 The Unquiet Grave expresses a belief found in various locations over Europe: ghosts can stem from the excessive grief of the living, whose mourning interferes with the dead's peaceful rest.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 234, Dover Publications, New York 1965 Modern views on ghosts Modern Era (1920 to 1970) Professional parapsychologists and \\"ghost hunters\\", such as Harry Price, active in the 1920s and 1930s, and Peter Underwood, active in the 1940s and 1950s, published accounts of their experiences with ostensibly true ghost stories such as Price's The Most Haunted House in England, and Underwood's Ghosts of Borley. Children's benevolent ghost stories became popular, such as Casper the Friendly Ghost, created in the 1930s and appearing in comics, animated cartoons, and eventually a 1995 feature film. No√´l Coward's play Blithe Spirit, later made into a film, places a more humorous slant on the phenomenon of haunting of individuals and specific locations. With the advent of motion pictures and television, screen depictions of ghosts became common, and spanned a variety of genres; the works of Shakespeare, Dickens and Wilde have all been made into cinematic versions. Novel-length tales have been difficult to adapt to cinema, although that of The Haunting of Hill House to The Haunting in 1963 is an exception. Sentimental depictions during this period were more popular in cinema than horror, and include the 1947 film The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, which was later adapted to television with a successful 1968‚Äì70 TV series.Newman, pg. 135. Genuine psychological horror films from this period include 1944's The Uninvited, and 1945's Dead of Night. Post-modern (1970‚Äìpresent) The 1970s saw English-language screen depictions of ghosts diverge into distinct genres of the romantic and horror. A common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger, often with unfinished business, such as 1989's Field of Dreams, the 1990 film Ghost, and the 1993 comedy Heart and Souls. In the horror genre, 1980's The Fog, and the A Nightmare on Elm Street series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence. Popularised in such films as the 1984 comedy Ghostbusters, ghost hunting became a hobby for many who formed ghost hunting societies to explore reportedly haunted places. The ghost hunting theme has been featured in reality television series, such as Ghost Adventures, Ghost Hunters, Ghost Hunters International, Ghost Lab, Most Haunted and A Haunting. It is also represented in children's television by such programs as The Ghost Hunter and Ghost Trackers. Ghost hunting also gave rise to multiple guidebooks to haunted locations, and ghost hunting \\"how-to\\" manuals. The 1990s saw a return to classic \\"gothic\\" ghosts, whose dangers were more psychological than physical. Examples of films from this period include 1999's The Sixth Sense and 2001's The Others. According to the Gallup Poll News Service, belief in haunted houses, ghosts, communication with the dead, and witches had an especially steep increase over the 1990s in the United States.Newport F, Strausberg M. 2001. \\"Americans' belief in psychic and paranormal phenomena is up over last decade,\\" Gallup Poll News Service.

A 2005 Gallup poll found that about 32 percent of Americans believe in ghosts.

The publication, sometimes called IBTimes or IBT, offers news, opinion and editorial commentary on business and commerce. IBT is one of the world's largest online news sources, receiving forty million unique visitors each month. Its 2013 revenues were around $21 million. IBTimes was launched in 2005; it is owned by IBT Media, which separated from Newsweek in 2018, and was founded by Etienne Uzac and Johnathan Davis. Its headquarters are in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City. History A hand-drawn blueprint, created in 2007 by Davis, outlining what would become the IBTimes FX editor Founder Etienne Uzac, a native of France, came up with the idea for the global business news site while a student at the London School of Economics. He found that the strongest business newspapers had a focus on the United States and Europe and planned to provide broader geographic coverage. Uzac recruited Johnathan Davis to join him in the enterprise. In late 2005, Uzac and Davis moved to New York City to launch the site, with Uzac primarily focused on business strategy, while Davis coded the site and wrote the first articles. In May 2012, the company announced the appointment of Jeffery Rothfeder as editor-in-chief and the promotion of Davis from executive editor to chief content officer. On August 4, 2013, IBT Media announced its purchase of Newsweek and the domain newsweek.com from IAC/InterActiveCorp. The purchase did not include The Daily Beast. Peter S. Goodman, previously executive business editor and global news editor of The Huffington Post, became editor in 2014. IBT Media later rebranded as Newsweek Media Group. From March to July 2016, IBT laid off an estimated thirty percent of its editorial staff. This period marked a new era for the company as it expanded into branded content and events with its sister publication Newsweek. At the same time, Dev Pragad, who had started the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) business in 2009, was promoted from managing director of Europe to global CEO of Newsweek and IBT. This was followed in January 2017 by the appointment of Alan Press in the \\"newly created, strategic role of President\\". In September 2018, Newsweek Media Group once again became IBT Media with Newsweek spun off as an independent company. Content quality In late 2011, Google allegedly moved the outlet's articles down in search results in response to excessive search engine optimization activity. An internal IBT memo allegedly advised IBT journalists on how to \\"re-work a story you've already done and re-post it in the hopes that it will chart better via Google... Some people have been just re-posting the exact same story, with a new headline. We're not doing that anymore.\\" Reporting in 2014, Mother Jones claimed that IBT journalists are subject to constant demand to produce clickbait; one former employee reportedly complained that management issued \\"impossible\\" demands, including a minimum of 10,000 hits per article, and fired those who couldn't deliver. Of 432 articles published by IBT Japan in a certain time interval, 302 were reportedly created by copying sentences from Japanese media and combining them, \\"collage-style\\", to create stories that seemed new; IBT Japan apologized for the behavior and blamed it on a contract employee. Similarly, employees told The Guardian in 2014 that at times they seemed to operate more as \\"content farms\\" demanding high-volume output than a source of quality journalism. At least two journalists were allegedly threatened with firing unless traffic to their articles increased sharply. In 2016, IBT hired John Crowley, the Wall Street Journal's EMEA digital editor, as its UK editor-in-chief. According to The Guardian, \\"Crowley said his focus would be on helping the site break exclusives, in-depth storytelling and new forms of digital journalism. He said IBT was putting together a UK business desk and hiring an audience team.\\" Crowley stated, \\"We are not a wire service or so-called paper of record... but I have a vision of where I want to take a site... we've got to have a USP (unique selling proposition)... make ourselves distinctive in journalistic terms.\\" In early 2017, International Business Times UK joined a partnership along with the likes of Bloomberg, Channel 4 and the BBC to work together to combat the spread of fake news. Consequently, IBTimes.co.uk has occasionally been quoted by other British media. In June 2017, Jason Murdock ‚Äî who covers cybersecurity for the International Business Times UK ‚Äî won Digital Writer of the year at the Drum Online Media Awards, which according to InPublishing magazine ‚Äúidentify the cleverest, boldest and most original purveyors of news and views from around the world.‚Äù Media Matters for America, a politically progressive journalism watchdog, labeled an IBT article linking Hillary Clinton's policies to the gun used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting a \\"false and sloppy smear\\" that was based on a misreading of government documents. In the Columbia Journalism Review, contributing editor Trudy Lieberman credited IBTs David Sirota's investigative reporting for helping to drive a call for reform in Connecticut health insurance regulation. Labor relations Early in its history, IBT Media allegedly employed immigrant students of Olivet University who were not authorized to work in the United States to translate English content into Chinese and other languages, paying them less than minimum wage to do so. In 2016, employees complained publicly about missed payroll, meager or nonexistent severance packages, and one-sided nondisclosure agreements. Relationship to \\"The Community\\" The nature of the connection between IBT and The Community, a Christian sect led by David Jang, is disputed; IBT states that many reports about its connections to The Community are false or exaggerated. Davis and Uzac both have ties to Olivet University, an evangelical institution founded by Jang. Graduates of Olivet are known to work at Newsweek Media Group, which has donated money to Olivet. Davis was formerly on faculty at Olivet, where his wife serves as university president. Uzac has served on the Olivet board of trustees; his wife has worked as press secretary for the World Evangelical Alliance, of which Olivet is a member. Davis has personally endorsed the view that homosexuality can be caused by childhood sexual abuse and cured by therapy, although he declines to elaborate on his religious views regarding homosexuality, stating that he separates his work from his faith. Christianity Today claimed in 2012 that it had obtained an email in which Davis stated that he could not join a certain Jang-affiliated organization because his \\"commission is inherently covert\\". Davis denied the claim. According to Business Insider, Jang's concept of journalism may involve infusing the \\"Gospel message\\" into media.

Stacy (March 27, 1930October 12, 2016), frequently referred to as Jim Stacy or J.D. Stacy, was an American entrepreneur and former NASCAR Winston Cup Series race car owner whose career spanned 1977 to 1983. His first race as an owner was the 1977 Firecracker 400 while his final race as an owner was at the 1983 Winston Western 500. As a team owner, Stacy employed veteran NASCAR drivers such as Neil Bonnett, Ferrel Harris, Sterling Marlin, Joe Ruttman, Tim Richmond, and Dale Earnhardt. Stacy's vehicles participated in 126 races with four wins, 21 finishes in the top five, and 53 finishes in the top ten. His cars have managed to lead 1,097 laps out of 30,307 ‚Äì for a grand total of . Summary The Stacy-owned No. 2 driven by Morgan Shepherd in 1983. Stacy was a native of Kentucky. He dropped out of school in the eighth grade. He founded a construction company in 1951. Stacy made his fortune in the coal mining industry. Among Stacy's interests included business in the Netherlands with the Rijn-Schelde-Verolme shipbuilding company, manufacturing thin-seam coal mining machines. Stacy also produced Stacy-Pak multivitamins. In May 1977, Stacy purchased the former K&K; Insurance team from Nord Krauskopf. He was convinced to purchase the team by its crew chief Harry Hyde, a friend and former Stacy employee. Stacy inherited the team's driver Neil Bonnett, with the team changing numbers from 71 to 5. Bonnett would score the first two victories of his career that year. The second of those victories, at Ontario Motor Speedway, would be the last NASCAR victory for a Chrysler vehicle until Dodge reentered the sport in 2001. The team expanded to a second team in 1978, but went winless and was dissolved by the beginning of the 1979 season. Stacy would later be sued by Hyde and Ferrel Harris, one of the drivers of the second team car. In July 1981, Stacy purchased Rod Osterlund's No. 2 team, which fielded Dale Earnhardt. Stacy proceeded to hire Joe Ruttman as a second driver, and planned to expand the team to five entries by 1982, calling the operation \\"The 5 Racers\\". Earnhardt would have a falling out with Jim Stacy after four races, and would leave for Richard Childress Racing. Stacy made headlines in early 1982, when he sponsored a total of seven entries in the 1982 Daytona 500, including his two team cars driven by Joe Ruttman and Jim Sauter. After five races, Ruttman was replaced in the No. 2 by Tim Richmond. Richmond scored two wins for the team, but left at the end of the season. For 1983, the team scaled back to one team, hiring Mark Martin to drive the No. 2 car. Martin was replaced by Morgan Shepherd after seven races. The team ended operations at the end of the season. With an average start of 14th place and an average finish of 17th place, Stacy's cars finished near the middle of the pack. His career winnings as a NASCAR owner were $927,815 ($ when adjusted for inflation); putting him below the millionaire status of most NASCAR drivers and owners. Following the end of his NASCAR career, Stacy purchased several dirt tracks in the Southeastern United States.

Royal Lake of the Woods Yacht Club is a yacht club in Ontario, Canada. It is located on Yacht Club Island approximately 2 miles from Kenora, Ontario, on Lake of the Woods. The yacht club was founded in 1903. History The first record of sailing on Lake of the Woods dates back to 1845, when the Hudson's Bay Company introduced York boats dawned with sails in order to transport their furs. The first camps were built on Keewatin Beach and for about twenty years canoeing, rowing and sailing were the only means of transportation. The first motorboats were introduced in the late 1890s. Keewatin Beach campers participated in sailing, rowing, and gymkhana events. By 1898, cruising races were run on McMillan Island. One of the earliest forms of these cruises was via the Keewatin Channel to Galt Island where the G.F Galt family hosted a picnic lunch. In 1903, sailboats became popular and motorized boats were introduced. A building was subsequently developed on McMillan Island and became the first clubhouse. George William Northwood designed the club house for Lake of the Woods Yacht Club in 1909 The first officers of the yacht club were: Commodore G.W. Baker, Vice Commodore W.E. Macara, Captain Fred Phillips, Measurer H.F. Forrest and Treasurer R.H. Mulock. Royal Assent In 1914, Prince Arthur and his daughter Princess Patricia visited the club. They suggested that it apply for the title of \\"Royal\\". The privilege was delayed because of World War I, but was later granted in 1925 with The Royal Lake of the Woods Yacht Club Incorporation Act. Commodore G.F. Galt was notified that King George V had granted the use of Royal to the Lake of the Woods Yacht Club.

The significance of this case to many students of Contract Law is that a promise to keep an offer open (an option) is itself a contract which must have some consideration. Facts On Wednesday 10 June 1874 Mr Dodds delivered Mr Dickinson an offer to sell some houses for ¬£800, an offer open until 9am on Friday 12 June. On Thursday afternoon, another man called Mr Berry told Mr Dickinson that the houses had already been sold to someone called Mr Allan (who was the second defendant). Mr Dickinson found Mr Dodds in the railway carriage at 7am on Friday, leaving Darlington Railway Station, and gave his acceptance there. But Mr Dodds said it was too late. Mr Dickinson sued for breach of contract. Judgment James LJ held that Mr Berry had conveyed notice of the withdrawal of the offer. After referring to the document of 10 June 1874 he said the following. Mellish LJ agreed and said, Baggallay JA concurred.

Retrieved 17 November 2018 According to the UNICEF 2018 Annual Report, there are approximately 69 million children left behind by one or both of their parents due to migration, which is equivalent to thirty percent of the children in rural area. The number of left behind children is unevenly distributed across age groups, regions, and gender. The majority of the left-behind children population is located in south and central regions of China. Six south and central provinces, including Sichuan, Anhui, Henan, Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi, take up 52% of the left-behind child population. Many factors contribute to the increase of left-behind children in China. Internal migration, which mainly involves massive economically-driven population shifts from the rural areas to the cities in China, produces a large population of left-behind children and migrant children. China's Hukou system (Chinese Household Registration System) hampers left-behind children's chances of public school enrollment in cities. In some cities where a school enrollment point system are implemented, educational resources in urban areas are not readily accessible to migrants and left-behind children. As a result of the lack of educational resources, many migrant parents left their children at home.China Development Brief, ‚ÄúReport discusses challenges in educating migrant and left-behind children‚Äù, 30 Mar 2017.

The lack of infrastructure and parental support have led to additional challenges for left-behind children including quality education, physical well-being, and healthy social relationships.  Overview of Statistics  There are approximately 69 million children in China that are left behind by one or both of their parents due to migration, which is equivalent to thirty percent of the children in rural area. According to the report published by All-China Women's Federation in 2011, among the total population identified as left- behind children, children age 0-5 take up 27.05%, age 6-11 take up 34.85%, and age 12-17 take up 38.11% of the children that are left behind. The male-to- female ratio in left-behind children population is 114.75, with boys composing 53.63% and girls composing 46.57% of the population. Approximately 96% of the left-behind children received or are currently receiving primary and secondary education from 6‚Äì14 years old. Approximately 80% of the left-behind children between the age of 15 and 17 are in school, whereas 70% of the rural children population between the age of 15 and 17 are in school. However, it is also argued that according to a different metric, approximately 1/3 of the left- behind children between 15-17 left home to work. The family structure of left- behind children in China varies. According to a report published by National Bureau of Statistics of China, the family structure can be divided into two main categories: (I) Children staying with a single parent due to migration take up 47.14% of the population, within which the father is three times more likely to migrate for work, hence leaving the mother and other family members with the left-behind child. (II) Children staying with neither of the parents take up 52.86% of the population, within which half of the population live with their grandparents. 11.58% of the total left-behind children live by themselves.National Women's Association (2013).

Cause of Left-behind Children  Construction in Hanyang, Wuhan, Hubei, China  Urbanization and rural-to- urban migration  See more in Wikipedia article: Migration in China Since the implementation of the Opening Up and Reform Policy, China has experienced exponential economic development. Despite the significant growth as an entire nation, the unbalanced regional growth has created a polarization between the urban and the rural, the east and the west, and the rich and the poor. The unequal development become one of the main driving force of rural-to-urban migration, such migration works hand-in-hand with urbanization progress. With China's increasing urbanization, more than half of the population lives in urban areas according to the census data collected in 2015.National Bureau of Statistics (2015). China Statistical Yearbook. Beijing: China Statistics Press. In addition, the conversion of agricultural land for commercial use made agricultural work became less viable and profitable. This prompted a growing number of people to migrate from their hometowns to search for better- paying jobs in urban areas. The income-related and labor-force-related drives to rural-to-urban migration and urbanization prompted the phenomenon of floating children and left-behind children in China.Ye, Jingzhong, Pan, Lu. 2011. ‚ÄúDifferentiated childhoods: impacts of rural labor migration on left- behind children in China.‚Äù The Journal of Peasant Studies Volume 38, Issue 2.  Household registration system (Hukou System)  See more in Wikipedia article: Hukou The Household Registration System is an institution implemented in China which requires its citizens to register and record as residents of a particular area in the unit of family. The system is often considered as an institutionalized mean to create class distinction in China. The system functions as a tool to control and monitor the population and the internal migration. It also serves as the basis for the distribution of public services and resources, which determines what social benefits (education, housing and medical services) a person may receive in a specific region. When residing outside of the place of origin, such benefits and services might not be awarded. Because of the barriers to access educational resources outside of their places of origins, people with high mobility have to either send their children to migrant worker schools or leave their children behind in the rural hometown, causing the increase of the left-behind children in China.Wang, Sophie Xuefei, and Fu Yu Benjamin. 2019. \\"Labor Mobility Barriers and Rural- Urban Migration in Transitional China.\\" China Economic Review 211-224.Lisa Yiu & Luo Yun (2017) China‚Äôs Rural Education: Chinese Migrant Children and Left- Behind Children, Chinese Education & Society, 50:4, 307-314. Although recent policies have relaxed school admission by banning sponsorship fees in many cities, many problems still remain.BBC News, \\"China to protect migrant workers' 'left-behind' children,\\" 15 February 2016. Retrieved 17 November 2018 from https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35581716 In December 2014, the Legislative Affairs Office of the People's Republic of China proposed a reform of the Household Registration System that dismantles it in small cities and towns and the relaxation of control in medium cities.  Impacts  Migration usually has adverse effect on the schooling and wellbeing of left-behind children. The experience of being left behind by migrant parents has various impact on children's mental and physical wellbeing. The severity of negative consequences that might experience by left-behind children in China depend on the child's age, gender, and family economic resources.  Intersectionality  Children who were left in early stages in life showed lower levels of life satisfaction. According to one research, children left behind at the age of three have emotional issues while children left at the age of nine have decreased in pro-social behaviors. Gender is another factor that impact the left-behind children's experience. Girls receive more supervision and undertake more care work than boys who are left behind. It is common for caregivers of left-behind children to place more restrictions on girls' social activities than those of boys. The practice is an attempt to protect female children, because females are considered more vulnerable than males in many rural Chinese societies. Additionally, the level of housework required by left-behind female children increases when their parents migrate, replacing male children as the main caretaker of the household. The difference in family's economic resources also create difference in left-behind children's experience. Difficult economic conditions often result in poor quality care for left-behind children. When caregivers lack the financial resources to afford school fees, nutritious food, and other basic needs, left-behind children are likely to face challenges with well-being. Lower-income households are also more likely to require left-behind children to engage in farm work, resulting in exclusion from social and academic activities.  Mental and physical health  Approximately 50% of the left-behind children in China go through melancholy and apprehension, in comparison to 30% of their urban peers. Likewise, they are more likely to suffer from mood swings and trauma.Tania Branigan, China struggles with mental health problems of 'left- behind' children, The Guardian, 30 August 2014.

They are more likely to exhibit more selfish, indifferent, and introverted mindset. Due to the various problems associated with being left behind, children are more prone to health problems. Left-behind children generally have a less healthy diet and lower rates of physical activity; lower intake of some nutrients and poorer physical development related to nutrition. Left-behind children are more likely to engage in unhealthy habits and extreme behaviors such as smoking and drinking alcohol. These particular habits have contributed to higher rates of stunted growth and unhealthy body weights.David McKenzie and Serena Dong, China to migrant workers: Take your kids with you, CNN, 16 February 2016.

In addition, a drop-in children's center in Xichehe was built to serve 200 left-behind children with sponsorship from the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation (CFPA) and the Sichuan Provincial Communist Youth League. Children's Clubs offering \\"play and educational activities under the care and supervision of local volunteers\\" have shown positive outcomes. Data-driven analysis to determine the most effective interventions in rural education and child welfare is being developed by Peking University and the Chinese Academy of Science's Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy, in Beijing have partnered with Stanford's Rural Education Action Program (REAP). Studies indicated that although rural children had good motor skills, benefited from school lunch programs, and responded to caregiver coaching with their parents, caregiver coaching with their grandparents had little effect. A randomized trial of early childhood development centers in villages in Shaanxi Province is expected to start yielding data in 2018. Besides government initiatives, private individuals including Jack Ma has called for other entrepreneurs to make increased investments and financial contributions to rural boarding schools in their home provinces.  Social support  ‚ÄúGuidance on how to make best use of social work professionals in the protection of rural left-behind children‚Äù has been jointly issued by the Ministries of Civil Affairs, Education and Finance, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Women's Federation, for the use of social work professionals who work with rural left- behind children. The tasks defined in the document include: # assisting in the rescue and protection work # carrying out family education guidance # actively providing social care services The policy aims to # strengthen the training and development of professionals # actively cultivate and develop social work service institutions # promote the construction of social work service stations in villages and towns, and # increase the employment of social work professionals in relevant units. Another initiative from the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MCA) has been placement of unsupervised left-behind children in the custody of guardians. Since the campaign commenced in November 2016, 16,000 left-behind children who had dropped out of school have resumed their education, and 177,800 who were previously unregistered have been registered on national household records. A national information management system for left-behind children has been launched. The system enables professionals to share data about the child subsistence allowance, impoverished households and people with disabilities. The system now has data on 1.3 million children with disabilities and 110,000 children of impoverished families. In Southwest China's Guizhou Province, left-behind rural children use smart wristbands with GPS for tracking and protection. The local governments of Bijie city and Qianxinan Buyi, the Miao autonomous prefecture in Guizhou, spent approximately 24 million yuan (3.6 million U.S. dollars) to provide smart wristbands for more than 100,000 left-behind children in primary schools. The wristband has a GPS locator and is linked to local police databases which allows children to report emergencies.

The Shingle Style house was designed by architect George D. Rainsford, a New York architect who moved to Wyoming to raise Morgan horses and Clydesdales. While horse breeding was his principal occupation, Rainsford continued to practice architecture, designing many of the houses in the neighborhood surrounding the Sturgis residence. Sturgis was another New Yorker, who moved to Cheyenne in 1873, joining forces with his brother Thomas to form the Northwestern Cattle Company and the Union Cattle Company, becoming one of the most prominent cattle ranchers in Wyoming. The Sturgises were instrumental in the founding of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. William held interests in mines, the Stockgrower's National Bank and the Cheyenne Electric Light Company. Sturgis took heavy losses in his cattle holdings as a result of the hard winter of 1886-87 and sold the house to another rancher, John Whitaker. The 2-1/2 story L-shaped house originally had brick on the first floor and shingles above. The brick was covered with stucco. A complex roofline features multiple dormers, including an eyelid dormer over the front door. The interior features a large living hall, featuring fishscale-pattern shingles as a wall treatment. The house was published in American Architect, attributed to William A. Bates. Vincent Scully, who repeats the Bates attribution, notes that the house is significant as an example of the westward spread of the Shingle Style. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 8, 1982.

From 2003‚Äì2010, this was delivered as an annual report produced by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (now known as BirdLife Australia) in the form of an illustrated colour magazine supplement. The 2015 version of the report marks the beginning of a new era in the series, with the introduction of the Australian Bird Index. Overview The SOAB reports collate and analyse information on trends in the conservation status of bird populations in Australia. Some of the material presented in SOAB is extracted from BirdLife Australia's monitoring projects, notably the Atlas of Australian Birds citizen science project. All issues are available for free download. 2003-2010 Reports The reports were published as supplements to Wingspan magazine. The 2003 and 2008 editions of SOAB were five-yearly overviews, while the other editions were themed on various aspects of Australian avifauna (for example, SOAB 2010 was themed on Birds and Islands). 2015 and Future Reports The 2015 (SOAB) report launched the first Australian Bird Indices for terrestrial birds and introduces Australia's Red List Index (RLI), a means of tracking trends in the status of Australia's most threatened bird groups. BirdLife Australia plan to release a comprehensive SOAB report in 2020, that will include indices for all of Australia's bioregions, highlight trends for a wide range of terrestrial species, and provide an evaluation of the monitoring gaps. The 2020 report also aims to incorporate information from the National Environmental Science Program Threatened Species Index project, the first iteration of which was a Threatened Bird Index, showing declines across multiple threatened bird taxa.

It tells the emotional story of 17 small children who leave home and family, possibly forever, in order to save their dying Tibetan culture. Parting from one of the most remote and desolate places on Earth ‚Äì Zanskar, in northwest India ‚Äì the expedition must travel on foot over 17,000 foot Himalayan passes. The two monks serving as guides walked this same path 30 years ago when they were children. The 17 children with them may not return home for 10‚Äì15 years or more. Narrated by Richard Gere, featuring the Dalai Lama, the film tells the story of their incredible journey. Plot Zanskar is the last remaining original Tibetan Buddhist society with a continuous untainted lineage dating back thousands of years. In nearby Tibet and Ladakh, in Sikkim, Bhutan, and Nepal, traditional Tibetan Buddhist culture is either dead already or dying. The horror of Chinese government design in Tibet is being matched by the destruction of global economics elsewhere. Zanskar, ringed by high Himalayan mountains in northwest India, one of the most remote places on the planet, has been safe until now. But that‚Äôs changing. In 3‚Äì5 years a road connecting Padum, the heart of Zanskar, with Leh, the heart of neighboring Ladakh, will be finished. The route which previously took up to two days by car will take only 4‚Äì5 hours. As economic growth descends on Zanskar it will bring with it an end to this unbroken Buddhist social tradition. Will the native language, culture, and religious practice be able to survive? The Dalai Lama has instructed two monks from Zanskar‚Äôs Stongde Monastery to do everything in their power to insure that it does. The monks are building a school to educate the children from surrounding villages in their own language, culture, history, and religion. Presently, the government school teaches none of those subjects, and is closed most of the year. The nearby private school also doesn‚Äôt teach those subjects and is additionally unaffordable for the area‚Äôs poor families. At Stongde, along with indigenous traditions, the children will be educated in the best Western curricula. The monks are racing against the clock. While they complete the school they are also placing local children in other schools and monasteries in the city of Manali and beyond. This requires walking over a 17,500 foot pass. On foot. On horseback. Led by yaks... Whatever it takes.

Gymnastic formation is a collective art based on gymnastics expressed by 30 to 5000 figurants using only human bodies without instruments. It is commonly presented in Japanese schools as a part of physical education curriculum. The expression of the collective beauty based on force, passion, and union of young men is much more important than the individual expression. It is a modality of mass game. In this moment, there is no unified English expression. In the United States of America, journalists sometimes use the expression ‚Äúmass gymnastics‚Äù especially to represent annual festival of the North Korea. However, this expression not always includes mounting, and therefore, it meaning is similar to mass game. In the other English speaking countries, such as Malaysia, it is called ‚Äúgymnastic formation‚Äù. In Japan, it is called ‚Äúkumi- tais√¥‚Äù, which means mounting gymnastics. History Basic performances of gymnastic formation are seen at the wall painting of ancient Egypt and ceramic art of ancient China. In the Middle Age of Europe, it was exhibited in Italy on the festivities. In the 19th century, gymnastic formation was performed in Germany. In the beginning of the 20th century, in the United States of America, some young women‚Äôs groups performed it. In Czechoslovakia (country name of that time), large-scale gymnastic formation of thousands of figurants was exhibited up to 1985. In Japan, gymnastic formation of hundreds of figurants is performed up to the present in annual sports festival of schools. Up to the end of the 20th century, gymnastic formation was practiced in many organizations of the world. However, in the 21st century large-scale gymnastics became less exhibited. Today, it is seem in limited countries and territories, such as Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Brazil, Philippines, and North Korea. The former five are in civil events and the latter is a national governmental event.

Gymnastic formation has general objective of demonstration of force, passion, and union of the participants and not a modality to dispute championship. General flow is from small-light mounting to large-heavy mounting. The performance of the NGOs, such as the Soka Gakkai International (SGI), is widely variable, such as, bi-dimensional wave, sky rocket, windmill, walking wall, walking pyramid, catapult, instantaneous stand-up pyramid, instantaneous stand-up tower, three-layers' plane tower, four-layers' tower, and rarely five-layers' tower. The six-layers' tower that stood up in Osaka, Japan, in 1982 was indexed on the Guinness Book. Bibliographic references * Yasuichi Hamada, 1996. Ilusstrated gymnastic formation.

When a shift does occur, it is necessary to understand how this will impact the ecosystem populations and the degree to which the shift can be reversed. Structural shifts can result in invasions by harmful organisms, species collapse and a radical reconfiguring of the biogeochemical cycles. Traditional approaches group species broadly into size classes and trophic levels measured by productivity or biomass. But to understand how ecosystems react to natural and anthropogenic stressors, specific differences in the way individual species react must also be understood, particularly where keystone species are involved.

These three settings represent critical stages in the life-cycle of the ocean floor. The ocean basins are created by the rifting apart of continents. Oceanic lithosphere then forms at mid-ocean ridges. It is subsequently modified by low and high temperature interactions with the overlying oceans, the addition of intraplate magmas, the deposition of marine sediments, and tectonic processes occurring at or near transform and convergent plate margins. When it subducts at convergent margins, the dehydration of the plate induces arc volcanism that creates and modifies the continental crust and transfers climate-relevant volatiles into the atmosphere. Such continental margins are sites of sediment accumulation, fluid exchange, important resources and major geo-hazards.\\"Research Division 4: Dynamics of the ocean floor IFM-GEOMAR.

Despite its legality, capital punishment has not been imposed in PNG in over sixty years. The last known execution took place under the colonial administration of Australia.Amnesty USA \\"Urgent Action: Papua New Guinea plans for executions\\" (4 June 2013) . The last execution is understood to have been done by way of hanging and took place in the capital city of PNG, Port Moresby, in November 1954.Cornell University \\"Death Penalty Worldwide Papua New Guinea\\" (23 January 2011) . History Within the Pacific Islands Forum, all countries (albeit not PNG) have either completely abolished capital punishment or have refrained from imposing it for numerous decades.Amnesty International \\"Papua New Guinea - The state as killer?\\" (April 2004) . The use of capital punishment in PNG has fluctuated throughout history and has again become unsettled in recent years. Since 1954, PNG appeared to have maintained a strong \\"long-standing de facto moratorium\\"Rupert Colville \\"UN human rights office regrets Papua New Guinea's decision to resume death penalty\\" (31 May 2013) . which was later passed into law. The complete abolishment of capital punishment occurred in 1970 whilst PNG was still under the colonial administration of Australia. However, in 1973, PNG took the first step towards becoming independent and began the process of self-governance. Two years later in 1975, Australia gave up its remaining powers over PNG, allowing the country to proceed to complete independence.Author Unknown \\"Papua New Guinea: History\\" (28 April 2015) . In August 1991 the Government of PNG re-introduced capital punishment as an amendment to the PNG Criminal Code Act 1974.Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code Act 1974, section 299(2). At this point its application was limited to cases of wilful murder,Sinclair Dinnen Law and order in a weak state: Crime and politics in Papua New Guinea (University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, 2001) . but the imposition of the death penalty would not be mandatory and therefore be \\"at the discretion of the Judge.\\"Cornell University \\"Death Penalty Worldwide Papua New Guinea\\" (23 January 2011) . The re-introduction of capital punishment into legislation was greeted with a mixed response not only in PNG but throughout the world. The Government at the time justified its actions by arguing that it was aligning legislation to reflect public perception that there was a necessity to deter abhorrent behaviour. According to Bernard Narokobi (the Justice Minister at the time), \\"it reflected the community's outrage and disgust\\"Author Unknown \\"Death Penalty Plan for PNG\\" The Canberra Times (Australia, 25 March 1991) at 16. to heinous criminal offences. Despite his support for Papua New Guinean communities to express their views, Narokobi made it clear that he did not endorse the move towards the re-introduction of capital punishment.Author Unknown \\"Death Penalty Plan for PNG\\" The Canberra Times (Australia, 25 March 1991). However, the country's Prime Minister at the time, Rabbie Namaliu, argued that the alarming deterioration in the country's enforcement of law and order was a threat to the country's future and needed to be dealt with.Author Unknown \\"Death Penalty Plan for PNG\\" The Canberra Times (Australia, 25 March 1991). On the contrary, there was also strong opposition for the re-introduction of capital punishment. Amnesty International pleaded that PNG addressed the deterioration of law and order in other ways and declared that Amnesty International \\"opposed the death penalty in all cases on the grounds that it is a violation of the human right to life.\\"Amnesty International \\"Papua New Guinea - The death penalty: Not the solution\\" (February 1996) at 1. In 2010, Manfred Nowak undertook a comprehensive review of PNG's use of \\"torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\\"Manfred Nowak \\"UN Special Rapporteur on Torture represents preliminary findings on his Mission to Papua New Guinea\\" (25 May 2010) . and subsequently recommended that PNG took immediate steps to abolish the death penalty. Following this, Nowak also suggested that PNG become party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the ICCPR) and ratify the second optional protocol,Manfred Nowak \\"UN Special Rapporteur on Torture represents preliminary findings on his Mission to Papua New Guinea\\" (25 May 2010) . aimed at abolishing the death penalty worldwide. However, in May 2013 PNG took further steps to revive the use of capital punishment, simultaneously amending legislation to reflect harsher punishments for a variety of criminal offences.Liam Fox \\"PNG death penalty condemned as 'barbaric' by Amnesty International\\" (29 May 2013) . Due to the failed deterrence of criminal offences following the 1991 Criminal Code amendment, the government subsequently passed another amendment to the Criminal Code.Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code (Amendment) Act (No. 6) 2013. Under earlier versions of the PNG Criminal Code, offences of treason, piracy and attempted piracy were also punishable by death.Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code Act 1974, sections 37, 81, 82. In addition, the 2013 amendment allowed that aggravated rape and robbery, alongside wilful murder would be punishable by death. Concurrently, the Government repealed the Sorcery Act 1971Papua New Guinea, Sorcery Act 1971. therefore making sorcery-related murder also punishable by death. The Prime Minister (past and present) Peter O'Neill stated \\"the proposed laws are tough, but they are necessary. We have to address a situation which is destroying our country.\\"Palash Ghosh \\"Papua New Guinea seeks to resume death penalty in wake of horrific crime spree, but activists object\\" International Business Times (USA, 2 May 2013) . The amendments came into force on 18 September 2013.Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code (Amendment) Act (No. 6) 2013. Recent events Throughout 2014, PNG's actions indicated that it was moving closer towards reinitiating capital punishment since its re-introduction in 1991 and broadened scope in 2013. The Constitutional Law Reform Commission (Commission) discussed the death penalty in a public forum which was held in November 2014Cedric Pajole \\"Forum to discuss death penalty today\\" Papua New Guinea Loop (Papua New Guinea, 13 November 2014). following the report given to the PNG Government on preferred execution methods. On 5 February 2015 the Secretary of the Department of Justice and Attorney General of PNG, Lawrence Kalinoe indicated that there are currently 13 people on death row in PNG. All of whom have exhausted their appeals and will likely be executed this year.Kelly Buchanan \\"Papua New Guinea: Cabinet Approves Guidelines for Implantation of the Death Penalty\\" (11 February 2015) . Kalinoe also confirmed that the PNG government had \\"approved an interagency committee to oversee the implementation of the death penalty.\\"Author Unknown \\"Church leaders condemn PNG government's decision to implement the death penalty\\" Papua New Guinea Today (Papua New Guinea, 5 February 2015) .

Papua New Guinea and Tonga is one of last countries in Oceania to not have abolished the death penalty and is most likely to abolish it in the 2020s. Cases Charles Bougapa Ombusu On 20 February 1995 Charles Bougapa Ombusu was the first person to be sentenced to death after PNG's re-introduction of capital punishment in 1991, following his supposed \\"fatal shooting of the father of a girl he had raped\\"Amnesty International \\"Papua New Guinea - The state as killer?\\" (April 2004) . in Popondetta, Northern Province. Ombusu was later acquitted in April 1995. The Supreme Court found that Ombusu had acted in self-defence. Critics of capital punishment have raised concerns that this form of punishment risks executing innocent people.Cornell University \\"Death Penalty Worldwide Papua New Guinea\\" (23 January 2011) . Since 1995 other death sentences have been handed down, but no executions have been carried out due to an absence of regulations surrounding the appropriate process.Liam Fox \\"PNG 'waiting for death penalty guidelines\\" Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Australia, 7 July 2009) . Steven Loke Ume On 2 December 1995, the three appellants were among a group of nine who abducted and brutally killed a woman. The trial judge deemed the facts of the case to accord with the worst kind of wilful murder and thus sentenced each of the appellants to death. The issue in the case on appeal was whether or not the trial judge had erred in reaching the conclusion of imposing the death sentence. The question was essentially whether or not there were \\"extenuating circumstances or mitigating factors which warranted lesser punishment\\"Ume v The State [2006] SC 836 at [68]. than the death penalty. The PNG Supreme Court quashed the death sentences imposed on each appellant and concluded that without further guidance from legislation, \\"Parliament may wish to consider prescribing the types of aggravating circumstances in wilful murder cases which warrant the death penalty.\\"Ume v The State [2006] SC 836 at [67]. Or further, clarify when \\"extenuating circumstances\\"Ume v The State [2006] SC 836 at [21]. are relevant. Finally, the PNG Supreme Court concluded with situations in which the imposition of the death penalty would be more appropriate;Ume v The State [2006] SC 836 at [67]. # The killing of a child, a young or old person, or a person under some disability needing protection; # The killing of a person in authority or responsibility in the community providing invaluable community service, whether for free or for fee who are killed in the course of carrying out their duties or for reasons to do with the performance of their duties e.g. policeman, correctional officer, government officer, school teacher, church worker, company director or manager: # The killing of a leader in government or the community, for political reasons; # The killing of person in the course of committing other crimes perpetrated on the victim or other persons such as rape, robbery or theft; # The killing for hire; # The killing of two or more persons in the single act or series of acts; # For an offence committed by a prisoner in detention or custody serving sentence for another serious offence of violence; or # The prisoner has prior conviction(s) for murder offences. Applying this case, prosecutors are to determine whether the death penalty is the appropriate sentence in light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Methods of execution The preferred method of capital punishment in New Guinea is hanging. Whilst precise statistics of all execution cases are unknown, it is known that \\"at least 67 people were executed by hanging\\" Amnesty International \\"Papua New Guinea - The state as killer?\\" (April 2004) . under the colonial administration of Australia, the United Kingdom and Germany between World War I and World War II. Following the 2013 amendment of the Criminal Code, the government introduced capital punishment by way of lethal injection, deprivation of oxygen (\\"medical\\" asphyxiation),Rob Taylor \\"Papua New Guinea may review death penalty, Prime Minister says\\" Wall Street Journal (America, 10 March 2015) . firing squad and electrocutionPapua New Guinea, Criminal Code (Amendment) Act (No. 6) 2013, section 614. in addition to the pre-existing option of hanging. With the addition of four alternate methods of execution, the Commission was requested to report on the best method of execution and the most appropriate for PNG to utilise.Jamie Tahana \\"PNG says executions will go ahead this year\\" (28 January 2014) . The Commission travelled to countries with experience in capital punishment: United States, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore \\"in order to provide advice to the government on what methods of execution should be adopted.\\"Kelly Buchanan \\"Papua New Guinea: Cabinet Approves Guidelines for Implantation of the Death Penalty\\" (11 February 2015) . Following the report by the Commission, the PNG Cabinet endorsed hanging, firing squad and lethal injection as appropriate execution methods. One of these three methods would likely be used if an offence punishable by death is committed and a sentence of capital punishment is imposed.Kelly Buchanan \\"Papua New Guinea: Cabinet Approves Guidelines for Implantation of the Death Penalty\\" (11 February 2015) . Exceptions There are three situations in which a sentence of capital punishment may be adjusted or denied; individuals under 18 years of age at the time the offence was committed; pregnant women; and mentally ill persons. Under 18 years of age If a person under the age of 18 commits a criminal offence that is punishable by death, they will not be executed.Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code Act 1974. PNG has ratified the ICCPRInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966. and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC),Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989, article 37(a). both of which are international instruments that prohibit the execution of a person under 18.Cornell University \\"Death Penalty Worldwide Papua New Guinea\\" (23 January 2011) . Pregnant women If a pregnant woman is sentenced to capital punishment, she may request to have the execution stayed (delayed) until after the birth of the child.Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code Act 1974, section 599. This is provided that it is sufficiently proven that she is in fact pregnant.Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code Act 1974, sections 599(2) and 599(3). Mentally ill persons A person with the incapacity to understand or control their actions will not be liable for a criminal offence which they have committed. Secondly a person who commits an offence due to a delusion will only be \\"held liable insofar as the delusion would support criminal liability if it were true.\\"Cornell University \\"Death Penalty Worldwide Papua New Guinea\\" (23 January 2011) at 3 . Legal framework PNG is governed by a mixture of national and international laws and regulations. National PNG has two notable pieces of legislation concerning capital punishment. The Criminal Code Act 1974 and the Constitution of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (Constitution) are at the forefront of the law. Imposing capital punishment for wilful murder in PNG is prescribed in section 299(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1974 and is validated by the country's constitution. The right to life provision states \\"no person shall be deprived of his life intentionally except...in execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of an offence for which the penalty of death is prescribed by law‚Äù.Constitution of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, section 35(1)(a). The provision concerning the freedom from inhuman treatment confirms that the killing of a person under section 35(1)(a) does not contravene section 36(1).Constitution of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, section 36(1). Therefore, confirming that imposing a sentence of capital punishment is legal in PNG. International The ICCPR and the CRC are fundamental human rights documents both of which PNG is a party to. On 21 July 2008, PNG ratified the ICCPR. However PNG is not party to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which is predominately aimed at abolishing the death penalty. In the same year, PNG abstained from the vote on the UN moratorium on the death penalty and went on to oppose a similar notion in 2011. PNG signed the CRC on 30 September 1990 and ratified it on 2 March 1993.

As spoken by Marx, self-estrangement is \\"the alienation of man's essence, man's loss of objectivity and his loss of realness as self-discovery, manifestation of his nature, objectification and realization\\". Self-estrangement is when a person feels alienated from others and society as a whole. A person may feel alienated by his work by not feeling like he has meaning to his work, therefore losing their sense of self at the work place. Self-estrangement contributes to burnout at work and a lot of psychological stress.  Sociologists on the topic   Karl Marx  In Marx's theory of alienation, he states that self-estrangement is the feeling of being alienated from people and things around you. Karl Marx's theory focused more on the self-estrangement aspect in man's work. He further explain it by saying that self-estrangement is the alienation of man from himself and his feelings, man's loss of purpose, objectification of himself to think he isn't good enough and realization of that. If someone denies self- estrangement, then they are confirming it as well; by dismissing it they are acknowledging that it is there. Marx states that self-estrangement is a huge factor in alienation.  Melvin Seeman  Melvin Seeman defined the meaning of alienation in his work On the Meaning of Alienation (1959). Seeman states that alienation is identified by five alternative meanings: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation, and self-estrangement. Self- estrangement in relation to society is essentially being something less than what one might ideally be if the circumstances in society were different, and being insecure and conforming to society's expectations in all aspects of himself. Furthermore, he mentions that alienation is man's loss of pride and satisfaction from doing their work and therefore feeling alienated.  Robert K. Merton  Robert K. Merton does not directly define self-estrangement in his Theory of Deviancy, but he does touch upon the concept of self- estrangement. In his theory he mentions cultural goals and institutional means. Cultural goals are the ideas and aspirations people reach for and the institutional means are the steps and actions they take to achieve those aspirations. Merton considers ritualism the acceptance of the means but the forfeit of the goals. Ritualists continue to subscribe to the means, but they have rejected the overall goal; this makes them feel alienated from their work causing self-estrangement. They work because they know they have to, not because they have a goal or reason they are doing the work.  Arlie Russell Hochschild  Arlie Russell Hochschild defined emotional labor and how it can make you feel estranged from yourself. This type of labor requires you to be in a good state of mind and feeling while in the work environment despite any problems you may be going through. At work you are expected to act a certain way and give the best customer service, even if you don't feel the way you act. This can be shown through always having a smile and acting happy while providing service to customers. For example, your boss may tell you to \\"leave your problems at home\\", meaning you must act like nothing is wrong even if you feel terrible. Hochschild uses an example of Delta flight attendants and how they must maintain an artificial state of elation throughout their workday despite their exhaustion and may even manage to take that artificial elation outside of their job into their real lives. This makes you feel detached and alienated from your own emotions and cause self-estrangement.  In a worker  Self-estrangement in workers manifests in feelings of working just for a salary, doing one's job just to get it out of the way, or doing work to please others. Although self-estrangement is a small factor, it still contributes to alienation, which contributes strongly to burnout at work. Self-estrangement may provoke different forms of psychic distress that potentially evoke symptoms of burnout, or manifestations of stress that ruin work life. Self- estrangement and lack of meaning in one's work provokes a different form of psychic distress that evokes symptoms of burnout. According to Marx's theory of alienation, a worker can feel self-estranged from their work, their production, and other workers. This means that the person loses interest in why they are working, which can decrease their production and cause them to alienate themselves from other workers as well. The worker doesn't feel like he is a part of the workplace, therefore isolating himself from his work and others.  In adolescents  Self-estrangement appears in many adolescents with low self-esteem. They may feel bored of life and feel like there is no purpose. Without a purpose, these adolescents may feel as if no one around them understands them, and they may alienate themselves. This may cause a decline in performance at school because they feel that they have no purpose in doing homework and a decrease in working on developing friendships because they feel that they don't need them.

It is a City of Pittsburgh Designated Historic Structure. The four-bedroom home was constructed in 1896 for William H. Wigman, the owner of Wigman Lumber on the South Side. At the time, Carrick, which sits upon a hilltop south of Pittsburgh, was a popular neighborhood for wealthy entrepreneurs who sought to escape the smoke of the city. The Wigman House is all that remains from this area known as \\"Millionaire's Row\\" Since 1952, the house has been owned by the McClory family; in 2011 they placed the property for sale, seeking $150,000, a move that set local preservationists into action. The owner of a neighboring funeral home, Congressman Harry Readshaw, considered purchasing and demolishing the building for parking for his funeral home, across the street from the property. Members of the Carrick-Overbrook Historical Society sought to block Readshaw's purchase by nominating the home for historic status, calling it \\"the last remaining example of several homes of the wealthy South Side gentry who lived in Carrick.\\" The owners, the McClory family, opposed the nomination, concerned that the designation would harm its chances to sell. The Young Preservationists Association of Pittsburgh identifies the building as a top-priority historic preservation opportunity. In April 2011, the city's Historic Review Commission approved the historical society's application, setting the stage for contentious hearings before the Pittsburgh City Council. The historic status was opposed by City Councilman Ricky Burgess, expressing a concern about the rights of the house's current owners. In a reversal, the current owners changed their position on the historic status in a letter to the Council, citing historic tax credits and the possibility that the house's historic value could be a selling point.

Previously, Tierney and Luciantonio were both members of a 1980s country-rock group called the Hodads. Luciantonio and Tierney met at the University of Guelph in Canada and formed a band in Montreal in 1985. Taking their name from the cover of an art magazine, the duo formed Gogh Van Go in 1993 and signed with Audiogram Records. Through Audiogram Records, the group released two records. Their first album, the self-titled Gogh Van Go, released in 1993 and produced by Pierre Marchand, was part of the label's push into the English-speaking Canadian market. It was recorded and mixed at Studio Nomade, Morin Heights, Qu√©bec. The record featured songs such as \\"Bed Where We Hide\\", \\"Say You Will\\" (re-mixed by James Di Salvio of Bran Van 3000 fame) and \\"Tunnel of Trees\\", which won Lyne Charlebois the Juno Award for Best Video in 1995, as well as a cover of John Lennon's \\"Instant Karma!\\". Their second album, Bliss Station, was released in 1997. In celebration of the 20th anniversary of their debut album, the duo reunited to perform in December 2013, with what was reported to be a \\"one-night-only\\" reunion show at the Cabaret du Mile End in Montreal. Luciantonio and Tierney were joined by their original line up, including Yves Desrosiers (Jean Leloup, Lhasa de Sela), guitar; Jean Massicotte, keyboards and samples; John Souranis (Men Without Hats, Hodads, Jerry Jerry), bass; and John McColgan (Kate & Anna McGarrigle, Michel Pagliaro, Stephen Barry Band), drums. That same year, Audiogram released a compilation on iTunes, The Best of Gogh Van Go, which included the Say You Will remix produced by James Di Salvio and a forgotten track from the first album. Brendan Kelly of the Montreal Gazette proclaimed the Gogh Van Go concert as his live music event of the year.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xyK20D89Wc In 2014 the group returned to the studio to record two new songs, Sugar and Mama Needs a New Dress, written by Luciantonio with Yves Desrosiers, and produced by keyboardist Jean Massicotte.

The frescoes epitomize the Mannerist style of Giorgio Vasari and his studio. History In March 1546, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1520‚Äì1589), at the suggestion of Paolo Giovio, commissions Vasari to paint a fresco a hall of the chancery in the Palazzo of San Giorgio, which was remodeled and rebuilt as the massive Palazzo della Cancelleria. The purpose of the frescoes was to celebrate the life of Pope Paul III, Alessandro's grandfather. In his biography of Artists (Vite), Vasari details the planning, commission and execution of this work. Legend has it that Michelangelo, known for his plodding meticulous style, was shown the work and Vasari bragged about the rapid execution, Michelangelo is reputed to have tartly replied: si vede! (\\"it shows!\\"). The work even in its day was not admired for its quality. Paolo Giovio reports to Cardinal Farnese that the portraits displeased him. Today, the condition of the frescoes is mediocre, even though they were restored several times after a 1940 fire. Program In the Sala dei Cento Giorni, Vasari and his assistants work in an elaborate and fanciful manner. The narrative unfolds within an unusual illusionist space flooded with allegoric ornamentation and further by numerous figures in painted architecture surrounded by simulated sculpture. The gestures and expressions of the figures are extravagant and exaggerated in a courtly manner, according to the Maniera style of the mid-Cinquecento. The decoration in this room exemplifies the third type of wall decoration: it is stylistically related to the Chamber of Fortune in the Casa Vasari. This hall is rectangular. Its flat wooden ceiling is composed of recessed coffered shapes. These squares are created by the intersection of wooden beams. A corbel resting on the upper part of the wall supports the end of each beam. The east wall contains six large windows on the lower zone and six small ones in the upper zone. The north and south walls each contain only one bay, while the west wall contains two. The treatment of the wall decoration is geometric and architectonic. The wall is not considered as a painted two-dimensional surface, but rather as a plastic, architectural structure in which imaginary and real space can expand and contract as one. The wall, which treated in a frieze-like style, is divided into two horizontal zones, each in turn divided into three vertical parts. The upper part contains at each end a portrait bust of an ancient emperor framed by winged Ignudi or allegories of Victory. A Latin motto is inscribed in a scroll above this composition. In the center of this upper zone, seated female figures framed by the wooden corbels present an escutcheon. They can he identified by the attributes they hold and by the Latin inscription on the scroll at their feet. Variations of grotesque motifs added to the overall decoration of this zone. The lower and upper parts are separated by two broken pediments at the ends of the wall (where the ancient busts rest) and by the architrave running between them. This architrave supports an elaborate mask and festoon motifs. In the lower part of the wall are two painted tabernacles supporting the broken pediments described above. The tabernacle motif contains an open area, or niche, from which a standing female figure protrudes toward the viewer: a motif deriving from Vasari's Michelangelesque studies of the Medici Chapel. In the center of the lower part, Doric columns frame depictions of an istoria. Using painted architecture to frame a narrative scene, commonly in antiquity, was elaborated in the Quattrocento, for example, in the Salone dei Mesi of the Schifanoia Palace at Ferrara, and later in the High Renaissance as exemplified by the Sala di Costantino in the Vatican Palace. The istorie are filled with stylistic quotations from past and present art. The dado (zoccolo or basamento) of the wall has been either transformed or eliminated. Vasari creates a new, large-scale device by using illusionistically painted steps extending from the center of the lower zone to the actual physical floor. It seems as if the viewer could step up into the painted scene and participate in the events occurring in narrative istoria. According to Sydney Freedberg, the steps motif is a transformation of Michelangelo's ricetto (vestibule) in the Biblioteca Laurenziana. Other important sources for Vasari's motifs are their exedra of Cortile del Belvedere at the Vatican and the Nymphaeum fresco in the window embrasure of the Hall of Constantine, also in the Vatican Palace. The decorative scheme in the Sala dei Cento Giorni is systematized and framed into quadro riportato, or independent framed scenes of history. The quadri or frames are flanked by tabernacles containing figures that symbolize moral or aesthetic virtues. And the overall design is fused by classical and grotesque motifs. The execution of the Sala dei Cento Giorni is invaluable for Vasari. It is, in fact, the beginning of a formalized, complex painting program that is to undergo further elaboration in the decorative cycles of the Palazzo Vecchio.

It is found on exposed sandy beaches in the swash region of the intertidal zone. Description The Pacific sand crab is a small crustacean growing up to long and wide. The female is nearly twice as large as the male and can often be identified by the orange egg mass carried under the telson. The adult is sand-coloured and well camouflaged, and has no claws or spines. It has five pairs of legs and three pairs of pleopods. Sand crabs moult periodically, so their exoskeletons may be found washed up on the beach. The sand crab is well adapted to life in the sand, which presents an unstable substrate, and its shape is an elongated dome shape designed for fast burrowing. The eyes are on long stalks and the antennules are also elongated so as to project above the surface of the sand. These form a tube which channels water downwards through the gills. The much longer antennae are retractable. When water is overhead, they also project above the sand surface to collect food particles. The legs and uropods have hairy margins to assist in digging and for use in collecting food and transferring it to the mouth. Distribution The sand crab occurs in North America from Alaska to Baja California and in South America, where it is found from Salaverry, Peru, southwards to around Cape Horn and into southern Argentina. The species is common on the beaches of California, but greater changes in population levels occur further north, probably as a result of variations in the coastal currents which in some years passively disperse the planktonic larval stages northwards. In Oregon, the populations seem not to be self-sustaining and recruitment is largely from larvae originating in California. There is an established population of sand crabs on the Twin Harbors Peninsula of Washington state. On any particular beach, the distribution of sand crabs from one part to another can vary greatly for reasons not properly understood. Females tend to be found far down the beach, whereas males and immature crabs are found at higher levels. Biology Underside of female sand crab with eggs The sand crab always moves backwards when burrowing or crawling. It can also swim (backwards) and tread water using its back legs. It is a suspension feeder. It burrows backwards into the sand and faces the sea. As each wave retreats, it extends its antennae and catches floating organisms. It then retracts the antennae and scrapes the particles into its mouth. It can do this several times per wave. When it becomes uncovered by water, it coils its antennae and burrows backwards deeper into the sand. The diet is plankton, mostly consisting of dinoflagellates. The sand crab mates in spring and summer. The female lays batches of up to 45,000 eggs each month and carries them about beneath her abdomen tucked under her telson. The eggs hatch in about four weeks. The larvae have five planktonic zoeal stages and a final megalopal stage. The zoeal stages last up to 130 days. The megalopae settle out onto sandy beaches where they moult and develop into juveniles, which mature into adults within a few weeks. The long planktonic stage means that the larvae can become widely dispersed and colonize new areas. The adults reproduce in both their first and second summers and most die in the autumn of their second year. Ecology Sand crab burrowing back into the sand The sand crab lives under the surface of the sand, moving up and down the beach according to the state of the tide. As each wave advances and retreats, the crab comes to the surface and extends its antennae to feed. This makes it vulnerable to predatory birds such as the sanderling. These birds actively patrol the part of the beach washed by incoming waves, probing the softened sand with their bills. The sand crab retreats under the sand surface as each wave goes out, maximizing its chance of being out of reach of the bird's beak. The bird maximizes its chance of feeding on sand crabs by scurrying at the edge of the surf. Other birds that eat sand crabs include willets, godwits, surf scoters, blackbellied plovers, and curlews. The sea otter also consumes them. The crabs are hosts to the intermediate stages of various parasitic worms. These are passed on to predators when the predators eat the crabs, and if enough worms are ingested, they have been known to kill the predator. The barred surfperch (Amphistichus argenteus), found off the coast of California, consumes a large number of sand crabs. Surf fishermen use the crabs for bait and commercial bait fisheries extract them from the beach. The sand crabs with soft shells that have just moulted are kept for bait, while the hard-shelled crabs are thrown back into the sea. The sand crab has been evaluated as an indicator species for monitoring the level of domoic acid-synthesizing diatoms (Pseudo-nitzschia spp.) which sometimes cause toxic blooms off the coast of California.

At the north end of the Grand Parade is the Halifax City Hall, the seat of municipal government in Nova Scotia's Halifax Regional Municipality. At the south end is St. Paul's Church. In the middle of Grand Parade is the cenotaph built originally to commemorate the soldiers who served in World War I. Centrally located in Downtown Halifax, the square remains an important civic space used for numerous events including musical performances, political demonstrations, the annual New Year's Eve celebrations, Remembrance Day ceremonies, and Christmas tree lighting. History Halifax town plan with Grand Parade at centre  18th century The first contingent of British settlers in Halifax arrived in June 1749 and completed 300 houses by October 1749. Lieutenant John Brewse, a military engineer, sited the town within a defensive perimeter while Charles Morris, appointed Chief Surveyor on 25 September 1749, worked on the town layout and probably conducted the actual surveying. Moses Harris, a settler skilled in draughting, published the town plan for Halifax in 1749. It comprised an urban grid made up of oblong, rectangular city blocks with the Grand Parade at the centre of the town. The plan stipulated a church at one end of the square (opened 1750), and a courthouse and prison at the northern end. However, the north end remained vacant. Shortly after arriving in Halifax, Governor Cornwallis ordered framing from Boston for the construction of a church. The cornerstone for the church was laid on 13 June 1750. It was named St. Paul's in 1759 when a parish of that name was established. The building was modeled off Marybone Chapel in London. In 1794 Prince Edward arrived in Halifax to command the military in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. He set about improving the military facilities around the city, and had the Grand Parade leveled to improve its usefulness. As Barrington Street slopes down toward the north of Grand Parade, a retaining wall was built here to keep the square level. The retaining wall is tall enough to accommodate inhabitable space underneath the square, with frontage on Barrington. This space originally accommodated ice houses for Mrs. Jane Donaldson, a Granville Street merchant. 19th century Dalhousie Square. A winter scene depicting men and women in their sleighs in front of Dalhousie College, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1851. The original building of Dalhousie College (now Dalhousie University) opened at the north end of the Grand Parade in 1821. It was a Georgian four storey building separated from the square by a dry moat to allow light to the lower floors. As the 19th century progressed the Grand Parade deteriorated. Dalhousie claimed to lack the funds to upkeep the space while the city claimed it could not take responsibility for the square without undisputed ownership of it. Meanwhile, city offices and council chambers were located at premises on Water Street described at the time as \\"a trifle porous\\", \\"disreputable looking\\", and \\"a dirty hole\\". In 1872 the council asked E.H. Keating, the city engineer, to investigate ways to improve the Grand Parade. Keating suggested building a new city hall at the south end of the site. Public opinion preferred the Dalhousie site, at the north end of the square. In the end, Dalhousie agreed to relocated to the city's South End and a decision was made to build a \\"respectable building\\" on the site of the college. At this time Mayor James MacIntosh suggested renaming the square after Queen Victoria as the name Grand Parade bore connotations to a \\"condition of decay\\". This was not pursued. An impressive new edifice was designed by Edward Elliot. Demolition of the old college began in 1886. The cornerstone of the new city hall was laid in 1888. Following the completion of the building, Keating completely redesigned the layout of the square to more suitably reflect its new civic role. He built a circular carriage drive that began at Barrington Street and looped in front of City Hall. The retaining wall on Barrington was rebuilt at this time. 20th century Keating's plan also specified a circular fountain that was not built until 1905. It was removed to make way for the Cenotaph, officially unveiled on July 1, 1929 by Sir Robert Borden. The Cenotaph, honouring Canada's war dead, was designed by Scottish sculptor J. Massey Rhind. Grand Parade flagpole being transported through Digby in 1947 In 1907 the retaining wall on Barrington Street was augmented to include a stable. There were also plans to build public toilets south of the stable but these were not proceeded with. Later this undercroft space became a police patrol station that operated until 1952. This space is currently walled off and unused. A new flagpole was installed in preparation for the city's bicentennial commemoration in 1949. The long Douglas fir log was transported from British Columbia by the Canadian Pacific Railway to the Bay of Fundy, where it was put aboard a scow and sailed to Digby. It was floated to shore and loaded onto three CPR flatcars, arriving in Halifax on August 4, 1947. The new flagpole was erected by the Royal Canadian Engineers and officially unveiled in September 1947 by Mayor A.E. Ahern and railway officials. There was once a short street called St. Paul's Hill that ran directly in front of St. Paul's Church and connected Barrington and Argyle Streets. It was created at the behest of St. Paul's during the renovations to the square after Prince Edward's 1794 arrival. The civic address of the church was 1 St. Paul's Hill. The street was served by a bus in the 20th century. It was closed in 1977-1978 and the land incorporated into the Grand Parade. The parade was improved in 1995 for the 21st G7 summit. Three functional areas were designated to accommodate different needs and uses: St. Paul's Plaza, the Civic Plaza in the centre, and the City Hall Plaza in front of City Hall. The pedestrian entrance to the City Hall Plaza from Argyle Street was added in 1999. Recent developments For several decades, regional councillors were allowed to park their cars in the Grand Parade. This was controversial; a 1989 report stated that \\"a consensus of opinion indicates that all parking in the Grand Parade should be eliminated.\\" The Coast argued for parking to be removed, derisively labeling the status quo as the \\"Grand Parkade\\". On May 20, 2003 councillors Sheila Fougere and Dawn Sloane brought forward a motion to seek alternative parking elsewhere so the space could be opened for public use, but this was defeated. On December 14, 2004 council voted against moving councillor parking to the Birk's lot. The matter came up again on January 18, 2005 on a motion to reconsider and the proposal was again voted down. Councillor Steve Streatch was one of the most steadfast opponents of moving car parking to the vacant Birk's site, across the street from city hall, because he favoured the convenience of not having to walk the short distance. Council eventually voted to relocate the councillor parking lot from September 1, 2007 (Streatch successfully argued to delay the deadline from the April 1 cutoff originally proposed). On October 17, 2010 a concrete arch was unveiled as a memorial to peace officers killed in the line of duty. It is inscribed with the names of 21 fallen Nova Scotia peace officers. Events The Grand Parade is home to a variety of events year-round. Each November 11 the Cenotaph is home to the official Remembrance Day commemoration ceremony. There are celebrations on other holidays including Canada Day, and an annual concert and countdown on New Year's Eve. The municipality also allows community groups to hire the square for special events, although there are special rules governing the use of the Grand Parade, including restrictions on advertising and the clause that events must remain 20 feet away from the Cenotaph. Visiting dignitaries and members of the royal family often tour the square and greet the public there. For example, the Queen visited the square on a 10-day tour of Canada in 1994, where she reviewed a guard of honour and laid a wreath at the cenotaph. The Grand Parade is also a popular site for political demonstrations, and as a starting or ending point for protest marches.

Halifax City Hall The Halifax City Hall is located on the original site of Dalhousie University, built 1821. The university building was demolished to make way for the new structure and timbers from the old academic building were reportedly incorporated into the municipal building, the Halifax City Hall. It was designed by architect Edward Elliot and constructed for the City of Halifax between 1887 and 1890; it is one of the oldest and largest public buildings in Nova Scotia and is a designated National Historic Site of Canada. The building is of cream and red sandstone, designed in an eclectic, monumental style. It features granite construction on the ground floor and in the tower. The seven storey tower has clock faces on the north and south sides. The northern face is fixed at four minutes past nine to commemorate the Halifax Explosion of 1917.  The Cenotaph  Britannia by renowned New York sculptor J. Massey Rhind, Cenotaph, Grand Parade, Halifax The Cenotaph in the middle of Grand Parade was dedicated on Dominion Day (July 1) 1929 by Former Prime Minister Robert Borden to commemorate those who died in World War I. The Bronze work on the cenotaph was modelled after Edwin Lutyens' famous Cenotaph in Whitehall, England, with a statue of Britannia by noted Scottish sculpture John Massey Rhind. The Cenotaph is constructed of local Tangier granite. The sculpture depicts victorious but grieving Britannia representing Nova Scotian motherhood. There are also three ceremonial wreaths, the names of First and Second World War Battles honours, a dedication, the coat of arms of both Nova Scotia and Canada as well as a Victory Cross. During a 2009 maintenance inspection structural problems were discovered with the monument. It was completely dismantled and rebuilt in time for the Remembrance Day ceremony that year.  St. Paul's Church  St. Paul's Church is the first Protestant Church built in Canada and the oldest building in Halifax. Founded in 1749, the first service held on 2 September 1750. It is the oldest still-standing Anglican church in Canada. It is based on the ground plan of the Gibbs church of St. Peter's, Vere Street in London, with later additions such as a larger tower. For many decades it was one of the only places of worship in Halifax, and other denominations would thus hold services in the building. During the Halifax Explosion of 1917, a piece of wooden window frame from another building was lodged into the wall of St. Paul's Church, where it remains today.

This was the anchor that started the museum. Subsequent exhibits were multidisciplinary, looking at the nexus between science and art. The largest sources of funding have been from contracts and grants from NIST, the U.S. Dept of Ed., and the National Science Foundation. The first version of WebExhibits in 1999 included a directory of cultural and scientific offerings at other sites. At the time, the major search engines were doing a poor job of directing web users to exhibits at Library of Congress, PBS, Discovery Channel and other sites.\\"Online launches\\" Min's New Media Report.\\" 9.02.99.http://www- sul.stanford.edu/depts/swain/nsflibnews/11feb00.htmlNet Talk Live! feature in show #170 on 23-Nov-1999. This was a syndicated radio show broadcast on television via ABC, CBS, NBC, WB, UPN, Fox and several independents. This directory was discontinued in 2003 once search engines became powerful; and it was no longer feasible to include all major online exhibits. The museum is widely cited in academic, student, professional, and general writing. WebExhibits was the first testbed of interactive concept maps using the SpicyNodes presentation approach.  Research  IDEA has published research on exhibit design and usability, and advocated for the format as an effective approach to draw in visitors to complex, multidisciplinary topics.Bogomazova, T, and Malevanov, C. \\"On Representation of a Highlight on the Web: The Amber Room as a Cultural Phenomenon in Progress\\".
