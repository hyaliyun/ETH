The flag is identical to the flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. During the Korenizatsiya period, most of the autonomous republics of the USSR, including Yakut ASSR, were encouraged to create a flag to suit their national tradition. Yakutia itself adopted a flag which depicted Aurora on its canton during this period. After 1937, the korenizatsiya policies were reversed. A new flag of the Yakut ASSR, which is similar to the flag of the Russian SFSR was adopted. The flag of Yakut ASSR is now a red flag with the inscriptions of the name of the republic.  History  The first constitution of the Yakut ASSR was adopted by the 2nd session of the Central Executive Committee of the Yakut ASSR, on the third convocation, on 23 March 1925. The first constitution did not mentioned any design of flag.  First version  The first flag of the Yakut ASSR was described in the 1926 Constitution of the Yakut ASSR, which was approved on the 4th All-Yakutsk Congress of Soviets on 13 February 1926, and was introduced by resolution of the 2nd session of the Yakut Central Executive Committee on the 4th convocation of September 17, 1926. The design of the flag was contained in the Article 119 of the constitution :  Second version  The flag of the Yakut ASSR was described in the 1937 Constitution of the Yakut ASSR, which was adopted by the Central Executive Committee of the Yakut ASSR on 9 March 1937, at the 9th Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of the Yakut ASSR. The flag is described in Article 109 of the constitution :  Third version  On March 23, 1939, a new alphabet for the Yakut language was approved by a decree of the People's Commissar of Education of the Soviet Union. The inscription on the flag was changed into the new Cyrilic alphabet, and the inscription \\"АССР\\" was written once, due to both language having the same abbreviation.  Fourth version  On June 12, 1954, by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Yakut ASSR \\"On the State Flag of the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\\", a new state flag of the Yakut ASSR was adopted, which was approved by the Law of the Yakut ASSR of June 23, 1954. The law also amended Article 110 of the Constitution of the Yakut ASSR: On January 20, 1956, the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Yakut ASSR approved the Regulations on the State Flag of the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The regulation established the exact proportions and design of the flag. On February 28, 1956, the Council of Ministers of the Yakut ASSR issued an instruction for the application of the Regulations on the State Flag of the Yakut ASSR.  Fifth version  A new constitution of the Yakut ASSR was adopted by the 8th extraordinary session of the Supreme Council of the Yakut ASSR on May 31, 1978. A new design of the flag was described in the constitution, of which the inscription on the flag was written in two lines, in Russian and Yakut. The article 158 of the constitution contains the design of the flag: On October 27, 1978, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Yakut ASSR approved the new flag. On October 26, 1979, by the decision of the Council of Ministers of Yakut ASSR No. 410, minor amendments were made to the instruction for the application of the Regulations on the State Flag of the Yakut ASSR.

The carol was written as \\"a carol for three voices\\".  Carol  During Medieval times, carols had started to develop a separate style from ordinary Christian hymns though not necessarily performed just at Christmas. King Henry VIII was a Renaissance monarch who was educated in music and several languages. The King wrote \\"Green Groweth the Holly\\" as his own take on the developing Christmas carol style. It is not known exactly when King Henry wrote the carol. In addition to writing the words, the King also composed the music for the carol. In 1522 the carol was published in \\"The Henry VIII Book\\" (manuscript: Add MS 31922). Despite the initial popularity during King Henry's reign, when it had been described as \\"this little piece by Henry VIII that is one of the half dozen that mark him as the first lyricist of his age\\", the carol afterwards fell into disfavour and the British Library described it as a \\"failed classic\\". The King may have written it as an adaption of the English folk carol \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\", but it has been argued that \\"Green Groweth the Holly\\" preceded that more famous carol.  Poem  \\"Green Groweth the Holly\\" has also been adapted into a poem. The poem version is more secular and removes references to God in it, with it being re-imagined as a love poem to the unchanging nature of the holly during the winter's weather and the faithfulness of the lover.

On January 31, 2001 Logan Marr was found dead in Schofield's house. Schofield initially stated that Marr died of trauma in an accident, but authorities found that she had been duct-taped and died of suffocation.

History Pfizer in Nigeria Pfizer began operations in Nigeria in 1957 importing its branded products such as Terramycin into the country. In 1962, it opened a factory at Aba, the first pharmaceutical factory in British West Africa. The Civil war in Nigeria affected production at Pfizer's plant at Aba which caused the firm to commit new investment to build a new plant at Oregun, Lagos. The new factory expanded Pfizer's product offerings to include inject-able drugs. In the 1990s, the firm faced increased competition from imported generic products from Asia and those manufactured within the country. While, the firm generated majority of its sales through relationships with pharmacists and hospitals, the rise in OTC consumption and importation of generics shifted the firm's focus away from business to business sales of prescription drugs and towards OTCs. The firm increased production of OTC drugs and sales to drug stores and other over the counter retailers. Neimeth In 1997, the parent company's global re-positioning away from OTC drugs led to a management buyout of majority shares. The new firm was named Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals, in honor a Pfizer executive who provided support to the Nigerian operation.

On September 1, 2016, the Ministry of Transport and Communications established the company [Reiseplan og billett], which was integrated into Entur AS during the first tertiary 2017. During 2017, it is also planned that the company Interoperabilitetstjenester will be merged with Entur and that some of the tasks undertaken by Norsk Reiseinformasjon (NRI) will be taken over. Entur has developed a travel planner for public transport throughout Norway, which in the long term will also give the opportunity to buy tickets directly. It also contains travel information from Avinor.

Formed in 2006, they claim to be the hardest working comedy band in the UK, having played over 1000 shows throughout the UK. They are best known on the UK's festival scene, having played at major festivals including Glastonbury Festival, Cambridge Folk Festival, Beautiful Days, Bearded Theory, Rebellion Festival, Wychwood Festival, Kate Rusby's Underneath The Stars Festival, Towersey Festival, Wickham Festival and to an audience of 20,000 at Fairport's Cropredy Convention in August 2018, for their 900th show. Playing mainly acoustic folk instruments, they take popular songs and replace the lyrics with their own comedy reworkings, often on themes completely unrelated to the original song. They have independently released ten studio albums (containing over 110 song parodies in total), and a large number of live albums. Presenting themselves as the long-lost children of Irish entertainer Val Doonican, and claiming to be \\"on a mission to keep their late, great spiritual father's legacy alive\\", the various members of the band have adopted the singer's surname for their shows, and wear brightly coloured hand-knitted tank-tops in tribute to Doonican's traditional knitwear. History The band started out as an acoustic harmony duo consisting of Scott Doonican (vocals, acoustic guitar/banjo/mandolin/kazoo) and Danny Doonican (vocals, acoustic guitar), mainly covering quirky song choices by such disparate acts as Sparks, Queen, Judas Priest and Vera Lynn on folk instruments with Everly Brothers-styled harmonies. The band's name and subsequent image was the idea of Scott's partner and long-standing co-lyricist Amanda White, inspired after they both saw a billboard poster for a gig by the San Diego band Bastard Sons of Johnny Cash, whilst on a weekend break to Dublin. They played their first show at Thawleys Pub in Wombwell, Barnsley on Saturday 17 June 2006. The pub is now a local convenience store. After their debut show, which was originally intended to be a one-off appearance, they decided to continue, and soon expanded to a three piece with the addition of Alan Doonican #1 on piano accordion, later self-releasing two albums of folky cover versions of classic rock songs (For Those About To Rock, Gently) and 1980s Number Ones (Back To The Day Job) on their independent Moon-On-A-Stick Records label, on which they continue to release albums to this day. From 2008, the original line-up began to change direction to become a comedy/parody band by replacing the lyrics of popular songs with comedic alternatives of their own and performing in their native Yorkshire accent and dialect, the first being \\"Tarnlife\\", a re-working of Blur's \\"Parklife\\" with lyrics about the inhabitants of their home town of Barnsley. The spoken parts of the song, originally performed by Phil Daniels, were performed in 2008 by Scott’s late father-in-law, Michael White, under the moniker of 'Barnsley Mick'. The band often make reference to the word 'Tarn' in their lyrics and in titles of songs and albums, which isn't a reference to mountain lakes formed by glaciation, but a local pronunciation of 'town'. As a local slang word, it is, however, given a capital letter, because it is often used as a proper noun by many local inhabitants, who affectionately call Barnsley 'Tarn'. The song Tarnlife was later added to Cpl Kipper’s Barnsley Trades Club Turn, their first full album as a comedy band, released in 2010. Its cover artwork mirrored that of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles, with 56 Barnsley celebrities gracing its front cover. The album was also notable for featuring the first of the band's several collaborations with guitarist Graham Oliver, founding member of heavy metal band Saxon. Shortly after its release, Danny Doonican left the band, leaving Scott to complete the recording of 2011's The Dark Side Of The Tarn largely on his own. Unlike, Cpl. Kipper (which was a concept album of songs with links to their hometown of Barnsley) , from their second album onwards, the focus of the band's songwriting became more universal. Due to the significant number of line-up changes between 2010 and 2014, in 2017 Scott Doonican created a retrospective family tree for the band’s website, showing the many incarnations of the band, which itself is a parody in the style of Pete Frame’s Rock Family Trees. Each band member, past and present also has their own stage persona and their own individual elaborate backstory. Danny Doonican was succeeded by Andy Doonican in 2011, and the line-up of Scott, Alan #1 and Andy recorded three further albums of parody songs between 2012 and 2014 ('EY UP! LET'S GO!, Sat'day Neet Fever and Talk Of The Tarn). In April 2014, in a period of less than 24 hours, the band saw three new Doonican brothers deputising at shows in North Yorkshire, for the increasingly absent Andy Doonican, due to work and family commitments. Scott Doonican refers to this period of change in his book, Songs In The Key of Tarn as the band's 'Lost Weekend'. At an indoor festival at Harefield Hall, Pateley Bridge, on 19 April, Delmar Doonican joined Scott and Alan #1, on 5-string banjo, and the following afternoon, Duck Doonican (played by Simon Friend from Levellers) joined them on mandolin. Swedish-born Björn Doonicansson then joined Scott and Alan #1 later on the evening of 20 April 2014, originally as a part-time member on tenor banjo. Within two months he joined as a full-time member, expanding his duties to mandolin, fiddle and bouzouki too, and the band expanded to a somewhat flexible three or four-piece line-up. Alan Doonican #1 unexpectedly left the band in September 2014, after the first night of a UK tour. This prompted Scott Doonican to have to place an advert on Facebook for a new accordionist, which read, \\"We are looking for someone that can play the accordion well, that is a nice bloke, with a GSOH, preferably called Alan\\". The call was answered within 36 hours, by Alan Doonican #2, whom, according to the band's website in an elaborate back-story, was Alan Doonican #1's twin brother from the second of a pair of IVF petri dishes. It goes on to claim that Alan Doonican #2's petri dish had been frozen for ten years, \\"whilst any underlying defects were ironed out\\". Since late 2014, the core trio has been stable, with a line-up of Scott Doonican (vocals, guitar, synthesiser ukulele, banjulele, kazoo) being joined by Björn Doonicansson (violin, banjo, mandolin, bouzouki, vocals) and Alan Doonican #2 (piano accordion, keyboards, keytar, ukulele, vocals). From October 2014, the core trio played most shows, however, during the ensuing two year period, Andy Doonican continued to play much more sporadic shows with the band as an expanded four-piece (on 12-string guitar and bass), until retiring in June 2016, after the band's 10th birthday show. During this period, the band recorded The Tarn Machine (2015) and T'South 0 – Tarn 4 (2016) as a four piece, while 2017's 'Ave It : Bold As Brass was recorded by the current trio of Scott, Björn and Alan #2. The band refer to this consecutive trio of studio albums on their website as their Tarnetto Trilogy, itself a parody of the 'Cornetto Trilogy', likening them to the trilogy of films created by Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright, in which each have their own significant colours (red, blue and green) and individual characteristics, but contain common themes throughout. The cover of The Tarn Machine mirrors the blood red colour of Shaun Of The Dead, the cover of T'South 0 - Tarn 4 mirrors the alien green colour of The World's End, and the cover of 'Ave It : Bold As Brass mirrors the policeman blue colour of Hot Fuzz. In early 2018, the band re-recorded a collection of 21 of their most- loved songs for their ninth studio album, a ten-year retrospective of their comedy years, The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican/2008–2018. The album was independently crowdfunded and released on CD, double disc coloured vinyl and limited edition cassette. In December 2018, the band released two charity Christmas singles via iTunes. The first single was their final annual collaboration with Maartin Allcock, who had died four months before, only weeks after performing with the band at Fairport's Cropredy Convention. The track, a prog-rock/traditional folk crossover rendition of Greg Lake's I Believe In Father Christmas, entered the iTunes chart, peaking at Number 33, and gaining a Number 80 position on the UK Official Charts for both downloads and sales on 21 December 2018. The second single, The Gasman Cometh, entered the iTunes chart reaching Number 55, and the iTunes comedy chart at Number 2. In the same week The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican/2008–2018 reached Number 2 in the iTunes comedy chart. On 26 January 2019, spurred on by BBC Radio 6 ignoring an unprecedented barrage of fan requests for the song How Deep Is Your Glove? on social media, during a feature on Stuart Maconie's show called 'Sunday Glove Songs', the band defiantly released the track as a charity single for Prostate Cancer UK, and it entered the UK iTunes Comedy chart at Number 1. Their tenth studio album, entitled Place Of Spades was crowdfunded in early 2019, and all pre-orders, came with a packet of 'Doonicans Magic Seeds', which at the time of their arrival at fans' homes, were of an unknown variety. In late April, fans were encouraged, on social media, to post photos of their plants, as they grew. Several months later, on 20 September, Scott Doonican finally admitted via the band's Facebook group, that they were actually cleome seeds, chosen because, when they grow, the leaves look remarkably similar to that of the cannabis plant. Scott, coming clean in his status post, stated, \\"I thought it would be a proper good laugh to try and get so many people to attempt to grow them, not knowing what they were growing. It worked, as over the past six months, I have had countless private messages from slightly worried fans (one of which lives next door to their local police station!)\\". The Place Of Spades album was released and launched on Sunday 30 June 2019 at Glastonbury Festival when the band played the Avalon Stage. A Glastonbury live album, Avalon Calling was recorded during the show, and was given a strictly limited edition CD release, which, on its announcement, sold out overnight, before being made available via digital download only. In June 2019, Scott Doonican announced via social media and the band's website that he was setting up a crowdfunding project for a special release under the title of 'Leap of Faith'. Fans were told that for taking a 'leap of faith' and by pledging just ten pounds, they would definitely get a CD album on time for Christmas 2019, but that this would be expanded to a second album for the same price, if enough people backed the project. By August, it was announced that then unnamed CDs would be expanded to a triple disc release containing 44-tracks. When posted out to pledgers in December 2019, it was revealed that the three albums were actually re-recorded and re-mastered versions of the 'Three Flavours Tarnetto Trilogy' (The Tarn Machine, T'South 0 - Tarn 4, 'Ave It : Bold As Brass) created by the 2014-present trio line-up of Scott, Björn and Alan #2, and produced by Joel Howe, who had mixed and mastered The Bar- Steward Sons of Val Doonican/2008-2018 and Place Of Spades. On its release, Scott claimed on social media that the aim of the project was to demonstrate that \\"when a lot of people work collectively together, paying a little bit of money into the pot each, much bigger and better things can be achieved. I'm hoping that people can see now from my small-scale 'experiment', that socialism can work in the real world\\". The band hosted their own music and comedy festival at The Old School House Venue in Barnsley in October 2019. The aptly titled Doonifest sold out over a year in advance, with a line-up including Oliver/Dawson Saxon, Hobo Jones & The Junkyard Dogs, The Sweetchunks Band and many other comedy and musical acts from the UK's festival circuit. It was the venue's fastest sell-out, with all tickets going within 56 seconds, before a single act was announced. The festival also saw, original founding member, Danny Doonican, returning for one final show, as the original duo of Scott and Danny opened the festival with a set composed of early Doonicans cover versions and songs from the band's first album. On 25 October 2019, the band played their 1000th show at the Palace Theatre in Redditch. The show was recorded for a DVD and CD live album. In January 2020, the band's 10th studio album, Place Of Spades was the winner of a 'Jezzie Award' from Radio Bicester's 'Tarka Blowpig Music Show' after coming in at Number 1 and receiving the accolade of 'Studio Album of the Year - 2019', in a chart that featured The Who, Stormzy, Bruce Springsteen and Willie Nelson. Later in the same month, it was announced that the band would be supporting Levellers for their 2020 tour dates at Sheffield Leadmill, Holmfirth Picturedrome, Lancaster Town Hall and Nottingham Rock City. These shows were postponed until 2021, due to a global pandemic of Coronavirus. This also caused the band to have to postpone their post-March 2020 tour dates, and as a result, Scott Doonican performed a series of weekly online shows, streamed on YouTube, under the title Scott Doonican's BIG NEET IN. The shows featured Scott performing live from home interspersed with some previously recorded video footage of the full band, new music videos and collaborations between Scott and special guests, including Björn Doonicansson, Kathryn Roberts and Eliza Carthy. The show also featured regular appearances from several puppet characters, voiced by Scott Doonican's partner Amanda White including Morris the alien quizmaster and Gloria McGlumpher the roving reporter. Although the band were announced to be playing at Bearded Theory, Fairport's Cropredy Convention , Beautiful Days Festival, Rebellion Punk Festival, Watchet Festival and several others in 2020, due to the worldwide pandemic, the festivals were postponed to 2021. On 1 May 2020, Scott Doonican announced via social media and a YouTube video promo, that the band would be hoping to release their 11th studio album, Roughe & Lief on 1 May 2021. The artwork was revealed too, a pastiche of Fairport Convention's' 1969 classic album Leige & Lief, which Scott revealed had been approved by the remaining members of the Fairport Convention line-up that played on the original album. Former Fairport Convention drummer Dave Mattacks and current bassist Dave Pegg both contributed parts to the opening track of the album. The title of the original album Leige & Lief means 'Loyal & Ready' in Middle English. Roughe & Lief is Middle English for 'Rough & Ready'. Also during the coronavirus lockdown, Scott Doonican made a guest appearance on a version of Fairport Convention's Meet On The Ledge, featuring the members of Fairport Convention, Clannad, Turin Brakes, Ralph McTell, Martyn Joseph and many more. The song was released as a charity single to raise money for people in the music industry affected by the pandemic. In December 2019, the band announced via their website, a second 'Leap Of Faith' crowdfunding project, which eventually saw them release a 10th Anniversary version of their Cpl. Kipper's Barnsley Trades Club Turn album, in October 2020. The album, re-recorded by Scott Doonican, Björn Doonicansson and Alan Doonican, and released in October 2020, also featured a host of special guests including Eliza Carthy, Dave Burland, Kate Rusby, Mike Harding, Graham Oliver, Hugh Whitaker, Kathryn Roberts, Ian McMillan, Barnsley blues-folk troubadour, Richard Kitson, and founder member Danny Doonican amongst others. The new version of the 'Barnsley Concept Album' was accompanied by a 120 page book written by Scott Doonican, entitled The Essential Listener's Guide To Cpl. Kipper's Barnsley Trades Club Turn, which contained the lyrics to the songs, and told the stories behind them and of the album's recording process. Influences Scott Doonican, in an interview with Farmer Phil's Festival in 2016, named his musical comedy influences as Mike Harding, Jasper Carrott and Richard Digance. On the band’s website, Scott also claims to have formed the band, \\"to fuse the theatrical stage antics of Freddie Mercury with the comedy of Mike Harding, in order to form the world's greatest folk-band in knitwear\\". From January to April 2015, the band released a series of Doonican Desert Island Discs Podcasts via Bandcamp, where each month, different members were interviewed by Scott Doonican's partner Amanda White (who performed in a mock Scottish accent to emulate Kirsty Young who was the presenter of the real Desert Island Discs at that time). The band members had to choose their favourite eight songs, a book and a luxury item. Scott Doonican's selections included Eliza Carthy, Mike Harding, Rory Gallagher, Half Man Half Biscuit and Queen. Björn Doonicansson's selections included AC/DC, The Dubliners and Swedish rock band Europe. Alan Doonican's selections included American Zydeco accordion player Clifton Chenier, Deep Purple and Fairport Convention. Notably, all three of the band members each chose a different Levellers song. Live shows The band have played over 1000 shows to date, and proclaim on their website that they are \\"The hardest-working comedy band in the UK\\". The band's present day live shows range from full band shows, to duo shows by Scott & Björn, to solo acoustic shows by Scott. The band are regulars on the UK festival scene, and have also supported a number of diverse acts including Levellers, Chas & Dave, Roy Wood, John Otway, Fairport Convention, Eliza Carthy, Tony Christie and The Darkness. Shows are often enhanced by audience participation and various set-pieces, such as the addition of occasional guest appearances from 6 ft 9in tall Tom Large dressed as The Devil for their version of \\"The Devil Went Darn To Barnsley\\" (where The Devil dares Björn to beat his fiddle playing, the forfeit being Björn's soul) and Scott crowd surfing to the bar and back to get and bring back a pint of beer; at several large festival shows, including Fairport's Cropredy Convention, Glastonbury Festival, Beautiful Days and Bearded Theory, Scott has used a rubber dinghy for this part of the show. The band regularly invite other musicians to play with them. At Cropredy Festival 2018 Fairport Convention's Maartin Allcock, complete with Doonican-style tank-top, joined them for the finale, at Beautiful Days 2017 they were joined by Eliza Carthy, and at Whitwell Festival of Music in 2015, they were joined by Graham Oliver guitarist and founding member of Yorkshire heavy metal band Saxon. Scott also joined Oliver/Dawson Saxon on stage that same evening, brandishing a banjulele for Saxon song Wheels Of Steel (which the Doonicans covered as a hidden track on their 2017 album, 'Ave It : Bold As Brass), and again at the band's own 'Doonifest' in October 2019. In February 2019, the band announced the date for their 1000th show, to take place at the Palace Theatre in Redditch, Worcestershire on 25 October 2019. The show, which is currently the band's biggest selling ticketed headline show to date, sold out on Sun 22 September. The band later announced and successfully crowdfunded a project to film and record a live DVD and double album on the night of the show. In August 2019, the band were invited to host their first 'Sunday Service' show at The Big Top stage at Beautiful Days, where the band performed a full set of their comedy parodies with guest collaborations from other acts on the festival circuit, including fellow Barnsley folk musician Kathryn Roberts who performed The Lady In Greggs as a piano duet. Kathryn duetted with Scott during his 15th online 'BIG NEET IN' show, which was broadcast on YouTube during the worldwide coronavirus pandemic of 2020. They performed a parody of the Joe Cocker & Jennifer Warnes song, Up Where We Belong about Barnsley sculptor, Graham Ibbeson's statue located in Barnsley, of the cricketing umpire Dickie Bird. The following week, folk singer Eliza Carthy duetted with Scott on the song Prince Ali from the Disney animated movie Aladdin, whilst she was dressed as the Genie from the movie. Reception Jeff Robson, reviewing their 11 August 2018 show at Fairport's Cropredy Convention for the Independent, said \\"... The Bar Steward Sons of Val Doonican were the highlights of a rainy Saturday afternoon, swearily lampooning a genre that sometimes takes itself too seriously.\\", whilst another review of the same show said \\"... complete with fluorescent tank tops and dodgy wigs [they] were an absolute highlight.\\" Talking about the same appearance in a 4 December interview with Radio Bicester on the Tarka Blowpig Show, Fairport Convention's Dave Pegg, said that the band were \\"the best... the highlight of the weekend\\". Reviewing the band's support act to the Levellers at Leamington Assembly in 2015, What's On West Midlands said \\"the Barnsley Boys left the audience in stitches with their exquisitely crafted parodies ... there was nevertheless some surprisingly excellent musicianship.\\" John Atkin, reviewing 'Ave It: Bold As Brass in RnR Magazine, said \\"Bristles with proper belly-laugh moments... a LOL-a-minute through a variety of perfect pastiches. If there is any justice, the Doonicans deserve to be all over your Saturday night telly.\\" In a review of Bearded Theory Festival 2016, UK Festival Guides said \\"I couldn’t fail to mention a gig by The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican that left even them speechless at the sheer size, volume and enthusiasm of the audience, the impact these boys have wherever they go is utterly phenomenal\\", whilst at the same festival two years later, the reviewer noted \\"Rapidly becoming the must-have, must-see festival band, the Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican played to an over-capacity Woodland Stage arena as hundreds queued for a chance at catching their much-anticipated antics\\". A review of a smaller venue show said \\"They simply take all the songs you cannot get out of your head – everything from The Police to Kings of Leon – and twist the lyrics beyond recognition while wearing gloriously outrageous multi- coloured tank tops.\\" In July 2017, comedian Jason Manford described their performance at Underneath The Stars Festival as \\"great fun\\" on his Twitter account, whilst eFestivals described their performance at Off The Tracks festival the same year with \\"Like a modern-day version of the Barron Knights, they take popular songs, amend the words and twist them into hilarious folk parodies.\\" In the foreword of Scott Doonican’s book of the band’s lyrics Songs In The Key Of Tarn, folk musician Eliza Carthy describes the band as \\"a ridiculous family of genius, hilarious, irresistible music makers, currently crowd surfing to the bar all over the great county of Yorkshire and beyond, into the venues and music festivals of the UK\\". Folk musician and comedian Mike Harding said on his \\"Folk Show\\" podcast #177 in 2016 that \\"The Bar- Steward Sons of Val Doonican are very, very funny... one of the hardest working bands on the planet\\". In the broadcast of his 273rd Folk Show podcast in Sept 2019 he described the band as \\"some of the funniest men on the planet... I would call them parodists extraordinaire\\". On 12 April 2019, the Staffordshire Sentinel published a headline about the band's appearance at Leek Arts Festival, describing them to be \\"like The Barron Knights - on speed\\", going on to say \\"Their hilarious parodies of popular songs will leave you crying tears of laughter\\". Mike Scialom, writing for the Cambridge Independent, said that the band's headline set at Cambridge Folk Festival's Club Stage was a \\"another festival highlight\\". It went on to say that the \\"irreverent, madcap trio, insisting they were quite posh really, included defence of their home town, Barnsley: 'In most cities people smoke spice, but in Barnsley everyone smokes basil... they buy the Radio Times when it's not even Christmas, that's how posh it is'.\\" During their appearance at Kate Rusby's Underneath The Stars Festival in August 2019, in a review by Louder Than War journalist Gareth Allen wrote, \\"The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican’s reputation preceded them and they didn’t disappoint, resplendent in the most garish of tank tops imaginable... without doubt these guys can really play. Led by the inimitable Scott Doonican, everyone is jumping, as metal-head culture joins folk and hip-hop in an intoxicating mix\\". The Yorkshire Evening Post described the band at the same show as \\"hilarious\\". RnR Magazine, reviewing Place Of Spades in September 2019, described the album as \\"the summit of musical comedy. Scott Doonican's attention to detail is what sets the Doonicans ahead of all the contenders in this genre. These are lovingly crafted pastiches with tonnes of subtle layers\\". They went on to say that it was \\"the strongest Doonicans album yet\\". During a Lives In Music interview with Robin Valk, in March 2020, Fairport Convention bassist Dave Pegg said, \\"one band I really love, are a bit of a comedy act, and an act that you will wanna go and see over and over again, called The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican... a great name, but absolutely hilarious.\\" On 6 July 2020, via her Underneath The Stars Festival social media, folk singer Kate Rusby said, \\"The 8th wonder of the world is actually in Yorkshire... a wonderful Yorkshire genius collective known as The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican. To see them is to know true magnificence and we love em to bits!\\" Jarvis Cocker from Sheffield band, Pulp, has been widely quoted to have described the band as \\"The best thing to come out of Barnsley, since the A61 to Sheffield\\".  Notable instruments   Scott Doonican  Scott Doonican has been an official endorsee of Tanglewood Guitars since 2018, but has had a preference for them for live shows since the band's conception. According to their website his main live acoustic guitar, a \\"battered old 1995 Tanglewood TW55, dubbed 'The Workhorse' (is) believed to have done well over a thousand shows to date\\" (since this was written, the guitar definitely has). The guitar was bought in 1999 from Scott's uncle, former Showaddywaddy bassist, Billy Norman. Scott also plays a 'chess board synthesiser ukulele', custom-built by North Yorkshire luthier, Robert Hinchcliffe, during She's From Dodworth, and occasionally he plays a 1981 Suzuki Omnichord OM-27 during solo shows. He also sometimes plays an Ozark banjulele, a GDAD tuned Irish bouzouki, and the 'Kazoobie Wazoogle', an extra-loud kazoo with a bell-shaped horn on top and a trumpet-styled opening at the front. On studio albums since 2015, Scott has recorded his acoustic guitar parts using a Gibson J200 and since 2020 also uses a George Lowden O23C.  Björn Doonicansson  Björn Doonicansson plays a Gold Tone TS-250A Tenor Archtop Banjo (and a Deering Goodtime 2 Leader as his back-up tenor banjo), a Bridge Aquila violin made by Sleaford violin- maker, Paul Bridgewater, and an electric Fender MandoStrat mandolin.  Alan Doonican  Alan Doonican plays Gallini and Chanson accordions, a Roland V-Combo VR-09 keyboard (dubbed \\"Alan's Massive Throbbing Organ\\" on the side of his keyboard stand), a 1987 Yamaha SHS-10 keytar, and a ukulele of ill repute.  Discography  This is an abridged list of albums; the band have also released over 20 live shows on CD or in download format, via their own independent label, Moon-On-A-Stick Records. All of the artwork for the front covers of the band’s studio albums, and a significant number of their live albums are pastiches of classic album covers.

Kipper's Barnsley Trades Club Turn, containing the lyrics and stories behind the songs along with commentary on the recording process, written by Scott Doonican, with a foreword written by Ringo Starr MBE  Members  The band's current core trio of Scott, Björn and Alan #2 has been stable since 2014. A number of former members, occasional members and additional guests have also performed with the band over the years.  Current members  Scott Doonican Lead vocals, acoustic guitar, banjulele, electric synthesiser ukulele, Suzuki Omnichord OM-27, kazoo, dinghy (17 June 2006 – present) Scott has been the only constant member throughout the band's history. He has played at every single Bar-Steward Sons show, except show #513 at the Rescue Rooms in Nottingham on 18 October 2014. He has written or co-written the lyrics to over 100 of the band's parodies. Despite his best efforts he still doesn't have an Ivor Novello Award. Björn Doonicansson Mandolin, tenor banjo, violin, bouzouki, vocals (20 April 2014 – present) Hailing from a small goat-herding village close to Gothenburg, Sweden, Björn is the youngest member of the band's '2014–present' line-up. He played for the first time with the band at The Blues Bar in Harrogate at show #426 in April 2014, aged only 16 at the time. He is currently the third- longest serving member of the band (after Scott Doonican and Alan Doonican #1). Alan Doonican #2 Piano accordion, keyboards, keytar, ukulele, vocals, and according to a weekly Facebook phenomena is alleged to be the Eye Candy of the band (25 October 2014 – present) Alan played for the first time with the band at Harefield Hall in Pateley Bridge at show #514 on 25 October 2014, at Halloween-themed festival, 'Scarefest'. The festival appearance doubled-up as a 'live audition', after Alan Doonican #1 had quit the band unexpectedly the previous month. At first, the rest of the band couldn't spot him amongst the rest of the festival crowd, as everybody in attendance was in Halloween fancy dress. Since joining the band, Alan has written or co-written over ten of the band's best-known parodies, including The Ornithologist Waltz, Walking In Manpiss and Too Good To Be Jus. Also, since Tuesday 5 July 2016, Alan has been the subject of a weekly Tuesday 'pin-up' on the band's Facebook page under the hashtag of #EyeCandyTuesday. As a result, Eye-Candy Tuesday has become something of a tongue-in-cheek hit with fans of the band, and also sported an official charity cALANder in 2018, with proceeds going to Prostate Care UK. He is currently the fourth-longest serving member of the band.  Former members  * Danny Doonican – vocals, acoustic guitar (17 June 2006 – 17 March 2011) * Alan Doonican #1 – piano accordion (24 June 2006 – 4 October 2014) * Andy Doonican – 12-string acoustic guitar, bass guitar, ukulele (8 April 2011 – 17 June 2016) Occasional members, notable guests and collaborators * Maart Doonican (Maartin Allcock) – producer and multi- instrumentalist on several studio tracks including annual Christmas singles (2015-2017). Maartin was given Scott's EY UP! LET'S GO! tank-top and made an \\"honorary Doonican\\" for his only live performance with the band at Fairport's Cropredy Convention on 11 August 2018. He died, just 35 days later after a short battle with liver cancer. * Duck Doonican (Simon Friend from Levellers) – played mandolin on the live album It'll Be Reight (2014) and has made two live appearances to date. * Mojo Doonican - made his debut on bass guitar and tambourine with the band at The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican's Sunday Service at Beautiful Days Festival 2019. Sporting an afro, sunglasses and silvery flares, Mojo remained mute for the duration of the show, communicating by coolly staring at his brothers. He is alleged to come from Coolville, Ohio. He also guested on bass on Big Coffee Brand and Frisky In The Jar from the 2019 reissue of The Tarn Machine. * Delmar Doonican – played 5-string banjo on the live album It'll Be Reight (2014) and as a guest on the tracks Whole Lotta Rosé from Talk Of The Tarn (2014) and Place Of Spades from the album of the same name (2019). * Foxy Doonican – acoustic guitar, bass guitar, banjo (made four live appearances between 31 May 2014 and 18 October 2014) * Bobby Doonegan – occasional appearances on tea-chest bass (25 May 2014 – present). Bobby has been described on the band's website as a distant cousin and the son of lesser-known skiffle star, Lenny Doonegan. * Sarah Doonican – occasional British Sign Language interpreter at live shows (21 May 2015 – present) has performed several times alongside the band at Bearded Theory Festival and at a handful of other shows in Derbyshire, inclusively translating the band's comedy lyrics for deaf festival or gig-goers. In the similar way to how the core band members refer to each other as \\"brothers from other mothers\\", they refer to Sarah as their \\"sister from the same mister\\". * Joel Howe (music producer) - often described by the band as 'The Fifth Doonican' (a subtle reference to Beatles producer George Martin), he has mixed and mastered a number of the band's albums since 2017, including studio albums Ave It : Bold As Brass (2017), The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican/2008-2018 (2018), Place Of Spades (2019), and the reissued versions of The Tarn Machine and T' South 0 - Tarn 4 (2019), as well as live albums, Live & Lairy at Fairport's Cropredy Convention (2018), Avalon Calling - Live At Glastonbury Festival (2019) and The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican Live At The Palace Theatre (2019). * Tom Large – occasional appearances as Björn's nemesis The Devil (or Tom DeVille) at live shows (since show #555 on 21 May 2015 – present) * Amanda White - co- writer of a significant percentage of the band's parodies, alongside Scott Doonican, regular band photographer and in charge of band merchandise at live shows since 2006. Amanda was also responsible for giving the band its name and subsequent unique image. Scott has long described her as 'The Fourth Doonican', even during the period where the band expanded to become a quartet between 2014 and 2016. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic the band were forced to cancel live shows, and Scott Doonican presented a weekly BIG NEET IN livestream show on YouTube. Amanda co-presented the show using and voicing a range of puppet characters, including Gloria McGlumpher the Big Neet In Roving Reporter (who interviewed band members and people close to the band), Morris the Quizmaster (an alien with three eyes) and Gervaise (the band's stylist and hairdresser) amongst others.

He was a subscriber to the third charter of the Virginia Company who emigrated to the colony in 1618. After surviving the Powhatan attack of 1622, he moved to Jordan's Journey. In the following year, Farrar became involved in North America's first breach of promise suit when he proposed to Cecily Jordan. In 1626, Farrar was appointed to the Council of Virginia where he served as an advisor to the royal governor, a judge of the highest court in the colony, and a member of the Virginia General Assembly of Colonial Jamestown. He was also appointed magistrate of the upper James River community. In both these roles, he served as a voice of the early planters' interest as the colony transitioned from being managed by the Virginia Company and becoming a royal colony under Charles I of England. Farrar was also on the Council when it arrested Governor John Harvey for misgovernance and forced his temporary return to England. By the time of his death around 1637, Farrar had sold off his remaining assets in England and established rights to a 2000 acre patent on Farrar's Island, located on a curl of the James River. arms of William Farrar's father, John Farrar of Croxton and London, Esquire Background William Farrar was born before April 28, 1583, the date of his christening, in Croxton, Lincolnshire, England. He was the 3rd son of John Farrar of Croxton and London, Esquire, a wealthy merchant and landowner with various holdings in West Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and Hertfordshire, and Cecily Kelke, an heiress and direct descendant of Edward III of England. The nineteenth century historian of Virginia, Alexander Brown, states that while in England, William Farrar received an education in law.  Relation to the Virginia Company and emigration to the New World  Facsimile cover of \\"Nova Britannia\\", a tract from Farrar's time used to recruit people to Virginia. When Farrar went to Virginia, it was still part of the Virginia Company of London, a joint-stock company, sanctioned by Royal Charter. Farrar was a subscriber to the Third Charter of the Virginia Company, where his name appears as \\"William Ferrers\\". His subscription consisted of three shares that were bought for a total of £37 10s (equivalent to about $ today). Farrar also had family interests in the Virginia Company as two of his second cousins, the brothers John Ferrar and Nicholas Ferrar, played key roles in the managing the company's interests. Farrar left London on Neptune on March 16, 1617/18 along with Virginia's governor, Thomas West, Baron De La Warr. De La Warr had been commissioned by the Virginia Company to return to the colony with fresh people and supplies to help it achieve political and economic stability, but he died en route. When Farrar arrived in August 1618,> news of the governor's death threw Jamestown into turmoil, Deputy Governor Samuel Argall, who was already unpopular with many colonists, was accused of mismanagement and the unauthorized misappropriation of Neptune's passengers and cargo. After a prolonged series of accusations from both the Virginia Company and colonists against Argall's governing, he finally stepped down in April 1619. In June 1619, the Virginia Company instructed that 40 indentured servants be put at the disposal of Farrar when they arrived in Virginia. The payment for the cost of transporting these colonists would have resulted in a 2000 acre headright at 50 acres a head. However, Garland never arrived in Jamestown because it was damaged in a hurricane while en route. Instead of proceeding to Virginia, the Garlands captain, William Wye left the remaining passengers in Bermuda and sailed the repaired ship directly back to England. As his personal headright, Farrar did receive a land patent for 100 acres on the Appomattox River close to where it flows into the James River, near what is now known as Hopewell, Virginia. In the meantime, the resultant legal suits between Wye and the Virginia Company regarding the financial responsibility for the Garland fiasco were not resolved until the end of 1622, when Farrar had already quit residence at his patent as a result of the Powhatan surprise attack of 1621/22.  Move to Jordan's Journey and marriage Matthäus Merian's engraving of the Powhatan surprise attack of 1622, in which 10 people at Farrar's patent were killed. During the Powhatan surprise attack, ten settlers on Farrar's land on the Appomattox River were killed. However, Farrar survived and got to Samuel Jordan's settlement at Beggars Bush, part of the plantation known as Jordan's Journey. After the attack, William Farrar stayed at Jordan's Journey as it had become a relatively safe fortified rallying place for the survivors. Samuel Jordan died before June 1623. Sometime afterward, Farrar proposed marriage to Jordan's pregnant widow, Cecily, which involved him in the first breach of promise suit filed in North America. Reverend Greville Pooley claimed he had first proposed marriage three or four days after Samuel Jordan had died and Cecily had accepted. However, Cecily denied his proposal and accepted Farrar's, which resulted in Pooley filing the suit. The case continued for almost two years. During the suit, Alexander Brown suggests that Farrar may have acted as Cecily's legal representative. Eventually, Pooley signed an agreement in January 1624/5 that acquitted Cecily Jordan of her alleged former promises. Even as the case was ongoing, William Farrar and Cecily Jordan continued to work together at Jordan's Journey. In November 1623, Farrar was bonded to execute Samuel Jordan's will regarding the management of his estate and Cecily Jordan was warranted to put down the security to guarantee Farrar's bondage. During this time, \\"Farrar assumed the role of plantation 'commander' or 'head of hundred'\\" for Jordan's Journey. A year later, the Jamestown muster of 1624/25 lists \\"fferrar William mr & Mrs. Jordan\\"[sic] as sharing the head of a Jordan's Journey household with three daughters and ten manservants.> During this time, Jordan's Journey prospered. By May 1625 Farrar and Jordan were finally married, as it was then that Farrar was released from his bond to Jordan's estate.They had three children together: Cecily (born 1625), William (birth year uncertain), and John (born around 1632).  Roles in the royal colony  On March 14, 1625/6, William Farrar was appointed councillor to the Council of Virginia by Charles I of England. Farrar held this position, which entitled him as an esquire of Virginia, until at least 1635 when Governor John Harvey was deported. thumb|left|Seal of \\"His Majesties Council of Virginia\\", the symbol of Farrar and the other councillors' role in Virginia's governance. Farrar became a councillor during a period of uncertainty for the colonists. The 1619 Great Charter of the Virginia Company had established self-governance through the Virginia Assembly, but James I dissolved the charter in 1624, and put the colony under direct royal authority. Just before James I died in March 1625, Charles I announced his intention to be the sole factor of his royal colonies. To this end, he commissioned a new structure, consisting of a governor, Sir George Yeardley, and 13 councillors, including William Farrar, to govern the royal colony on behalf of the Crown's interest. Because the assembly was not included in the commission, the Council was the only legal body representing the interests of the Virginia planters. This state of affairs continued until the petitions of the colonists allowed the continuance of the House of Burgesses and the re-convention of the Virginia Assembly in 1628. The Council also functioned as the highest court in Virginia and as the advisory board to the governor regarding the creation of legislative acts. Just as importantly, the members of the Council could determine the fate of the governor. Farrar was on the Council when it elected John Pott as governor in 1628. He was also on the Council when it temporarily deported Governor Harvey in 1635.. Harvey's silencing of Farrar when he questioned the governor's proceedings with the council initiated the protest that eventually lead to the governor's arrest and expulsion. In August 1626, Farrar was also appointed by Yeardley as commissioner (i.e., magistrate) of the \\"Upper Partes\\"[sic] which lies along the James River west of Piersey's Hundred having jurisdiction over Charles City and the City of Henrico. Farrar was the head commissioner of six commissioners appointed: he was the one given the right of final judgement when present and allowed the discretion to hold monthly courts at either Jordan's Journey or Shirley Hundred.. When his commission was renewed by Governor Sir John Harvey in 1632, it also mandated that the court could only be in session when Farrar was present. After 1619, settlers could purchase the cost of transporting white indentured servants from England to the new world as a contract that could redeemed as a headright, and these headright contracts could used for speculation by being sold, bought, or bartered. William Farrar was one of the settlers involved in this activity. For example, he is listed in patents as selling headrights to the settlers William Andrewes around 1628 and Nathan Martin around 1636  Sale of inheritance  When William Farrar's father, John the elder, died sometime before May 1628, he willed his various landholdings in Hertfordshire to William. In addition, John Farrar also stipulated that William and his family receive a £20 annuity from his older brother from rents in Halifax Parish, Yorkshire and that William receive £50 upon his return to England. In 1631, William Farrar returned to England to claim his inheritance. He then sold the assets from his inheritance to his brothers, including his annuity for £240 and his landholdings for £200, for a total of £440 (equivalent to about $ today) and returned to Virginia. Farrar's Island Approximate extent of William Farrar's 2000-acre 1637 land grant in green with boundary descriptions from patent in blue At the time of his death sometime before June 11, 1637, Farrar was described as being \\"of Henrico\\", one of eight shires established in Virginia three years previously. By the time of his death, he had established his headright to a 2000 acre land patent at a site that included Dutch Gap and the former settlement of Henrico. This headright was given for 40 indentured servants, who were named in the patent. After Farrar's death, the headright was repatented to his oldest son, his namesake who was twelve years old at the time, by John Harvey, who had returned from England and resumed his role as governor of the colony. The patent was issued for land that included a peninsula formed by meander loop, or curl, of the James River subsequently known as Farrar's Island.

Biography  340x340px Van der Heide was born in Hilversum, Netherlands, and studied Music Technology in Utrecht and Sonology at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. He has developed his academic activity in The Hague, where he was lecturer and later also co-director of the ArtScience Interfaculty of the Royal Conservatory and the Royal Academy of Arts. Currently, in addition to pursuing his artistic career, he is a lecturer and researcher at the Faculty of Science of Leiden University. 340x340px Van der Heide began his artistic career as a composer and performer in the field of electronic music. Along with Zbigniew Karkowski and Atau Tanaka he was a founding member of Sensorband. From giving stage based performances he has developed his work in the fields of sound, interactive and audiovisual installations. Van der Heide's installations are characterized by the importance of sound, and by the use of other spatial media, such as light (including lasers), real fog or smoke, creating immersive and sensory experiences for the audience. His work has been presented at the Reina Sofía Museum in Madrid, the MAXXI in Rome, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Art Basel in Basel and the Locarno International Film Festival. Van der Heide was awarded the Composition Prize of the Beethoven Foundation in Bonn, in 2015. In 2018, he was commissioned to develop the installation CHIASM for the city hall of Barcelona to open and celebrate the 25th edition of Sónar 2018.  Collaboration with architects  The interactive Son-O-House in Son en Breugel, the NetherlandsEdwin van der Heide collaborated extensively with architects. Together with Victor Wentink, he conceived a generative and interactive sound environment for both the freshwater part by NOX (Lars Spuybroek) and the saltwater part by ONL (Kas Oosterhuis) of the Water Pavilion (1997), part of the Deltapark at the artificial island Neeltje_Jans. The approach was not to have a building with separate content inside but to create a true integration of architecture, sound and light. In 2004 Lars Spuybroek and Edwin van der Heide realized the interactive architectural sound sculpture Son-O-House. For the exhibition of his installation Pneumatic Sound Field, part of the Synthetic Times exhibition at the National Art Museum of China (NAMOC) in 2008, Lars Spuybroek designed a dedicated pavilion. As part of Sónar 2014 van der Heide realized his composition Spectral Diffractions for the Barcelona Pavilion by Mies van der Rohe.

It opened in October 1915 to provide fire northward from the Haven ports, replacing a battery of 10-inch guns that had previously covered this area. With their removal, only a single 10-inch gun in Landguard Fort could fire in that direction, and Brackenbury was built to address this problem. Brackenbury Battery was equipped with two of the newest 9.2-inch Mk IX guns, making it the most powerfully armed battery on the east coast at that time. The gun's carriages were set in concrete with shelters below, then surrounded by an earthen rampart and ditch. The guns were upgraded to Mk. X versions in 1929-1930. Trenches and strongpoints were added around the battery on the outbreak of World War II, and in 1941 two searchlights were placed on the beach to give the battery night fighting capability. The Battery had a role in the development of radar when, in July 1939, the guns were being test fired right as researchers at Bawdsey Manor, about to the north, were testing a new surface-scanning radar. The splashes of the shells produced strong returns on the radar displays, allowing the team to measure the distance and bearing of the fall of shot. This led to the development of Coast Artillery radar, and more generally the use of radar to guide naval gunfire. During WWII, the battery was manned by the 176 Battery of Suffolk Heavy Regiment Royal Artillery (Territorial Army), and later, 278 Battery of 515 Coast Regiment. It was put into care and maintenance in 1944, and formally stood down in 1952. The site was later redeveloped as a housing estate, and the area is now a greenspace. No sign of the battery remains.

It was built from 1969 to 1970. The property is owned by Hawkesbury City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 February 2004.  History  The land on which Australiana Pioneer Village is situated was farmland recognised as essential to the survival of colonial New South Wales, being one of the earliest grants made in Australia. Located in the District of Mulgrave Place, the third mainland settlement of the colony, the 30 acre grant was registered to William MacKay on 1 May 1797, but by 1809 at least part of it was in the possession of Joshua Rose.Land & Property Information Grants of Land Book 2, p. 192; Portion 49 Parish Map of Wilberforce, County of Cook.State Records, New South Wales, GRR563, K260780/PA15431. John Rose, the final Rose descendant to live on the rich farmland after continuous occupation by the family for over 150 years, died only in 1961.M. Clarke, The Australiana Pioneer Village Story, Australian Pioneer Village, Wilberforce, 1992. Upon John Rose's death, Dugald Andrew (Bill) McLachlan, a friend of Rose and an industrial chemist, bought the property. A man who relished challenges, whether competing in gruelling Australian car trials or being part of the 1940s group who pioneered water-skiing, Bill McLachlan fashioned a vision: to save part of the Hawkesbury's historical legacy, and to demonstrate its pioneering accomplishments \\"Village Times\\" n.d. in \\"Australiana Pioneer Village\\" file, Local Studies Collection Hawkesbury City Library. In an era before New South Wales heritage legislation such an enterprise had to be carried out privately, and resiting endangered buildings was one of few options open. It was a very natural option in the Hawkesbury district where there was, and still is, a long tradition of adaptation of buildings, both public and private, often involving reuse of materials or transfer complete to another site. By 1967 McLachlan had begun to plan a \\"Pioneer Village\\" of two streets, a water based leisure centre on his 250-metre water frontage to the Hawkesbury River and picnic facilities. Ready response from the owners of many buildings endangered in the district, meant that from the end of 1969 and throughout 1970 he engaged Silvio Biancotti of Kurrajong to bring by low loader to his \\"Village\\" twelve of the resited buildings together with the glasshouse. Many local families helped with the removals, which were all undertaken keeping the buildings structurally intact, and with their relocation on their planned sites. Brian Bushell of Wilberforce brought the small Bee House shop from McGraths Hill and others transported the Riverstone General Store and Jack Greentree's garage which became the \\"Bank of Australasia\\". On 29 November 1970 the Village was officially declared open by the Eric Willis, Minister for Education. Bill McLachlan's early death at the age of 54 years in 1971, and the interment of his ashes near the church on the Village site, rallied continued support. The last three buildings to be resited were the Riverstone Police Station (1972–73), Mangold Cottage (1985) and Aiken Hut (1984–85). Arthur and Jean Mawson who ran a hotel on site, had joined Bill McLachlan to help finance the original village and continued to do so, bringing the Riverstone Police Station to the Village through Silvio Biancotti around 1972. The Village changed hands three times in quick succession, the first buyer a syndicate headed by Sydney solicitor Mr. Anthony Gye.Hawkesbury Gazette 10.12.1980 Hawkesbury City Council decided to buy Rose Cottage and the Australiana Pioneer Village (excluding the hotel/motel) in December 1984, paying $450,000 the following year, and subsequently the Council did conservation work on the buildings.Daily Mirror 7.12.1984 During council's ownership towards the end of the 1980s Mangold Cottage and Aiken Hut were added to the Village. On 30 March 1989 a \\"Friends\\" Society was formed, the inaugural meeting attracting 24 members, increasing to almost 100 friends and workers by 1991. The Village was widely used by schools, local and overseas visitors, film crews, the community and businesses during the 1980s and 1990s. In April 1985 Grace Bros. retailers hired the Village for their firm's 100 year celebrations. Nearly 10,000 employees and their families attended, hundreds of them being bussed from country centres as far flung as Tamworth and Dubbo.Grace Bros. News, Vol. 26, No. 4, April 1985. Australia Day celebrations, and Annual Bush Fire Brigade Field Days were held there (16). An award-winning heritage video made by Hawkesbury City Council was partly shot at the Village in 1994 and it was featured on Telstra's telephone book cover in 1998. In 1987 visitor numbers for that year reached 27, 572 with 164 school visits included. Articles praising Australiana Pioneer Village have been regularly published, including those in Woman's Day (16 June 1969), The Sun- Herald (30 August 1970 and 19 October 1986), The Open Road (August 1988) and the Daily Telegraph (12 February 1997). Documentaries, films and advertisements have used Australiana Pioneer village, and the community have conducted market days there). A name modification took place in 1993, the Village becoming the Australian Pioneer Village Recreation and Animal Park, with a management committee formed from a public meeting undertaking control of the Village. Additional initiatives included the planting of over 10,000 trees on the land by community groups. From 4 January 1997 Council leased the property to Chris Wells, resulting in another name change to Heritage Farm. When the lease expired in 2002, Hawkesbury City Council agreed at its 11 February 2002 meeting to sell Australiana Pioneer Village to James Kelly, making no mention of its listing on the Hawkesbury Local Environment Plan or the heritage constraints necessary to the property.Hawkesbury Gazette 22.5.2002, p.3. This decision was invalidated because the land on which the Australian Pioneer Village stands is zoned \\"community\\" and cannot be sold without being reclassified, which it then was. Subsequently, a third community group was formed to ensure the Australiana Pioneer Village remained a community asset and that its heritage and environmental integrity is retained. The Australiana Pioneer Village was closed from 2002 until January 2011. In 2010, it was leased to The Australiana Pioneer Village Ltd, an organisation which had been set up to in 2002 to preserve the site as a community asset. The organisation were granted $100,000 towards the cost of repairs and it formally reopened on 26 January 2011. Individual buildings Buildings originally on site =Rose Cottage= This cottage and its curtilage were originally part or the land parcel Bill McLachlan purchased from John Rose and on which he constructed the Australiana Pioneer Village. It is an integral part of the Australiana Pioneer Village concept, but is now separately owned to the remainder of the village. =\\"Salter\\" Barn (formerly part of 498 Wilberforce Road, Wilberforce)= This barn is one of the three buildings still on their original site. It is known as the \\"Salter\\" barn after its early twentieth-century owners, but is of nineteenth-century style and was almost certainly built in the mid-Victorian period by the then owner, Richard William Cobcroft prior to his death in 1866, or by his widow and family in the period 1866 to 1890. The Cobcrofts owned 6a 2r 19p, part of the 30 acres granted to William MacKay in 1797, until 1905 when Thomas J. Salter, a local man, bought the allotment. A Cobcroft building of the nineteenth century was close to the existing barn and its archaeological remains can be seen at 496 Wilberforce Road (on an empty paddock that today is part of the Australian Pioneer Village). Salter in 1905 bought a developed property which included Cobcroft's barn, and locals believe he almost at once built his own house, now 486 Wilberforce Road; while in 1909 Salter's son William built a second new house at 498 Wilberforce Road when he married a local Buttsworth girl, Minnie Christabel. As a result, the Cobcroft barn became part of 498 Wilberforce Road and was closely associated with the Salter family from 1905 onwards. When 498 Wilberforce Road, like the Australiana Pioneer Village site was purchased by Bill McLachlan, founder of the Village, the barn became part of the Australiana Pioneer Village and remained so when 498 Wilberforce Road was sold independently. =Quilty Stables= The Quilty Stables were built sometime before the early 1980s for the 100 mile endurance horse race which started at the Village and went out through Colo and ended at the Village. The race attracted entrants from all over Australia was held in the district for some 10 years until tar roads became too hard for horses and its location was moved interstate. People like R. M. Williams were regular riders. Local State Emergency Services personnel were actively involved in operating the far flung check points and co-ordinating the incoming radio reports from each one.  Resited buildings  = Stable from the Black Horse Inn, Richmond= Paul Randall became licensee of the Black Horse Inn on the SE corner of Windsor and Bosworth Streets, Richmond in 1819. Part of the Inn still stands on its original location, one of a select group of buildings erected in the Macquarie period that remain in the Hawkesbury. The date of construction for the stables is not known, but is certainly no later than the 1860s, since prior to the 1870s the Black Horse Inn was popular with honeymooners as a pre- Blue Mountains resort destination, reached by horse and carriage or train and sulky ride. During this period the Inn was also the finishing point of an early horse race track down the main street of Richmond.D. Bowd, Macquarie Country, author, 1973, p. 50; K. Moon, Hawkesbury's Black Horse Inn, Research Publications Pty Ltd, 1988, pp. 12, 29; A. Smith, Some Ups and Downs of an Old Richmondite, Nepean Family History Society Inc, Penrith, 1991, p. 52. Indeed, it is said that the room on the end of the stables was supposed to have been used to lock up the jockeys before other such races to prevent bribing or interference. The building and its stabling remained in situ after the Inn closed in 1927 when the licence was transferred to Kurrajong Heights; the stabling was resited to the Village in early 1970. It was moved in one piece, held together by ropes (3). The sign of the Black Horse Inn painted by T. Masters and some china used there is now part of the collection at Hawkesbury Museum, Windsor. =Perry House, Richmond= This building was originally Samuel Paul's house and shop at Richmond. Samuel Paul, a skilled bootmaker and saddler, purchased the land in 1841 and had the building erected for his dwelling and shop by 1856, for when he moved to Bathurst that year his mother, sisters Elizabeth and Priscilla and her son Samuel Charles as well as the two little children of his older sister Martha continued living in the building, following the death of his father. In 1867 Samuel Paul sold the property to Alfred Perry who made it his residence and the premises for his tailoring business. Mr Perry later became an alderman on Richmond Council and the family continued to conduct the tailoring business until 1914. Mr Cahoon, a saddler, took over until 1927 when the premises are said to have become a brothel. Edward Sydney Paull [no connection to Samuel Paul] bought the property in the 1930s together with the adjoining premises to the West (now the Gazette office) where he conducted a grocery business, expanding that he ran in March Street in one of the cottages recently conserved as part of the Richmond Town Centre. The building now at Australiana Pioneer Village was moved in one piece when Paulls sold the land for the building of the Magnolia Mall. The magnolia tree still growing at the front of the Mall, from which its name is taken, was planted by earlier resident Mr Perry. \\"Perry\\" House was moved to Australiana Pioneer Village in 1969 by Silvio Biancotti, the first building to be relocated there. The Paull family [no connection to Samuel Paul] bought the property years later and leased it out. =Atkin's Blacksmith's Shop, Wilberforce= Originally sited in Wilberforce on the SW corner of the Singleton (Putty) Road and King Street, only a couple of hundred metres from its present relocation site, this blacksmith's shop was operated by George Atkins from 1862 when he rented it as a new shop from David Wenban, son of Wilberforce schoolmaster John Wenban. George Atkins, a blacksmith of exceptional ability, in 1874 invented the single furrow steel plough, which revolutionised Hawkesbury cropping. At the Sydney International Exhibition of 1879 he received a \\"commended\\" Award for his entries of a plough and scuffler. Atkins' single furrow plough was highly regarded and late in the nineteenth century there was scarcely a farm in the district that did not have an Atkins plough. George's son William and grandson William were blacksmiths in the same premises spanning over 80 years. When the business closed down in 1943.D. Bowd, Hawkesbury Journey, Library of Australian History, Sydney, 1986, p. 104 Of particular interest is the original stone quenching trough used by the Atkins family, located at the rear of the blacksmith's shop. An Atkins plough is on display in the Blacksmith's shop at the Australiana Pioneer Village today. This whole section of the original shop was moved intact to the Village in May 1970 by Silvio Biancotti. =Cartwright Cottage, East Kurrajong= This cottage was built in the 1870s at 927 East Kurrajong Road, East Kurrajong by Alfred Francis Case (b. 1847) a pioneer of Bull Ridge now East Kurrajong, for John Edward Cartwright (Mycock) and his wife, Julia Anne (née Riley), who is now referred to as \\"Old Granny Cartwright\\" by some members of the family. Her daughter Laura (b. 1899) later conducted a mail service from a room on the end of her verandah, walking to Comleroy to pick it up. If no mail arrived the sign on the door read \\"Sorry no male today\\". She is credited with being the owner of an early pistol licence which is still in the family today. Three Cartwrights who have Aboriginal ancestry born in Cartwright Cottage are alive today; Lorna, Gweneth and Fay. Cartwright Cottage was moved in one piece to the Village in 1970 by Silvio Biancotti. =Bowd's Sulky Shed, Wilberforce= This outbuilding was originally located only one hundred metres away from its resited location, on the property of the Bowd family adjacent to the Village in Rose Street Wilberforce. It stood in the paddock immediately behind the Village's present wagon shed having been built in 1874 by Edward Bowd, a descendant of William Bowd who arrived in the colony in 1816. Originally this was a two-storey barn with a skillion on one side. Also on the Bowd property originally but now demolished were a weatherboard house and another barn. =The Bee House, McGrath's Hill= Built at McGraths Hill c.1879 as part of a tearoom and shop complex, this building was used as a retail outlet for honey made from Box-Gum and from Patterson's Curse, now branded a weed but marketed as \\"Salvation Jane\\".M.Clarke, The Australian Pioneer Village Story, Australiana Pioneer Village, Wilberforce, 1992, p. 20; This building was brought to the Australian Pioneer Village complete, around 1970 by Brian Buttsworth, Marj. Clarke's brother. =Mangold Cottage, Riverstone= This was built by Gottlieb Mangold (II) as a temporary home on the corner of Garfield Road West and Penprase Street, Riverstone for his family around 1886. It remained owned by the Mangold family until 1986 when it was resited at the Village.D. Kingston, Early Slab Buildings of the Sydney Region, Kangaroo Press, Kenthurst 1985, p. 22. Gottlieb Mangold (I), his father, was a vine dresser in Germany who had emigrated to Australia with his wife Eva by the ship \\"Peru' arriving in May 1855.Immigration Department, Assisted Immigrants Inwards to Sydney, State Records New South Wales, 4/4953, microfilm reel 2471. Gottlieb (II) was born in 1861. The family was living at South Creek, like another German vine dresser emigrant William Emert.J. Barkley in Emerton is Ours, Emerton Public School, 1995, pp. 61-63. Previously, the Mangold family, like that of William Emert had lived in Mulgoa possibly working for the Cox family. German families were in New South Wales by the 1850s for large landowners in the colony sought German expertise in their vineyards. Seventeen ships in that period had brought the Germans to the colony, most coming from Hamburg with up to 40 or 50 German vine dressers and their families aboard. Mr Bill Mangold who offered the house to Hawkesbury City Council for the Australiana Pioneer Village building remembers living there as a child with his grandmother, Phoebe the wife of Gottlieb II, after his grandfather's death. He, his brother and sister remained at the house for two or three years, and the family at that time had associations with the Schofield's vineyard nearby. Later when he was married, Bill and his own family lived there whilst building their own home elsewhere in Riverstone. In 1983 a mini-cyclone tore off the roof and verandah, in which state it was sketched, as a vernacular building in danger of being lost by well known recorder of Sydney's slab building heritage, Daphne Kingston. Bill Mangold repaired the roof reusing the old iron where possible, so that only the front section had to be replaced with new iron. =Riverstone Police Station= Built by 1888, this small station originally was in Garfield Road Riverstone. It was a small wooden building measuring 10 feet by 8.5 feet by 10 feet, and would have been used for interviews and to allow the police officer to complete paperwork. It had no cells or holding facilities.(Windsor and Richmond Gazette 21.7.1888) The district policeman was based at Rouse Hill and he used this building when in Riverstone. When a larger police station was built on the Riverstone site in 1891/92, the small original room continued as an office. The new station consisted of a house with cells at the back. The location of the original Riverstone Police Station can be seen on a 1947 extension plan of the 1890s building and on a Department of Public Works plan of 1959, located at the front of the block facing Railway Terrace on the North-West side. It was relocated to Australiana Pioneer Village around 1972 or 1973 for Mawsons, the then owners, by Silvio Biancotti. =Case Cottage, East Kurrajong= Like Cartwright Cottage this dwelling at East Kurrajong Road, formerly known as Bull Ridge, East Kurrajong was built by a member of the Case family. Herbert James Case who built it, in 1896 at the time of his marriage to Catherine Hornery, was the son of Alfred Case (see Cartwrights Cottage). Herbert had been born at East Kurrajong, just down from the school and always lived in the district. He became a farmer, self-taught in building skills amongst a family who over two generations did most of the early building in East Kurrajong. This was not the only talent of Herbert, or indeed the Case family generally, for once a month Herbert and the family formed a band to enliven the district families' get-togethers. Herbert himself played the fiddle (which instrument is still in the Case family), and grandson Kelvin recalls the latter years in which dances were held there when he, as a small boy, saw Herbert's brother Jack play the concertina and his son Matthew play the accordion. The Case family's involvement in these entertainments was even more integral than providing the music for the dances, for they also provided the venue. Case Cottage, like some of the other cottages built by the family, was special in the district, purpose built with a view to this community use, for the centre wall is completely removable so dances could be held in the small cottage. The signage used to advertise some dances was: 'Dance. All welcome Saturday 8pm till 2am. In Case Cottage at Bull Ridge. Dancing Free - Bring your own food basket and drinks, Good Dance Time Orchestra Herb Case Violin, Art Overton accordion. Best Square Dance and Buffet. Ladies without transport contact Mrs Jim Packer with her 4-wheel coach. Case Cottage was the third or fourth dwelling relocated to Australiana Pioneer Village being moved in March 1970 by Silvio Biancotti intact. =Riverstone General Store= Originally this building was a general store located on the southern side of Garfield Road, Riverstone approximately today where the Liquor Barn is now. It was built about 1890 and is probably the shop in which Norm Conway set up a hair-dressing business between 1914 and 1925. A Mr Edwards took over the lease followed a couple of years later by Tommy Freeman. The Blair family who took over the shop in 1929, conducted their fruit and vegetable business there for over 30 years. It closed in 1960. It was transferred to the Village as one of the original group of buildings acquired by Bill McLachlan in around 1969 having been empty for almost ten years. =St. Matthews Church, Upper Macdonald= St. Matthews Church, Upper Macdonald Road, Upper Macdonald was newly built on land donated by Edward Archer Bailey by May 1900 when the Bishop of Newcastle toured the St Albans parish and conducted on \\"afternoon services at the new church, Upper McDonald\\". The Bishop also conducted services at that time in St Philip's Church about twelve kilometres further north along Upper Macdonald Road.Hawkesbury Gazette 12.5.1900. St Philip's Church is still extant and in use in the Upper Macdonald Valley but St Mathews ceased to operate sometime between 1952 and 1956, and was taken to Australiana Pioneer Village in 1970. Confusion seems to have existed in the labelling of this church at the APV with current signage still incorrectly proclaiming it to be St Philip's. Mrs Laurel Bailey, granddaughter of Edward A. Bailey, has Christening certificates for two of her children in 1948 and 1951 that confirm the resited church was indeed St Matthew's and believes the confusion arose because there was never any formal identification sign on the church during its use at Upper Macdonald between 1900 and 1951. Edward A. Bailey died in 1921, leaving his property including the land on which the church was sited to his son Oscar Archer Bailey, Mrs Laurel Bailey's father. The church had belonged at times to the Sydney Diocese and at others to the Newcastle Diocese. The last minister at the church, J. B. Neville lived in the Rectory at St. Albans and travelled between the four churches in the Macdonald Valley. On the 1st and 3rd Sundays he conducted services at the central St Albans Church on the 2nd and 4th Sundays he alternated morning and afternoon between St Mathew's Church and St Philip's churches, Upper Macdonald. On the fifth Sunday (when occurring) a service was held at the church on the Wollombi side of the St Albans Common. =Schoolhouse, Marsden Park= This building from Marsden Park was under construction in March 1889, having originally been suggested 1886, but not receiving recommendation until October 1888. The school opened in July 1889 with five boys and five girls as pupils but within four weeks the enrolment had risen to 18 boys and 9 girls, and by the end of 1889 it had an enrolment of 48 of whom 28 regularly attended.Marsden Park School Centenary Book 1889-1981, Marsden Park School, 1989, pp, 9, 12, 13. The schoolroom plan is by W. E. Kemp, Architect and was designed as an 8th Class (small) school able to give accommodation for 40 pupils under the space formula of the revolutionary Public Instruction Act of 1880, at a cost of (£228.5.3). The design of the Marsden Park Schoolhouse was so quintessentially official school design for the period that a sketch of this Marsden Park Schoolhouse was published in the annual report of the Minister of Education to Parliament in 1890, romanticised by curling smoke from the chimney and a sylvan landscape. James Mackay an unmarried teacher in his thirties who had come from another small school as a half-time teacher there on the lower Hawkesbury River was the first teacher. The building was resited at the Australiana Pioneer Village in 1969 by Silvio Biancotti the second building to be set up in the Village. It was transported in one piece except for the hat room, which was reattached at the Village. =Mitchell Cottage (originally called 'East Lynne'), North Richmond= Mr Ern Mitchell built this dwelling in Crooked Lane, North Richmond around the mid to late 1890s.M. Clarke, The Australiana Pioneer Village Story, APV, Wilberforce, 1992 Like the previous generation of his family. Ern was a skilled bullock team driver, employed as a road builder and is credited with constructing the main streets of Richmond using his team and a single furrow plough. Ern was also involved in the 1908 resiting of a church to the corner of Comleroy and Single Ridge Roads, using a specially constructed dray drawn by 35 bullocks (3). This building was one of the early resitings carried out by Bill McLachlan for the opening of \\"the Village\\" in 1970 (4). =\\"Kenso\\" Cottage, Kogarah= Originally built between 1890 and 1920s in Ocean Street, Kogarah NSW, this cottage was bought by Mr Jack Griffiths, a Kensington dentist, and removed for him to Freemans Reach in 1950 or 1951 by Mr Harvey Fotheringham who ran a fleet of trucks transporting market produce to Sydney. He brought the cottage back in sections: each wall, flooring, roof iron, rafters separately. Jack inherited the land at Freemans Reach from his brother Jerry Griffiths who had operated an orchard there. The loquat tree still growing at the front of the property was planted by Jack in the 1950s in front of his resited cottage.M.Clarke, The Australiana Pioneer Village Story, 1992, p.15. Jack became the local dentist which he visited his brother or resided in the cottage at Freemans Reach. Marj. Clarke recalls that Jack Griffiths came to her house, at Earle Street Wilberforce in 1943 to attend to her father's teeth in the dining room, while the Bushell children including Marj. watched. The resiting of houses and other buildings into the district or within the district has a long tradition in the Hawkesbury area both before and after the formation of Australiana Pioneer village. \\"Kenso\\" cottage was moved intact to the Village by Silvio Biancotti in 1970. =George Hastwell's House and Sackville North Post Office= The house now on the Australiana Pioneer Village site was originally located on the south side of Sackville Ferry Road at Sackville North, immediately south- west of the still extant Sackville North School of Arts, built in 1914. For many years, until his death in 1943, George Hastwell a well-known resident of the area, lived there, certainly in the 1930s and probably much earlier in the century.J. J. Olsen, Sackville North, Australian Post Office, Historical Office, Public Relations Section, 1974, p. 5 The cottage, is believed by local people to date from the 1890s, a date consistent with its fabric. In the 1930s it was already \\"old and weather-beaten\\". Hastwell was the contractor who boated children from their homes or across the Hawkesbury River to and from Sackville Reach (later Sackville North) School from 1905 until at least 1914.Rick Fleming, Sackville North Public School, Sackville North 1992; His handwriting and ability to compose letters show him a well-education man, while his character was vouched for by the Sackville Reach Schoolmaster, Mr Britten, who described him as \\"a thoroughly reliable and trustworthy person\\".Britten, 11.7.1905, State Records, New South Wales, School Files, Sackville Reach School, 5/1756OA. Later Hastwell was the non-official postmaster for Sackville North, for an unknown number of years from at latest the 1930s up to his death in 1943 (1). The post office at Sackville North had been conducted from 1906 until 1914 by the schoolmaster's wife, Mrs Britten. She initially operated from the school residence, now part of Brewongle Field Studies Centre, but between 1911 and 1914 her husband built a separate galvanised iron post office adjacent to the residence.Olsen, p. 3-5; Arndell, 16.5.1911 State Records, New South Wales, School Files, Sackville Reach School 5/1756OA Amy Munro, the wife of the next schoolmaster then became postmistress until her husband did in 1919 (Inspector, 6.6.1919, School Files). At some date after 1919 the small galvanised post office building was moved to behind the cottage on Sackville Ferry Road (2). Hastwell became postmaster and is likely to have used this iron building initially, but in 1934 a new weatherboard post office room was added to the north-east side of his cottage by other Sackville residents, who had formed a Sackville North Post Office League, with R. T. Madden as secretary. This new post office 2.5 x 3.2 metres (8 by 10 feet), was described in 1955 as \\"alike to an old shed. It is of wooden structure, and lined with jute bagging .. it is a lock up building\\".Olsen, p. 8. This is the post office run by George Hastwell until 1943 and then by Miss Doris Alcorn, appointed postmistress in July 1943. Miss Alcorn, whose later married name was Mrs Noble, used the weatherboard building for postal business and for the sale of confectionary, tobacco and soft drinks. Later by 1955 she used the cottage as a tearoom. The post office moved from Hastwell's former premises in 1956 to a new general store built in fibro- cement, also on Sackville Ferry Road, some 1650 metres to the north. The store-keeper cum postmaster was initially Ernest Buttfield from 1956 until 1957 and from 1963 until 1975 Mrs June Bonser ran the store and post office.Olsen p.10. The Hastwell cottage and its adjoining 1934 weatherboard post office became derelict after 1956 and in 1970 both were moved to the Australian Pioneer Village. The post office still contained its pigeon holes and other postal equipment used in the time of George Hastwell and Doris Noble from 1934 to 1956. =Kurrajong Railway Goods Shed= This building stood cheek by jowl with the passenger station building on the Kurrajong railway station platform. The 1929 timetable shows a goods train ran separate to the passenger service each weekday, in addition to one mixed goods - passenger train, but these services operated for the entire 26 years of the line from 1926 to July 1952. Arthur Poole remembers the goods truck on the combined train was drawn from Kurrajong to Richmond by the steam engine \\"Pansy\\" where it was added to the goods train departing Richmond for Sydney, until after the second World War when road transportation became preferred.Pansy: The Richmond to Kurrajong Railway, tourist Railway Association, Kurrajong, 2000, photo J. L. Buckland p. 18, photo R. Boyd 21, photo H. J. Wright p. 24, pp. 4, 16, 20, 23. In 1882 after almost twenty years of operation of the Blacktown-Richmond line, the residents of Kurrajong were agitating for the railway to be extended from Richmond to Kurrajong, thus, when the present North Richmond bridge was built in 1904 provision was made on it for a line to be added on the downstream side.V. Webb, Kurrajong: an Early History, author, 1980, p. 21.R. Ian Jack, Exploring The Hawkesbury, Kangaroo Press, 1986, p. 163. Construction of the railway to Kurrajong commenced in 1923.V. Webb, pp. 23, 24, 27. Like the original line to Richmond, It was seen as primarily a way for farmers and orchardists to get their goods quickly to the Sydney markets.J. Barkley and M. Nichols, Hawkesbury 1794-1994: The First 200 Years of the Second Colonisation, Hawkesbury City Council, 1994, pp. 143-146. Kurrajong Railway Station was located below Woodhill's Store, and was one of seven in the bush, on the track to Richmond (Kurrajong, Duffy's, Nurri, Thompson's Ridge, Kemsley's, Red Cutting, Phillip). The half hour trip to Richmond cost 1/- and the train would stop anywhere along the line boarding by a ladder lowered by the guard.V. Webb, pp. 28, 29. Prospect County Council purchased Kurrajong Station the site and built a sub-station on it. The concrete passenger station building stands at the Zig Zag Railway at whilst the wooden goods shed was taken to Australiana Pioneer Village by Silvio Biancotti in 1970 in one piece. =Bank of Australasia, Wilberforce= Originally this building stood on the NE corner of Rose Street and Wilberforce Street, Its contents were donated by the ANZ Bank. It was Jack Greentree's garage and was located straight across from the motel in Rose Street. Next door neighbour Aub Voller remembers it from the 1930s, but believes it could be older. =Aikin Hut, West Pennant Hills= This was the last slab hut remaining in West Pennant Hills when it was moved to the Village. It had originally been built by William Aikin to the north of present-day Aiken Road in 1875. The Aiken family descended from West-Indian John Aiken who had arrived in NSW in 1796, a free man who was a carpenter by trade. He rented a farm near Parramatta and applied for a grant in 1820, which resulted the following year in 30a in the Field of Mars being given to him, registered in 1831. He, his wife and children settled in West Pennant Hills as we now know the area, where John built a slab hut. His son William was killed in an accident in 1869, and 'William junior and brother Charles stayed on the farm with their mother and, when William married Elizabeth Bowerman, a local girl, in 1875, he built a slab hut on an acre of his mother's land and mainly worked on orchards in the district'. He died in 1933.G. Millhouse, The Settlers of West Pennant Hills Valley 1799 Onwards, Hills District Historical Society, 1987, pp. 33-40. The area on which John's house was built was known as \\"Dixieland\\" a local reference to the Aikens (both John and probably his wife Francis) being coloured, probably from the West Indies and \\"Dixie Lane\\" is now Aiken Road. Description The Australiana Pioneer Village is a museum comprising a collection of vernacular Australian buildings, most of which have a strong relationship to the Hawkesbury district. The museum is located on a large site on the banks of the Hawkesbury River on the outskirts of Wilberforce. Rose Cottage, believed to be Australia's oldest surviving timber building, stands in its original location at the entry to the village. A row of relocated buildings, mostly small vernacular cottages line a \\"street\\" through the village leading to the relocated St Matthew's Church and Kurrajong Railway Station buildings. To the southwest is Salter's Barn, a nineteenth century slab barn on its original site and a quintessential example of the tall slab barns of the region. A number of buildings have been built on the site for various purposes associated with its use as a museum. The Australiana Pioneer Village at Wilberforce contains numerous historic buildings both in their original location and resited from other locations. Buildings in their original location include: * Rose Cottage (1811) * \\"Salter\\" Barn (1860-1890s) * Quilty Stables (20th century) Resited buildings include: * Black Horse Inn Stables ( 1819-1860s), formerly on the north-east corner of Bosworth & Windsor Streets, Richmond. * Perry House ( 1841 - pre-1856), formerly at 289 Windsor St, Richmond * Atkin's Blacksmith Shop (1861–62), formerly at the south-west corner of Singleton and King Roads, Wilberforce * Cartwright Cottage ( 1870s), formerly at 927 East Kurrajong Road (corner Carinya Close), East Kurrajong * Bowd's Sulky Shed (1874), formerly at Rose Street, Wilberforce * The Bee House ( 1879), formerly at 241 Windsor Road, McGraths Hill * Mangold Cottage (1886), formerly at Lot 1, 10 Garfield Road West, Riverstone * Riverstone Police Station (pre-1888), formerly at 18 Railway Terrace, Riverstone * Case Cottage ( 1896), formerly at 113 Bulls Ridge Road, East Kurrajong * Riverstone General Store ( 1890s), formerly at 36 Garfield Road, Riverstone * St Matthew's Anglican Church (1899), formerly at Upper Macdonald Road, Upper Macdonald * Marsden Park Public School (1899), formerly at Garfield Road (West), Marsden Park * Mitchell Cottage ( 1899, formerly at 193 Crooked Lane, North Richmond * \\"Kenso\\" Cottage ( 1890s - 1920s), formerly at 156 Freemans Reach Road, Freemans Reach, resited there from Ocean Road, Kogarah * Hastwell's Residence and North Sackville Post Office (((circa)) 1890s), formerly at Sackville Ferry Road, North Sackville * Kurrajong Railway Goods Shed (1926), formerly at corner Grose Vale and Old Bells Line Roads, Kurrajong * Bank of Australasia (pre-1930s), formerly at north-east corner Rose Street and Wilberforce Road, Wilberforce * Aiken Hut (1875), formerly at Hawkesbury-Aiken Road, West Pennant Hills Replica constructions on site include: * Buttsworth Road Gate House: Built as the entrance to the Village 1986, this building depicts a drop slab structure. * Oxboro Inn: A two-storey parapetted building constructed as a set for a commercial and remaining on the site. * Shearing Shed: A slab building built for museum purposes. * Smoke House: A circular building of timber slabs and bark built for the museum, a rare replica. * Wagon Shed: A long skillion roofed building, built of timber poles with a corrugated roof for museum use. Individual buildings Buildings originally on site  Rose Cottage  Rose Cottage is one of two nineteenth century buildings on the wider site which is in its original location. It stands on the east side of the entry drive, but is no longer part of the Village itself. Rose Cottage is a single storey Colonial Georgian cottage with a steeply pitched roof. The roof is hipped at the west end and gabled at the east end. A verandah is on the north side, under the main roof with a slight change of pitch. A broader skillion is on the south side, again under the main roof but with a slight change of pitch. The roof is of corrugated steel, with exposed battens at the ends indicating the original timber shingled roof. The house has chamfered weatherboards to the gable end. Hardwood slabs are exposed on the east and west walls. Modern lapped boards clad the north front of the house. The verandah is supported on stop chamfered rectangular posts and has a gravel floor. The house has two corbelled brick chimneys. 3 over 6 pane (unequal sash) windows are either side of the central front door, 2 on the west side, 1 on the south side. The front door is ledged and sheeted. A ledged and sheeted door gives access to the roof space from the east gable. Internally, the main part of the house is divided into two rooms, with the rear skillion a single room.  \\"Salter\\" Barn  'Salter' Barn is the only nineteenth century building on the site in its original location (not including Rose Cottage). The barn is of unusual interest as it appears to be an early slab barn of the district and is remarkably intact. The barn is single storey with a central space roofed with a steeply pitched gabled roof. Broad skillions on either side are broken back to the main roof. The roof is supported on closely spaced large timber posts. At the sides, the barn is divided into bays providing horse stalls on one side and storage on the other side. Joints are mortice and tenon or pegged. Storage spaces at the north end of the skillions are accessed by double doors across the skillions. The central space has a wide platform from which hay could be passed to the horse stalls. At the end of the space is a twentieth century forge, with possibly a recycled air conditioning duct.  Quilty Stables  Quilty stables is a large building constructed of bush poles 1970s. It has in more recent years been clad with vertical boards. Resited buildings =Black Horse Inn Stables= The Black Horse Inn Stables are a rare surviving Victorian (or earlier) timber stables. Further detailed investigation is warranted to determine the development of the building. The building is single storey built of vertical timber slabs with a hipped corrugated steel roof. The eaves are narrow and are boxed with beaded timber boards. On the left side of the front elevation, rough weatherboard cladding marks the jockey's room. A ledged and sheeted door and 4 pane casement window open to the room. The rest of the front has ledged and sheeted doors between timber slabs. Square timber dowels are used in the vent openings over the doors. A broad rear skillion was added after the stables were relocated to the museum. ='Perry House'= 'Perry House' is a rare two-storey timber house of the mid-Victorian period. It is square in plan with a hipped corrugated steel roof. The house is clad with sawn splayed weatherboards to the sides and rear with some beaded boards to the front. The house is two rooms deep and two rooms wide. A verandah with an awning roof shelters the two front doors; one to the house and one to the shop. The entry to the house is through French doors, the entry to the shop is through a salvaged pair of 2 panelled doors replacing the mid-twentieth century glazed door which was on the building when it was transported to the museum. Both front doors have small toplights. The shop window on the right side of the front has 16 panes. The first floor has 2 over 2 pane double hung windows, directly below the narrow eaves. A rear door is ledged and sheeted with 200mm wide boards. 6 pane casement windows open to the rear of the house. Internally, the house is lined with 200mm beaded boards and timber boards salvaged from packing cases. The first floor rooms have tent form ceilings. =Atkin's Blacksmith Shop= This blacksmith shop is a larger gabled building with broad skillions on the front and back. The main gabled section is clad in corrugated steel; the skillions are clad with timber slabs and weatherboards. A vent in the corrugated steel roof provides ventilation for smoke. At the rear of the shop a sandstone trough for quenching the hot metal protrudes through the wall. =Cartwright Cottage= Cartwright Cottage is a hipped roof cottage of wide (250-300mm) slabs and a corrugated steel roof. The cottage is one room deep and has a skillion verandah, broken back to the main roof. The symmetrical front has a four panelled door flanked by 2 over 2 pane double hung windows. The ceiling is lined with calico. The main front room has no internal wall linings; masonite has been used in the bedroom. The cottage has a slab and tin chimney, lined internally with corrugated iron. =Bowd's Sulky Shed= This large gabled shed was once two storeys high. The upper storey was clad in weatherboards before this section was relocated to the museum. The main gable faces the front of the building. The roof is of corrugated steel and the walls are timber slabs. Reused 4 panelled doors are at the entry of the shed. A skillion has been added to the rear and the sides. The building is framed with square timber posts and saplings for the roof framing. An iron stove inside the building is from the Macquarie Arms Inn. Windows on the side wall appear to be salvaged. =The Bee House= The bee house is a small gabled freestanding shop building, probably dating from the late Victorian period. It has a medium pitched gable with a scalloped barge board facing the street. An awning roof over the entry is supported on gallows brackets and finished with a reproduction scalloped valance. A four panelled door on the right is the shop entry. Tall vertical windows divided by a mullion serve as the shop window. The shop is clad with splayed weatherboards and lined with fibro. A honey spinner once reported to be in the shop is missing. =Mangold Cottage= Mangold Cottage is a late Victorian slab cottage with a gabled roof and skillion verandahs (broken back to the main roof) to the front and back of the cottage. Sketches of the cottage on its original site by Daphne Kingston show the original front verandah as a bullnose. The roof is corrugated galvanized steel and the walls are of vertical slabs with tin strips covering the gaps between the slabs. The symmetrical front has a four panelled door flanked by 2 over 2 pane double hung windows. The original floor framing of this cottage appears to survive. =Riverstone Police Station= The police station is one of the most interesting buildings at the museum. It is a small building, square in plan, with a skillion verandah (broken back to the main roof) on the front. The roof is of corrugated galvanized steel and the walls are clad with rusticated weatherboards, probably an alteration during the 1920s while still in use as a police office. On the left side of the building front is a framed and sheeted door with a toplight. To the right is a 6 over 6 pane double hung window. A window is at high level on the rear wall. Internally, the police office is lined with v-jointed boards. The building is a rare surviving nineteenth century police office. =Case Cottage= Case Cottage is a late nineteenth-century hipped-roof cottage. One room deep, it has a bullnose verandah on the front which meets with the main roof. The roof is of corrugated steel and the walls are five-inch-wide sawn boards. 2 over 2 pane double-hung windows flank the central four-panelled door. The verandah is supported on stop-chamfered posts. The unique feature of Case Cottage is inside the cottage. The internal dividing wall can be removed to make a larger single space which served as the venue for local dances, with music being provided by the Case family, who made up the local band. The main room of the cottage has a pressed metal ceiling, and wall. =Riverstone General Store= The general store is a mid-Victorian commercial building which once stood in Riverstone. It is a single-storey building with a steep gable facing the street. A broad verandah provides shelter on the front of the building. Early photos thought to be of the shop suggest it was once at least two bays wide and has been reduced to the present single gable. The original shopfront survives and features a recessed entry, timber framing, with the shop windows divided into large vertical panes. Recessed panels are below the shopfront. The shop doors are a pair of French doors with 2 panes and small kick panels. Internally, the shop is lined with wide beaded boards, except on the left side, where the v-jointed boards suggest the earlier extension to the side. The footpath outside the shop is flagged with bricks reportedly salvaged from a well. The verandah has timber posts with vertical grooves. A valance of pointed end boards is a partial reconstruction, the original verandah having a curved valance. =St Matthew's Anglican Church= St Matthew's Church from Upper Macdonald is a Federation carpenter gothic church. It is a simple gabled building with a gabled entry porch on one side. The church has a corrugated steel roof and splayed weatherboard cladding. The windows have pointed arched glazing divided into small panes inside rectangular openings. A four panel door to the porch has a toplight in a pointed arch opening. A tall window is in the end wall. A cross finial at one end has lost the cross member. =Marsden Park Public School= The public school is a two classroom school building of a pattern typical of the turn of the century. It has a gabled roof and a separate skillion roofed verandah, now enclosed. The roof is sheeted with corrugated steel and the building is clad with rusticated weatherboards. The gable ends are finished with a timber screen with narrow vertical slots. 6 over 6 pane double hung windows are at the ends of the classrooms and 3 pairs of double hung windows light each room. The enclosed verandah has 4 pane casement windows. =Mitchell Cottage= Mitchell Cottage is a two roomed gabled cottage of the late Victorian period. It has a medium pitched roof of corrugated galvanized steel with a verandah under a skillion roof (broken back to the main roof) on the front and rear. Timber posts at the corners of the cottage are the main structural supports, with vertical boards between. Modern timber battens externally cover the gaps between the slabs. The gable ends are clad with splayed weatherboards. The verandah structure is from the 1970s and the slab balustrade is probably more recent. The cottage has double hung windows (not original) either side of the 4 panelled front door. A brick chimney is external to the cottage on a side wall. =\\"Kenso\\" Cottage= 'Kenso' Cottage is a long gabled cottage which appears to date from the 1920s. The main part of the cottage is one room deep, with a broad skillion at the rear providing additional accommodation. The front verandah is a skillion, separated from the main roof. Its structure and balustrade appear to be a reproduction by the museum. The cottage is clad with wide rusticated weatherboards. A high waisted door is on the right side of the front. Windows are paired casements. Internally the cottage has v-jointed boards and its original timber floor. Advertising signs painted on the gable and verandah end are associated with the museum. =Hastwell's Residence and North Sackville Post Office= The post office and residence is a rare example of a vernacular cottage adapted for use as a rural post office. The original cottage is a simple gabled building with a slab and tin chimney at one end. Double hung windows flank the ledged and sheeted door. The cottage is clad with splayed weatherboards. At the opposite end to the chimney, a wide skillion has been added to house the post office. It is clad with splayed weatherboards, narrower than those of the main cottage. The roof has a broad eave to provide some shelter to the counter opening at the end of the office. The counter is sealed with a boarded timber flap which is folded down when the office is open. The cottage is lined with jute bags. =Kurrajong Railway Goods Shed= The shed from Kurrajong Railway Goods Shed is a simple gabled railway shed enclosed at one end to provide a goods room. The roof is of corrugated steel and the walls to the goods room are clad in wide rusticated weatherboards. The shed is supported on timber posts. The gable is finished with plain barge boards. The valance has timber boards with mitred corners. A modern skillion on one side of the shed has been added to provide additional shelter for the railway in the museum. ='Bank of Australasia'= The building presented as the \\"Bank of Australasia\\" is a simple gabled building, reportedly once used as a garage and relocated to the museum from a nearby site. It has a roof of corrugated steel, simple barge boards and splayed weatherboard cladding to the sides and rear, probably dating from the early twentieth century. The front of the building has an arched 4 panelled door and large arched double-hung window. The front has a mixture of cladding including wider splayed weatherboards, and beaded boards, suggesting it has been made up of salvaged materials. The cladding in the gable matches that of the sides and rear. The building is lined with double v-jointed boards. =Aiken Hut= Aiken Hut is the only building in the group not associated with the Hawkesbury district. It is similar to the other vernacular cottages in the group in being a single storey two room cottage. It has a gabled roof of corrugated steel and a skillion verandah, broken back to the main roof. The walls of the cottage are of timber slabs. Tin strips to cover the gaps between the slabs were probably added by the museum. The verandah is supported on timber posts. The front door is ledged and sheeted. Casement windows either side of the door are not original to the building.  Heritage listing  Australiana Pioneer Village [APV] is a rare example in New South Wales of the worldwide interest in the 1960s and 1970s in creating heritage places by transferring historic buildings from elsewhere to a single site for educational purposes. The high local value of the 18 individual buildings, 15 of them nineteenth-century which were re-erected at Australiana Pioneer Village, enhanced by a major Victorian barn in situ and by the adjacent Rose Cottage, a Macquarie-period slab cottage listed on the State Heritage Register, is transmuted into State significance because the whole is more important than the sum of its parts and the siting of the village is on the historic curtilage of Rose Cottage. All the buildings bodily transferred, without dismantling, were at risk and would certainly have been demolished over the last thirty years if not rescued: one had a history of relocation and the others meet the requirement of the 1999 Burra Charter's article 9 that removal \\"is the sole practical means of ensuring [their] survival\\", that removal should be \\"to an appropriate location\\" and that the items should be \\"given an appropriate use\\". The village created in 1970 by the vision of one man has attracted fierce loyalties among the families originally associated with the buildings and among a wide range of people, local, national and international, who value the place for its educational and historical attributes. The cross-section of rural life presented at Australiana Pioneer Village, including the cultural diversity, Aboriginal, Jamaican and German as well as Anglo-Celtic, represented in the origins of its component parts, has attracted an annual visitation exceeding 30,000 and has been successful with school groups from a wide catchment. As an open-air museum of buildings and activities associated with early Australian domestic life in the country and with rural trades and services, not available elsewhere in the state, APV has an important role at the state level. Unlike Lachlan Vintage Village at Forbes and Old Sydney Town at Somerton, hardly any of the buildings are reproduction and at Australiana Pioneer Village these original buildings are supported by associated artefacts in a major collection of provenanced moveable heritage. Australiana Pioneer Village demonstrates to a wide audience human activity that is in grave danger of being lost and is outstanding because of its integrity and the community esteem in which it is held. Australiana Pioneer Village was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 February 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Australiana Pioneer Village (APV) consists of two buildings still on their original sites, eighteen buildings brought from elsewhere in the north-west sector of greater Sydney, five replica buildings and five supporting constructions, including toilets. The site is part of the original curtilage of Rose Cottage, a slab building of the Macquarie period already on the NSW State Heritage Register, which is immediately adjacent to APV but in the ownership of a separate private trust. Created in 1970 by the vision of a distinguished local sportsman and heritage enthusiast, Dugald (Bill) McLachlan, APV is a strikingly successful example of the genre, popular in the 1960s and 1970s, of creating artificial educational conglomerations of historic buildings removed from their original sites. Examples can be found in Britain, in many European countries and in the US, where they form a distinctive and often distinguished part of heritage presentation. The removal of buildings from their context is, of course, now recognised as a second-best to their retention in situ, but the Burra Charter (article 9) specifically provides for removal if this is the only means of ensuring the survival of the structure. Removal does not extinguish heritage values, although these values are modified and changed by the act of removal and re-erection. In the case of APV, 18 out of 20 individual buildings with heritage significance had this significance modified by the act of removal, but few, if any, of them would have survived the last thirty years on their original sites: most were derelict and at grave risk when McLachlan acquired them around 1970. They were, moreover, moved intact to their new home at Wilberforce by low-loader, not dismantled and then reconstructed at APV, which enhances their degree of integrity. The act of removal of many of the buildings was documented on a film made by McLachlan and now available on video. It is important to note that the physical relocation of buildings for residential or other purposes generally has been a common feature of rural existence in the state for over a century. One of the houses in APV, moreover, the so-called \\"Kenso\\" cottage was itself originally built in Kogarah but was moved to Freemans Reach as a residence twenty years before it was finally transferred to Wilberforce. The APV shows evidence of a wide range of significant human activity in rural Australia in Victorian times; is associated with significant activities on the land and with other provision of necessary services for farming communities in nineteenth-century Australia; and, not least, shows the continuity of the historical process of living on and with the land in one of the most significant cultural landscapes in the country. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. APV was the creation of Dugald (Bill) McLachlan (1917–1971), an industrial chemist who has significance as a pioneer of water-skiing on the Hawkesbury, as well as some fame in car rallies. His knowledge of the old Hawkesbury families, in particular his friendship with the Rose family of Rose Cottage, was fundamental in the acquisition of the various threatened buildings which were transferred to the safekeeping of APV in 1969–70. McLachlan is of regional importance. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Because the riverside site has preserved old trees, planted new native trees and has an attractive natural configuration, the buildings of APV are presented in a pleasing environment, consistent with the nature of predominantly wooden cottages and working premises. The wide dirt single street of the hamlet provides a telling vista of the principal structures and activities, framed by the wooden church at the south end. Signage is unobtrusive and necessary modern intrusions, such as toilets, are discreetly tucked away behind the street. Its present rather run-down condition is consistent with the nineteenth-century Hawkesbury. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The APV has attracted fierce loyalties both among the families originally connected with the buildings themselves and among a wide range of people who value the place for its educational and historical attribute. The Friends of Australiana Pioneer Village Society has since 1989 been a well-informed and vigorous pressure group maintaining the documentation of the village and its moveable heritage and being a force in trying to preserve the values of the village from inadequacies of lessees and perceived failures by the Hawkesbury City Council, the owner since 1984. The Friends and the community have been extremely active on three occasions, most recently in 2002, in attempting to save APV from undesirable fates. Since many of the buildings were originally used by members of identifiable groups, including British free settlers and ex-convicts, Germans brought to Australia in the 1850s to practise their skills as vinedressers, Aboriginal people and a couple of Jamaican settlers, there is an ethnic dimension to the community interest. The village was visited by 30,000 people a year by the late 1980s and was particularly successful with school groups from a wide catchment. In its submission to the Tidy Towns Competition in 1989, the City Council drew attention to the way in which the APV was attracting \\"a substantial tourist market including overseas, interstate and intrastate visitors, day trippers, the schools and social club markets, as well as families, local residents and bus and coach tours\\". Over the past 30 years, APV has featured in the national press from Woman's Day to the Sun-Herald and The Open Road, was used by Telstra for the cover of the regional telephone directory in 1998 and has been featured in many television advertisements and documentaries. The community takes particular additional pride in the hire of the site by major retailing firms such as Grace Bros in its heyday for annual functions involving thousands of people from all over New South Wales, and in the use of APV for market-days on themes such as \\"renovation and home making\\", for the recurrent field days of the Bush-Fire Brigade and for Australia Day commemorations. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. APV is an open-air museum of houses and other buildings, associated with early Australian domestic life in the country and with rural trades and services. As such it is a significant educational tool to provide insights and understanding into Australian history. Its utility to schools is outstanding and its ability to create awareness among the public at large is considerable. The cultural diversity exhibited by the history of the buildings adds substantially to its educational value. At the same time, the survival of these buildings and the research which they have prompted about their original location and the people who were associated with them has made possible on an ongoing basis the acquisition of new knowledge about the social and family history of ordinary rural Australians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This gives APV an important role at the state level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. APV is rare as a single entity in the state: Wauchope Timbertown is more specialised; Old Sydney Town at Somerton is entirely reproduction; the Lachlan Vintage Village at Forbes is largely reproduction. The concentration of slab buildings in APV is unusual and as slab huts and slab barns are proving more and more vulnerable to destruction by neglect or ignorance throughout the state, this distinctive construction style at APV is becoming worryingly rare on country properties. The humble house is always likely to disappear more readily than the grand house and APV specialises in the humble. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The twenty buildings at APV are representative of older rural life in New South Wales. The homes are a remarkable cross-section of the unpretentious cottages occupied by so many members of a farming community in the state in the nineteenth or early twentieth century, while the service buildings give a reasonable sampling of the everyday environment of a country village.

Her production and management company, Fox Meadow Films, produced all three of her feature films and the web series The Other F Word. She also wrote and produced the short film Dream House in 2010. Jentis was selected as one of Good Housekeeping's 50 over 50 in 2016. Early life Jentis graduated from Syracuse University's S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications in 1984 with a degree in film and television. After graduating from Syracuse, Jentis moved to Los Angeles where she worked as a literary agent and in development; her first screenplay was for an ABC movie that never aired. While in California, Jentis had the first of two children while attending UCLA, where she completed her master's degree in 1996. She then moved back to the east coast, moving to Ridgewood, New Jersey where she lived for 20 years. Feature films Jentis wrote and produced her first indie feature And Then Came Love in 2007, which stars Vanessa Williams, Ben Vereen and Eartha Kitt (in her final film appearance). The movie was filmed at her alma mater, Syracuse University, where the chancellor's suite in Lubin House was converted into the apartment where Williams’ character lived. Jentis gave university students the opportunity to be interns, assisting with pre- production and post-production activities. Her directorial debut was in 2011 with the coming-out film The One, starring Jon Prescott, Margaret Anne Florence and Ian Novick, Jentis also produced and wrote the script for the movie. The film is a romantic dramedy about a man who plans to marry a woman, when a month before his wedding, he falls in love with a man from his past. Jentis said she wrote the screenplay \\"after spending several nights with friends discussing true love”, and it was the fastest script she had ever written. Bad Parents, released in 2012, is based on her award-winning play It’s All About the Kids, and was produced, written and directed by Jentis. The film stars Janeane Garofalo, Cheri Oteri and Kristen Johnston, and was inspired by Jentis' personal experiences as a soccer mom. The film was shot entirely in New Jersey and used several kids from local soccer teams in the area where Jentis once lived as talent for the feature. Jentis said making the film \\"was cathartic to go through,\\" and it's \\"absurd behavior, but it's stuff that's not far from the truth\\". The movie won Best Feature Film in 2013 at the Hoboken International Film Festival. ;Short films In 2010 Jentis wrote and produced Dream House, a short directed by Darien Sills-Evans, that explores the dark side of the suburban dream. Web series Jentis is the creator and director of The Other F Word, a comedy web series that premiered in September 2016 on Amazon Prime. The series is set in New York City, where Jentis now resides, and stars Steve Guttenberg, Judy Gold, Michael Boatman, Gilbert Gottfried and Reiko Aylesworth. The show is produced by her company, Fox Meadow Films, and follows four women aged 40 and 50-something, who are dealing with starting over after their kids are grown. The episodes are extremely short, with none running longer than 20 minutes. According to Jentis, the \\"F\\" in the show stands for being in your forties, fifty, friendship, fearless, family and fun. Jentis also went out of her way to include many commercial products in the series that were developed by women entrepreneurs. Season 1 was a top-ranked show on Amazon for over 4 months, season 2 premiered in September 2017.

History  The 1929 Yanco Weir was built 1928-9 to divert flows from the Murrumbidgee River to the Yanko, Colombo and Billabong Creeks System for irrigation. In 1980 the Weir was reconstructed and its diversion capacity was enlarged to per year. This increased capacity has resulted in significant increase in irrigation development along the creek system. , a new weir was erected nearby at the diversion, and the 1929 weir was concreted over. The 1929 weir is now not in operation. The site of the 1929 weir contains many remnants of early structure.  Description  The 1929 Yanco Weir is located approximately downstream of Narrandera. The Weir measures between abutments. It consists of concrete sill floor surmounted by several concrete piers of about high. The concrete sill floor, originally reinforced with timber piles and sheet pilings, has been further reinforced with concrete piles and sheet piling during the 1980 reconstruction. The weir has been concreted over due to the commencement in usage of the new weir constructed nearby.

The first farms were taken up in 1960.DLWC S170 Register  Description  The Gogeldrie Weir is one of seven major weirs on the Murrumbidgee River. It is approximately downstream of Narrandera. The weir is between abutments. The weir structure comprises concrete sill floor reinforced with steel sheet piling cut-off walls, the floor is surmounted by concrete piers and steel superstructure providing supports for the steel sluice gates. There are six gates each measuring high and wide, weighing . The gates are opened individually by electric motors placed centrally between piers. The gates move vertically and the counterweights drop into the counterweight wells allowed for in each of the concrete piers. The original gate control meter has been replaced by computerised meter in 1996.

It became the foundation of today's Museum of Musical Instruments of Leipzig University. Hinrichsen was a nationally-minded German who had been recognized by Wilhelm II, the German emperor. He therefore felt safe in the changed environment of the 1930s. In 1938, he lost ownership of the publishing house as a result of the Arisierung laws.Zeraschi, Helmut: Geschichte des Museums, in: Schriftenreihe des Musikinstrumenten-Museums der Karl-Marx-Universität, Vol. 2. Leipzig: Musikinstrumenten-Museum der Karl-Marx-Universität 1977. In 1940, he travelled to Brussels and applied for visas for England and the United States. His son Max Hinrichsen (1901–1965) had already emigrated in the 1930s and founded the Peters Edition in London. His other son, Walter Hinrichsen (1907–1969), had left Germany in 1936 and founded the C.F. Peters Corporation in New York City. Henri Hinrichsen did not receive a visa. His wife died in Brussels on 7 October 1941, because as a Jew she could not get insulin to treat her diabetes. Henri Hinrichsen was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was murdered on 17 September 1942.  Awards and honors  On 29 May 1929, Hinrichsen received an honorary doctorate from the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Leipzig. In 1949, Arnold Schoenberg dedicated a revised version of his Fünf Orchesterstücke, Op. 16, to his memory: \\"This new edition is dedicated to the memory of Henri Hinrichsen, a music publisher who was a great seigneur.\\" After the grave monument of the Abraham/Hinrichsen family in the Südfriedhof was razed in the 1980s, a statue recalling the former location was erected in 1992. A bust of Hinrichsen is displayed in a staircase of the Grassi Museum in Leipzig. In 2001, a street in Leipzig's Waldstraßenviertel was named after him.

Work on the new structure began in 2016, and is expected to be completed in 2020. Design  Original building  The original 425 Park Avenue The original building was designed by Kahn & Jacobs. Modernist in style, it replaced a row of sixteen four-story townhouses built by Robert Goelet in 1871. The construction of the building began in 1954, on land leased from the Robert Walton Goelet estate, who died in 1941. At the time of the construction, it was one of the tallest buildings that utilized the bolted connections. The 32-story building was open in 1957 with National Biscuit Company, Kaye Scholer, Chemical Corn Exchange Bank as major tenants. Since 2004, L&L; Holding, which was founded in 2000, had been trying to redevelop 425 Park Avenue when the Goelet family intended to sell a 33% stake of the property. After an extended negotiation, L&L;, in partnership with Lehman Brothers, entered into a 84-year ground lease deal with the Goelet family in 2006 that was valued at $320 million with a large upfront payment. The lease allowed L&L; to redevelop the easterly block of Park Avenue between 55th street and 56th street after the existing leases with the building tenants expired in 2015. During the predevelopment phase, Lehman Brothers went into a bankruptcy in 2008. L&L; attempted to buy Lehman Brothers out at a steep discount, but Lehman Brothers opted to continue funding the project through its bankruptcy with the original financial obligations. However, in 2013, L&L;, GreenOak Real Estate, and other investors bought 90% of Lehman Brothers’ stake in the project, allowing L&L; to have a full control of the redevelopment.  Redesigned building  L&L; designed the new building under the assumption that it would keep 25% of its former structure in order to keep the total floor area of 670,000 square feet. L&L; chose Foster + Partners to design the building after a competition to choose an architect. L&L; solicited bids from 11 architectural firms. These entries were narrowed to four final proposals, from Zaha Hadid Architects, Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, OMA, and Foster + Partners. Each incorporated a portion of the original structure. Real estate news site YIMBY noted that, due to its three roughly 200-foot concrete fins, the Foster plan would have \\"[...] the most pronounced skyline effect\\" compared to the other proposals. Another key element of Foster + Partners design was the three tiers of very high ceiling and virtually column-free floor space. Zoning The 425 Park Avenue is located in the eastern part of the Midtown Manhattan. The area, which is generally stretched from East 39th Street to East 57th Street, and from Third Avenue to Madison Avenue, is one of the main business districts in Manhattan with more than 400 office buildings. The 1961 Zoning Resolution restricted the size of the buildings based on floor area ratio (FAR), not the heights. As many as 300 office buildings in the area were built before 1961 with an average age of 73 years. The older building stock made the area become less competitive in the modern office space market due to the low ceiling and less open floor space by the obstruction of many columns in those buildings. The 1961 zoning was more restrictive than prior rules with low allowable FAR to make the area less dense. Many of those pre-1961 office buildings were considered overbuilt as the floor area amounts exceeded the allowable amounts per the 1961 zoning, but they were grandfathered. If the owners of those buildings would have demolished an existing building to build a new one on the site, the new building would have less floor space than the original one. This caused a deterrent for redevelopment of those older office buildings. The concern was the reason for the city's East Midtown rezoning plan, which added more air rights in the neighborhood immediately around Grand Central Terminal, thereby encouraging redevelopment. For 425 Park Avenue, without the redevelopment, the building could only generate revenue of about $50 to $70 per square foot. With a more modern building, the revenue could be boosted to more than $100 per square foot. The 1961 zoning was a major obstacle for its redevelopment. If L&L; would have demolished the building, it could only construct a building with the maximum of 580,000 square feet instead of the original 670,000 square feet. However, there was an exception to the 1961 zoning rules. If a redevelopment of a pre-1961 building could retain at least 25% of its original structure, the new building would be permitted to have up to the original square footage. This was an option that L&L; explored, but the rezoning occurred only after L&L; had already commissioned a design. Development A $556 million construction loan is secured by the property.The new base with the floor slabs connected to the new columns, and the old columns cut off. Preserving the original structure led to difficulties during construction, requiring the developer to hire a third engineering firm to help orchestrate the sequence of demolition and construction. The first step was to completely demolish floor by floor from the top floor to the 18th floor. Temporary steel structures were then installed to support the remaining 17 floors before further demolition. As much as 750 tons of wind bracings, crane-bracing systems, shoring systems and temporary trusses were put in place. Installing these large temporary steel structures in the middle of a partially demolished building proven to be a challenging and time-consuming process. After the installation, the rear side of the building was demolished. Twelve new jumbo columns were erected, six as exterior columns at the front of the building and the other six at the center of the building. The new building core was also built at the rear to connect to every other floor that would be remained in the new building. The rest of the unconnected floor slabs were demolished creating high ceiling floors at the base. The work continued on the building core at the rear, and new floors were built atop the old structure. There was a waiting period of many months when more floors were built upward before the removal of the original columns and the temporary steel structures at the base, leaving those floors to be supported by 12 jumbo columns and the new building core only. As of April 2018, the building was halfway to its full height. Facade installation began in June 2018, when the building was 22 floors from topping out. The building topped out on December 4th, 2018, in a ceremony attended by lead architect Lord Norman Foster. Tenants L&L; intended not to pre-lease the building, but in early 2016, hedge fund Citadel signed a lease for 200,000 square feet across several floors, including the penthouse floor. At the time it was signed, it was the most expensive lease in the city's history. Delays in construction have led some to speculate that Citadel may back out of the lease, or that it was seeking temporary offices due to the delays. L&L; has asserted that the tenant will move in as planned. These concerns were officially allayed in January 2019 when Citadel executed a lease expansion for another of space, bringing their total occupancy to 16 floors of the building. The expansion will see Citadel occupy a total of , or 48% of the building's space. The founders of restaurant Eleven Madison Park will open two restaurants in the building, originally announced in 2015. One will be two stories tall, in the building's base, totaling roughly 14,000 square feet. According to L&L;'s founder, David Levinson, the intention is for the restaurant to be \\"[...] a Four Seasons on steroids for the 21st century\\". The other restaurant will be open only to tenants, and will be located on the 27th floor. Despite construction delays, both venues are still expected to open when construction is complete as of June 2018.

A 19th century short-lived state ruled by the infamous Swahili slave trader Tippu Tip (Hamad al Murjebi) and his son Sefu. The capital of the state was the town of Kasongo. Tippu Tip's controlled territory reached as far to eastern Kasai and to Aruwimi Basin in the west. By the mid 19th century, the Arab traders arrived from the east African coast, in what was under the control of the Sultanate of Zanzibar. While the Arab traders were already engaged in important and different trade activities, they continued searching for ivory and slaves. Arab settlements in the African interior and trade stations were to be found in many locations, including the most important trade stations at Lualaba, Nyangwe and Kasongo. The Arab traders and explorers were not interested in converting locals to their faith, nor did they seek to bond with local chiefs, but rather to establish trading stations and regular flow of trading goods to Zanzibar.

Early life  Jeanette Solstad Remø was born in the 1950s. Remø left home at 17 and married in her early twenties. She and her wife had a son. Remø later enlisted in the Navy and became a Captain at 27.  Activism  Remø joined the Norwegian Association for Transgender people (FTP-N) in 1986. She came out as a transgender woman in 2010. At the time, she was able to change her legal name but not her legal gender. From the 1970s until 2015, transgender people in Norway were able to obtain legal recognition of their gender on the basis of compulsory treatments, including gender affirming surgery and removal of reproductive organs, resulting in irreversible sterilization. Trans people seeking legal gender recognition were required to obtain a psychiatric diagnosis stating that they suffer from a mental disorder. Remø rejected these terms. As a result, she could not obtain identity papers that recognised her identity as a woman. As an activist, Remø used the name \\"John Jeanette\\" to highlight the discrimination Norwegian transgender people faced in accessing legal gender recognition. She actively campaigned for an end to the policy. In 2014, her personal story was included in Amnesty International's \\"Write for Rights\\" campaign, and she was supported by thousands worldwide.  Policy change  Activism eventually paid off. On 10 April 2015, the Norwegian Ministry of Health’s Expert Committee on legal gender recognition presented its recommendations and recommended the policy be amended. On 6 June 2016, the Norwegian Parliament approved a new law regulating gender recognition based on self-determination, which came into force on 1 July 2016. The law removed all requirements for psychiatric diagnosis, medical interventions including surgeries and sterilization; this process is accessible to all above age 16 and with consent from at least one parent for people aged 6 to 15.

As the Rector of the Lublin Higher School of Agriculture, he led the formation of the first Chair of Soil Science in Poland. Dobrzański was a pioneer of agrophysics in Poland, a founder and long- time director of the Institute of Agrophysics in Lublin, and the Polish Journal of Soil Science. He is a co-author of the official Table of Land Classes and criteria for valorisation of agricultural production areas. He was awarded a number of prizes and medals including The Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. Life and education Bohdan Dobrzański was born in Strutynka (), a village in the district of Ananyiv Raion, in the province of Odessa Oblast, Ukraine. He was the son of Stanisław Dobrzański and Zofia née Mianowska. His father was a property administrator. In 1922, he moved to Poland and settled in Puławy with his mother. His father died of typhus during the move. In 1929, after finishing high school in Puławy, he started his studies at the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry in Lviv Polytechnic (at the time, Lviv was part of Poland, nowadays it is in Ukraine). In 1933, after graduating, he worked as an agricultural instructor in the Lviv Agricultural Office. At the same time, he held a position as an assistant in the Department of Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, Lviv Polytechnic, then headed by Arkadiusz Musierowicz, with headquarters in Dubliany near Lviv. In 1939, he obtained a PhD in Agricultural Science. That same year, after the invasion of the Red Army into Eastern Poland, he decided to remain at the university as a docent. In 1941, after the occupation of Lviv by the Nazi army, he moved to Podolia, where he worked in one of the forestry districts. At the end of 1944 he got employed by the Agricultural Office in Rzeszów, where he organized agricultural courses. After the war, Dobrzański moved to Warsaw where he became an adjunct in the Warsaw University of Life Sciences. Around that time, he often traveled to Rzeszów, where from 1945 he was the director of the Agricultural Office. In 1946, after moving Prof. Jan Tomaszewski to Wrocław, to the Maria Curie-Skłodowska University (UMCS) in Lublin, the head position of the Department of Soil Science at the Faculty of Agriculture had become vacant. Dobrzański took it as assistant professor. At the same time, he became the curator of the Department of Plant Fertilization and Nutrition; he held this position until 1949. In 1949 he presented his habilitation thesis about loess soils of the northern edge of Podolia and their properties, and became doctor habilitatus. In 1951 he became an associate professor, and in 1956 full-time professor. In 1955 he joined the organization of the Lublin Higher School of Agriculture, which was established from the Faculty of Agriculture, Veterinary and Zootechnic UMCS (nowadays University of Life Sciences in Lublin). For the next four years he was the rector there. In 1955 he led the establishment of the first Chair of Soil Science in Poland, at the Faculty of Biology and Earth Sciences of the Lublin Higher School of Agriculture. Dobrzański also created and managed the Laboratory of Soil Science at the Institute for Land Reclamation and Grassland Farming in Lublin. From 1957 until 1962, he was the deputy secretary of Division 5 of the Polish Academy of Sciences. In 1960 he became a correspondent member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and in 1969 a full member. In 1968 Dobrzański initiated the founding of the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lublin, where he served as director till 1980. There he created a new research field: the physics of plants and crops. In 1969, he was honored with the title of doctor honoris causa (honorary doctor) of the Lublin Higher School of Agriculture. In the same year, he became secretary general of the Polish Academy of Sciences and head of the Department of Soil Science, Warsaw University of Life Sciences. Because of that he moved to Warsaw. In 1970 the Department became the Institute of Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry; Dobrzański directed it until 1979. In 1980 he became the honorary doctor of Maria Curie-Skłodowska University, and six years later of the Academy of Agriculture and Technology in Olsztyn. Dobrzański was also an honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences of the USSR and the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of the GDR. Dobrzański died on July 15, 1987, in Warsaw and was buried in the Powązki Cemetery. Work Dobrzański was the author or co-author of over 350 publications, including over 160 research papers. They were mainly about the genesis and evolution of soil, as well as human influences on their properties. He also dealt with soil cartography and co-authored every major cartographic study that appeared in Poland from 1949 to 1987. In 1968 he established the Polish Journal of Soil Science and managed it until 1987.

She was one of the best two-year-old fillies in Europe in 2018 when her wins included the Marble Hill Stakes, Lowther Stakes and Cheveley Park Stakes. In the following year she won the Flying Five Stakes and ran well in several major sprint races. Background Fairyland is a bay filly with a white star bred in Ireland by the Tally-Ho Stud. In October 2017 the yearling filly was offered for sale at Tattersalls and was bought for 925,000 guineas by Michael Magnier of behalf of his father, John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation. The filly was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of her ownership changed from race to race: he has sometimes been listed as being the property of Evie Stockwell (John Magnier's mother), while on other occasions she was described as being owned by a partnership comprising Stockwell, Derrick Smith and Michael Tabor. She was sired by Kodiac, a sprinter who won four minor races from twenty starts and finished second in the Hackwood Stakes and fourth in the Prix Maurice de Gheest. His other foals have included Tiggy Wiggy, Best Solution (Grosser Preis von Baden) Gifted Master (Stewards' Cup) and Kodi Bear (Celebration Mile). Fairyland's dam Queenofthefairies, a half-sister to Dream Ahead, did not race, but produced at least two other winners including Now Or Never (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial). She is a distant female-line descendant of Cantrip, a full sister to the Epsom Derby winner Aboyeur. Racing career 2018: two-year-old season Fairyland was ridden by Ryan Moore when she made her racecourse debut in a six furlong maiden race at Naas Racecourse on 7 May and started at odds of 3/1 in a ten-runner field. She raced close to the leaders from the start, took the advantage a furlong from the finish and won \\"comfortably\\" by one and three quarter lengths. Nineteen days later the filly was stepped up in class and matched against male opposition in the Listed Marble Hill Stakes over the same distance at the Curragh in which she was partnered by Seamie Heffernan. After tracking the front-runners she took the lead in the last quarter mile and drew away to win by two and a half lengths and a neck from her stablemates Van Beethoven and Land Force. The second and third placed horses went on to win the Railway Stakes and the Richmond Stakes respectively. Heffernan was again in the saddle when the filly was sent to England to contest the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot and started the 5/2 second favourite against seventeen opponents. Racing on the far side of the straight course (the right-hand side from the jockeys' view) she finished a close third behind Main Edition and La Pelosa, both of whom raced on the opposite side of the track. In the aftermath of the race she was reported to be \\"under the weather\\" as many of the Ballydoyle horses were affected by a viral infection. After a break of two months, Fairyland returned for the Lowther Stakes at York Racecourse and started 6/4 favourite ahead of the Princess Margaret Stakes winner Angel's Hideaway. Ridden by Moore she led for most of the way and after being headed by The Mackem Bullet inside the furlong she rallied in the final strides to regain the advantage and win by a nose. After the race O'Brien said \\"I'm delighted with her. She did get headed so it was great to see her battle back... She's a lovely filly and [the Cheveley Park Stakes] is the way we'll be heading... she's a big, rangy filly – she looks more like a three-year-old than a two-year-old\\". On 29 September Fairyland, ridden by Donnacha O'Brien, started at odds of 6/1 for the Group 1 Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. Her ten opponents included Pretty Pollyanna (winner of the Prix Morny), So Perfect (Grangecon Stud Stakes), Lady Kaya (second in the Moyglare Stud Stakes), Signora Cabello (Queen Mary Stakes, Prix Robert Papin), Queen of Bermuda (Firth of Clyde Stakes), Angel's Hideaway and The Mackem Bullet. After tracking the leaders she took the lead just inside the final furlong and kept on strongly to win by a neck from The Mackem Bullet with So Perfect half a length away in third place. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"We thought she would come forward from York and she did. She's a lovely, big filly and has loads of speed. Donnacha gave her a peach of a ride. We always thought she would maybe get a mile but she's not short of speed and has a lovely mind. We probably wouldn't run her again this season\\". 2019: three-year-old season On her three-year-old debut Fairyland was ridden by Frankie Dettori when she was one of fifteen fillies to contest the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket on 5 May. Starting the 15/2 fifth choice in the betting she raced in mid-division before keeping well under pressure to finish fifth behind Hermosa, Lady Kaya, Qabala and Angel's Hideaway. In the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh she never looked likely to win and came home sixth behind Hermosa, beaten more than eight lengths by the winner. Fairyland was dropped back to sprint distances for the King's Stand Stakes over five furlongs at Royal Ascot and finished fifth behind Blue Point, Battaash, Soldier's Call and Mabs Cross. On her next race she contested the six-furlong July Cup at Newmarket in which she ran third to the colts Ten Sovereigns and Advertise. In the Nunthorpe Stakes at York of 23 August Fairyland failed to recover from a poor start and trailed home tenth of the eleven runners in a race won by Battaash. The filly maintained her busy schedule in the Haydock Sprint Cup on 7 September when she ran sixth to Hello Youmzain beaten just over three lengths by the winner. Eight days after her defeat at Haydock Fairyland was partnered by Ryan Moore when she started at odds for 12/1 for the Group 1 Flying Five Stakes at the Curragh. Soffia (Sapphire Stakes) started favourite while the other seven runners included Mabs Cross, Soldier's Call, Houtzen (P J Bell Stakes), Invincible Army (Duke of York Stakes) and So Perfect (Lacken Stakes). After settling just behind the leaders Fairyland overtook the front-running outsider Caspian Prince approaching the final furlong and kept on well to hold off the late challenge of her stablemate So Perfect to win by a short head. O'Brien commented \\"Her best run of the year was back at five at Ascot in the King's Stand. The ground was too soft for her at Haydock and she got upset in the stalls and banged her head before that at York. You would have to be delighted.\\" Fairyland ran in France for the first time on 6 October when she contested the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres on very soft ground at Longchamp Racecourse but never looked likely to win and came home tenth behind Glass Slippers.

Col. Samuel Bayard was charged with murdering one of his own officers in the ranger unit. Bayard was tried and found guilty of manslaughter in October, and sentenced to be suspended for three months and then removed from his command. This sentence was overturned on a technicality by the Judge Advocate General,\\"King's Orange Rangers\\", John G. Leefe, Liverpool 1996, p 3 but probably played a role in Bayard's subsequent difficulties in retaining his command. On November 17, 1778 the KOR arrived by sea at Halifax, Nova Scotia.King 1996, p 4 The reason for the transfer was probably to stem the rate of desertion by relocating the men to a place much farther away from their homes. The KOR was assigned to protect the Eastern Battery on the shore of Halifax harbour at the north end of Eastern Passage, where the community of Imperoyal now exists. At the end of 1779, Lt. Col. Bayard learned of a plan to merge the KOR with the Royal Fencible Americans, which would entail Bayard losing his command. He wrote in protest to Brig. Gen. Francis McLean (British army officer), noting that he had already given up his commission with the 60th Regiment of Foot, and that the KOR currently had more men than the RFA. He wrote a similar letter to Sir Henry Clinton, the British C-in-C in North America. Clinton decided not to proceed with the plan at that time, but Bayard's position remained insecure.  Liverpool  In the 1770s, Liverpool was the second-largest settlement in Nova Scotia, after Halifax. Unlike Halifax, nearly everyone in Liverpool was a New England Planter. The town was at first sympathetic to the cause of the American Revolution, with outlying outports like Port Medway and Port Mouton almost continuously visited by American privateers,Brebner. Neutral Yankees. 334-335 but after repeated attacks by American privateers on local shipping interests and one direct attack on the town itself, Liverpool citizens turned against the rebellion. Simeon Perkins wrote a successful appeal to the authorities in Halifax, and on December 13, 1778 Capt. John Howard's company of the Samuel Bayard regiment arrived aboard the transport Hannah. The company consisted of Howard, 2 lieutenants, 1 ensign, 3 sergeants, 2 or 3 corporals, 48 privates, and several camp followers, both women and children.http://www.royalprovincial.com/reenactors/groups/kor.shtml\\"King's Orange Rangers\\", John G.

In the spring of 1781, Major Samuel Bayard was ordered to take a detachment of Rangers overland from Halifax to Fort Hughes (Nova Scotia) to overawe local Planters who were planning to erect a Liberty Pole and thereby break with the King. There they fixed bayonets and \\"with bright weapons glittering, colours flying and drums beating, they marched up Church Street and back to Town Plot, where the barracks stood.\\" This show of force brought the locals back in line.

It was developed from the tradition of nationalism, Islamism, and conservative democracy. The UPD party is one of the largest Somali political parties and some leading members of the party were former members of the government of former Somali presidents Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. UPD is also a member of the Forum for National Parties which is led by Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. As of October 2018, Mohamud was the leader of the UPD. In 2018, while the UPD was being formed, it was awarded a registration certificate, and the party was officially unveiled on 4 October 2018. The first official gathering will take place in mid April 2019 where it is supposed to elect a new leader of the party, executive members and central body of the party. Vision According to the party: \\"The Union for Peace and Development hereafter abbreviated as UPD is a political party formed and led by a team of professional, visionary and forward looking men and women. The founding of UPD is informed and motivated by the overarching need to provide leadership geared to building a stable and progressive Somalia where every citizen, young and old can live and make a living. It is our understanding that the evolving dynamics in the management of state affairs require competent, professional and loyal leaders who are committed to giving their most and best to nation building. As we establish the building blocks of our party which unveiled, we are thoroughly seized of the need to choose the right men and women to steer the party and prepare ground to take the leadership of this country during the 2020 elections. We have learnt from the mistakes and misgivings of previous leaderships including the current one and are of the view that only individuals who have the country at heart can deliver the aspirations and expectations of many a Somali citizen. Based on these experiences, UPD is composed of individuals across the societal spectrum drawing expertise from the youth, women, politicians and experts in various fields. These individuals jointly form the synergy to deliver in line with our manifesto and expectations of Somalis at large. UPD is founded on the principles of democracy, understanding and compromise. Dispute resolution has remained a distant shot in Somalia making it difficult to end vicious conflicts which have claimed thousands of lives. Our party is charting a new path which we believe can immensely contribute to building a peaceful society. Our decision to agree without reservations to change our party name following concerns we received attest to the quality of leadership our party is composed of. Initially, we had named our party as Union for Peace and Democracy. However, a citizen of this country objected to our choice on grounds that there already existed a party with similar names. In effect therefore, we changed our party name to Union for Peace and Development. In March 2019, the national party convention bringing together party delegates and interim leadership will come together to elect substantive office holders for all positions as set out in the party structure. The electoral process shall be transparent, accountable and verifiable to ensure we not only have the right people for the job but also set the standard for political party leadership in the country. We firmly believe that transparency must start at the party level. We can only think and speak of credible elections at the national level when we are able to exercise the same at political party level. Critical in our party leadership will be the role of women and youth. Our party leadership system is structured to give young people and women the right to bring in their talent, experience and expertise in managing the party and in effect inspire further affirmative actions as we prepare to take over leadership of this country. Going forward, UPD will reach out to Somalis across the country and in diaspora to explain what we stand and to register those who wish to voluntarily join.\\" References Political parties in Somalia Political parties established in 2018 Islamic political parties in Somalia Islamic democratic political parties ","title":"Union for Peace and Development Party"},{"id":"58733646","title":"Skylight (Pinegrove album)"},{"id":"58733656","text":"{{Infobox hospital name = Venice Regional Bayfront Health org/group = Community Health Systems logo = logo_size = image = File:Venice Regional Bayfront Health.jpg image_size = alt = caption = map_type = relief = map_size = map_alt = map_caption = location = 540 The Rialto region = Venice state = Florida country = US coordinates = healthcare = Private funding = For-profit type = General religious_affiliation = affiliation = patron = network = standards = Joint Commission emergency = Yes beds = 312 speciality = helipad = h1-number = h1-length-f = h1-length-m = h1-surface = founded = closed = demolished = website = other_links = module = }} Venice Regional Bayfront Health is a private 312-bed health care facility located in Venice, Florida.

She reverted to her maiden name in 1929. Early life Forbes was born at 8 Grafton Street, Mayfair, the youngest daughter of Robert St Clair- Erskine, 4th Earl of Rosslyn and Blanche Adeliza FitzRoy. Her sisters were Millicent Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland and Sybil Fane, Countess of Westmorland, and her brothers were the 5th Earl of Rosslyn and Alexander FitzRoy St Clair-Erskine.

Forbes grew up at Dysart, Fife, near Kirkcaldy, and at Lady Anne's House near Stamford, Lincolnshire, now Lady Anne's Hotel. She was educated by German governesses. She grew to a height of almost six feet and was considered vivacious rather than pretty, unlike her sisters. She resisted finishing her education in Germany, explaining that she had no wish to see Germany, having only just \\"escaped from German governesses\\", so she was sent back to the schoolroom in Scotland. Vanity Fair illustration, November 1901 Forbes spent much of her life fox-hunting and shooting, and she was depicted riding side- saddle at a meeting of the Quorn in a Vanity Fair magazine chromolithograph by Cuthbert Bradley.Kirby Gate the Quorn at npg.org.uk, accessed 15 October 2018 In her memoirs, she reveals that she was considered an enfant terrible and that Elinor Glyn used her as the prototype of Elizabeth in her book Visits of Elizabeth (1900).Lady Angela Forbes, Memories and Base Details (London: Hutchinson, 1921), p. 79 Career Married life and after On 28 April 1896, Lady Angela married James Stewart Forbes (1872–1957), an officer of the Imperial Yeomanry, with the use of Stafford House for the occasion,Forbes (1921), p. 85 and they went on to have two daughters, Marigold (born 1897) and Flavia (born 1902). In 1907 they were divorced. Between 1910 and 1912, Forbes published four novels, mainly because she was hard up and needed to make some money. The Publisher magazine said of her novel The Other Woman's Shadow (1912) About 1912, she became the mistress of Lord Elcho, due to a vacancy caused by the death of the Duchess of Leinster, and thus joined the social circle known as the Souls.Arthur Balfour, Mary Elcho, The letters of Arthur Balfour and Lady Elcho, 1885-1917 (Hamilton, 1992), p. 295 Forbes was then living either in her own house at Le Touquet or in Elcho's country house in East Lothian. She has been called \\"a tough, vibrant personality whose language would make a trooper blush\\".Joan Perkin, Women and Marriage in Nineteenth- Century England (2002), p. 109 The writer Edith Sitwell (after Forbes had feuded with her brother Sacheverell) later described her as \\"an elderly gorilla afflicted with sex appeal\\". World War I At the outbreak of the First World War, Lady Angela went as a volunteer to Dr Haden Guest's hospital in Paris, where she took notes for the surgeons. A few weeks later she was in Boulogne and saw trains of wounded soldiers coming in, and was surprised that they were left on the quay for hours with no food or drink. In November 1914 she started a canteen for the soldiers in the station waiting-room. This turned into a string of canteens, formally known as the British Soldiers' Buffets, less formally as \\"Angelinas\\". Every train of wounded men was met by Lady Angela and her volunteers, largely friends and relations. At first, the supplies needed were funded by appeals in the newspapers, but in 1915, both the Red Cross and the British Soldiers' Buffets began to charge for their food and drink. In 1916, Lady Angela opened other canteens in Étaples, the main depôt and transit camp for the British Expeditionary Force in France, to which wounded men returned. One canteen was for the workmen building the British army camp there, another for the British soldiers who were drilled there, and a third in the railway station, feeding men on their way to the front. These canteens were often open all night as well as all day.Lady Angela Forbes, Memories and Base Details (New York: G. H. Doran & Co., 1921)Lady Cynthia Asquith Diaries, 1915–1918. (Hutchinson, 1968), p. 44 From the profits of her canteens, Forbes built fourteen recreational huts for the soldiers. However, senior officers found her abrasive, and Sir Douglas Haig, Commander of the British Expeditionary Force, was hostile to her. A few days after the Étaples mutiny of September 1917, she was ordered to leave the base, without any explanation, at which she protested, to no avail. On 5 February 1918 the case was raised in the House of Lords by her former lover Lord Ribblesdale, and Lord Wemyss (previously Lord Elcho) spoke at length in her defence. Lord Derby, the War Secretary, replied on behalf of the government, recognising Lady Angela's valuable work and her \\"zeal and ability\\".Lady Angela Forbes’s canteen, House of Lords debate on 05 February 1918 at parliament.uk, accessed 13 October 2018 It later transpired that the main accusations against her were that she had used the word \\"damn!\\" and had washed her hair in a canteen. Later life After the war, Forbes started a short-lived training scheme for disabled soldiers, then a dress shop, and also tried to run Lord Wemyss's Gosford House as a hotel. In 1921 she published her first book of memoirs, Memories and Base Details. She reverted to her maiden name by deed poll in 1929.

The hanja is inscribed on both sides of the coin. Words inscribed on the front side is Sangpyeong Tongbo (Hangul: 상평통보, Hanja: 常平通寶), and on the back side, Hoe Dae Dang Baek (Hangul: 호대당백, Hanja: 戶大當百). Hoe (호, 戶) stands for HoeJeo (호조, 戶曹), Joseon's ministry of revenue. Dae (대, 大) is a modifier which may be interpreted as 'the great'. Dang Baek (당백, 當百) means 'this coin worth 100 coins' in reference to the coins of 1 mun. As inscribed, it was worth 100 mun, which values it 100 times more than ordinary yeopjeon, and it would soon caused fatal inflation in the Joseon economy. It was lapsed in April 1867, after only 6 months of use.  History   Issuing  In 1866 (third year of King Gojong's reign), the royal authority of Joseon had decreased in power. To gain back his authority, Heungseon Daewongun planned the rebuilding of Gyeongbok Palace. Also, the military power had to be strengthened in order to protect Joseon from the invasion of Western countries. However, at that time, the financial difficulties of Joseon were serious. So, the government needed to get a large amount of money to proceed that plans and Daewongun ordered to issue new Sangpyeong Tongbo cash coin with a denomination of 100 mun, called the DangBaekJeon, in Hoe Jeo (Hangul: 호조, Hanja: 戶曹), Joseon's ministry of revenue. Also, Daewongun ordered to abandon the Kapsan mountain copper mine which was the largest mine of copper in Joseon, the government needed to solve the problem of supplying ingredients that were needed to make more Sangpyeong Tongbo cash coins. Therefore, the government issued higher valued coins using the same amount of materials. To stimulate the circulation after issuing of DangBaekJeon, the Joseon government ordered to use both DangBaekjeon and lower denomination of the Sangpyeong Tongbo cash coins together at every trade or monetary exchange.  Problems  A size comparison between the dangijeon (2 mun cash coin) and dangbaekjeon (100 mun cash coins). The DangBaekJeon had a lot of serious problems. First, 100 Mun was a big unit for common people. They couldn't use the coins and could only trade with each other. DangBaekJeon was sometimes used in big transactions, but it wasn't necessary for common people, who usually deals in small units. Second, the real value and the nominal value had a big gap. While the nominal value of DangBaekJeon was 100 times as much as the standard 1 mun Sangpyeong Tongbo, the intrinsic value of the coin was only five to six times as much as the value 1 Sangpyeong Tongbo. Since currencies that have a big gap between the real value and the nominal value was hard to be accepted, it was unappreciated from people. Third, the government used DangBaekJeon only as a means of purchasing goods but didn't accept it when they pay taxes. This resulted in a decline in public confidence of the coin. Therefore, as more DangBaekJeon cash coins kept being issued, hyperinflation occurred. The price of one koku (Hangul: 섬, Hanja: 石) of rice (one koku of rice is 144kg), which used to be 7 to 8 nyang (Hangul: 냥, Hanja: 兩), jumped about six times at the beginning of its issue. Some people started to melt Sangpyeong Tongbo and make counterfeit money. People who had Sangpyeong Tongbo avoided to exchange with DangBaekJeon, so they didn't put Sangpyeong Tongbo on the market. As a result, DangBaekJeon became bad money, and lower denomination Sangpyeong Tongbo became good money. This is related to Gresham's law, which is a monetary principle stating that \\"bad money drives out good\\". The introduction of the 100 mun coin happened concurrent with the Tenpō Tsūhō 100 mon coin issued by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1835 (in reaction to government deficit),TAKIZAWA Takeo, (1996) Nihon no Kahei no Rekishi (History of Japanese Currencies) Tokyo, Yoshikawa Kobunkan.

Disposal  The casting of DangBaekJeon was officially stopped on 16 June 1867, after a total of 172 days from the date of first production to the date of their discontinuation. The next year, its distribution was stopped because of an appeal from Choe Ik- hyeon (Hangul: 최익현, Hanja: 崔益鉉), a janglyeong (Hangul:장령, Hanja: 掌令) in Joseon Dynasty. He insisted that the DangBaekJeon adversely affected all classes of Korean society in its two years of circulation. After its distribution had stopped, DangBaekJeon was exchanged with lower denomination Sangpyeong Tongbo cash coins or Chinese money (Hangul: 청전, Hanja: 掌令) and was used in iron. Following the abolition of the Dangbaekjeon, the Korean government introduced the Dangojeon (當五錢, 당오전) in 1883, like the earlier Dangbaekjeon this denomination also caused a sharp decline in the value of coinage which brought a lot of turmoil to the Korean economy. From this point onwards, Japanese currency began to flood the Korean market and the Korean mun began to lose its power.  Estimation  The Dangbaekjeon is a good example of what happens when money is issued ignoring the real value and the nation's chances of guarantee. It did not just end with inflation, it destroyed the economy of Joseon. When the era of Heungseon Daewongun passed and King Gojong started politics, the reduction in armaments brought Ganghwa Island incident. And due to the lack of national finance, the Imo Incident occurred. The Bank of Korea (the central bank of the modern Republic of Korea) is also regarded as a bad history of the issuance policy. The value of Dangbaekjeon was so bad that the people called it Ttangdon (Hangul: 땅돈), and it changes the pronunciation to Ttaengjeon (Hangul: 땡전).

Static and trailer mounted versions of the gun were designated 7.7 cm FlaK L/27.  History  During the Franco-Prussian War, Paris was surrounded by the Prussians and the French attempted to use balloons to smuggle messages and supplies in and out of the besieged city. In response, Krupp developed a 37 mm cannon which was mounted on a pedestal which sat on a four-wheeled horse cart and was designated BallonabwehrKanone or BaK and this was the first practical anti-aircraft gun. Even though armed aircraft were used as early as the Italo-Turkish and Balkan Wars the designation BallonabwehrKanone remained in use until replaced by the more familiar FlugabwehrKanone or FlaK later in the First World War. Designs for dedicated anti-aircraft guns existed before the First World War but few were in service. The idea of a truck-mounted self- propelled anti-aircraft gun also existed since 1906 but few had been built. In 1912 both Krupp and Rheinmetall were asked to prepare prototypes of a self- propelled anti-aircraft gun. The design that was tested and approved for production in 1913 was from Krupp and would be known as the 7.7 cm Leichtes Kraftwagengeschütz M1914. The gun, mounts and vehicle layout would remain similar despite being produced by both Krupp and Rheinmetall. The primary role for the M1914 would be to provide mobile air defense for targets such as supply depots, command centers, and bridges. In addition to their anti- aircraft role, M1914's were often used as anti-tank guns during the final year of the war since they were able to move from place to place quickly to repulse allied armored thrusts.  Production Priorities  A number of factors forced the Germans to prioritize the production of field artillery over the production of specialized anti-aircraft guns. These included: * A lack of raw materials. * An underestimation of light field artillery losses during the first two years war and an inadequate number of replacement guns being produced. * An underestimation of ammunition consumption, inadequate production capacity, and resulting shortages. * The need for new field-guns with superior performance. *An underestimation of the threat posed by ground attack aircraft. *A surplus of obsolete and captured field-guns. This meant that obsolete light field-guns such as the 9 cm Kanone C/73 and captured guns such as the 76 mm divisional gun M1902 and Canon de 75 modèle 1897 were often issued to anti-aircraft units where they were used as makeshift anti-aircraft guns. Most were either propped up on earthen embankments or scaffolds to point the muzzle skyward. However, their limited traverse and elevation hindered their use as anti-aircraft guns. Instead of producing new guns like the M1914 the Germans often opted to convert a large number of captured M1902's and M1897's they had to create the 7.62 cm FlaK L/30 and 7.7 cm FlaK L/35 by placing the existing barrels on new or modified carriages. It was for these reasons that the total number of 156 produced was fairly small.  Design  The barrel for the 7.7 cm FlaK L/27 was built from steel and was 27 calibers in length. The trunnioned barrel was held by a U shaped gun cradle that rotated on top of a steel pedestal. At the front of the pedestal there was also a seat for two crew members while on the move. The gun had a semi- automatic Krupp horizontal sliding-wedge breech to boost its rate of fire and used the same ammunition as the FK 96 n.A. There was a hydro-pneumatic recoil system located above and below the barrel, along with an equilibriator to balance the gun. The gun was capable of 360° of traverse and -5° to +70° of elevation. The pedestal mount was bolted to a lightly armored 4 x 4 (all-wheel drive) truck chassis. The vehicle was powered by a 90 hp liquid-cooled gasoline engine. Along the sides of the vehicle were lockers for ready ammunition as well as supplies for the gun crew. The sides of the vehicle unfolded to provide a firing platform and there were also seats for the gun crew. A number of different truck chassis were used such as Krupp-Daimler and Ehrhardt-Rheinmetall.  Guns of comparable role, era, and performance  * - was an Italian self-propelled anti-aircraft gun that was actually a copy of the 7 .7 cm Leichte Kraftwagengeschütze M1914. In 1913 Italy bought a few M1914's for evaluation and decided to build their own version using a converted barrel from their Cannone da 75/27 modello 06 field-gun which was itself a Krupp design produced under license and mounted on the back of either an Itala X and Fiat 18BL truck chassis. *Autocanon de 75mm mle 1913 - a French self-propelled anti-aircraft version of the mle 1897 on the back of a De Dion- Bouton truck chassis. * QF 13-pounder 9 cwt - a British anti-aircraft gun often mounted on the back of a Thornycroft or Peerless truck chassis. * 76 mm air-defense gun M1914/15 - a Russian anti-aircraft gun sometimes mounted on the back of a Russo-Balt type T truck chassis.

The film stars Liam Neeson, Kate Walsh, Robert Patrick, Anthony Ramos, Jeffrey Donovan, and Jai Courtney, and follows a former bank robber who turns himself into authorities, only to be set up by them. Honest Thief was theatrically released, including in IMAX, in the United States on October 16, 2020, by Open Road Films and Briarcliff Entertainment. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who noted its familiarity. Plot Sneaking around Boston for years, Tom (Liam Neeson) has become a master thief, earning the nickname the \\"In-and-Out Bandit\\" for his slick ways when it comes to stealing large amounts of money. When he meets Annie (Kate Walsh), a psychology graduate student working at a storage unit facility, his heart melts, commencing a relationship that lasts a year before he's ready to commit to something more. Ready to turn himself in to the FBI in exchange for a short sentence, Tom also wants to live peacefully with Annie. The feds don't immediately believe Tom is the In-and-Out Bandit, with Agent Baker (Robert Patrick) blowing him off, sending underlings to conduct an interview with the criminal. When Agent Nivens (Jai Courtney) and Agent Hall (Anthony Ramos) are sent in to see if Tom is a real thief, they are led to boxes of money that challenge their dedication to duty. Electing to take the cash for themselves and murder Tom, the agents' plan is soon disrupted by the suspect's particular set of skills, seeing him escape into the city to protect Annie while they scramble to cover their tracks as Agent Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan), their superior, gets involved in the hunt. Tom ambushed Agent Hall in his home, and convinced him to give up the security footage at the storage company which would incriminate the agents, and the location of the safe house where the money was kept. After blowing up Agent Nivens' house while deliberately sparing his life, he followed Nivens to the safe house, knowing that Nivens would try to make a run with the money. A gunfight followed at the safe house where Hall was killed and Tom was wounded. Nivens tried to drive away with the money, but he was intercepted by Tom's threat to detonate the bomb if he continues driving or attempts to leave the vehicle. Bomb squad arrives and attempts to defuse the bomb, only to find out that there is no detonator and the bomb is impossible to explode. Nivens is arrested by the feds. Agent Meyers receives a voice recorder which recorded the conversation between Nivens and Hall before the gunfight at the safe house, proving Tom's innocence in the death of Agent Baker. Tom turns himself in, and Meyers promises to try to get a lighter sentence for Tom. Cast Production On October 12, 2018, it was announced that Liam Neeson and Kate Walsh would star as a bank robber Tom Carter and his love interest Annie, respectively, in the thriller film Honest Thief with Mark Williams directing it, while in talks for other roles were Jai Courtney and Jeffrey Donovan. Tai Duncan, Myles Nestel, Williams, and Craig Chapman would be producing the film. Courtney and Donovan were confirmed along with Anthony Ramos, and Robert Patrick added to the cast in November, with filming beginning on November 5. The film, set in Boston, was shot in and around Worcester, Massachusetts. Release In January 2020, Briarcliff Entertainment acquired distribution rights to the film and set it for a September 4, 2020 release. It was then re- scheduled to be released on October 9, 2020. In June 2020, it was announced Open Road Films would co-distribute the film with Briarcliff. After temporarily getting pulled from the schedule due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the film's U.S. release was set for October 16, 2020. Due to the lack of big-budget competition, the film also played in IMAX and Dolby theaters.  Reception   Box office  , Honest Thief has grossed $4.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $5.7 million. In the United States, the film grossed $1.3 million from 2,425 on its first day, including $225,000 from Thursday night previews screenings. It went on to debut to $3.6 million ($4.1 million including Canada's opening weekend the previous week), topping the box office.  Critical response  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 37% based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 4.79/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Guilty of first- degree squandering, Honest Thief returns Liam Neeson to late-period action thriller mode but neglects to supply much of a story.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". According to PostTrak, 75% of audience members gave the film a positive score, with 53% saying they would definitely recommend it. Owen Gleiberman of Variety complimented Neeson for not phoning in his performance but wrote \\"Honest Thief isn't incompetent (for a certain kind of pulp action fan, it delivers just enough of the goods), but it's a textbook case of an action movie that goes through the motions.\\" Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Frank Scheck said the film \\"delivers exactly what you expect\\" and wrote: \\"Running a sleek 90 minutes before the credits roll, Honest Thief is certainly efficient if not exactly original, with writer/director Williams infusing it with enough quirky character touches — such as Tom crankily complaining how much he hates his 'In and Out Bandit' moniker — to distract from the derivative feeling of it all.\\"  References  External links * 2020 films 2020 action thriller films 2020s heist films American films American action thriller films American heist films Films about bank robbery Films about the Federal Bureau of Investigation Films about police misconduct Films postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Films scored by Mark Isham Films set in Boston Films shot in Massachusetts Open Road Films films IMAX films ","title":"Honest Thief"},{"id":"58733933","text":"Blackrock railway station is in Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland.

Discovery Skull elements In 2003, amateur paleontologist Yoshiyuki Horita at the Shirafunezawa Creek discovered the tail of a euornithopod. An entire skeleton was in 2013 and 2014 uncovered by teams of the and the Hokkaido University Museum. The find was nicknamed Mukawaryu, the \\"Dragon of Mukawa\\". In 2019, the type species Kamuysaurus japonicus was named and described by Professor , Tomohiro Nishimura, Ryuji Takasaki, Kentaro Chiba, Anthony Ricardo Fiorillo, Kohei Tanaka, Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig, Tamaki Sato and Kazuhiko Sakurai. The generic name is derived from kamuy, meaning \\"deity\\" in Ainu, the language of the original inhabitants of Hokkaido. The specific name japonicus, \\"japanese\\" in Neolatin, refers to the provenance from Japan. The holotype, HMG-1219, has been found in a marine layer of the Hakobuchi Formation, part of the Yezo Group, dating from the early Maastrichtian, between 72.4 and 70.6 million years old. It consists of a nearly complete skeleton with skull, only missing the snout, parts of the sacral vertebrae and phalanges. Containing over 60% of the skeletal elements and 80% of the bone mass, it is, together with the smaller skeleton of Fukuivenator, one of the most complete dinosaur skeletons found in Japan. The bones were found on a surface of seven by four metres and were partially articulated, though sometimes damaged by erosion. The holotype represents an adult individual of at least nine years of age. It was likely washed into the sea as a carcass. Description Life restoration Kamuysaurus was about eight metres long. From the width of its thighbone, its weight has been estimated at 4 or 5.3 tonnes, dependent on its having been bipedal or quadrupedal respectively. The describing authors indicated some distinguishing traits. Three of these were autapomorphies, unique derived characters. On the quadrate bone, the notch at the opening separating it from the quadratojugal bone, is located at a very low position, at three quarters of the shaft length measured from the top of the element. This is unique for the Hadrosauridae as a whole. The surangular bone of the lower jaw has only a short ascending branch, not reaching the coronoid process. The sixth tot thirteenth back vertebrae have neural spines that are inclined to the front.

It is the former headquarters of the Croatian Fraternal Union, the oldest and largest Croatian organization in North America, and a significant site in Croatian American history. The building was designed by Pierre A. Liesch in the Flemish Gothic Revival style and built in 1928–9. History The Croatian Fraternal Union (CFU) began as the Croatian Association, chartered in 1894 in Allegheny, now Pittsburgh's North Side. It was re-chartered in 1897 as the National Croatian Society and then merged with three other organizations in 1926 to form the CFU. The organization offered life, accident, and health insurance for its members, as well as social and cultural services including scholarships and sports programs. By 1928, it had over 80,000 members. After the 1926 merger, the CFU needed a new headquarters to consolidate its operations. Both of its existing facilities—the old NCS building on the North Side, and the Chicago offices of the Croatian League of Illinois—were inadequate for the new, larger organization. Delegates to the first CFU convention in May 1926 decided to sell the old offices and build or buy a new one. In 1928, the organization commissioned a new Home Office building on Forbes Avenue in Oakland. The Pittsburgh Press reported that the \\"architecture of the building will be Gothic and leaning towards the Cathedral of Learning style, and will be in keeping with the cultural atmosphere of the Schenley district.\\" The building was dedicated on January 20, 1929, with a speech from Pittsburgh mayor Charles H. Kline. It was the first building designed specifically to meet the needs of the organization and included an auditorium and meeting hall as well as office space. In 1961, the CFU moved to a new headquarters in Wilkins Township and the Forbes Avenue building was sold to Allegheny County. It housed county Health Department facilities for many years. The University of Pittsburgh bought the building in July 2018 for $1.9 million and filed for a demolition permit in August. In October, it was nominated as a city historic landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh. Architecture The CFU building is a three-story, flat-roofed structure of brick, steel, and concrete construction. It was designed by Luxembourg-born Pittsburgh architect Pierre A. Liesch (1872–1954) in a Flemish Gothic Revival style. Liesch was also credited as a consulting architect on the Union Trust Building (1916), which showed a similar Flemish influence. The principal facade faces southeast toward Forbes Avenue and is clad in gold terra cotta tile with rust-colored accents. The facade is symmetrical and is divided into five bays by vertically ribbed responds which run the full height of the building. The first floor has an arcade of five pointed arches, with the central arch housing the entry doors. The side arches were originally plate-glass storefronts with their own individual entrances, but were later filled in with terra cotta blocks to form a blind arcade. The main entrance was also altered from the original carved wooden doors with stained-glass sidelights and transom to a more utilitarian aluminum-framed entrance. The second and third stories have three windows per bay, separated by vertical ribbing. The third-floor windows have the form of Gothic pointed arches, while those on the second floor are rectangular. The parapet above the third-floor windows is ornamented with Gothic tracery including a large tripartite pointed arch above the entrance bay. The building was originally crowned with a highly ornate overhanging cornice and a pointed-arch apex topped with a sculptural element, but this has been replaced with a plain brick parapet. Truncated corbeled arches that supported the cornice are still present. The responds were terminated with ornamented pinnacles, though only one is still present as of 2018. Other terra cotta ornamentation includes seals of the United States and Pennsylvania, escutcheons, scrollwork, floral patterns, heraldic dolphins, a crowned head, and sculpted figures of a rope- maker and a miner, representing common occupations for Croatian immigrants.

For many years Rietz served as a member of the National parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\") and he was also a long-standing deputy chairman of the State Council. Life Hans Rietz was born to a working-class mother in Könnern, a small manufacturing town between Magdeburg and Halle. Little is known of his father, but in 1960 it was reported by Neues Deutschland, the mass-circulation newspaper of East Germany's ruling SED (party), that the father of Hans Dietz was a member of the Spartacus League and later of Germany's Communist Party which grew out of it. He attended junior and middle school at nearby Bitterfeld, before undertaking an apprenticeship at Wolfen as a machinist between 1928 and 1932. From the start of his apprenticeship Rietz was a member of the Young Communists and of the Metal Workers' Union (\\"Deutscher Metallarbeiter-Verband\\" / DMV). On successful completion of the apprenticeship he remained with IG Farben, working as a machinist at their large Wolfen plant till 1939, apart from a two-year break for mandatory military service. (The term of military service had been extended from one year to two with effect from 24 August 1936.) War returned in September 1939: Rietz was conscripted initially into the National Labour Service (\\"Reichsarbeitsdienst\\" / RAD) and later into the army. He was sent to fight on the Russian front and had reached the junior- officer rank of Oberwachtmeister by the time he was captured by the Soviets. In the prisoner of war camp he was politically active, undertaking various courses at the camp anti-fascist school. Rietz was returned to Germany in 1949. The central portion of what had previously been Germany was administered after 1945 as the Soviet occupation zone and there is speculation that his return was connected with a willingness to undertake a political role in the zone, which would be relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). He immediately joined the Free [East] German Trade Union Federation (\\"Freier Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund\\" / FDGB) and the newly launched Democratic Farmers' Party (\\"Demokratische Bauernpartei Deutschlands\\" / DBD). Within the DBD he took a position as head of the party's national \\"Thomas Münzer\\" party academy at Borkheide (Belzig), and over the next three years successfully built up both the institution and his own credentials with the national leadership. He became a member of the DBD executive in 1951 and was thereafter engaged in a succession of leadership functions within the party. Between 1954 and 1982 he was a member of the presidium within the executive, becoming Party Secretary for Organisation in 1963 and serving as a deputy party president between 1963 and 1982. During several years in the mid-1950s and again between 1977 and 1982 he served as chair of the party court, a position he held in succession to Stephan Zagrodnik. Later he served as chair of the party's veterans' commission. Following the so-called General Election of 1954 the DBD was allocated 52 of the 466 seats in the National Parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\"), and one of those seats went to Hans Rietz. He would remain a member of the assembly, even after retiring from his more onerous political functions, till 1986. From 1963 he was a deputy chair of the parliamentary defence committee. He represented the DBD as a member of the parliamentary presidium between 1976 and 1981. By 1990 Hans Rietz had retired from active participation in East German politics. In March of that year East Germany held its first and, as matters turned out, last free and fair general election. The DBD achieved slightly above 2% of the national vote, implying a lack of popular support under a democratic system. According to some analyses the DBD's creation, back in the late 1940s, had been intended to weaken support for the \\"bourgeois parties\\", notably the CDU which back then had presented a serious challenge to the one party structure favoured by the authorities. In 1990, however, it was the CDU that staged an electoral come back, and after briefly attempting to carve out a niche championing ecological causes, the DBD merged into the CDU at around the same time the East Germany merged into what many saw as an expandeded version of West Germany. Hans Rietz, by now an \\"elder statesman\\" of the DBD, stood out in opposition to the party merger: between 1990 and his death in 1996 he was not a member of any political party.

F. Reilly, \\"Burgundy, House of\\", in Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia, ed. E. Michael Gerli (Routledge, 2003), pp. 184–86. is a cadet branch of the House of Ivrea descended from Raymond of Burgundy. Raymond married Urraca, the eldest legitimate daughter of Alfonso VI of León and Castile of the House of Jiménez. Two years after Raymond's death, Urraca succeeded her father and became queen of Castile and Leon; Urraca's and Raymond's offspring in the legitimate line ruled the kingdom from 1126 until the death of Peter of Castile in 1369, while their descendants in an illegitimate line, the House of Trastámara, would rule Castile and Aragón until the 16th century. History Origins Raymond was the fourth son of William I, Count of Burgundy (from the House of Ivrea) and arrived in the Iberian peninsula probably in 1086 with the army of Odo I, Duke of Burgundy, who besieged the city Tudela, Navarre. In April 1087 the army abandoned the siege and returned home, but Odo, Raymond and Henry of Burgundy (Raymond's cousin) went west at the court of Alfonso VI king of Castile and León. There, Odo arranged the marriage of king's first daughter, Urraca, to Raymond on 1087; the couple received the county of Galicia as dowry.Pallarés Méndez, María del Carmen; Portela, Ermelindo (2006). Η βασίλισσα Magpie . Συντάκτης NEREA. σ. 79. . In 1093 Alfonso VI married an illegitimate daughter Teresa to Henry and gave them the county of Portugal, which evolved to a kingdom.La formación de Europa: Conquista, colonización y cambio cultural, 950-1350. Universitat de València. p. 67. . In 1107 Raymond died, followed the next year by Sancho, the king's only son. Now his presumptive heiress, Urraca was married to Alfonso I of Navarre and Aragón, who was promised the kingdom to the exclusion of Urraca's son by Raymond. The couple proved incompatible, and following Alfonso VI's death in 1109, Urraca reigned as queen while resisting efforts by both her husband and her son by Raymond to take the crown. The latter succeeded on her death, becoming Alfonso VII, first king of Castile and León from the Castilian House of Ivrea. Kings of Castile and León Alfonso VII partitioned the kingdom to his sons: Sancho III received Castile & Toledo and Ferdinand received León & Galicia. The kingdoms remained divided under their sons Alfonso VIII of Castile and Alfonso IX of León, but in 1197 the latter married the daughter of the former, so following the death of her teenage brother, Henry I of Castile, this kingdom passed to her son by Alfonso IX, Ferdinand III. He permanently reunited the kingdoms on the death of his father and passed them to his own son, Alfonso X. Alfonso X's eldest son Ferdinand died in 1275 leaving two sons, but the king's second son Sancho claimed to be the new heir. The king preferred Ferdinand's sons, but the nobility supported Sancho and a civil war began. The descendants of Ferdinand form the House of la Cerda. Alfonso X died in 1284 and finally his second son succeeded him, as Sancho IV. The grandson of Sancho IV, i.e. Alfonso XI, had legitimate son Peter of Castile and some illegitimate sons: Henry, Fadrique, etc. Henry attacked Peter with a host of soldiers of fortune in 1366. The Castilian Civil War followed: Peter was besieged at the fortress of Montiel. During the negotiations, Peter entered the tent of Henry's envoy, where Henry, which was hidden there, attacked him and killed him. Peter had no legitimate sons, and Henry became the new king as Henry II and was the founder of the House of Trastámara. His brother Fadrique became the founder of the House of Enríquez.

She was born as Mary Jones in Ludlow, Shropshire, England, and stayed there throughout her childhood and early adulthood, marrying William Morgan on 25 June 1785 and having two children with him. In 1789, hempen yarn stolen from a factory was discovered at the Morgans' house, resulting in the couple being sentenced to penal transportation. Although William was able to escape initially, Molly was transported to New South Wales as a convict with the Second Fleet on the Neptune, and William was eventually caught and transported as well. After working together for a while in Australia, William left Molly due to her flirting with other men. In 1794, Molly Morgan was able to escape back to England aboard the Resolution by becoming Captain John Locke's mistress. Once back in England, she recovered her children and became a dressmaker in Plymouth, marrying Thomas Mears in 1797. However, she was transported back to Australia on the Experiment, after she was accused of burning her husband's house down in 1803. When Morgan returned to Australia, she acquired land and cattle. In 1814, she was sentenced to seven years in jail for milking a stolen cow. However, by 1819, she was trusted enough to be one of the twelve convicts given several acres of land to farm at Wallis Plains (now Maitland), and was set free by 1822. She married Thomas Hunt on 5 March 1822. She started a wine shanty on the land she was given at Wallis Plains and received a grant of additional land by the governor, Thomas Brisbane, where she built the Angel Inn. By 1828, she was described as \\"one of the largest landholders on the Hunter River\\" and had several features in New South Wales named after her. Morgan also aided other settlers several times, including donating money to help build a school, turning part of her home into a hospital, and riding to Sydney on behalf of convicts. Her wealth significantly decreased throughout the later years of her life and she died on 27 June 1835, at Anvil Creek in Greta, New South Wales, where she owned of land.  Early life  Morgan was born as Mary Jones in 1762, in Ludlow, Shropshire, England, and was baptised in the village of Diddlebury, on 31 January 1762. She was the child of David Jones, an English general labourer and ratcatcher, and Margaret Jones, born Powell. As a child, she briefly received education and later became a dressmaker. She called herself \\"Molly\\" from childhood and became known as that for the rest of her life. Her first child was with a farmer who would not marry Molly. Her first husband was William Morgan, whom she married on 25 June 1785, when she was 22 years old William was from the village of Hopesay in Shropshire and was working as a carpenter and wheelwright. The couple had two children.  Sentencing and convict life   First sentence and escape  A drawing of the Neptune, the ship Morgan was transported on. In 1788, Molly Morgan stole hempen yarn, due to her family struggling at the time, which resulted in her being arrested along with her husband. A bleaching factory located near the Morgans' house was reported to have a few shillings of hempen yarn missing, and it was discovered to be hidden at their house. While her husband, with the help of some of his soldier friends, was able to escape jail and run away, Molly was tried at Shrewsbury Assizes and found guilty on 8 August 1789, which caused her to attempt suicide. Her trial was used as an example of what would happen if other thieves performed a similar action as Morgan, a \\"special case\\". Morgan was sentenced to seven years of penal transportation, being forced to sail to Australia with the Second Fleet on the hell ship Neptune in 1790; Morgan's children remained in England. Of the 502 convicts on the ship, 164 of them died during the voyage, mostly from starvation and neglect, and almost half of the total group of convicts died either on the ship or shortly after arriving at shore. During that time, ship owners would receive money for every convict they transported and if a convict died they would not have to spend money to feed them, essentially meaning that the more convicts that were on the ship but died during the voyage, the more money the ship owner would make. However, by using her \\"good looks\\" and swapping favours with the officers of the ship during the voyage, she received better treatment than the other convicts, including gaining extra rations and special privileges, as well as not having to endure the harsh treatment the rest of the convicts received. Due to this, Morgan was still in decent condition after the voyage. Shortly after arriving at Botany Bay in Sydney, New South Wales, on 28 June 1790, Morgan was sent to Parramatta and later essentially became a free agent. Three years later, William was caught again and this time was deported to Australia; he arrived at Australia in a group of prisoners who had been transported for thievery. Molly received permission to join him after his arrival. They both worked in Sydney, William on labour gangs and Molly in a factory. As a result of her good behaviour, Molly soon received a ticket of leave, allowing the couple to start a small shop. Due to Molly's persistent flirting with men, William eventually left her following several arguments between the two. Morgan decided to try to escape the colony in New South Wales, so that she could go to the two children of her and William, who were still in England with no parent caring for them. She became the mistress of Captain John Locke, allowing her to join him on the Resolution, a store ship which was heading towards England, on 9 November 1794, along with thirteen other convicts who had not finished their transportation sentences. Along the way, Locke proposed to her, but she declined. After Morgan's escape, various theories were formed by the people in the colony as to what had happened to her. Upon arrival in England, Morgan was able to recover her children. She became a dressmaker in Plymouth, Devon, working to provide for her children. In 1797, Morgan married Thomas Mears, also spelt Meares, Meyers, or Mares, a rich brassfounder and bellringer, while she was still legally married to William. By this time, William had a new partner and family.  Second sentence and land grant  In 1803, Mears' house burned down, and Morgan was found guilty of this incident after a trial on 10 October 1803 at Croydon Sessions. Although she escaped to London, she was eventually arrested; for her sentence, she was sent back to Australia a second time for seven years of penal transportation, this time on the Experiment, arriving on 24 June 1804 at Port Jackson. The convicts transported on the ship included 136 females, of which 6 died while on the ship, and 2 males, significantly fewer than the previous voyage on the Neptune. Upon arrival, Morgan was not able to locate William in Sydney. She was given several protectors, including Thomas Byrne, and acquired land and cattle at Parramatta a few years afterwards. In 1814, she was sentenced to jail for seven years in Newcastle Penal Colony for milking a stolen cow. However, the man who actually stole the cow was sentenced to only three years in jail. In 1819, five years after she was jailed, Lachlan Macquarie, the governor of New South Wales, trusted Morgan enough to give her a ticket of leave, along with eleven other convicts who he thought were behaving well. These twelve convicts were granted of land in West Maitland, in an area which became known as Wallis Plains, located along Wallis Creek and the Hunter River. These convicts could use this land to farm, in a \\"trial project to see if criminals could better themselves\\". Morgan had received a farm in her own right, being the only female convict in the group to do so. By 1822, Morgan was granted freedom.  Life in Australia  Morgan established a settlement in the land she was given at Wallis Plains and became a successful farmer in the area, also starting a wine shanty there. Her third husband was Thomas Hunt, a soldier 30 years younger than herself, who was positioned as an army officer at the garrison in the area. They were married on 5 March 1822. By this time, Thomas Brisbane was the governor of New South Wales. Impressed by Morgan's farming skills, Brisbane rented out of land to her in November 1823. In the centre of this area, Morgan built the Angel Inn. As more people began to settle into the area, both the inn and the shanty began to produce large amounts of money. Additionally, Morgan began to subdivide her lease, selling small parts of her land. Between her lease subdividing and the money produced by the inn and shanty, she eventually became one of the wealthiest people in the area. An article in the Australian newspaper on 23 January 1828 called her \\"one of the largest landholders on the Hunter River\\". In May 1830, she was fully granted the of land that she had previously rented from the governor. She moved to Anvil Creek in 1830, where she bought of land and had her own farm; she stayed there until her death in 1835. Several features in the area Morgan lived in throughout her life were named after her. Wallis Plains was often commonly called Molly Morgan's Plains at the time, or Molly Morgan Plains, before it became named after Captain James Wallis. The pathway from Anvil Creek to Singleton is now known as Molly Morgan’s line of road. Molly Morgan Drive, a road in Maitland, and Molly Morgan Ridge, located in North Rothbury, New South Wales, were named after her. Morgan was unofficially given the title \\"Queen of the Hunter Valley\\" or \\"Queen of the Hunter River\\". In addition to owning and farming land, Morgan also helped other settlers in a variety of ways. In particular, she donated £100 to the Church Corporation to help build a school in East Maitland in 1827. In addition, she rode her horse to Sydney several times to negotiate with the governor regarding the execution of runaway convicts and turned part of her home into a hospital.  Later life and death  During the last few years of her life, Morgan had difficulties sustaining the large amount of property she owned, due to sale irregularity issues, causing her wealth to quickly decrease. She was retired for the last few years of her life, living at Anvil Creek in Greta, New South Wales. She died there on 27 June 1835 when she was 73 years old. At the time of her death, she no longer owned any property and had unpaid mortgage loans. After her death, she had a long obituary, which was the largest ever published obituary at the time, saying:  Notes   References   Bibliography         See also  * Convicts in Australia 1762 births 1835 deaths 19th-century English landowners Convicts transported to Australia on the Second Fleet English farmers Women farmers Australian convict women English female criminals 19th-century English criminals 19th-century women landowners 18th-century Australian women ","title":"Molly Morgan"},{"id":"58734495","text":"Hôtel de Nevers: * Hôtel de Nevers (left bank) * Hôtel de Nevers (rue de Richelieu) ","title":"Hôtel de Nevers"},{"id":"58734498","text":"Al-Samaqiyat, also spelled al-Summaqiyat or Smaqiyat (), is a village in southern Syria, administratively part of the Daraa Governorate, located east of Daraa and south of Bosra.

Biography Little is known of Ó hOrchaidh. To date, the only item of his work is a copy of Cúirt an Mheán Oíche ('the Midnight Court') by the Co. Clare poet, Brian Merriman, composed about 1780. The manuscript containing it is held in Dublin at the library of the Royal Irish Academy, but up to 2018 there was no record of it containing a version of the poem. Its value lies in the fact that it is written in the badly-attested Connacht Irish of County Roscommon rather than the Munster Irish of County Clare. Both dialects are now extinct, with Ó hOrchaidh's manuscript one of the last featuring Connacht orthography and vocabulary and how Irish was pronounced in east Co. Galway and south Co. Roscommon (see Uí Maine), rendering its value quite high. Ó hOrchaidh's version was discovered in 2018 by dialectologist and sociolinguist Professor Brian Ó Curnáin of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. Ó hOrchaidh wrote it in 1817 in An Bhearaidh Bheag (Barry Beg) towndland, Kiltoom parish, west of Lough Ree and Athlone. With translation, his scribal note at the end of the text reads: > Crioch le Cúirt an Meón áoighthe liomsa.

She was born as Ellen Pangieran in Western Australia and was sent to New Norcia for education after her father deserted the family. She first married at age 15, but her first husband died shortly afterwards; she later married Benedict Cuper. Cuper was trained as a telegraphist by Rosendo Salvado and became the first postmistress of New Norcia. In addition, she trained Sarah Ninak as a telegraphist, who took over as the New Norcia postmistress temporarily. Cuper died at age 30, due to tuberculosis.  Early life  Cuper was born in 1847 in Bunbury, Western Australia, as Ellen Pangieran. Her father, William Ramsey, was a European, while her mother, Yanjipp, was aboriginal to Australia. Her father deserted the family while Cuper was still a child. Because the government did not think that Yanjipp would be able to raise her child herself, Cuper was sent to the Benedictine mission at New Norcia, in 1862, where she was educated. On 8 December 1862, she married Peter Nhawer, when she was 15 years old. However, Nhawer died shortly after, and on 6 April 1863, she remarried to Benedict Cuper, a farmer and cricket player. Benedict's father was from England, and his mother was aboriginal to Australia; Benedict had been married once before. The two of them had a child who died while still an infant.  Career  Rosendo Salvado trained Cuper as a telegraphist, so that she could work full-time on a telegraph line, teaching her morse code in August 1873. The line began at a post office of Victoria Plains, which opened in April 1857, and stretched to Geraldton. In May 1873, the postmaster position at the post office was suddenly vacant. James Fleming, the superintendent of telegraphs, said that Salvado had a female aboriginal who could read and write well and was knowledgeable with telegraph coding, who was applying for the job. However, Fleming believed that Cuper would be an inconstant worker and thought \\"it will be necessary to appoint someone to whom the quarters and a small salary will suffice.\\" Despite this, Salvado still supported Cuper for the position, and she was eventually able to take the job. Cuper became the first postmistress of New Norcia. She started working as a postmistress in August 1873, although she was not officially appointed until January 1874, with a salary of £30 a year. By this time, the postal records showed her name as Helen Cuper. Her capabilities were described as exceeding \\"any apprentice the superintendent of telegraphs had ever seen.\\" Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, postal authorities visited Cuper and a few other postmasters, and requested photographs of them due to believing that they were \\"exceptional\\" with their post careers. Cuper began to train Sarah Caruingo Ninak to be a telegraphist in late 1875, as she was beginning to have health problems at this time and was therefore not able to perform as much work. In 1876, Ninak became temporarily in charge of the New Norcia office. William Cleaver Francis Robinson, the governor of Western Australia, was visiting New Norcia at this time, and due to his high impression of her job as the New Norcia postmistress, he sent her photograph and a letter praising her to London:  Death  In 1875, Cuper became infected with tuberculosis, causing her health to decline. Afterwards, Ninak also became ill. The two of them retired, as did Carmine Gnarbak, another postmistress and telegraphist who had worked with them, to follow the Aboriginal custom of \\"avoiding a place associated with death.\\" On 12 January 1877, Cuper died. She was buried in the cemetery at New Norcia. Her husband Benedict remarried in 1893, to Matilda Murricherry.

She described several new species of fungi and published and illustrated books on New Zealand fungi and plants. Background and education Taylor was born Grace Marie Bulmer in 1930. She attended New Plymouth Girls' High before going on to study at Victoria University of Wellington. Taylor gained a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science with honours studying botany. She then went on to attend the Auckland Teachers Training College before beginning work as a teacher at Wellington Girls' College. Researches in mycology Taylor began undertaking lab demonstration work at Victoria University of Wellington which in turn lead her to be becoming a lecturer in botany at that University. Her professional botany career was then interrupted with her marriage and the subsequent birth of her children. She lived with her family in Oamaru and undertook numerous field trips from and around that location. During this time she authored a key to the genus Cosprosma. In 1971 Taylor moved to Auckland and was employed by the University of Auckland as a senior tutor teaching botany. She became a member of the Auckland Botanical Society. She continued to undertake research and to draw the species she was studying. It was around this time that Taylor published the first of her books on New Zealand fungi which she herself illustrated, Mushrooms and Toadstools in New Zealand. She would go on to publish another book that she also illustrated Mushrooms and Toadstools in 1981. During her career Taylor would describe at least 21 species that were new to science. Her final work Meanings and Origins of Botanical Names of New Zealand Plants was published in 2002 after her death. Taylor died on 24 April 1999. Taylor created an historically important private collection of New Zealand fungi. This was incorporated with the collections of Greta Stevenson and Barbara Segedin to form the basis of the New Zealand Fungarium. Eponymous taxa *Entoloma mariae G. Stev.

Both were active between 1993 and 2003, in the city of Ciudad Juárez. According to his own statements, Granados kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered at least 8-10 young women, but according to the Attorney General of the State of Chihuahua they murdered at least 14 women. This corresponded to the 8 corpses found in cotton fields in the city's outskirts and 6 more found in Mount Cerro Negro, also adjacent to the city.  Background   Apprehension of Francisco Granados  Granados was an assiduous consumer of cocaine, had a long criminal record in the United States, consisting mainly of low-impact crimes such as illegal entry and residence in the country and consumption and possession of illicit substances; there are records that indicate that Francisco's first arrest was made in 1995, when he was 16 years old, on charges of illegal stay in the country and resisting arrest. In 2003, he was detained by the police in El Paso, Texas, the Texas Ranger Division, under the charge of illegal stay in the country.  Confessions  While in the custody of the Texas police in 2006, Granados confessed to having participated in at least 10 murders of women, perpetrated between 1993 and 2003. In his statements he indicated that he was not fully aware of what he did, as he committed his crimes while drugged: He identified Edgar Ernesto Álvarez Cruz as the alleged mastermind of between 10 and 17 murders. He also mentioned of the participation of a third man, Alejandro Delgado Valles, known as El Calas, who was later exonerated. He indicated that Álvarez used to provide him drugs during the crimes, so he did not remember the exact events.  Crimes  According to statements by Francisco Granados, the women were kidnapped or taken with deception to unpopulated areas of the outskirts of the city inside Álvarez's car, an eighties-model Renault, where they were tied and raped, then mutilated and murdered in the midst of satanistic rituals chaired by Álvarez, who used to dissect the hearts of his victims. The bodies were buried or simply abandoned in vacant lots, with some buried in Álvarez's own home. In later investigations, a corpse was exhumed on the premises of Álvarez's home.  Possible victims  In his confession Granados identified 6 murdered women, and mentioned a sixth and seventh victim whom he partially identified only under their supposed names: * Mayra Juliana Reyes Solís * Esmeralda Herrera Monrreal * Laura Berenice Ramos Mónarrez * Claudia Ivette González * Verónica Martínez Hernández * Guadalupe Luna de la Rosa * Rosario (\\"Chayito\\"): she supposedly died when she was intentionally run over by Álvarez with his car.  Court proceedings   Intervention of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights  The intervention of the Inter- American Court of Human Rights was based on requests from victims' relatives, who filed a complain against the Mexican State, motivated by the lack of response from the same. In 2005 the Inter-American Court approved and admitted the case, and in January 2007 it accumulated the files of González, Monrreal and Mónarrez, whose bodies were found in Juárez's cotton fields. On November 16, 2009, the court issued a judgment against the Mexican State. From the sentence that was issued the following recommendations were highlighted: # Conduct the criminal process properly # Publicly acknowledge their international responsibility # Unveil a monument in memory of the victims  See also  * Belém do Pará Convention § Impact * Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez * The Ciudad Juárez Rebels * Abdul Latif Sharif  References  Mexican serial killers Male serial killers Murder in Mexico Rape in Mexico Violence against women in Mexico Incidents of violence against women 1990s murders in Mexico 2000s murders in Mexico 1993 crimes in Mexico ","title":"Feminicides of the cotton field"},{"id":"58734605","text":"Jacques Barreau (born 21 January 1923) is a French footballer.

It occurs mainly in arctic and northern temperate waters, in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Description Halecium muricatum is a colonial hydrozoan. It is arborescent, forming stiff bushy colonies usually between in height but sometimes . The main stems are robust and mostly straight, with a few large side branches diverging irregularly, each forming an angle of 30° with the main stem. Finer tertiary branches are formed as the polyps each elongate and bud new polyps on alternate sides of the often single plane branch; there is a clearly defined node between each segment. Gonothecae (reproductive structures) develop on the stem and main branches; both male and female gonathecae are ovate and covered with rows of spines and appear identical. The colony is typically yellowish. Distribution and habitat Halecium muricatum is found in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean and the northern Pacific Ocean. It is mainly an arctic and northern temperate species and is present in Greenland and Iceland. In America its range extends southwards to Cape Hatteras and it is also present in Alaska and in the seas around Siberia. In Europe it extends southwards as far as the British Isles. Here its range extends from the western coast of Scotland southward to West Wales where it occurs around Lundy Island and Skomer Island; it is commonest in Scotland and tends to occur only in exposed locations further south. It chiefly grows in gullies and on vertical rock faces, at depths between .

This coat of arms is augmented from a heraldic chief, the division occupying the upper third.

In the 13th century, merchants' guilds embarked on a revolt against the power of the Archbishop-Count of Lyon. These used their own flags with a lion to symbolize their strength, forcing in 1320 King Philip V of France to intervene in this conflict. As a result of the intervention of the king, the city happened to depend directly on the French Crown, being included the list of \\"Bonnes Villes\\" and receiving its shield (and flag) of arms. In 1376, King Charles V simplified its heraldry, reducing to three the indeterminate number of fleurs de lys that hitherto covered the entire space of the royal armories and heraldic chiefs of the \\"Bonnes Villes\\".

Within Hamburg, the Elbe divides into two main anabranches, the Norderelbe (Northern Elbe) and the Süderelbe (Southern Elbe), which, after the Alte Süderelbe (Old Southern Elbe) was sealed off, reunite with the Norderelbe via the Köhlbrand anabranch, bypassing the Elbe islands, of which Wilhelmsburg is the largest river island on the Elbe. In particular, the term refers to several parallel railroad and road bridges over River Elbe in central Hamburg, divided into Norderelbbrücken (Northern Elbe bridges) and Süderelbbrücken (Southern Elbe bridges). They emerged from the first crossings over River Elbe, and today, due to the low headroom, form a barrier east of the Port of Hamburg which can't be passed by sea ships. Today, especially the Norderelbbrücken are considered a landmark of Hamburg. The Hamburg Elbbrücken form, along with the Old Elbe Tunnel (1911, below Norderelbe) and the New Elbe Tunnel (1975, under re-united River Elbe) the last fixed Elbe crossings before the mouth into the North Sea. The bridges constitute an important link within the city-state of Hamburg and connect the districts north of the Elbe, including the inner city of Hamburg with the Wilhelmsburg, the Veddel and the port area as well as with the borough of Harburg to the south of the Elbe and the region beyond. In addition, the Elbe bridges have a significant national function as a north-south link in European rail traffic and within the crossings of the federal motorways (A 1, A 253) and federal highways (B 4 / B 75). In the entire Hamburg city area, all road signs to Neue Elbbrücke (New Elbe Bridge) and Brücke des 17. Juni (Bridge of 17th June), which are both part of the Hamburg Elbbrücken are generally signposted only as Elbbrücken, as the Freihafenelbbrücke (former free economic zone) and the motorway bridges are excluded and journeys over the other bridges would be a detour.

As a two-year-old in 2018 she was one of the best fillies of her generation in Europe, winning the Group 1 Fillies' Mile. In the following year she was beaten in her first three races but then recorded further major win in the Pretty Polly Stakes, Matron Stakes, and Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. Background Iridessa is a bay filly bred in Ireland by Whisperview Trading Ltd, a breeding company partly owned by Aidan O'Brien. The filly entered the ownership of O'Brien's wife Anne-Marie and was sent into training with his son Joseph Patrick. She was from the first crop of foals sired by the Epsom Derby winner Ruler of the World. Iridessa's dam Senta's Dream was an unraced daughter of the top class racemare Starine. Racing career 2018: two- year-old season On her racecourse debut, Iridessa was ridden by Seamie Heffernan in a minor race over one mile at Killarney Racecourse on 17 July. Starting a 20/1 outsider in a six-runner field she raced in second place behind the favourite Cardini before taking the lead a furlong out and drawing away to win easily by four lengths. Before her next race the filly entered the ownership of Chantal Regalado-Gonzalez. On 26 August Iridessa was moved up in class to contest the Group 2 Debutante Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh in which she was ridden by Donnacha O'Brien and finished fifth of the nine runners behind Skitter Scatter. In the Listed Ingabelle Stakes over the same distance at Leopardstown Racecourse on 15 September she finished third behind Sparkle'n'joy and Foxtrot Liv. On 12 October Iridessa was sent to England for the Group 1 Fillies' Mile at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Wayne Lordan she started a 14/1 outsider in an eight-runner field which included Pretty Pollyanna, Hermosa, Antonia de Vega (Prestige Stakes) and Beyond Reason (Prix du Calvados). Iridessa raced in mid-division before making a forward move in the last quarter mile but was obstructed when attempting to obtain a clear run. She accelerated through a gap to take the lead in the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths from Hermosa with Pretty Pollyanna three quarters of a length back in third. After the race Joseph O'Brien said \\"We've always loved her. She ran well in a messy race at the Curragh and then was drawn on the inside at Leopardstown so she was set an almost impossible task. Today was probably the first time since her debut that she had a fair crack at everything. She travelled very well through the race. Wayne gave her a fantastic ride\\". 2019: three-year-old season Iridessa began her second season in the Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes on 6 April and finished third of the fourteen runners behind Lady Kaya and Happen. On 5 May the filly started 6/1 for the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket, but after tracking the leaders she was outpaced in the final furlong and came home eighth to Hermosa, three lengths behind the winner. In the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh on 26 May she again proved no match for Hermosa and was beaten more than six lengths into fourth place. For her next race, Iridessa was stepped up in distance and matched against older fillies and mares in the Group 1 Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh in which she was ridden by Wayne Lordan. The Epsom Oaks runner-up Pink Dogwood started favourite ahead of Wild Illusion, Magic Wand (Ribblesdale Stakes) and Worth Waiting (Dahlia Stakes) with Iridessa being made the 8/1 outsider in the five- runner field. She raced just behind the leaders Magic Wand and Wild Illusion before taking the lead inside the final furlong and pulling away to win by two and a quarter lengths. After the race O'Brien said \\"She won very well and it was a huge performance... It was very strong race. There wasn't a big field, but there were some very very good fillies in the race... the step up in distance was a big help to her as well... she's strong and hardy. That's obviously a career-best again today and she's progressed with each run so far this year.\\" In July Iridessa was again moved up in distance for the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh. She went off the 4/1 third favourite but was never in serious contention and finished seventh of the eight runners, almost twelve lengths behind the winner Star Catcher. At Leopardstown on 14 September the filly was dropped back to one mile for the Matron Stakes in which she was partnered by Lordan and started at odds of 10/1. Laurens went off favourite in a seven-runner field which also included Hermosa, I Can Fly (second in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes), Just Wonderful (Rockfel Stakes), Skitter Scatter and Happen. Laurens set the pace from Hermosa with Iridessa settled in fourth place before making a forward move in the last quarter mile. She took the lead 150 yards from the finish and kept on well to win by three quarters of a length from Hermosa. O'Brien commented \\"She's a very good mare when things fall right for her. Wayne gave her a great ride, and she was the best filly on the day. She has a huge engine... She's by a Derby winner but physically looks like more of a miler than a staying filly, but she seems really versatile distance-wise\\". At Newmarket on 5 October Iridessa was made third choice in the betting behind Hermosa and Lauren in the Group 1 Sun Chariot Stakes over the Rowley mile. With Donnacha O'Brien in saddle she stayed on well in the closing stages to take third place, beaten one and a half lengths and half a length by Billesdon Brook and Veracious. For her final run of the season the filly was sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf over ten furlongs at Santa Anita Park on 2 November. With Lordan in the saddle she went off the 8/1 third favourite behind Sistercharlie and Vasilika (Gamely Stakes) while the other seven runners included Billesdon Brook, Villa Marina, Castle Lady and Mirth (Rodeo Drive Stakes). After racing in third place behind Mirth and Vasilika she went to the front in the straight and kept on well to win by a neck from Vasilika with a gap of two and a quarter lengths back to Sistercharlie in third place. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"I was very happy through the race. We just wanted to get a nice position early and she had the early place to do that. It was always the plan to finish her season here and we were fortunate to have a good draw and things worked out lovely under a great ride by Wayne. She’s been a great servant to her owner, competing in all the best races and either winning or placing, and I’d love to think she will stay in training next year, when we will run in all the top mile and mile-and-a-quarter races\\". In February 2020 it was announced that Iridessa had been retired from racing after sustaining a tendon injury in her stable. She was sold and exported to Japan to become a broodmare.

AMR utilizes a modified Dutch auction procedure to set the new interest rate on each participating class of CLO securities first developed by MUFG Securities and structured by Konstantin Kulev.  History  AMR was originally developed by Sancus Capital Management, an active investor in the CLO market not only as means to increase the efficiencies and reduce the costs of Traditional Refinancings, but also as a means for CLOs whose original issuance date predated the effective date of the U.S. risk retention rules to avoid being subject to the U.S. risk retention rules as a result of a Traditional Refinancing. In response to a request letter on behalf of Sancus Capital Management, the SEC confirmed in a Sept. 1, 2016, no-action letter that resetting the applicable margin of an AMR Class using AMR procedures would not constitute an “offer and sale of asset- backed securities by an issuing entity” and would therefore be unlikely to require compliance with the U.S. risk retention requirements. The Atlas Senior Secured Loan Fund VIII, Ltd. CLO, managed by Crescent Capital Group L.P., was the first to incorporate the AMR mechanics in its CLO documents in July 2017. Since then, AMR has been incorporated in additional CLOs including transactions managed by Trimaran Advisors, LLC and Seix Investment Advisors LLC.  AMR procedures  AMR affects the reset of the interest rate on each of the designated participating classes of CLO securities (each, an “AMR Class”) through a modified Dutch auction. Like Traditional Refinancings, the AMR procedures can be initiated at the direction of the holders of a majority of the Subordinated Notes of a CLO or by the Collateral Manager. In addition, the AMR procedures may also be initiated automatically, if certain specified objective conditions specified in the indenture for the related CLO have occurred. Prior written notice of each AMR date, auction procedures, and other relevant information is distributed by the CLO trustee to the holders of each AMR Class and certain other transaction parties. An Auction Service Provider (the “ASP”) is appointed by the CLO issuer to facilitate the auction process. The ASP provides the platform for the submission of bids by participating member broker-dealers who are preapproved trading counterparties of the AMR settlement agent. These broker-dealers place confidential bids to purchase a specified principal balance of the AMR Classes at a spread (margin) to Libor not higher than a predetermined maximum margin. If sufficient bids are received by the ASP, the lowest margin at which such bids fully account for the aggregate principal balance of all securities (other than, if relevant, securities held by holders of risk retention interests), will become the “clearing rate” and the new applicable margin for the AMR Class. After the new applicable margin is established, the securities comprising each relevant AMR Class are mandatorily tendered pursuant to Depository Trust Company (DTC) protocols. If sufficient bids are not received to establish the clearing rate for any AMR Class, the auction for that specific AMR class fails and the applicable margin for the AMR class remains the same. A failed auction for one AMR Class does not impact the new clearing rate of any other AMR Class for which the auction was successful. On any subsequent AMR date, the auction may be repeated. The period from the commencement of the AMR procedures by the delivery of an election notice by the majority of the Subordinated Notes or the Collateral Manager designating the relevant AMR Classes through the settlement date for purchases is approximately a 45-day period. AMR can be utilized in addition to, and not in replacement of, Traditional Refinancings. The AMR provisions required to be incorporated into the standard CLO documentation are straightforward and limited. Such provisions have already been incorporated into the transaction documents for new issue CLOs and for previously issued CLOs in connection with the reset options.  Transparency and risk retention compliance  The AMR auction results are made publicly available to promote transparency. In addition, access to AMR Classes being refinanced via the AMR auction process is intended to be democratic, providing access to investors who might otherwise be excluded from a Traditional Refinancing. To the extent that an AMR Class contains risk retention securities under the European risk retention rules and/or the U.S. risk retention rules, such securities can be excluded from the AMR procedures, with the clearing rate being applied to such securities automatically.

Its sister company under Murdoch's control, the present- day News Corp, holds his print interests and other media assets. History The company name traces back through a series of mergers and demergers to the Fox Film Corporation founded by William Fox on February 1, 1915. Formation On December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company announced its intent to acquire the motion picture, cable entertainment, and direct broadcast satellite divisions of 21st Century Fox. The remainder of the company would form a so-called \\"New Fox\\", maintaining control of assets such as Fox's television network and broadcast stations, Fox News, the national operations of Fox Sports, and the 20th Century Fox studio lot, which would be leased to Disney for seven years. Fox's regional sports networks were to be included in the sale to Disney. In May 2018, it was confirmed that Lachlan Murdoch, rather than James Murdoch, would take charge of the New Fox company. The merger faced antitrust scrutiny; Disney would not legally be able to own both the ABC and Fox networks due to an FCC policy known as the \\"dual network rule\\", which prohibits mergers between the top broadcast networks. The Department of Justice also ordered that Fox's regional sports networks be divested by Disney within 90 days of closing. Disney owns 80 percent of ESPN, and the Justice Department felt that the Fox regional networks' combination with ESPN would make Disney too dominant in the cable sports market. In mid-2018, NBCUniversal's parent company Comcast instigated bidding wars over both the Fox assets Disney planned to purchase, and the British broadcaster Sky plc (a company which 21st Century Fox held a stake in, and was planning to acquire the remainder). In July 2018, Fox agreed to an increase of Disney's offer to $71.3 billion to fend off Comcast's counter-bid. British regulators ordered that a blind auction be held for Sky's assets, which was won by Comcast. On October 10, 2018, it was reported that in preparation for the impending completion of the sale, the new, post-merger organizational structure of \\"New Fox\\" would be implemented by January 1, 2019. On November 14, 2018, it was revealed that the new independent company will maintain the original Fox name. On January 7, 2019, Fox Corporation's registration statement was filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On January 11, 2019, Fox stated in a securities filing that it had no plans to bid on its former regional sports networks; they would instead go to a consortium led by Sinclair Broadcast Group, with Fox Corporation continuing to license the FSN name to those stations until Sinclair can develop a new brand. On March 12, 2019, Disney announced that the sale would be completed by March 20, 2019. On March 19, 2019, Fox Corporation officially began trading on the S&P; 500, replacing 21st Century Fox on the index. Republican politician and former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan also joined Fox Corporation's board at this time. Beginning of operations Fox Corporation began operating separately on March 18, 2019. Chairman and CEO Lachlan Murdoch led a town hall meeting three days later, indicating that stock would be issued to the corporation's employees based on longevity. In May 2019, via the Fox Sports division, Fox Corporation acquired a 4.99% stake in Canadian online gambling operator The Stars Group for $236 million. As a result, it was also announced that the companies would co-develop sports betting products for the U.S. market under the branding Fox Bet. In early July 2019, Fox Entertainment announced the formation of SideCar, with executives led by Gail Berman. SideCar is a content development unit for Fox and other outlets. In August 2019, Fox Corporation announced it would acquire Credible Labs for $397 million and animation studio Bento Box Entertainment for $50 million. In April 2020, Fox acquired streaming service Tubi for $440 million.

It plays a similar role in real algebraic geometry that the radical of an ideal plays in algebraic geometry over an algebraically closed field. More specifically, the Nullstellensatz says that when I is an ideal in a polynomial ring with coefficients coming from an algebraically closed field, the radical of I is the set of polynomials vanishing on the vanishing locus of I. In real algebraic geometry, the Nullstellensatz fails as the real numbers are not algebraically closed. However, one can recover a similar theorem, the real Nullstellensatz, by using the real radical in place of the (ordinary) radical. Definition The real radical of an ideal I in a polynomial ring \\\\mathbb{R}[x_1,\\\\dots,x_n] over the real numbers, denoted by \\\\sqrt[\\\\mathbb{R}]{I}, is defined as :\\\\sqrt[\\\\mathbb{R}]{I}=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}[x_1,\\\\dots,x_n] \\\\mid -f^{2m} = \\\\sum_i h_i^2 + g \\\\text{ where }\\\\ m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_+, h_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}[x_1,\\\\dots,x_n], \\\\text{ and } g \\\\in I\\\\right\\\\\\\\}.

He was a member of Academia Sinica and a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Engineering. Considered a founder of Taiwan's semiconductor industry, he was awarded the TWAS Prize for Engineering Sciences in 2006 and the Nikkei Asia Prize for Science in 2007.  Early life and education  Chang was born on 12 October 1937 in Fengshan, Kaohsiung (formerly part of Tainan), Taiwan. His father Chang Mu-huo (張木火), a secondary school teacher, was fired after the February 28 incident and sentenced to death on charge of subversion for his involvement in the Madou incident. Because of his father's involvement, Chang was blacklisted and forbidden from going abroad to study, and therefore received his entire education in Taiwan. After graduating with an electrical engineering degree from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in 1960, he studied at the graduate school of National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), where he earned his MS in 1962 and his PhD in 1970, specializing in semiconductors. He was the first locally educated engineering PhD in Taiwan.  Career  In 1964, Chang, together with his colleagues Chang Jui-fu (張瑞夫) and Kuo Shuang-fa (郭雙發), founded the Semiconductor Research Center at NCTU, which was the first such center in Taiwan and considered the foundation of Taiwan's hi-tech industry. He moved to National Cheng Kung University in 1977, where he pioneered Taiwan's research on semiconductor materials including gallium arsenide, amorphous silicon, and polycrystalline silicon. After 10 years at NCKU, he returned to NCTU in 1987 and established the National Nano Device Laboratories in 1990, serving as its director until 1997. He then served as director of NCTU's Microelectronics and Information System Research Center for a year. On 1 August 1998, Chang became President of National Chiao Tung University. In 2002, he established the program \\"National System on Chip\\" (NSOC) to foster talent in system design. Chang's former students went on to establish some of the largest hi-tech companies in Taiwan, including Acer, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), and UMC. Chang served as an advisor to some of Taiwan's semiconductor companies. He donated more than NT$100 million from his earnings to the endowment of NCTU.  Awards  Chang was elected as an IEEE Fellow in 1987 \\"for his contribution to semiconductor device development and to education\\". He became a member of Academia Sinica in 1996, and a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Engineering in 2000. Chang was awarded IEEE's Third Millennium Medal in 2000, the TWAS Prize for Engineering Sciences in 2006 \\"for his pioneering contributions to very large scale integration, opto-electronics, microwave devices and materials\\", and the Nikkei Asia Prize for Science in 2007.  Illness and death  Chang was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. After two years of treatment, he died on 12 October 2018, his 81st birthday.

He was a Professor of Physics and of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, and he served as the second Master of Massey College from 1981 to 1988. Life and career Hume received a B.A. in Mathematics and Physics in 1945, an M.A. in Physics in 1946 and a PhD in Physics in 1949 (Theoretical Atomic Spectroscopy) from the University of Toronto. From 1946-1949 he taught returning soldiers Mathematics at the University of Toronto campus in Ajax, Ontario. He was an instructor in Physics at Rutgers University in New Jersey between 1949-1950 before rejoining the University of Toronto as an Assistant Professor of Physics. In 1953, Hume and Beatrice Worsley began development of Transcode, a new computer language for the Ferranti Mark 1 machine known as FERUT. In collaboration with his colleague Donald Ivey, he helped to steer the teaching of physics in a new direction through the use of educational television programs and movies. Starting in 1958 Hume and Ivey prepared and presented over one hundred television programs for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on various physics topics. Short films for the PSSC such as Frames of Reference and the CBC TV show The Nature of Things used humour and creative camerawork to make physics accessible to a wider range of students. In 1958 with Calvin Gotlieb he published High-speed Data Processing, the first book on using computers in business which was \\"recognized by The Oxford English Dictionary in twelve computer-related entries: block, character, datum, generator, housekeeping, in-line, interpreter, keyboard, logical, loop, matrix and simulate\\". In 1964, with Calvin Gotlieb and Thomas Hull, he founded the Computer Science department at the University of Toronto. With Ric Holt, he co-authored many computer programming textbooks, for SP/k, Fortran, Pascal, Turing and Java. Hume was the second Master of Massey College, Toronto having been a Senior Fellow since 1973. Upon his retirement, he was appointed Professor Emeritus in 1988. In 2002, he was inducted into the Canadian Information Productivity Awards (CIPA) Hall of Fame. In 2006 he was awarded an Honorary D.Sc. from Queen's University School of Computing. He was an active member of The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto and for many years collaborated with Jack Yokom to produce the Annual Spring Review. He died on 9 May 2013. In 2014 Hume was given a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Canadian Association of Computer Science including for \\"the world's first long-distance use of a computer\\".

Acraephia is said to have been founded by Athamas or Acraepheus, son of Apollo; and according to some writers it was the same as the Homeric Arne. Here the Thebans took refuge, when their city was destroyed by Alexander the Great. It contained a temple of Dionysus. At the distance of 15 stadia from the town, on the right of the road, and upon Mt. Ptoum, was a celebrated sanctuary and oracle of Apollo Ptous. This oracle was consulted by Mardonius before the Battle of Plataea, and is said to have answered his emissary, who was a Carian, in the language of the latter. The name of the mountain was derived by some from Ptous, a son of Apollo and Euxippe, and by others from Leto having been frightened πτοέω by a boar, when she was about to bring forth in this place. Both Acraephia and the oracle belonged to Thebes. There was no temple of the Ptoan Apollo, properly so called; Plutarch mentions a tholos (θόλος),Plutarch, Gryllus 7 but other writers speak only of a temenos (τέμενος), ἱερόν, Χρηστήριον or μαντεῖον.Plutarch, Pel. 16. According to Pausanias, the oracle ceased after the capture of Thebes by Alexander; but the sanctuary still continued to retain its celebrity, as we see from the great Acraephian inscription, which August Böckh places in the time of Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus after 177 CE. It appears from this inscription that a festival was celebrated in honour of the Ptoan Apollo every four years.Böckh, Inscr. No. 1625. The ruins of Acraephia are situated at a short distance to the south of the modern village of the same name. The remains of the acropolis are visible on an isolated hill, a spur of Mt. Ptoum, and at its foot on the north and west are traces of the ancient town. Here stands the church of Agios Georgios (St. George) built out of the stones of the old town, and containing many fragments of antiquity. In this church William Martin Leake discovered the great inscription alluded to above, which is in honour of one of the citizens of the place called Epaminondas. The ruins near the fountain, which is now called Perdikóbrysis, probably belong to the sanctuary of the Ptoan Apollo.Leake, Northern Greece, vol. ii. p. 295, et seq.

In 2013 she experimented with the effects of fire on a 1950 style British house discovering that toxic gases were as prevalent in closed rooms and ones with their doors open: this affected emergency egress times. Her work in 2018 showed that fire fighters were 3 times more likely to contract cancer, as the carcinogens entered through the skin. The methods used to wash their protective gear washed the carcinogens into the fibres making them carcinogenic. Grenfell Tower Inquiry Seventy-one people died in the Grenfell Tower fire. Stec had warned of the toxic nature of plastic cladding in an academic paper. On 8 February 2018, Stec briefed Public Health England, saying further analysis was needed of soil and dust within the tower and other evacuated buildings before residents returned. The so-called “Grenfell cough” reported by survivors is indicative of elevated levels of atmospheric contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) which are potentially carcinogenic. Early results indicate high levels of PAH in the surrounding soil and the biggest threat to survivors would be from absorption of toxic material via the skin, not from smoke inhalation. Black soot from the fire was highly likely to be contaminated with asbestos from the tower. There would be potential large-scale contamination up to a mile around the tower, with potential long-term health implications. In September 2018 Stec was appointed as an expert witness to the Grenfell Tower Enquiry.

Its design was advanced and its price low, but its stalling characteristics were too dangerous for beginners, so the thirty-plus examples completed were rapidly withdrawn from use. Two were subsequently modified, one with greater span and the other with a small engine. Design and development The CW 8 was designed in 1934 to build on the success of the CWJ, an open-frame basic training glider. It had the same layout but a rigorous effort to simplify the structure and to use standard components resulted in a very low cost. The CW 8 was the last of Czerwiński's designs to be built in the workshops of ZASPL, the Aviation Association of students of the Lwów Technical University. The single spar wing of the CW 8 was in two parts, each with two distinct panels. ts inner panels were parallelograms in plan, swept at about 7°. The outer panels were trapezoidal, with more than 7° leading edge sweep but with unswept trailing edges which carried broad chord ailerons. It was plywood-covered ahead of the main spar inboard and to the angled ancillary spar further out, with fabric aft. The wing was mounted on top of the CW 8's open frame fuselage and braced on each side by a single, airfoil-section strut from the lower fuselage to the wing spar, assisted by wires. The upper chord or longeron of the glider's open frame fuselage was horizontal in flight but the lower chord included a box which ran from the nose to behind the trailing edge, with an upward-sloping member aft. The upper and lower longerons were connected by two vertical and three oblique cross- members, truss fashion. The exposed pilot's seat was mounted on the box behind the foremost cross-member and under the wing at about mid-chord. A rubber disk-sprung landing skid was also attached to the box. The empennage was similar to that of the CWJ, with a fabric covered, tube-braced, triangular plan tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage. It carried fabric covered elevators which were rectangular in plan apart from a cut-out for rudder movement. Part of the fin, with a vertical leading edge, filled the space between the upper and lower longerons but there was an upward, cropped triangular, extension. The fin carried a square-topped, balanced, rudder. Operational history The date of its first flight is uncertain as sources give either autumn 1934 or early 1935. It was flown from Lwów-Skniłów, piloted by Franciszek Kotowski. Successful flight trials led to an order from LOPP for the CW 8bis, which had a larger rudder. Between thirty and forty were completed before it became obvious that it was easily stalled by inexperienced pilots and so was unsuitable as a basic trainer. It was therefore withdrawn from service. The CW 8ter, a version with an increase in span, wing area and unladen weight of about 30% each was tested in 1935. Despite better performance, including a minimum sink speed of and a maximum glide ratio of 12.5, no further examples were built. In late 1936 some student members of ZASPL began design work on a motorized version of the CW-8 which became known as the ZASPL CW 8S. It was powered by a inverted, air-cooled, single cylinder engine named the JS4 and designed by one of the students, Jerzy Szablowski. This drove a two blade, wooden propeller and was mounted in tractor configuration in the wing leading edge, where the upper fuselage was strengthened around its mounting. The pilot's seat was enclosed in an open, ply nacelle. The CW 8S's dimensions were unchanged, though the empty weight rose to . The sole example was first flown in 1937 and was used by ZAPL students. Its maximum speed was about and it had a range of about .

It was created in 1320, although the current version, which dates from 1859, reprises the form that it had before the end of the Ancien Régime after having undergone several temporary modifications. Its heraldic description is the following one: The blazon proper of Lyon consists of a field of gules (red color), in which a lion appears rampant (of profile and erect) and silver (white color). The shield itself is augmented by a heraldic chief, the division occupying the upper third. This is the \\"Head of France\\", which shows the heraldry of his former monarchs: of azure laden with three golden fleurs-de-lys (a blue background adorned with three yellow lily flowers). In the crest, a French mural crown of gold is shown. The mural crown, of Roman origin, is often used by municipal corporations as an emblem of their power and authority. Surrounding the arms is a crown formed by two branches of mulberry or oak. A decree, dated 26 November 1946, established that it would adorn the coat of arms with the decorations granted to Lyon: the Cross of the Legion of Honour, the French Cross of War 1914-1918 and the Resistance Medal. The shield of the city was granted in 1320, when Lyon was included the list of «Bonnes Villes» of the king of France. The armories with the silver lion in a field of gules, which used the ancient counts of Lyon, were augmented with the old \\"Head of France\\" (strewn with gold fleurs-de-lis). In 1376, King Charles V of France simplified its shield by reducing the number of fleurs de lis to three. This change was introduced in the heraldic chiefs of all the \\"Bonnes Villes\\". The current design was adopted in 1859. History of the coat of arms of Lyon Pre- heraldic times Ancient arms of Lyons. The birth of heraldry and the formation of the first coats of arms as a distinctive mark of individuals (noble or not) and the organizations of cities or corporations only dates from the 12th century, but one can find, however, traces of a symbol of the city's arms called De geules au chef de Bourgogne, that is, a red shield surmounted by a haorizontal band with the diagonal striped colors of the Kingdom of Burgundy, which were gold and blue starting in the fifth century.Histoire du blason de Lyon sur @Lyon et Guichet du Savoir, Blason de Lyon. Essentially, during this era, Lyons made up part of the Kingdom of Burgundy born in the aftermath of the fall of the Western Roman Empire and which made up the three great French kingdoms with Austrasia and Neustria, where the Merovingians ruled. One finds on these original arms the champ de gueule (red field or background), which would be the foundation for all subsequent coats of arms of Lyons. The counts of Lyon Blason des comtes de Lyon In the tenth century, the counts of Lyons were the sovereign rulers of the city of Lyons which coalesced during the time of the Kingdom of Arles, then in the Holy Roman Empire after 1058. These counts of Lyons took for their emblem De gueules au lion d'argent. The name of the city of Lyons has no link with the animal lion, as it comes from the Latin name Lugdunum of which the root Lug- could also have been attached, like the Latin Lux (\\"light\\") or the Gaulish Lugos (\\"bracket\\") to the other root dunum, which means \\"hill.\\" But the linguistic closeness which is noted today between the animal and the name of the city could have given inspiration to the arms parlantes, that is, the imagistic content gives in rebus the name of the cities that they designate. In the 12th century, the Archbishop of Lyons regained the title of Count and exercised temporal power as well as spiritual over the city. During this time the city carried the emblem of the counts of Lyons. The union with France Blason de la ville de Lyon en 1320 The relationship between the bourgeois residents and the archbishop of Lyons often intersected with the subject of communal freedom at the beginning of the 14th century. King Philip IV of France, interested in this city on the frontier of his kingdom, came to settle conflicts and eventually de facto to annex the city, an action confirmed by the Council of Vienne in 1312. In 1320, he gave the city a municipal charter, under which it would be governed by 12 consuls and, as a symbol of his protection, be granted a chef de France (French heading) to its coat of arms. This heading was stitched onto the arms in order to avoid the rule of heraldry which prohibited the bordering of a color against another color (red against blue) on a coat of arms. The French heading, which is a blue band studded with fleur-de-lis, was a privilege which the King of France accorded to \\"good cities of France,\\" which were loyal to him during the Middle Ages, before they were instituted all over the coats arms of municipalities in France at the end of the Ancien Régime. These cities had the privilege of being represented at the coronation of French kings. This addition corresponded with the coat of arms of France itself. Furthermore, the coat of arms of Lyons followed the evolution of the royal coat of arms of France, which at its outset was described as D'azur semé de fleurs de lys, that is, blue with a significant number of fleur-de-lis arrayed on the shield. The French heading accorded in 1320 was thus also studded with fleur-de-lis. In 1376, however, King Charles V of France simplified his arms and reduced the number of fleur-de-lis to just three. The arms of Lyons followed suit, being simplified to use a heading with only three floral emblems. The coat of arms as thus modified is the coat of arms of the city today and that which has been used for the longest stretch of the city's history. French Revolution and First French Empire Lyons' arms under the Napoleonic Empire. The French Revolution which began in 1789 suppressed the coats of arms which were considered symbols of the Ancien Régime, which had been overthrown. There were thus no coats of arms of Lyons that represented the city during the First French Republic. The representatives of the city wanted to use a shield carrying only a goddess of Liberty. In 1793, following the Revolt of Lyon against the National Convention, \\"Lyon n'est plus\\" (Lyons was no more), as the city as an institution was officially disestablished. The First French Empire re-established the city and gave it arms like all the other cities in France by the decree of 1809 and changed only the fleur-de-lis at its head into three bees oriented upwards.http://www.euraldic.com/txt_vbh002_lyon.html (in French) The bees are symbols of Napoléon I and the Empire itself and came to replace the fleur de lis as a symbol of France in different heraldic contexts. The arms were thus officially described: \\"De gueules au lion d'argent au chef des bonnes villes de l'Empire (de gueules à trois abeilles d'or).\\" The Restoration and the July Monarchy Arms of Lyons in 1819. The French Restoration in 1815 again changed the coat of arms of France and Louis XVIII permitted French cities to resume using the arms that they had employed before the Revolution. This returned the three fleur-de-lis to the head of the arms of Lyons. Otherwise, the king augmented through letters-patent of 27 February 1819 the arms of the city with a sword carried in the right paw of the lion in order to commemorate the siege of Lyons the city had endured for the royal cause in 1793 and in recognition of the combativeness of the city in the armed struggle against the Revolution.Archives historiques et statistiques du département du Rhône, tome VII, 1827 (lire en ligne ), note at the bottom of page 339-340 (in French). Arms of Lyons in 1831. Following the Three Glorious Days in July 1830 which overthrew King Charles X of France, the July Monarchy was installed and renounced the traditional royal coat of arms with the blue field studded with three fleur-de-lis in 1831 in order to symbolize the adhesion of the monarchy to a parliamentary system. As such, the fleur-de-lis on the coat of arms of Lyons were changed to three gold stars. From 1848 to the present The short-lived Second French Republic was not interested in using coats of arms. Under the Second French Empire, the keeper of the seals asked Senator Vaïsse in 1859 to resume the use of the coat of arms carrying only the lion and the fleur-de-lis, but this modification was not adopted by the municipal council of Lyons until the beginning of the twentieth century. In the interim, under the Third Republic, a number of fantastical emblems flourished, with many adding elements or changing the position of the lion.Guichet du Savoir [archive], Blason de Lyon. The city of Lyons uses thus at the beginning of the 21st century the arms which it has carried for six centuries: De gueules au lion rampant armé, lampassé d'argent au chef d'azur chargé de trois fleurs de lys d'or. Ornaments Arms and motto of the city of Lyons. 220pxThe ornaments outside the shield do not, properly speaking, make up part of the coat of arms and are not described in the heraldry, even if eventually they are codified. They are situated around the shield itself. * The walled crown: The walled crown symbolizes the fortifications of the ancient cities but their addition on the shield generally only dates from the First Empire. Napoléon Bonaparte accorded the city a walled crown with seven gold crenellations, a symbol of the cities fortified from Antiquity. * The War Cry: The cry is represented traditionally on a ribbon above the shield: \\"Il servait autrefois de signal, soit pour livrer le combat ou se reconnaître dans la mêlée, soit pour rallier les troupes et ranimer leur courage\\" (It serves otherwise as a signal, either to begin combat or for soldiers to be recognized in the melée, or to rally the troops and restore their courage.)Jouffroy d'Eschavannes, Traité complet de la Science du Blason à l'usage des Bibliophiles, Archéologues, Amateurs d'objets d'art et de curiosité, Numismates, Archivistes, Paris, 1885 (in French). For example, Montjoie-Saint- Denis would be the war cry of the kings of France, as Notre Dame Guesclin would be that of the constable Bertrand Du Guesclin. The war cry of the city of Lyons in the francoprovençal dialect which is documented from 1723 is \\"Avant, Avant, Lion le melhor!\\" This exhortation is, however, regularly confused with the motto and is frequently associated with the arms of the city in the representations on the ribbon under the shield. * The motto: The motto is represented traditionally in heraldry as written on a ribbon under the shield. The motto of the city of Lyons is traditionally Virtute duce, comite fortuna (\\"Led by virtue, accompanied by good fortune\\"), quotations from Cicero to Lucius Munatius Plancus, the founder of Lyons. One finds, however, also other mottoes such as Fortitudine ac (or et) prudentia (From force and prudence). * The supporting elements: The supporting ornaments are animals or figures (often mythological) who support the shield. In the ancient representations, the shield of Lyons is often represented alone or shared between two \\"angels\\" or \\"spirits.\\"Archives historiques et statistiques du département du Rhône, Tome VII, . (in French) But modern usage often undergirds the arms of cities with oak branches or laurel wreaths, etc. * The decorations: The city of Lyons received over the course of the 20th century several decorations which it could represent in its coat of arms. The city was awarded the cross of the Knight of the Legion of Honor by decree of 26 November 1946 with the Croix de Guerre of 1939-45 and the Resistance Medal with a rose.Chemins de mémoire. The origin of the lion in the arms of Lyons The name of Lyons has no link with the animal, but derives from the Latin name of the city Lugdunum, which was progressively reduced to Lyduum, and then Lyons. This homonym, completely by chance, has influenced the choice of a lion as a symbol of the city and the formation of \\"speaking arms.\\" But this resemblance is not the only origin of the lion of Lyons, though it was used as an emblem of the city beginning in antiquity. It is possible that it had been adopted in honor of Mark Antony, who himself had used the emblem. Mark Antony had traveled in Gaul with Julius Caesar, for whom Antony had been the treasurer of the army during the Gallic Wars, and Celtic Gaul had been retaken by him during the partitioning of Roman lands by the Second Triumvirate as constituted with Lepidus and Octavian. He had been one of the benefactors of the city, which had been founded shortly beforehand. The mint at Lugdunum which had the privilege of striking money released at least about 43 BC a quinarius of Mark Antony with the head of Victory turned to the right and on the reverse a lion walking and the inscription LUGUDUNI A XL (Lyons, 40th year) for its 40th anniversary. Thus, in the same manner as the wolf of Rome or the crocodile of Nîmes, it seems that the lion has been associated with Lyons since ancient times. Later, it also served as a symbol of the bourgeois citizens of Lyons in their struggles against the power of the archbishop. As a consequence of the presence of the lion in its coat of arms, on 10 July 1584 the city was offered a real lion by François de Mandelot, governor of the Lyonnais. The consulate thanked the donor but refused the gift, as it did not have funds for its upkeep in the middle of the Wars of Religion. Arms of the city as a municipality The history presented here of the different coats of arms traditionally used in order to describe the city of Lyons in the sense that the sovereign, that is, the count of Lyons, was merged with those of the city. Technically, it was not until 1320, when the archbishop Pierre IV of Savoy accorded a charter that instituted the consulate, that the city possessed its own arms as a municipality, which were those of the counts of Lyons to whose temporal power the consulate had succeeded.Guichet du Savoir , Blason de Lyon. At the beginning of the 15th century, the presence of the lion in the arms of the city was the subject of a trial. The archbishop of Lyons, Amédée II de Talaru, who was at the time on unfriendly terms with the city's aldermen, decided to remove the lion from the arms of the city, thus depriving it of its most noble element, in arguing that the lion had been given by the archbishops-counts of Lyon since it was the arms of the counts of Lyon and thus it was the right of the archbishop to reclaim it. As it happened, the archbishop had the will to modify the arms of the city as he believed he had the right to do, but the aldermen appealed to King Charles IV who sided with them and carried the affair before the Parlement when the archbishop refused to execute the royal order. By this decision, the authorities confirmed the full ownership of the municipality to the arms of the city.

The saint is set in one of the first landscapes by either of the Carracci brothers, showing how he was influenced by Venetian landscape painting until about 1598 after a stay in the city in 1587 and 1588. Specific influences include Titian's Penitent Saint Jerome (Louvre) and the naturalism of Jacopo Bassano. Critics argue the composition is based on two prints by Cornelis Cort, a Flemish printer - Penitent St Jerome and The Vision of Saint Eustace. These prints were in turn based on ideas by the Lombard painter Girolamo Muziano, who was also influenced by Venetian models. Gianfranco Malafarina, L'opera completa di Annibale Carracci, Milano, 1976, n. 26, pp. 93-94. The dogs and some other details are drawn from Saint Eustace, an engraving by Albrecht Dürer of the same subject.

It is theorised that the painting was taken to Rome by the artist to give to cardinal Odoardo Farnese, who became titular cardinal of the Basilica of Sant'Eustachio in 1595, the same year as Carracci moved to Rome permanently to work for Odoardo. It remained in the Farnese collection, moving initially to Parma and then to Naples, where it finally ended up in its present home in the National Museum of Capodimonte in Naples.

It was celebrated for the worship of Athena, who was said to have been born there, and who is hence called Alalcomeneis (Ἀλαλκομενηΐς) in Homer's Iliad. The temple of the goddess stood, at a little distance from the town, on the Triton River, a small stream flowing into Lake Copais., 9.33.5, et seq. The town was by a hill which Strabo calls Mount Tilphossium (named for Telphousa, the spring visited by the god Apollo). Strabo also records that the tomb of the seer Teiresias, and the temple of Tilphossian Apollo, were located just outside Alalcomenae. Ancient sources preserve three accounts of the origin of the town's name: * Stephanus of Byzantium and the geographer Pausanias -- and probably Homer -- preserve the story that it was named after Alalcomenes (or Alalkomenes, in Stephanus), who raised the goddess Athena there. * Pausanias also records an account that it was named after Alalcomenia, daughter of Ogygus, King of the Ectenes, the people to first occupy the land of Thebes. * According to Stephanus of Byzantium, the Alexandrian scholar Aristarchus of Samothrace believed the town was named from the Greek verb \\"to protect\\" (< ), to reflect Athena's role as defender of the town. The early \\"D\\" scholia on the Iliad also reflect this account, so the idea may pre-date Aristarchus.Schol. D on Iliad 4.8, 5.908. In view of the cult of Athena there, presumably local myth in Alalcomenae followed the first of these theories. Beyond the modern village of Solinari (Solinarion), the site of Alalcomenae, are some polygonal foundations, apparently those of a single building, which are probably remains of the peribolus of the temple. Both the town and the temple were plundered by the Roman general Sulla, who carried off the statue of the goddess. Pausanias recalls a story after Sulla stole the statue of Athena from the temple, in revenge Athena sent a plague of lice upon him; but afterwards the temple was neglected.William Martin Leake, Northern Greece, vol. ii. p. 135; Forchhammer, Hellenica, p. 185.

The track was written with Frank Ocean collaborator Troy Nōka. The second single \\"Bad Ones\\" was released on August 29, 2017. The single features a collaboration with Canadian duo Tegan and Sara. On August 8, 2018, Dear announced the release of the new album. He explained the reasoning for title: \\"I'm calling this one Bunny. As always, it’s got a little bit of everything that makes me who I am. Why Bunny? Fundamentally, I love the way the word looks and sounds. I love the way it rolls off the mind and onto the tongue\\". Alongside the album, single \\"Bunny's Dream\\" was also released. The next single \\"Horses\\", which featured Tegan and Sara in the second collaboration, was released on September 18, 2018. Critical reception Bunny was met with \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 76, based on 14 reviews. Aggregator Album of the Year gave the release a 70 out of 100 based on a critical consensus of 14 reviews. Paul Simpson from AllMusic explained that the album is \\"as sprawling and ambitious as his other long-players\\", admiring that it \\"features some of [Dear's] most forthright songwriting and catchiest hooks\\". Simpson also noted the album \\"seems more like an album to mentally pick apart than dance to, yet it's not hard to lose one's self in the rush of Dear's inventive rhythms. Jill Guthrie from Clash said of the album: \\"in its entirety is quintessentially disparate, a fleeting repertoire of the avant, and a keeper of both the nostalgic and the progressive\\", explaining that the songs drift from \\"the ethereal\\" to the \\"gritty reality\\". Skye Butchard from Loud and Quiet explained that the album \\"goes just about everywhere in its hour-long runtime, from ’80s Bowie camp to shimmering alt-pop, to ’90s guitar rave. He’s been tinkering with club music and alt-rock his whole career, but this is by far his most bubbly outing. Despite that, his oddball baritone stays intact, which sadly makes for a mixed bag of experiments\\". Ben Devlin from MusicOMH said the album \\"is a worthwhile return for Matthew Dear, showcasing the production chops that have made him a familiar name for 15 years now. It sags in places, but this isn’t such a crime when the album also contains highlights like Electricity, Horses, Modafinil Blues and Bunny’s Dream, which are highly recommended for any electronic music fan.

Life and career  Robert Cecil was born in Southbourne, a suburb of Bournemouth, Dorset in southern England on 25 March 1913. He married Kathleen Marindin in 1938, and they had one son and two daughters. During his career in the diplomatic service, from 1945 to 1967, Cecil served in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; as First Secretary in Washington, D.C.; as a Counsellor and Consul General in Europe, as Director- General of British Information Services, and latterly as Head of the Cultural Relations Department at the Foreign Office. He had been made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1959 Birthday Honours. According to Cecil's obituary in The Independent, from childhood he had a close personal relationship with Donald Maclean, and the two both studied at Cambridge and worked together in the Foreign Office. Maclean was a member of the Cambridge Five, who acted as spies for the Soviet Union. There was some speculation that this relationship \\"cost [Cecil] the promotion to the highest echelons of the diplomatic service which his talents merited.\\" Cecil would later write a biography of Maclean. Cecil went on to become a reader in Contemporary German History from 1968–78, and chairman of the Graduate School of Contemporary European Studies from 1976–78, at the University of Reading. From 1968–94 he was chairman of the London-based Institute for Cultural Research (ICR), founded by the writer, thinker and teacher in the Sufi mystical tradition, Idries Shah (for whom Cecil wrote an obituary). Cecil wrote three monographs for the institute, and also published several books, including The King's Son, co-compiled for Shah's publishing house, Octagon Press. As well as his interest in Sufism, Cecil had a prior interest in the esoteric work of the Russian mystic, P. D. Ouspensky.

During World War II, Fortis fought as part of the Greek resistance against the occupying Axis powers. She later resettled in Israel.  Biography  Sara Fortis was born Sarika Yehoshua in 1927 in Chalkis. She was raised by her mother after her father died early in her life. The family identified themselves as Greek, but practiced aspects of their Jewish faith. Sara was the niece of Mordechai Frizis, a high ranking Jewish officer in the Greek army who would later be killed in Greco-Italian War. When the German and Italian armies invaded and overran Greece in the spring of 1941, Sarika and her mother disguised their faith and blended into the civilian population; however, in 1943 they fled their home and took refuge in the mountain countryside of Euboea. There, Sara became involved in the local Greek resistance movement against the German occupation forces. She focused her efforts on recruiting other women to fight against the Germans; this paid off, and she was able to form a fighting force that specialized in using diversionary tactics to draw German soldiers away from areas that other resistance fighters planned to attack. Despite the success of these actions, Sara and her band were not always credited with their victories, as it was unfathomable that women could accomplish such acts. By the age of 18, Sara was well-known enough to be referred to as \\"Captain Sarika\\". She continued to fight against the Germans until the liberation of Greece in late 1944. After the withdraw of the German army, Greece descended into a state of civil war as left and right wing factions inside the country battled for control. Sara's rebel group was in opposition to the right-wing Greek government, resulting in her eventual arrest. However, she was released and resettled in Israel. In 1991 her home in Israel was destroyed by an Iraqi SCUD missile during the Persian Gulf War.

It is set in 10th-century England and continues to follow the fortunes of the fictional Uhtred of Bebbanburg. In this novel Uhtred sets out to finally regain his childhood home, Bebbanburg, which is now held by his cousin.  Plot summary  Uhtred fails again to capture Bebbanburg. His son-in-law, the pagan warlord Sigtryggr, king of Jorvik and in turn Northumbria, asks for help against invading West Saxons who seem intent on breaking the truce recently drawn up with the ruler of Mercia, Aethelflaed, King Edward of Wessex’s sister. Uhtred’s men are outnumbered by invading Scots led by Constantin intent on making Bebbanburg their own. However, Uhtred's cousin is willing to wait out the siege behind the nearly impregnable walls of the fortress. Uhtred figures out that Aethelhelm – a wealthy and powerful Saxon warlord and King Edward’s father in-law – is planning to attack Edward’s men and make it look like Sigtryggr did it and so start the war that has been at least delayed a few years by the truce, if not fully averted. It seems inevitable that Edward will want to drive all Danes from the north of the country and bring about the Christian Saxon kingdom his father Alfred dreamed of. Aethelhelm wants to ensure that his grandson Aelfweard – Edward's second son – eventually becomes ruler of a united England. So he planned for Aethelstan (Edward’s first son by his first wife) to be leading Edward's men and to be killed in the ambush. However, Edward sends his trusted warrior Brunulf to lead his men instead. Uhtred sees through Aethelhelm’s machinations and rescues Brunulf and his men from the fake Danish attack. He interrupts a meeting between Edward, Aethelflaed and Sigtryggr where Aethelhelm’s clergy are war-mongering and reveals the truth of Aethelhelm’s plot. Edward has the prisoners Uhtred brought to show him executed. Queen Aethelflaed reveals that she is dying and can no longer protect Aethelstan. So Uhtred claims Aethelstan as his hostage in order to protect him and reconfirms the details of the treaty. Sigtryggr, his commitment to the truce proven, returns to Jorvik. Uhtred then turns his attention back to Bebbanburg, which is besieged by the Scots. He pretends he has given up and moves all his men, women, children, goods, horses and cattle out of Dunholm and spreads rumours that he is sailing across the sea to Frisia. Instead he intends to use a ruse to get into the besieged fortress at Bebbanburg. While he is making preparations in Grimesbi, he realises that the ships coming in to the port and stocking up with goods are a supply fleet commanded by Aethelhelm. He despairs of ever winning back Bebbanburg because Aethelhelm’s ships and men will get to the fortress before he does and provide both food and hundreds of Saxon warriors. His prayer for a miracle is answered: Northmen allied with the Scots burn most of Aethelhelm’s ships and in the chaos, Uhtred escapes Grimesbi undetected. He disguises his ships as Aethelhelm’s supply ships and chased by Aethelhelm’s remaining warships gets to Bebbanburg and fools the guards into opening one of the fortress gates. Unbeknown to Uhtred, his son has helped AEthelstan stow away, and the prince quickly kills Aethelhelm’s champion. After much fighting, Uhtred finally defeats both Aethelhelm and his cousin, killing the latter when he refuses to fight him one-on-one, and takes back his beloved Bebbanburg. Aethelstan persuades Uhtred not to kill Aethelhelm, but to ransom him so he can replenish his coffers and weaken AEthelhelm. Aethelstan also suggests Uhtred keep Aethelhelm’s daughter – who was supposed to be wed to Uhtred’s cousin as part of the resupply deal – as a hostage and this is much to Uhtred's son's liking as he has taken a shine to her. Uhtred then tells the Scots to leave his land, which they do.

Pre-wedding speculation  In a pre-wedding interview, Eugenie had said: \\"I'm not telling anyone who is making it, but I can say it is a British-based designer ... As soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer, and the look, straight away\\". British-based designer Erdem was the bookmakers' favourite to design Eugenie's wedding dress. Suzannah and Stella McCartney were also among the bookmakers' favourite choices.  Designers and dress details  Peter Pilotto, a British-based label, was founded in 2007 by Peter Pilotto and Christopher de Vos. Known for their \\"innovative textile design, paired with a modern feminine silhouette\\", the label has provided Eugenie with several outfits during the past years. Pilotto and de Vos searched through archives and viewed previous bridal gowns and eventually identified a silhouette. The wedding gown was then made layer by layer after several fittings, \\"with the corset and complex underskirt before moving on to the fitted bodice and full pleated skirt\\". It features a wide-neck V shape, folded shoulders and a low back \\"that drapes into a flowing full-length train\\". Eugenie personally asked the designers to make an open-back dress as she wanted her scar from the scoliosis operation that she underwent at the age of 12 to be revealed. In an interview before the wedding she had spoken about the importance of \\"showing people your scars\\". The fabric for the dress was created at the designers's studios and featured different symbols in form of \\"rope-like motifs, woven into a jacquard of silk, cotton and viscose blend\\". These were a Scottish thistle, to show \\"the couple's fondness for Balmoral\\", an Irish shamrock, \\"a nod to the bride's [maternal] family\\", a York Rose, a reference to her family name of York, and ivy, which represented the Ivy Cottage, the couple's residence at Kensington Palace.

According to the club's website, the group states that it is \\"the militant arm\\" of the Aryan Nations.  Formation  After serving a seven-year prison sentence for federal weapons charges, ex-Ku Klux Klan member Dennis Michael McGiffen started the Sadistic Souls Motorcycle Club in 2010 with the intention of having the group act as the militant arm of the Aryan Nations. McGiffen has been the leader of SSMC since its founding. The club's colors are black & silver. In July 2012, the Sadistic Souls MC formally merged with the neo-Nazi group Aryan Nations.

The motorcycle club has chapters in Illinois, Oklahoma, Missouri, Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Ohio, Tennessee, Australia, United Kingdom and New Zealand.

On its official website, the club claims that forced integration is \\"deliberate and malicious genocide, particularly for a people like the white race, who are now a small minority in the world.\\" Their club's motto, \\"The Black & Silver Solution\\"', is the phrase given to represent a coalition of several racist organizations. More specifically, it refers to the group's alliance with the United Klans of America and The Creativity Movement.

Cheplapharm is among the most notable small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in the federal state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, and part of Braun Beteiligungs GmbH, a family owned business conglomerate that is among that state's 25 biggest employers. Subsidiaries of the company are located in Hamburg, Levallois-Perret (France) and Englewood, New Jersey. Cheplapharm acts as a divestment partner for various large pharmaceutical companies. Since its foundation in 1998, Cheplapharm has acquired exclusive rights for more than 80 drugs and other pharmaceutical products that their developers intended to divest for economic or strategic reasons, generating yearly double-digit growth rates with this international “buy and build“ strategy. As of 2018, the company holds more than 400 pharmaceutical product registrations in over 120 countries worldwide. History The company was founded 1998 in Freiburg by Kurt Teubner, who had been working as a manager for Ciba Geigy (now Novartis). The name Cheplapharm derives from the plant based diuretic Cheplaren, one of the first products Teubner acquired. In 2003, Cheplapharm was bought by the Braun family. The new proprietors moved operations to Mesekenhagen, where Norbert and Dagmar Braun owned another pharmaceutical company, Riemser AG, a spin-off of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute. Their son Sebastian F. Braun assumed the CEO position at Cheplapharm. Over the years, Cheplapharm has acquired the rights to more than 80 branded pharmaceuticals and medical products from multinational and German pharmaceutical companies. Among them are large corporations like Merck, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Boehringer Ingelheim and Johnson & Johnson as well as midsize businesses like Grünenthal, Klosterfrau or Riemser. Key acquisitions were those of Heminevrin/Distraneurin (a sedative used to treat acute alcohol withdrawal, from AstraZeneca, in 2010, Rohypnol (a hypnotic) and Vesanoid (a leukemia medication, both from F. Hoffmann-La Roche, in 2012), Deursil/Ursolvan (an anti-gallstone medication, from Sanofi in 2014), Dilatrend (a beta blocker), Xenical (an anti-obesity medication) and Anexate (a benzodiazepine antagonist, all three from F. Hoffmann-La Roche in 2016), Konakion and Cymevene (a vitamin K supplement and a virostatic, from F. Hoffmann-La Roche in 2018), Visudyne (a photosensitizer used for photodynamic therapy of the wet form of macular degeneration, from Novartis in 2018) and Sotacor/Sotalex (an antiarrhythmic, from Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2018). In 2017, Cheplapharm signed a distributorship agreement with an Orexigen Therapeutics subsidiary to market Mysimba, a combination drug for weight loss, in Germany, France and Austria. Cheplapharm also markets several over-the- counter remedies of local renown or niche appeal in Germany. Among them are Reisegold (an antiemetic with Dimenhydrinate, marketed specifically for motion sickness), the valerian extract-based sedative Baldrian Dispert, and a number of herbal tinctures from the 'Thüringer' brand formerly owned by Klosterfrau. Cheplapharm has expanded its operations by taking over the pharma companies Walter Ritter GmbH & Co., Hamburg (2008), Sanavita Pharmaceuticals, Werne (2012) and Glenwood LCC, New Jersey (2014). The latter company's main product is Potaba, an urological drug. The french subsidiary Cheplapharm France SAS, located in Levallois-Perret, was established in 2016. In 2017, Cheplapharm founded a joint venture with the German medical technology company Clearum. The venture, by the name of Med-Tec Holding GmbH, is meant to focus on manufacture of medical technology products, research and development. Construction of a new production facility near Rostock has been announced to start in July 2018. Products Cheplapharm owns global or local marketing and distribution rights for a number of prescription drugs that are used in cardiology (Dilatrend, Aldactone, Inhibace, Sotalex/Sotacor, Pertenso, Dopegyt, Natrilix, Vascal), haematooncology (Vesanoid), urology (Potaba), gastroenterology and bariatrics (Deursil/Ursolvan, Cotazym, Xenical, Mysimba), emergency medicine (Anexate), addiction medicine (Heminevrin/Distraneurin), sleep medicine (Rohypnol, Aponal), infection control (Cymevene, Lariam) and ophthalmology (Visudyne). The company also markets over-the-counter drugs for common heath issues (e.g. antiemetics, antacids, antidiarrhoeals, cardiovascular remedies, pain killers, sedatives) and medical products, among them dietary supplements, hot-cold-packs, cold sprays and dermatological care products.

The genus Dicranoloma has 40 species, which share the features of long stems, wispy and twisted leaves, and large, erect capsules. The genus is dominant in wet forest habitats in Australia and New Zealand. Etymology ‘Dicran’, for the similarity to the Northern hemisphere genus Dicranum. The suffix ‘-loma’ means border, and refers to a layer of elongate cells along the leaf margins of Dicranoloma, which distinguishes this genus from Dicranum mosses. The word ‘dicarpum’ was coined by German botanist Nees von Esenbeck, and refers to the multiple sporophytes produced from one perichaetium. Description Dicranoloma dicarpum plants are dull to bright green in colour, growing to form cushions or tufts. Stems are often branched, and range from 0.5-7.5 cm tall. The leaves are 3.0-12.4 mm long and 0.5-0.16 mm wide. They are falcate (curved into a sickle shape), spirally twisted, and taper to a pointed tip. There is strong serration along the margins of the leaf tip, although a hand lens is usually required to see this. The leaves are also strongly plicate (folded along an axis) on either side of a central nerve (midrib) running length-wise through the leaf. The deepness of this pleating helps differentiate D. dicarpum from other Dicranoloma species. Another distinguishing feature is aggregated sporophytes, with 1-10 capsules produced from a single perichaetium (see Figure 2). Setae are light brown and project 0.5-1.0 cm above the perichaetium. Perichaetial leaves are strongly tapered, and grow to about a quarter of the length of the seta. Capsules are cylindrical, smooth and narrow, and grow 3–3.5 mm in length. At a cellular level, D. dicarpum can be identified by a region of short, square cells beside the nerve in the mid-region of the leaf, with cells becoming longer closer to the leaf margins. Ecology and distribution D. dicarpum lives in wet forest between sea level and 1550 metres. It grows on a variety of substrates including logs, rocks, tree bases and stumps, leaf litter or soil. It is found in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, China, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, New Guinea, Taiwan, and Vanuatu. There is considerable variation in the plant's morphology across its geographical range. For example, specimens from southern Australia (Tasmania and Victoria) and New Zealand typically have more setae per perichaetium and longer leaves compared to specimens from northern Australia (New South Wales and Queensland) or other warmer regions.

Life Theodorus was named after his maternal grandfather. His mother served in the priestly role of kanephoros ('basket-bearer') of the deified Arsinoe II in Alexandria in 177/6 BC.British Museum EA 10518. PP III/IX 5038. He was born before 143 BC, since he dedicated a statue of the officers of the Ptolemaic garrison on Cyprus in that year.Mitford (1961), p. 26, no. 69. From 142 to 131 BC, Theodorus commanded the garrison at Salamis.R. Bagnall, The Administration of the Ptolemaic Possessions Outside Egypt (1976), 59. His father served as governor of the island at that time and was followed in that role by Crocus (131–124 BC). After the end of the Ptolemaic civil war in 124 BC, Theodorus was appointed governor (strategos) of Cyprus and admiral (nauarchos). He is named in these roles repeatedly in the dedicatory inscriptions of many statues set up on Cyprus between 124 and 118 BC by Cypriot dignitaries and Ptolemaic military officials.Mitford (1961), p. 29–30, No. 78. A statue, dedicated by the city of Salamis. The dedicatory inscription is in the Epigraphic Museum in Athens (KM 52).Mitford (1961), pp. 30–31, No. 79 and 81.

A statue, dedicated by the koinon of the Ionians.Mitford (1961), p. 32, no. 85 and 86. Two statues dedicated by Helenus of Cyrene, a member of the royal court who later served as governor himself. In the first inscription, Theodorus is referred to with the expansive title of strategos autokrator, which suggests the extraordinary military responsibilities of the role, which he received from his predecessor Crocus, as a result of the civil war between Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra II. In all other inscriptions, the qualification autokrator is absent, since this military power was withdrawn from the role by Ptolemy VIII after the end of the civil war. In older scholarship, it was claimed that Theodorus died in 118 BC, but then his name was found in a papyrus document dated to 105/4 BC,P. Koeln. 2, 81. in which he is named as priest of the \\"beneficent and mother-loving goddess\\" (Cleopatra III) for life and as leader of the council of Alexandria (exegetes). In this priestly role he was succeeded by Helenus of Cyrene, who was also his successor as governor of Cyprus. Family Theodorus was married to his niece Olympias and had a son and three daughters with her, all of whom held priesthoods:Miltford (1961), pp. 30–31, no. 80 and 82.

Luban developed on October 6 in the central Arabian Sea, and for much of its duration, maintained a general west- northwestward trajectory. On October 10, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) upgraded Luban to a very severe cyclonic storm - equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane - and estimated maximum sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). The storm made landfall on October 14 in eastern Yemen, as a cyclonic storm. The storm quickly weakened over the dry, mountainous terrain of the Arabian Peninsula, before dissipating on October 15\\\\. Upon moving ashore, Cyclone Luban produced flooding rains in Somalia, Oman, and Yemen. The cyclone killed 14 people in Yemen, when heavy rainfall cut off villages and damaged roads. Damage in the country was estimated at US$1 billion. In Oman, desert rainfall caused a small locust outbreak. Luban coexisted with Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Titli in the Bay of Bengal, marking the first time since 1971 that two storms of such intensity were active at the same time in the North Indian Ocean. Meteorological history On October 4, an upper-level low persisted over the southeast Arabian Sea. That day, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) first mentioned an area of scattered convection southwest of India as an area for potential tropical cyclogenesis, due to projections from tropical cyclone forecast models. The convective system was located in the warm waters of the Arabian Sea in an area of low wind shear. The circulation slowly became more defined, developing a low pressure area on October 5\\\\. On October 6, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as Depression ARB 04. A day later, the agency upgraded the system to a deep depression, and on October 8, the IMD upgraded it further to Cyclonic Storm Luban. On the same day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Luban, giving it the designation Tropical Cyclone 05A. By that time the JTWC initiated advisories, Luban had rotating rainbands around a persistent central area of thunderstorms, with good outflow to the north. The circulation became better defined over time, steered generally west-northwestward by a subtropical ridge to its north. On October 9, the IMD upgraded Luban to a severe cyclonic storm, as the thunderstorms continued to bloom over the circulation. A day later, the IMD upgraded Luban further to a very severe cyclonic storm, with maximum sustained winds of at least 120 km/h (75 mph), equivalent to a hurricane. Luban coexisted with Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Titli, marking the first time since 1977 that two storms of such intensity were active at the same time in the North Indian Ocean. The JTWC also upgraded Luban to the same intensity on October 10, noting the development of an eye feature. Both the IMD and the JTWC estimated that Luban attained a peak winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). They also forecasted that the storm would continue its general trajectory and strike the Arabian Peninsula. Caught between two ridges, Luban moved slowly toward the Arabian Peninsula. The slow movement caused upwelling, which cooled the waters, thus weakening the cyclone despite otherwise favorable conditions. The central core of convection diminished and became restricted to the eastern side of the circulation. On October 13, thunderstorm activity increased over the center, signaling some re- intensification. Luban again weakened as it approached land, affected by the cooler water and air temperatures. On October 14, around 06:00 UTC, Luban made landfall in eastern Yemen, about 30 km (20 mi) south of Al Ghaydah, with winds of 75 km/h (45 mph). The storm rapidly weakened over the dry and mountainous terrain, degenerating into a well-marked low on October 15. Preparations, impact, and aftermath The IMD advised fishermen not to go into deep waters of the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Omani officials closed schools and recommended that residents in the storm's path to avoid low-lying areas. As Luban made landfall, the storm dropped heavy rainfall in southern Oman that caused flash flooding. Dalkout reported a 24 hour precipitation total of and Salalah of . The rains created temporary lakes between desert dunes, which produced a small locust outbreak. To the south of the center, the outer rainbands of Luban dropped rains in Puntland, Somalia. Cyclone Luban struck Yemen in the midst of a civil war and a cholera outbreak. The United Nations Population Fund moved 1,250 rapid response kits to coastal areas of Yemen in anticipation of Luban's landfall. Medical teams also moved to the region on standby in preparation for storm victims. Luban dropped heavy rainfall upon moving ashore, reaching in Al Ghaydah; there, wind gusts reached 102 km/h (63 mph). Luban caused about US$1 billion in damage in Yemen, with the worst effects in Al Mahrah Governorate, where about 90% of the infrastructure was damaged. The storm killed 14 people in the country, and 124 people were injured, with 10 people missing. About 8,000 people were left homeless because of Luban. Storm damage forced 2,203 families to leave their houses, using 38 schools for shelter. Flooding washed away thousands of livestock, and damaged Yemen's coastal roads and bridges, which disrupted relief efforts. Dirt roads were washed away, isolating seven villages and about 3,000 people. The port of Nishtun was closed during the storm, but was reopened in the subsequent weeks. In Al-Masilah, flooding damaged or destroyed 62 houses. The storm damaged the hospital in Qishn District, forcing all workers to evacuate, and shutting down the facility for at least a week. The storm damaged about 90% of the power grid in Al Ghaydah. Many areas lost access to clean water after wells were destroyed. The Yemeni Red Crescent operated search and rescue missions, with help from a helicopter sent by Saudi Arabia. In the storm's aftermath, various governments and non-governmental organizations provided emergency supplies to residents affected by Luban. The King Salman Relief Centre sent two trucks from Aden to the worst affected areas to distribute tents, blankets, and mattresses. The Oman Charitable Organization sent seven trucks with food and other supplies to eastern Yemen. The World Health Organization sent three tons of medical supplies, including kits for cholera, malaria, and general trauma. About 10 days after the storm struck, the Emirates Red Crescent reconnected seven villages after clearing debris and restoring the dirt roads. Al Mahrah Governorate allocated ﷼2 billion (US$2.55 million) for repairing public facilities.

It was the site of the Day of Mourning protests by Aboriginal Australians on 26 January 1938. It was also known as the Cyprus Hellene Club. The property is owned by the Indigenous Land Corporation, a statutory corporation of the Australian Government. It was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 20 May 2008 and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History   History of the Day of Mourning  Since European settlement, Indigenous Australians have been treated differently to the general Australian population; denied the basic concession of equality with whites and rarely given full protection before the law.Bennett, 1989:3 Indigenous people have long resisted and protested against European settlement of their country.Foley, 2001. Early protests were initiated by residents of missions and reserves as a result of local issues and took the form of letters, petitions and appeals.Attwood, et al, 1999. One of the earliest examples of this form of protest was during the mid 1840s at the Aboriginal reserve called Wybalenna on Flinders Island. Residents of Wybalenna sent letters and petitions to Queen Victoria and the Colonial Secretary and other Government officials, protesting against the living conditions and administration of Wybalenna. Similarly in the mid 1870s residents of Coranderrk in Victoria began a decade long protest against the management and closure of the reserve using letters to the editors of daily newspapers and government ministers as well as seeking support from humanitarian organisations. This pattern of protests focusing on local concerns continued during the 1880s and 1890s with residents of Cummeragunja in New South Wales and Poonindie in South Australia also using letters and petitions to lobby for the allocation of parcels of land within the reserve to families so that they would be responsible for farming their allocated parcel. William Cooper A new dynamic began in the late 1920s with the creation of regional and state based Aboriginal controlled organisations. The first of these was the short lived Australian Aboriginal Progressive Association (AAPA), founded on the mid north coast of New South Wales (NSW) by Fred Maynard. Subsequent state based organisations were formed in NSW with the Aborigines Progressive Association (APA) and in Victoria with the Aboriginal Advancement League (AAL). Key founders of these organisations included William Cooper, Doug Nicholls, Margaret Tucker, William Ferguson, Jack Patten and Pearl Gibbs. The key members of both these organisations shared common life experiences; they grew up on missions or reserves controlled by protection boards but were either expelled on disciplinary grounds or left to find work.Attwood, 2003. The majority of these people had at one time resided at Cummeragunja and/or Warrangesda missions in NSW and a number also had lived at Salt Pan Creek, an Aboriginal squatter's camp south-west of Sydney. This camp housed refugee families, the dispossessed and people seeking to escape the harsh and brutal policies of the Aborigines Protection Board.Reason in Revolt Project, 2007. It became a focal point for intensifying Aboriginal resistance in NSW. While living off an Aboriginal reserve provided some level of freedom, these Aboriginal people experienced the full force of laws that impacted on the ability of Indigenous people to find employment, receive equal wages, seek unemployment relief and the ability to purchase or own property. The experience of living under the control of a protection board on a mission or reserve, and the barriers they faced off these reserves, united the members of these early Aboriginal organisations in their concerns for the lack of civil rights, the growth in the Aboriginal Protection Board's powers and the condition of people remaining in missions and reserves. It was in this environment that in November 1937 William Cooper called a meeting of the AAL in Melbourne which William Ferguson from the APA also attended.Jumbunna Centre for Australian, Indigenous Studies, Education and Research, 1994. During this meeting the two groups agreed to hold a protest conference in Sydney to coincide with sesquicentenary celebrations planned for Australia Day 26 January 1938. They decided to call this protest the Day of Mourning.Horton, 1994. Poster promoting the Day of Mourning, 1938 The AAL and APA widely promoted the Day of Mourning through radio interviews and other media. To encourage Aboriginal people to attend, Jack Patten and William Ferguson took turns in touring the reserves to promote it. Jack Patten and William Ferguson also published a 12-page pamphlet entitled \\"Aborigines Claim Citizen Rights\\" to promote the purpose of the Day of Mourning amongst non-Indigenous people. This \\"manifesto\\" has been described as perhaps the most bitter of Aboriginal protests.Rowley, 1972:79. It explained the significance of the action: > \\"The 26th January, 1938, is not a day of rejoicing for Australia's > Aborigines; it is a day of mourning. This festival of 150 years' so-called > 'progress' in Australia commemorates also 150 years of misery and > degradation imposed upon the original native inhabitants by the white > invaders of this country. We, representing the Aborigines, now ask you, the > reader of this appeal, to pause in the midst of your sesqui-centenary > rejoicings and ask yourself honestly whether your \\"conscience\\" is clear in > regard to the treatment of the Australian blacks by the Australian whites > during the period of 150 years' history which you celebrate?\\"Patten, et al, > 1938. The pamphlet asked the reader to acknowledge the impact of the \\"protection\\" approach, the restrictions that it continued to place on Aboriginal people's rights, and to be proud of the Australian Aborigines and not misled by the superstition that they are a naturally backward and low race. It also made explicit that the choice of holding the Day of Mourning on Australia Day, the national holiday celebrating the arrival of the First Fleet and the birth of Australia as a nation, was to highlight the exclusion of Aboriginal people from the Australian nation: > \\"We ask you white Australians for justice, fair play and decency, and we > speak for 80,000 human beings in your midst. We ask--and we have every right > to demand--that you should include us, fully and equally with yourselves, in > the body of the Australian nation\\". The organisers distributed approximately 2,000 leaflets and posters advertising the Day of Mourning which advised that \\"Aborigines and persons of Aboriginal blood only are invited to attend\\". The organisers were denied permission to hold the Day of Mourning in Sydney Town Hall, but were able to rent the Australia Hall at 150-152 Elizabeth Street. The use of Australia Hall was granted on condition that the delegates watched the sesquicentennial parade from the Town Hall steps and then marched behind the parade to the Australian Hall.NSW Heritage Office, 2000:9. A blackboard displayed outside the hall proclaims, \\"Day of Mourning\\" The official Australia Day celebrations included a re-enactment of the arrival of Governor Phillip by boat at Port Jackson \\"who will put the Aborigines to flight\\".Horner, 1980. The Government had brought in Aboriginal people from the Menindee reserve to participate in the re-enactment of the arrival of Governor Phillip at Port Jackson as this was a safer option then using Aboriginal people from the Sydney area.Parbury, 1986:107. These people were housed at the Redfern Police Barracks and were not allowed any contact with \\"disruptive influences\\" before the re- enactment.Dodson, 2000. While delegates did not watch the re-enactment, they were required to watch a pageant at the Sydney Town Hall. After watching this pageant, delegates for the Day of Mourning walked to Australia Hall. Two police officers guarded the front door of the building. The Day of Mourning was held at a time when there were restrictions on Aboriginal people's rights of movement and assembly and the delegates from reserves risked imprisonment, expulsion from their homes and loss of their jobs for participating in an event such as this.Burgess, 2002:20. As a result, some entered through the back door of the building to avoid identification and reprisals. The Aboriginal meeting in Australian Hall Over 100 people attended the Day of Mourning from throughout NSW, Victoria and Queensland. Telegrams of support for this action also came from Western Australia, Queensland and north Australia, which the organisers believed gave the gathering the status and strength of a national action. After a number of statements by participants, they unanimously endorsed a resolution demanding full citizen rights: > \\"WE, representing THE ABORIGINES OF AUSTRALIA, assembled in conference at > the Australian Hall, Sydney, on the 26th day of January 1938, this being the > 150th Anniversary of the Whiteman's seizure of our country, HEREBY MAKE > PROTEST against the callous treatment of our people by the whitemen during > the past 150 years, AND WE APPEAL to the Australian nation of today to make > new laws for the education and care of Aborigines, and we ask for a new > policy which will raise our people to FULL CITIZEN STATUS and EQUALITY > WITHIN THE COMMUNITY\\". On 31 January 1938, a delegation presented this resolution, and a ten-point policy statement developed at the Day of Mourning, to the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Interior. Participants described the ten-point policy statement as the only policy which has the support of the Aborigines themselves. It included a long range policy with recommendations for: Australian Government control of all Aboriginal affairs; the development of a national policy for Aborigines; the appointment of a Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whose aim would be to raise all Aborigines throughout Australian to full citizen status and civil equality with the whites in Australia. The latter included entitlement to: the same educational opportunities; the benefits of labor legislation, including Arbitration Court Awards, workers' compensation and insurance; receiving wages in cash, and not by orders, issue of rations, or apprenticeship systems; old-age and invalid pensions; to own land and property, and to be allowed to save money in personal banking accounts. The long range policy also identified the need for Aboriginal land settlements including tuition in areas of agriculture and financial assistance to generate self-supporting Aboriginal farmers. While opposing a policy of segregation, it advocated the retention of Aboriginal Reserves as a sanctuary for some Aboriginal people. A full report of the Day of Mourning appeared in the first issue of the monthly Australian Abo Call, the first newspaper published by Aboriginal people to voice their views.Goodall, 1996:243. It stated: > \\"The Day of Mourning protest conference on 26 January 1938 at the Australia > Hall marks the first occasion in Australian history that Aboriginal people > from different states joined together to campaign for equality and full > citizenship rights. Initiated and organised by key figures in two of the > early Aboriginal political protest organisations, the Australian Aborigines > League and the Aborigines Progressive Association, delegates joined to > discuss civil rights and debate a ten-point list of demands aimed at > redressing the political and legal disadvantages of Aboriginal people\\". Although it brought about little change in the years immediately following 1938, the Day of Mourning produced a comprehensive collection of key policies that identified impacts on the lives of Aboriginal people at the time and recommendations for how they should be addressed. One of the issues highlighted in these policies, namely Australian Government control of all Aboriginal affairs, formed the basis for the constitutional amendments endorsed by the Australian people in the Referendum of the 27 May 1967.Mesnage, 1998. While there has been progress, governments still identify the broad issues raised in these documents as priority areas within Indigenous Affairs (see Ministerial Taskforce on Indigenous Affairs long term vision in Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination 2004; issues identified in Bilateral Agreements between Commonwealth and States/Territories at www.oipc.gov.au/publications/default.asp). A number of contemporary Indigenous leaders also recognise that the key policy issues identified at the Day of Mourning remain relevant to Indigenous people today. In a speech at the Australian Reconciliation Convention, Noel Pearson (1997) noted that after reading the documents associated with the Day of Mourning he \\"was struck either how sophisticated the movement was back then, or how far we have not come\\" because the issues raised in the material from the Day of Mourning remained fresh propositions. In an article published in a number of metropolitan newspapers on Australia Day in 1998, Gatjil Djerrkura noted that while advances have been made in relation to Indigenous affairs since the Day of Mourning, many of the underlying issues remain, including improvements to the health and economic opportunities in communities.Djerrkura, 1998. The call at the Day of Mourning for recognition of \\"full citizen status\\" and \\"equality within the community\\" still recurs in the numerous government reports including those of the Human Rights Commission, the Social Justice Commissioner, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissions and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, as well as the Indigenous statements such as the Yirrkala Bark Petition, the Barunga Statement, the Eva Valley Statement and the Boomanulla Oval Statement. The Day of Mourning not only produced political statements that remain current, it also highlighted the exclusion of Indigenous people from the Australian nation. The ambiguous relationship between Indigenous people and the Australian nation remains an issue for Indigenous people.Pearson, 2007. As a result, Indigenous people have continued to use Australia Day and other foundation anniversaries to draw attention to their exclusion from the national consciousness: in 1970 a second Day of Mourning was held to demonstrate against Sydney's bicentenary celebrations of Captain Cook's \\"discovery\\" of Australia; Australia Day in 1972 saw the establishment of an Aboriginal Tent Embassy on the lawns of the then Parliament House in Canberra (now Old Parliament House) in a call for national land rights, sovereignty and self-determination; and the anti-bicentenary protests on Australia Day in 1988 is still one of the largest Indigenous protest marches in Australia. In the 1930s demanding the same rights as white Australians, when Indigenous people were subject to severe restrictions and punitive sanctions, constituted a radical claim in Australia and challenged the premise of the dominant racial order. The Day of Mourning is therefore regarded as one of the most important moments in the history of the Indigenous resistance in the early 20th century.Foley, 2005.  History of the Australian Hall  The building that houses the Australian Hall was erected in 1910-13 for the Concordia German Club. It was purchased in 1920 by the Knights of the Southern Cross, a Catholic fraternal lay group linked with the Catholic Right, in 1922 the name of the hall in the building was changed from Miss Bishop's Hall to the Australian Hall.  Phillip Theatre, 1961-1974  The next significant change to the site on Elizabeth Street was the Phillip (Street) Theatre. In 1961 the Australian Hall was renovated and the interior of the building remodelled to turn it into a theatre capable of seating 453 with a raised area at the back to give a balcony effect. The Phillip Theatre broke away from traditional Australian theatre and became a significant force in Australian Theatrical History. ;The Cinema, 1974 In the early 1970s the theatre was the only exclusively live theatre remaining in the city but it was hard to find shows suitable for a venue of its size. The site became the Rivoli Cinema in 1974. Changes were made to the auditorium and foyer to make it more of a cinema rather than a live theatre venue. With Haymarket being identified with the Chinese community, the Rivoli was let to Chinese interests who reopened in 1976 as the Mandarin Cinema, showing Chinese language films and in 1989 the Australian Hall became the home of the Mandolin Cinema.  Cyprus-Hellenic Club  The Knights of the Southern Cross sold the building in 1979 to the Hellenic Club and it was then used by Greek Cypriots as the Cyprus Hellene Club. It was a Greek organisation offering cultural and social links for its members. The club was and still is instrumental in promoting and maintaining the Cypriot culture in Australia. The Cyprus club and use of the building have been directly involved with the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia in the support of charitable organisations, particularly those associated with the Greek Welfare Centre. The Cyprus Club owned the property until 1998. Similarly to previous owners, the Cyprus-Hellenic Club used the premises for their cultural and social activities while still sub-letting the old hall, which continued as a cinema with various owners and names until 1988. Over the years, the building accommodated a restaurant, dining and community facilities and the interior of the building was altered on a number of occasions. Site (as the then Hellenic Club) of the first national conference of the Australian Labor Party, called the \\"Inter-Colonial Conference of Labour\\" held in January 1900, which formally established a federal party and platform, and adopted the \\"maintenance of a White Australia\\" and the \\"total exclusion of coloured and other undesirable races\\" as the first plank in the new federal party's \\"fighting platform\\" and its \\"general platform\\". Site in 1965 of the 26th national conference of the Australian Labor Party when it abolished the White Australia policy from its platform.Ramsey, 2004 In the early 1990s the owner of the Cyprus Hellene Club planned to demolish most of the building and erect a 34-storey residential development. This proposal started a campaign by Indigenous people and the National Aboriginal History and Heritage Council to protect the building and gain recognition of the significance of the building to Indigenous people for its association with the Day of Mourning.  Indigenous community ownership  After several years of inquiries and objections, the NSW Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning made a Permanent Conservation Order over parts of the building. In 1998 the Indigenous Land Corporation, a Commonwealth statutory authority, purchased the building on behalf of the Metropolitan Aboriginal Association Inc, who now manages the building.  Description  The Cyprus Hellene Club - Australian Hall is located at 150-152 Elizabeth Street, Sydney. The Cyprus Hellene Club, the building which houses Australia Hall, is a three-storey masonry building in the Federation Romanesque style with the use of rusticated stone dressings. The building originally formed part of a Federation period streetscape group known as the Elizabeth Street Precinct.Commissioners of Inquiry for Environment and Planning, 1995. The entire building, although internally altered over the years, remains substantially intact. The symmetrical facade to Elizabeth Street has bold modelling and textures, due to its semi-circular arches, segmental oriel windows and rock faced stonework. The former Australia Hall occupies the rear of the first floor; its interior and that of the entrance lobby and foyer both retain original Classical decorative elements possibly dating from the 1920s.Foy, 1935. The front entrance and back door survive intact. ;Exterior The building was constructed on the full site area, has three storeys above ground and a basement and has facades to Elizabeth Street and Nithsdale Street. The Elizabeth Street facade has a suspended steel awning above which fabric is intact. The facade has the characteristics of Federation Free Style as identified by Apperley, Irving and Reynolds. In consistency with the style it features two contrasting materials, face brick and rusticated sandstone. The sandstone has all been painted and the brick left unpainted. There are three entrances. The cinema entrance has marble steps and timber floors which are glazed. The club entrance has terrazzo steps with aluminium edge strip. The club doors are of solid timber. The fire exit, constructed during the 1980s has white terrazzo steps and standard fire door. The Nithsdale Street facade walling is rendered and painted. The two windows at the second floor have segmental arched face brick heads. Two windows behind the Mandolin cinema screen and part of the opening which was probably a fire exit or receiving dock have been bricked up. The roof is corrugated asbestos above the western part of the building and corrugated iron above the hall. ;Interior The basement extends for half the depth of the building and the ground along the northern and southern site boundaries is un-excavated at basement level. The ground and first floors extend the full depth of the site with the former Australian Hall occupying the rear half of the first floor. Main access to the hall if from Elizabeth Street. The second floor extends for half the depth of the site. Two isolated stairs and one lift provide access to all levels of the building. The lift dates from the 1960s alteration. The stair has terrazzo steps. The other fire stair, located in the former light-well, was constructed in the mid-1980s and has tiled steps. ;Basement The basement comprises store rooms, cool rooms and toilets. Cool rooms and store rooms have cement floors and cement rendered walls. Although the spatial arrangement and much of the visible fabric date from later alterations, some wall sections appear to be original. ;Ground Floor The main entry to the former Cyprus-Hellenic Club opens into a foyer and reception office. The major part of the ground floor is occupied by a large bar/club with games area and a restaurant/auditorium with a small stage and dance floor. Also located on this floor is a kitchen, cool room, toilets, storeroom and an exit passage to Nithsdale Street. The club premises were completely refitted in the mid-1980s and most of the finishes date from this latest alteration. Original elements include the plastered and painted side walls, recessed alcoves and original ceiling panels. The main spaces on the ground floor have carpeted floors while the cinema entrance foyer features black and white lino tile flooring, papered wall and decorative plastered ceiling with cornice and brackets. ;First Floor The front part of the first floor comprises the board room, snooker room, bar area, a small kitchen and toilets. Original elements surviving timber floor structure, the arched and square timber windows to Elizabeth Street and joinery such as frames, shashes, architraves and surviving skirtings. The rear part of the first floor is occupied by the Mandolin Cinema, the former Australian Hall. The cinema is accessible by a narrow foyer which is adjacent to the northern wall of the building. The first floor cinema foyer and amenities retained much of their original features such as the original floor structure, marble stair and billboard frames. The ceiling, cornice frieze and ceiling roses appear to be original too. The former dance hall, which was adapted to the use as a theatre in 1961 and to the cinema use in 1974, retains much of its original fabric. These are the wall fabric to external walls, the surviving original wall detailing such as blind arches and remaining wall decoration, hidden behind false walling and the suspended ceiling. Other original elements include the timber floor structure, windows in the rear wall, mouldings, skirtings and architraves. However, nothing remains of the original stage. ;Second Floor The second floor is occupied by a large function room, toilets at the rear, a kitchen and an unused board room along the northern boundary wall. Surviving original fabric includes timber floor structure, original wall surfaces along the southern and northern walls, timber windows, window joinery, architraves and skirtings. The acoustic tiled suspended ceiling above the board room is ruined. Similarly to the first floor, the finishes and fit out of the toilets dates from an earlier (1970s) alteration.  Condition  The building is in a good condition. Modifications to the interior of the building have not affected its heritage significance in connection to the Day of Mourning. The front of the ground floor has undergone modernisation and has a suspended awning.  Heritage listing  Australian National Heritage List Since European settlement, Indigenous people have been treated differently to the general Australian population; denied the basic concession of equality and rarely given full protection before the law. While Indigenous groups have long resisted and protested against this inequality, up until the 1920s these protests were generally focused on local issues. Cyprus Hellene Club - Australian Hall was listed on the Australian National Heritage List on 20 May 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Events, Processes Coinciding with the 1938 sesquicentenary celebrations for Australia Day, members of the Aboriginal Advancement League and the Aboriginal Progressive Association held the first national Indigenous protest, the Day of Mourning, to highlight that the \\"150 years\\" so-called \\"progress\\" in Australia commemorates also 150 years of misery and degradation imposed upon the original native inhabitants by the white invaders of this country'. The Day of Mourning identified a significant collection of policy issues impacting on Indigenous people and proposed recommendations for addressing these issues through government action. While there has been some progress, generally the political statements and social issues identified from the Day of Mourning are still relevant to Indigenous people today.Pearson, 1997. Australia Hall, as the site of the Day of Mourning, is outstanding in the course of Australia's cultural history as the first national Indigenous protest which identified issues of continuing relevance to Indigenous people. The ambiguous relationship between Indigenous people and the Australian nation remains an issue for Indigenous people. The choice of holding the Day of Mourning on Australia Day, the national holiday celebrating the arrival of the first fleet and the birth of Australia as a nation, highlighted the exclusion of Aboriginal people from the Australian nation. Since the Day of Mourning in 1938, Indigenous people have continued to use Australia Day celebrations to draw attention to their exclusion from the national consciousness as shown by the 1988 bicentenary protest, one of the largest Indigenous protests in Australia. The Australian Hall, as the site of the Day of Mourning, is outstanding in the course of Australia's cultural history for its association with the first national Indigenous protest seeking the inclusion of Indigenous people in the Australian nation. Criterion G: Social value The Day of Mourning played a significant role in the history of Indigenous peoples' struggle for the recognition of their civic rights and is regarded by Indigenous people as one of the most important moments in the history of the Indigenous resistance in the early 20th century.Martin, 1996. The strong social and cultural association Indigenous people have with Australia Hall and the Day of Mourning is demonstrated by the continuous references made by Indigenous leaders from across Australia to this event. It is also shown through the campaign during the 1990s for the recognition of the significance of the building to Indigenous people and the depiction of the Day of Mourning at Reconciliation Place. Indigenous people have a strong association with the Australian Hall, the site of the Day of Mourning, as the first national Indigenous protest which identified social justice issues of continuing relevance to Indigenous people. Criterion H: Significant people Over 100 people Aboriginal people attended the Day of Mourning at the Australian Hall. Indigenous people involved in the inception and organisation included prominent Aboriginal leaders of the time such as William Cooper, William Ferguson, Jack Patten, Pearl Gibbs, Margaret Tucker and Doug Nicholls. Their combined work produced a significant collection of policy issues impacting on Indigenous people and proposed recommendations for addressing these issues through government action. The political statements associated with the Day of Mourning are still relevant to Indigenous people today. Australia Hall has a special association with the work of the organisers of the Day of Mourning, which is outstanding for its continued relevance to Indigenous people. New South Wales State Heritage List The Cyprus-Hellene Club holds State social significance for at least three groups of people. Firstly, the building holds social significance for the Aboriginal People for its role in the 1938 \\"Day of Mourning\\" meeting. This event was the first protest by Aboriginal people for equal opportunities within Australian Society. It was attended by approximately 100 people of Aboriginal Blood and was the beginning of the contemporary Aboriginal Political Movement. Among those who contributed significantly to the movement generally and particularly to the event in the Australian Hall were Mrs Ardler, J Connelly, William Cooper, William Ferguson, Tom Foster, Pearl Gibbs, Helen Grosvenor, Jack Johnson, Jack Kinchela, Bert Marr, Pastor Doug Nicholls, Henry Noble, Jack Patten, Tom Pecham, Frank Roberts and Margaret Tucker. Secondly, it holds significance for the German and Greek-Cypriot communities in Sydney as it allowed visitors and migrants to enjoy cultural and social events. The building also has an association with Australian national and political history in its ownership (1920–79) by the Knights of the Southern Cross, a Catholic fraternal lay group linked with the Catholic Right and, ultimately with the split in the Labor Party in the 1950s. The building was initially built to be used as a meeting place for cultural and social activities and was continuously used for these events including cinema and theatre. It is a rare example of a purpose built building in Sydney continuously used for its initial purpose. The building holds architectural significance as it still contains some examples of original architecture. It is a good example of Federation Romanesque style. The interior also contains examples of certain features that could date from the original construction in the 1920s and also has features from each of the renovations since Cyprus- Hellene Club was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Australian Hall is of State significance as the site of the National \\"Day of Mourning\\" - the first organised Aboriginal Civil Rights protest. They met in 1938 to debate a ten-point list of demands aimed at changing the then current disadvantages to Aboriginal People. The list was presented to Prime Minister Joseph Lyons four days later and formally began the struggle for indigenous rights. A theatre, art-house cinema and club houses operated from the building until 1999 when it was purchased by the Indigenous Land Trust to house a museum of Aboriginal heroes. The site is important in the Aboriginal and Political history of Australia and is significant for its association with the beginning of the continuing struggle for the rights of Aboriginal people. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Cyprus-Hellene Club is of State significance as the site of the 1938 Day of Mourning, which sparked the modern Aboriginal political movement. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Cyprus-Hellenic Club is of State significance for its strong connections with several groups throughout its history. Firstly, the German Concordia Club used the building for cultural and social events allowing their culture to continue outside their homeland and providing German migrants and visitors to Sydney a touch of home. Similarly thus can be said for the Greek-Cypriots who later used the club for its cultural and social events. Secondly, the Aboriginal people of Australia have a strong connection to the building for its use in the first organised Aboriginal Civil Rights protest in 1938. Thirdly, and to a lesser extent, the building has a connection with the Knights of the Southern Cross and even the Asian Community of Sydney. Both these groups found a purpose to use the building. The KSC used the building as a place to find employment for Catholic people and also as a call in centre, while the Asian community of Sydney have links to the cinema for its dedication to showing Asian films. Once again, providing a cultural group with a sense of identity outside their homeland. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building is a rare example of a European building that is of heritage significance to both Aboriginal and European communities, but particularly to Aboriginal people. It is of State significance as a rare example of a venue for club, social, recreational and entertainment purposes which was in continuous use for that purpose since its erection until recently. It is rare for the use by a number of social institutions related to ethnic groups.

It is written in the style of a government report written in the aftermath of the conflict, in 2023, and uses many real-world figures. Plot The conflict begins unintentionally, with a North Korean KN-06 unit in Ongjin, near the Korean Demilitarized Zone shooting down a civilian Air Busan Airbus A320, which was flying off-course and without a transponder due to a brief loss of power in the cockpit, having mistaken it for a U.S. stealth aircraft. South Korean President Moon Jae-in orders a retaliatory attack on North Korea without the approval of the United States, firing six missiles at the Headquarters of the Korean People's Army Air and Anti-Air Force near Pyongyang and a residence of Kim Jong-un. Following the missile attack, North Korea's leadership, lacking communications infrastructure, misinterprets Tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump so as to believe that a decapitation strike is in-progress. North Korea launches nuclear missiles in the hopes of staving off further U.S.-South Korean attacks, with nuclear bombs detonating over Seoul, Busan, Pyeongtaek and Daegu in South Korea and Tokyo and Yokohama in Japan. Missiles launched at Guam and Okinawa fail to reach their targets. Negotiations in New York City fail to resolve the conflict. The United States launches a retaliatory conventional strike on North Korea, but fail to locate the vehicle-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles in North Korea's arsenal. North Korea proceeds to launch 13 nuclear-tipped missiles at the United States. The Ground-Based Interceptors at Fort Greely fail to intercept the incoming ICBMs, which detonate over Honolulu, Hawaii, Jupiter, Florida, Arlington County, Virginia, and Manhattan, New York. President Trump evacuates from Mar-a-Lago aboard Air Force One, narrowly avoiding the nuclear explosion. Kim Jong-un subsequently commits suicide at a bunker in Myohyangsan, and Mike Pence succeeds Trump as President of the United States. Characters American * President Donald Trump - Trump spends most of the events of the novel at Mar-a-Lago, unintentionally sparking the conflict by causing Kim Jong-un to believe that North Korea's leadership is being targeted. * White House Chief of Staff Jack Francis - A retired United States Marine Corps General modeled on John F. Kelly. * National Security Advisor Keith Kellogg - In the novel, Kellogg replaced John R. Bolton as National Security Advisor. * Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis - Mattis functionally removes consideration of the use of nuclear weapons against North Korea, and orchestrates much of the war effort against North Korea. Mattis is depicted as the sole remaining member of Trump's initial inner circle. * United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley - Haley leads failed negotiations with Ma Zhaoxu, the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations, to end China's support for North Korea. North Korean * Kim Jong-un - The leader of North Korea. Kim misinterprets the South Korean retaliatory attack and Donald Trump's tweets as the beginning of a general war, so he launches an initial strike in the hopes of preventing further attacks on North Korea. When that fails, Kim launching his remaining nuclear arsenal. He commits suicide when U.S. and South Korean special forces attack his bunker. * Ja Song-nam - North Korea's Permanent representative to the United Nations. During the crisis, Ja is unable to contact North Korea's leadership due to damage to the telecommunications grid. He and the rest of the North Korean Mission to the United Nations defects in Haskell, New Jersey. South Korean * President Moon Jae-in - Infuriated by the destruction of BX 411, Moon authorizes a limited retaliatory strike against North Korea, acting without American approval. He is subsequently killed in a nuclear explosion while traveling from the Blue House to the Central Government Complex. * Minister of National Defense Jeong Kyeong-doo - Jeong advocates a hardline approach to North Korea following the shoot-down of a civilian airliner. He is killed in the nuclear explosion above Seoul. * Chief Presidential Secretary Im Jong-seok - Im provides the point of view for many of the South Korean developments, having narrowly survived the nuclear attack on Seoul in the Blue House. Development Lewis drew inspiration from John Hersey's reporting on the atomic bombing of Hiroshima when depicting the casualties of nuclear war. Reception The book received positive reviews, with Julian Borger of The Guardian comparing it to nuclear war stories Dr. Strangelove and On the Beach.

This data will enable scientists to study the dynamic processes that occur in the inner core of the storm resulting in rapid genesis and intensification. William Blackwell of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington is the principal investigator.  Mission overview  The TROPICS CubeSats will perform very frequent measurements, similar to X-rays, that cut through the overall cloud- cover to see the storm's underlying structure. The storm structures known as the eyewall – tall clouds, wind and rain around the eye – and rainbands – the rainy parts of the spiral arms – give us clues about whether a storm is primed to intensify into a category 4 or 5 storm, something everyone in their path needs to know. TROPICS will consist of 6 CubeSats, each about one foot long and weighing just 8.5 pounds, that use scanning microwave radiometers to measure temperature, humidity, precipitation and cloud properties. The CubeSats will be launched into three separate orbital planes to enable the overall constellation to monitor changes in tropical cyclones as frequently as every 21 minutes. Each CubeSat will host a high-performance radiometer scanning across the satellite track at 30 RPM to provide temperature profiles using seven channels near the 118.75 GHz oxygen absorption line, water vapor profiles using 3 channels near the 183 GHz water vapor absorption line, imagery in a single channel near 90 GHz for precipitation measurements, and a single channel at 206 GHz for cloud ice measurements. The investigation was selected from NASA's third Earth Venture Instrument competition. Langley Research Center is the NASA Center leading the mission.  TROPICS Pathfinder  The TROPICS Pathfinder mission, consisting of a single CubeSat, was approved by NASA's Earth System Science Pathfinder (ESSP) Program Office in order to demonstrate the technologies planned for use on TROPICS in advance of the constellation's launch.

It was the site of one of the successful protests by Aboriginal Australians for their rights during the Freedom Ride in February 1965. The site was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 6 September 2013.  History  In early 1965 a group of students from the University of Sydney led by Aboriginal student activist Charles Perkins embarked upon a bus trip known as the Freedom Ride through outback NSW and Queensland to highlight racial inequalities in Australia at the time. The trip was based on the \\"Freedom Rides\\" that occurred as part of the civil rights movement in the United States in the early 1960s. The bus travelled to number of towns where racial discrimination had been identified with the aim of highlighting the inequalities and raising the profile of this issue amongst the broader Australian community. A number of towns were visited including Walgett and Kempsey but in Moree, where a ban on Aboriginal use of the local pool was in force, the trip gained a national profile in the media and raised the profile of Charles Perkins as an iconic figure for the Indigenous community. The events at the Moree Swimming Baths in February 1965 constitute a defining moment in the history of race relations in Australia. The activities of the Student Action for Aborigines group at Moree drew the attention of the public to the informal and institutional racial segregation practised at that time in outback towns in New South Wales. The events at Moree also highlighted the failures at both state and federal levels; while both spoke rhetoric of inclusion into the wider Australian society, Aboriginal people in country towns were still being excluded from sharing basic facilities. The publicity that the events at the Moree baths attracted contributed to shaping a climate of opinion resulting in a resounding Yes vote in the 1967 referendum, leading to a change in the Australian Constitution to allow the Australian Government to make laws specifically for Aboriginal people. The constitutional amendment provided the legal basis for subsequent Australian Government involvement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, and also led to increased recognition of the importance of Indigenous rights in Australia. The Freedom Ride and the events at Moree have their origins in a heightened concern about racial discrimination in Australia after the Second World War. In 1945 the international community, in its attempts to provide peace and security in a world traumatised by the social and economic disruption of total war, agreed to recognise the political aspirations of, and to promote self-government in, colonised countries.United Nations 1945: Article 73 As a signatory to the United Nations Charter, and under pressure from independence movements in many of its colonies, Britain began to divest itself of its colonies immediately after the war: India gained independence in 1947, quickly followed by Ceylon and Burma in 1949 and Malaya, Sudan and Ghana in the 1950s. While these countries were proud of their independence from Britain, many of them elected to remain within the Commonwealth of Nations. The \\"Commonwealth club\\" provided a forum where the heads of government of the newly independent states met on equal terms with the heads of older self- governing Dominions like Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa. In 1960 the British Prime Minister, Harold MacMillan responded to the Sharpeville massacre by delivering his \\"Winds of Change\\" speech to the South African Parliament. The speech recognised the inevitable growth of African national consciousness, which could no longer be ignored. MacMillan's speech was not welcomed in South Africa, with its apartheid laws that entrenched racial segregation, economic exploitation, and discrimination. In response, South Africa declared itself a republic in 1961, a move that threatened to divide the Commonwealth. The Australian Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, and Harold MacMillan tried to develop a form of words that would keep the Commonwealth intact. However, the final statement released at the end of the 1961 meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers expressed concern at the effect that South Africa's racial policies could have on relations between Commonwealth countries that were members of a multi-racial association of people.Martin 2000: 201 Menzies always championed the Commonwealth of Nations and it is not surprising that he worked with MacMillan to try to keep it intact. Privately, however, he questioned whether the newly independent nations could ever equal the old Commonwealth countries where British descendants and values prevailed.National Archives of Australia He declined to become involved in overt criticism of apartheid, arguing that it was an internal matter for South Africa in which Australia should not interfere. Despite the government's silence, an anti-apartheid movement began to form which included the National Union of Australian University Students.Curthoys 2002: 2; Clark 2008: 5 South Africa was not the only country where there were laws institutionalising segregation and racial discrimination. In the early 1960s, protests by the civil rights movement against racial segregation laws in the United States of America led to brutal response by police in southern states. The police response and subsequent mass jailing received widespread coverage in Australia. In response to the mass protests and arrests in Birmingham, Alabama, the American President, John Kennedy, introduced a Civil Rights Bill to Congress in 1963. His successor, Lyndon Johnson, sought to push the bill through Congress in the early months of 1964. Sydney University students decided to protest outside the United States consulate on 6 May 1964 in support of the Bill, and against the senators from southern states who were attempting through filibuster to prevent its passage. When police began arresting protestors, fellow students tried to free them. The initial scuffle turned into what one newspaper described as \\"an all-in brawl\\", leading to extensive media publicity.Curthoys 2002: 6-7 International and some local reports of the demonstration included suggestions that demonstrators were hypocritical because they focused on fashionable American civil rights issues but did not consider the treatment of Australia's Indigenous minority, which was also racially discriminatory. In 1965, assimilation rather than segregation had been Australian Government policy for at least a decade, but the Australian Government powers were limited to persuasion since Aboriginal policy was firmly a matter for the state governments at this time. In his statement after the 1961 Native Welfare Conference, the Hon Paul Hasluck, the Australian Government Minister for Territories, described this policy as one that would enable Aboriginal people to: > \\"... live as members of a single Australian community, enjoying the same > responsibilities, observing the same customs and influenced by the same > beliefs, hopes and loyalties as other Australians.\\" Discriminatory legislation was removed by the Australian Government and state governments in the early 1960s. The last two states to grant Aboriginal people voting rights were Western Australia in 1962, and Queensland in 1962 (for Australian elections) and 1965 (for state elections). In New South Wales, Aboriginal policy was managed by the Aborigines Welfare Board (AWB), which sought either to keep people on its managed stations or to exert control over the rest through a network of district welfare officers.Goodall 1996: 265 Typically, Aboriginal people lived on the fringes of towns, either in unhealthy shanty settlements or in highly regulated stations. They continued to suffer the effects of racial discrimination at a local level, socially, economically, and culturally. There was, however, a growing movement for Aboriginal rights in the late 1950s and early 1960s, represented most clearly by the organisations brought together by the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines (in 1964 Torres Strait Islanders were added so that the acronym became FCAATSI). Students had not been a significant part of this movement, but after the criticisms of their actions outside the US Embassy in May 1964, and influenced by the arrival the year before of Charles Perkins and Gary Williams as the first two Aboriginal students at the University of Sydney, they began to organise a very successful student-organised demonstration and concert. This took place on National Aborigines Day in Hyde Park in Sydney and was followed by the formation in July 1964 of a more permanent organisation, Student Action for Aborigines (SAFA). This organisation drew people from many of the political, religious and recreational clubs in the University and it had an Aboriginal student, Charles Perkins, as Chairman.Ford 1965: 4; Spigelman 1965: 116-117; Curthoys 2002: 8-10 The proposed Freedom Ride with its focus on racial discrimination and segregation resonated with Charles Perkins' life. He was born at The Bungalow in Alice Springs. His Eastern Arrernte mother, recognising there were limited educational opportunities in Alice Springs, took up an offer for him to go to St Francis House, an Anglican home for boys of mixed Aboriginal and other descent in Semaphore South, Adelaide.Briscoe 2000: 253 He had encountered discrimination against Aboriginal people in Alice Springs and this continued when he moved to Adelaide. A story from his late teens demonstrates the callous treatment meted out to Aboriginals. He went to a dance at the Port Adelaide Town Hall where he summoned up the courage to walk across the room and individually asked each girl for a dance only to be told, 'We don't dance with blacks'. The experience, he said, scarred his mind and undermined his confidence and self respect.The Times 19 October 2000 In the early 1950s Charles began playing soccer at St Francis House. His outstanding skills as a soccer player led him to England in 1957 where he trialled for Everton. Although he was offered a position he rejected this due to his treatment at the club and ended up playing as an amateur for the Bishop Auckland club. In 1958, he returned to Australia to marry Eileen Munchenburg and take up matriculation studies.Briscoe 2000:254 He continued to play soccer, taking on the position of captain coach for Adelaide Croatia before moving to Sydney where he also accepted the role of captain coach of the Sydney Pan Hellenic team, using it to help finance his way through University. In 1963, he entered the University of Sydney where he became increasingly involved in campaigns against racial discrimination and segregation against Aborigines, \\"recognising too their rights as a people\\". One of the suggested activities for the SAFA group, which was inspired by the Freedom Rides in America, was a bus tour of Aboriginal settlements. Unlike the American Freedom Rides, which aimed to challenge segregation on interstate buses and at interstate bus terminals in the south, SAFA planned their bus tour to highlight the plight of Aborigines in rural Australia on a range of issues. Their aim was to undertake a social survey into the extent of racial discrimination in country towns, and then to draw discrimination to the attention of the wider Australian public through the press, radio and television. They wanted to point out the discriminatory barriers and inadequacies in health and housing as well as supporting Aboriginal people in challenging the status quo. The group decided to adopt Martin Luther King's approach of non-violent resistance when dealing with opponents. Preparations for the trip included a number of fundraisers including folk concerts, dances and sales of Christmas cards. SAFA also received donations from the Student Union, and each student participant contributed ten pounds. They heard talks and produced a reading list about the barriers facing Aboriginal people in outback New South Wales to help them prepare themselves for the trip.Talkabout 1964 No.1 and No.2 The group also had several people as sources of information on discrimination and segregation in the towns in northern New South Wales. One was Jack Horner of the Aboriginal Australian Fellowship. He provided information on issues in a number of towns in outback New South Wales including Walgett, Moree and Kempsey. He also advised the SAFA about recent reports and conferences dealing with Aboriginal health and education.Letter from J. Horner to J. Spigelman 19 January 1965 Charles Perkins, the President of the group was another source of information for the bus trip. During the summer, he worked for the Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs where his interaction with job seekers, evicted families and those requiring access to social services enabled him to gain an understanding of the issues faced by Aboriginal people in New South Wales. He gained further insight into racial prejudice and segregation in some of the towns when he was invited to join a light plane tour through New South Wales with a journalist, Craig Williams, and the Reverend Ted Noffs, who had agreed to help the students design their survey.Curthoys 2002: 50 Preparing picket signs, Walgett With all the preparations completed, the Freedom Ride bus left Sydney on 13 February 1965. Its first stop was Wellington where the students conducted surveys and investigations, highlighting social injustices and uncovering evidence of racial discrimination. However, without local Aboriginal contacts and with insufficient firm information to justify a demonstration they moved onto to the next town, Gulargambone. While the conditions under which Aboriginal people lived there were quite shocking, there was not a clear case of racial discrimination on which to demonstrate. The next stop was Walgett, and here the Freedom-riders took action. Walgett had both an existing group of Aboriginal activists and some clear cases of racial discrimination. It proved to be the first real showdown for the Freedom Riders. They spent their first day conducting interviews to obtain information about segregation and racial discrimination and found that the cinema, the Returned Servicemen's League (RSL) club, the town's two hotels and a frock shop were all segregated.Read 1988:47 The manager of the Oasis Hotel stated that he did not allow Aboriginal people into the public bar because his white patrons did not want them admitted. He said he would lose his white customers and business if he allowed Aboriginals to drink there. Of more concern was the fact that Aboriginal people, including Aboriginal ex-service men, who applied to join the Walgett RSL Club, were denied membership. The Freedom Riders picketed the Walgett RSL club from noon until sunset holding placards stating \\"Walgett: Australian's disgrace\\", \\"Bar the Colour Bar\\", \\"Good enough for Tobruk - why not Walgett RSL?\\".Read1988: 48; Curthoys 2002: 98 The picket provoked much heated discussion and the white community in Walgett expressed its anger towards the Freedom Riders. The minister of Anglican Church Hall in Walgett, where the students were staying, had warned them that morning that they would not be allowed to stay if they demonstrated against the RSL. After the demonstration, the minister and three churchwardens gave the students two hours to vacate the hall.Read 1988: 48 A line of cars and a truck followed the bus when it left Walgett. It was night time and the students could not see their followers. The truck attempted to run the bus off the road twice; on the third attempt, it clipped the bus forcing it off the road and over an embankment. While nobody was injured during this incident, the students were further alarmed when the convoy of cars stopped, but were relieved to find that the cars belonged to members of the Aboriginal community who had tried to provide an escort to protect the bus from hostile white residents. The bus returned to Walgett where the driver reported the incident to the police. When the police had finished taking all the statements, the Freedom Riders left Walgett, which remained a bitterly divided town.Read 1988:49 Walgett was the first big test for the students. While their protest did little to change the attitudes of the townsfolk, they encouraged the Aboriginal community to push for change. Aboriginal people who participated in pickets were bitter at the ongoing discrimination they experienced in their town and they continued to protest and agitate for desegregation in the establishments that still upheld a colour ban after the protestors left.Clark 2008:171 Seven months after the visit of the Freedom Ride, some students returned to Walgett to assist in an Aboriginal demonstration to desegregate the local cinema. Initially, there was little media interest in the events in Walgett. However, a report by Bruce Maxwell, a cadet reporter for the Herald, brought the SAFA Freedom Ride into the national spotlight. The Sydney Morning Herald and The Daily Mirror newspapers as well as TV and radio now began to report on the next stage of the Freedom Ride in Moree.Curthoys 2002:7 The pattern of racial discrimination and segregation in Moree was similar to that found in Walgett with some firms refusing to employ Aboriginals, and most hotels refusing to serve them. The students' attention, however, focused on the swimming pool where a council by- law prevented Aboriginal people's entry. This was an example of discrimination enforceable under local ordinance so it was seen to be similar to officially sanctioned apartheid in South Africa and segregation in the United States. In addition, a local councillor, alderman Bob Brown, had repeatedly tried to get the council to allow Aborigines to use the baths, but to no avail - he could not even get a seconder for his motion.Clark 2008:172 Student Action for Aborigines protest outside Moree Town Hall Initially, the Freedom Riders held a picket at the Moree council chambers to protest against the exclusion of Aboriginal people (except for school children during school hours) from the Moree baths. The next day Bob Brown and the Freedom Riders tried to take Aboriginal children into the pool. The pool manager argued heatedly with the student leaders. The impasse ended when the mayor agreed to allow the children in. That evening, the students held a public meeting to explain why they were in Moree and to present their survey results. Initially the largely white audience reacted angrily and some left, but after discussion the atmosphere changed. The meeting concluded by passing a motion that the by-law segregating the pool should be removed, which the mayor said he would take to the council.Curthoys 2002: 136-142 alt= The Freedom Riders left Moree the next day, jubilant that the colour ban had been lifted.Messenger 2002: 2 While the students travelled to Boggabilla and then to Warwick in southern Queensland, Bob Brown tried to take another group of Aboriginal children to the pool but the pool manager refused them entry and decided to close the pool. Following an emergency council meeting, the mayor arrived and ordered the manager to re- open the pool and enforce the by-law providing for segregation of the baths. The following day Bob Brown called the Freedom Riders to let them know what had happened. Charles Perkins had flown to Sydney to be interviewed for a television programme. The students phoned the Methodist Minister in Moree who confirmed Bob Brown's story and told them that they would not be welcome in Moree. The students decided to turn the bus around and return to Moree.Clark 2008:173 Crowd and police outside Moree Baths The Freedom Riders stopped at Inverell that night and picked up Charles Perkins in the morning. Charles felt that the opportunity to achieve a \\"break through\\" was at stake and saw Moree as the place to do this.Read 1988: 51 On returning to Moree, the Freedom Riders again collected a number of Aboriginal children from the mission to gain admittance into the swimming pool. They attempted to enter the pool with the children for three hours. By this time, a large crowd of locals had gathered outside the pool. It was hostile and tempers were inflamed. Some locals threw eggs and tomatoes. They knocked some students down and at least one was punched. Fights broke out and police arrested several crowd members.Curthoys 2002: 155-158 The media reported the attacks on the students as \\"little different from the American South\\".Messenger, 2002:3 Moree Mayor William Loyd escorts protestors away from the pool A breakthrough came when the mayor of Moree, Bill Lloyd, came down to the baths and informed the students and the crowd that he was prepared to sign a motion to rescind the 1955 by-law. After some negotiation, the Freedom Riders accepted these assurances and agreed to leave. They boarded the bus under a hail of eggs and tomatoes and the police provided a protective escort as the bus left town.Curthoys 2002 Freedom riders at Bowraville The Freedom Riders continued their journey, visiting the coastal towns in northern New South Wales to undertake their surveys and highlight instances of racial discrimination. While the students demonstrated against particular instances of discrimination and segregation in towns like Kempsey and Bowraville, the local reactions were more muted than those in Moree.Spigelman 1965: 49; Curthoys 2002; Ch. 7 The reports and photos in the major newspapers of the events at Moree shocked many white Australians, making them aware of the plight of Aboriginal people.Cameron 2000: 12; Clark 2008: 178 By drawing attention to both informal and officially sanctioned segregation and racial discrimination, the Freedom Ride helped to show that governmental rhetoric, that Aboriginal people should share in the benefits and opportunities of Australians generally, was not being applied in practice. The Freedom Riders highlighted the fact that, contrary to government policy, segregation and discrimination were endemic in many of the rural towns of New South Wales. The council ordinance prohibiting Aboriginal people from using the Moree baths demonstrated that discrimination was officially sanctioned in some cases. Whether the Australian Government was unable or unwilling to tackle such contradictory policies is unclear. Section 51 of the constitution, prohibited the Government from passing laws specifically for Aboriginal Australians. There was also a lack of will to use the external affairs powers to address racial discrimination. By highlighting endemic racism in Australia, the Freedom Ride contributed to the passage of the 1967 referendum, which altered the constitution to allow the Commonwealth to make laws for Aboriginal people. It also contributed to the passage in 1975 of legislation prohibiting racial discrimination and encouraged some Aboriginal people to become active in challenging the status quo of segregation and discrimination. The Freedom Ride has been described as one of those transitional moments in Australian history when one era fades and another takes its place.Clark 2008: 11  Description  Main entrance to the baths, 2011 Moree Baths and Swimming Pool is at about 0.5ha, Lot 20 bounded by Anne Street, Gosport Street and Warialda Street in Moree. The Moree Hot Artesian Pool Complex (Moree baths) is owned and managed by the Moree Plains Shire Council. The original hot pool opened in 1895 when the first bore that tapped into the Great Artesian Basin was completed. The bore delivered mineral waters, heated naturally to about 41 degrees Celsius. A small basin was originally excavated and gravelled. This was later upgraded with a small wooden lined basin for bathing. The original bore ceased to flow in 1957, and the hot mineral waters are now pumped to the baths. Currently the large municipal complex comprises three tiled pools.  Condition  The building is still in use and is in good condition. Since 1965 the exterior has been modified and there have been minor refurbishments to the interior of the baths and swimming pool. These modifications have not affected its heritage value relating to the 1965 Freedom Ride.  Heritage listing  In 1965 student protest actions at the Moree baths highlighted the racial discrimination and segregation experienced by Aboriginal people in Australian rural towns and the outback and forced the broader Australia community to look at the way it treated its Indigenous population. The protest was an important contributor to the climate of opinion which resulted in a yes vote in the 1967 referendum to change the Australian Constitution regarding the status of Aboriginal Australians. That change provided a legal basis for subsequent Australian Government involvement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and an increased recognition at local, state, and national levels of the importance of Indigenous rights in Australia. The events that occurred at the Moree baths in 1965 also have a special association with the life and works of the Aboriginal activist Dr Charles Nelson Perrurle Perkins AO. Moree was the place where the public first saw him confront people with awkward truths about the treatment of Aborigines. This combined with other events that occurred in the wider Freedom ride, brought Charles Perkins to public prominence as a leading Aboriginal activist and established him as an iconic figure for both young and older Aborigines alike. In addition it clearly demonstrated his commitment to achieving equity for Aboriginal people in Australia, which became a lifelong cause. Moree Baths and Swimming Pool was listed on the Australian National Heritage List on 6 September 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Events, Processes The Moree baths has outstanding national heritage value under criterion (a) as the place where student protests in 1965 highlighted the legalised segregation and racism experienced by Aboriginal people in outback Australia. It brought the racial discrimination and segregation experienced by the Aboriginal population in Australian country and rural towns to the attention and consciousness of the white Australian population. It forced Australia to look at the way it treated its Indigenous population and showed that racial segregation continued in many towns. The protest was an important contributor to the climate of opinion which produced a yes vote in the 1967 referendum to change the Australian Constitution. From that change came a legal basis for subsequent Commonwealth involvement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and an increased recognition at local, state, and national levels of the importance of Indigenous rights in Australia. Criterion H: Significant people The Moree baths has outstanding heritage value to the nation under criterion (h) as the place that has a special association with the life and works of the Aboriginal activist Dr Charles Nelson Perrurle Perkins AO. The events at the Moree baths in 1965 brought him into public prominence as a leading Aboriginal activist and it was here that his tactic of confronting people with awkward truths about their treatment of Aborigines first emerged in a public context. This pattern was repeated throughout his life even when it resulted in costs to him personally. The events that occurred in Moree, and the wider Freedom ride, established Charles Perkins as an iconic figure for both young and older Aborigines alike. In addition it clearly demonstrated his commitment to achieving equity for Aboriginal people in Australia, something that became a lifelong cause.

It is endemic to Florida. Description Arcadian St. John's wort is a small, thicket-forming shrub, growing up to tall. The stems are reddish-brown, marked with lines when young and with bark peeling in strips as it ages. The leathery leaves are sessile and elliptic, growing long and across, paler underneath and waxy above. The leaves quickly fall off, leaving behind gland-like auricles. Flowers are produced in a pseudo- dichotomous arrangement. Each yellow flower has 4 sepals: 2 large and 2 small. The flowers each have 4 bright yellow petals and numerous stamens. The capsules have 3-4 lobes. Hypericum edisonianum is distinguished from the similar H. crux-andreae by its smaller, thicker leaves, its pseudo-dichotomous branching, and a pair of gland-like auricles that remain after leaves fall off the stem. Distribution and habitat In Florida, Hypericum edisonianum is restricted to wet prairies, flatwoods, pond margins, and other low areas in the central peninsula, often on sandy soils. It is locally abundant, but only found at 25 sites in 5 conservation areas. Conservation Arcadian St. Johns wort is threatened by wetland loss, fire suppression, grazing, and habitat destruction. Conservation efforts to protect this species include securing scrub habitat suitable for its growth, the application of prescribed fire, maintaining natural hydrology, and excluding off-road vehicles and cattle.

The exhibition featured the work of Juliet Batten, Allie Eagle, Claudia Eyley, Keri Hulme, Bridie Lonie, Heather McPherson, Joanna Paul, Nancy Petersen, Helen Rockel, Carole Stewart and Tiffany Thornley. Exhibitions were often arranged thematically, engaging in issues that impacted women's lives. According to curator and art historian Anne Kirker: 'Mothers was undoubtedly the most significant project of this collectively-run enterprise. Accompanied by a comprehensive catalogue, the exhibition toured throughout New Zealand from 1981 and afterwards went to Sydney for the Women and Arts Festival (October 1982). In this country it was shown in community centres as well as galleries, in an effort to reach a wider audience. Many women who saw this show were deeply moved to recognise their own experience in art for perhaps the first time.' In 1981 the gallery moved into new premises at 323 Willis Street, where it remained until its closure in 1984. The decision to close was made at the A.G.M. in January of that year.

In 1806 the Royal Navy commissioned her. She captured some small privateers and took part in a number of other engagements. She foundered in 1809. Capture At 10am on 13 December 1804, the frigate HMS Princess Charlotte was four leagues west of Cape Antonio when she sighted an unknown brig. After a chase of seven hours southward, Princess Charlotte caught up with her quarry at . The brig surrendered after her pursuer had fired four or five shots. The quarry was the French privateer Regulus, out of Guadaloupe. She was pierced for 14 guns but had only 11 on board, having thrown two overboard during the chase. She had a crew of 88 men under the command of Citizen Jacque Mathieu. Captain F.F. Gardner of Princess Charlotte described Regulus as \\"a very fine Vessel\\" that \\"sails remarkably well\\" and is \\"perfectly adapted for His Majesty's Service\\". Royal Navy Lieutenant John Rorie commissioned Morne Fortunee in 1806. On 6 April Morne Fortunee recaptured Industry and took her into Port Royal where she was to unload, having sprung a leak. Industry, Galt, master, had sailed from Port Royal on 2 April for Dublin with the fleet, but a French privateer had captured her on the 6th and taken most of her crew and some valuable articles.Lloyd's List (LL) №4061. After a chase of two hours off Cape Beata on the island of Hispaniola, Morne Fortunee on 16 May 1806 captured the French privateer Luni. Luni, of two guns and 47 men, was four days out of San Domingo but had not captured anything. On 3 June Morne Fortunee drove the Spanish letter of marque schooner Aimable Jenette ashore between Saona Island and Cape Euganna. It was impossible to get her off so Rorie sent his boats in to destroy her. Aimable Jenette had been armed with two guns and had had a crew of 20 men. In June Lieutenant John Brown replaced Rorie. On 18 June Brown and Morne Fotunee took the French privateer schooner Hope of St. Pierre's, Martinique. Brown has sighted a suspicious sail and gave chase, and after two hours was able to come up with and capture her. Hope had lost her main-mast and foretop-mast in am earlier squall. She was armed with four guns and had a crew of 44. She had been out for seven days but had taken nothing. In November Lloyd's List reported that Morne Fortunee had detained Attempt, of and from Salem, Massachusetts, which had been sailing to Martinique with naval stores. Morne Fortunee took Attempt into Saint Lucia.LL №4098. Lieutenant J.J. Rorie replaced Brown in command of Morne Fortunee during 1807. On 1 January 1807 the frigates , , , and captured the Dutch island of Curacao. Morne Fortunee was not mentioned in the letter describing the action. However, Lieutenant Rorie claimed a share of the prize money arising from the capture, a claim that was disputed. By 1849 when the Admiralty awarded the NGSM for the action, Morne Fortunee and Rorie were listed together with the four frigates. On 13 January Morne Fortunee captured Nuestra Senora del Carmen. On 8 July Rorie observed a Spanish privateer schooner near Point Tunacas and after a chase of about three hours, succeeded in driving on shore. Rorie immediately opened fire and succeeded in destroying his quarry. She turned out to be Babillon, of two 6-pounder guns and 45 men. She was three days out of Coro but had not captured anything. Rorie reported a \\"particular Satisfaction\\" at having destroyed Babillon as she had been a \\"considerable Annoyance to the Curacoa Trade.\\" While off the south side of the Pedro Bank, Morne Fortunee gave chase to a Spanish felucca. After a chase of 24 hours, Morne Fortunee captured Santo Christo, a letter of marque armed with one long 12-pounder and with 15 men on board. She had been sailing from Cuba for Portobelo, Colón. On 27 March the boats of Morne Fortunee joined those of , , and in an attempt to cut out the 16-gun French brig Griffon at Marin, Martinique. They succeeded in capturing a battery but were driven back empty handed, having suffered heavy casualties from the brig's fire. On 18 May Morne Fortunee captured a letter of marque schooner. On 12 December Morne Fortunee, again under the command of Lieutenant John Brown, discovered the French 16-gun brig Cygne and two schooners off the Pearl Rock, Saint-Pierre, Martinique. Morne Fortunee joined the frigate , the ship-sloop , the brig-sloop , and the advice boat in an action against the squadron. The British suffered heavy casualties. The next day arrived and the British eventually succeeded in destroying Cygne. In all, the British lost some 12 men killed, 31 wounded, and 26 missing (drowned or prisoners) for little gain. Morne Fortunee suffered no losses. Cygne was armed with 18 guns and carried a crew of 140 men. She had been carrying flour, guns and cartridge paper for the relief of Martinique. The French schooners were armed and were carrying flour. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the award of the NGSM with the clasp \\"Off The Pearl Rock 13 Decr. 1808\\" to the then living survivors of the battle. Morne Fortunee shared with , , and Amaranthe in the prize money pool of £772 3s 3d for the capture of Frederick on 30 December 1808. This money was paid in June 1829. Fate Morne Fortunee was off Martinique on 9 January 1809 when a squall came up and overset her. Lieutenant Brown and 40 of her crew drowned. Only the ship's clerk and 18 men were saved.Lloyd's List №4337.

He is a co-founder of BitMEX and according to The Sunday Times is Britain's youngest self-made billionaire. Early life and education Born in Sheffield, Delo was educated at Lord Williams's School and graduated from the University of Oxford in 2005 with a double first-class honours degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. About Delo's high- achieving yet idiosyncratic character, Worcester College's Provost Sir Jonathan Bate later commented: \\"He overcame great difficulties in his school career to win a place at Oxford from a local state school, and went on to a stellar performance – as well as a sometimes colourful career – as a student.\\" Career Delo began his career as a software engineer at IBM, where he was named as an inventor on several patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the Intellectual Property Office. He then went on to develop high-frequency trading systems at hedge funds and banks such as GSA Capital and J.P. Morgan, dealing predominantly in kdb+/Q. His expertise covers the design, architecture, and implementation of quantitative infrastructure, systems, and tools. In 2014, Delo met Arthur Hayes and Sam Reed, and they co- founded BitMEX, a cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform. Philanthropy In October 2018, Delo gave £5 million to his Oxford alma mater Worcester College, endowing two teaching fellowships in perpetuity and becoming the youngest major donor in the College's history. In April 2019, Delo signed The Giving Pledge, a programme orchestrated by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, announcing his intention to give away at least half of his wealth during his lifetime. In his pledge letter, Delo states that his initial philanthropic interests are focused on long-term and large-scale problems and reducing catastrophic risks, and that he is inspired by the philosophy of effective altruism. That month, Delo also became a member of Giving What We Can. In March 2020, in collaboration with Oxford University, Delo initiated and funded a cross-sectional survey, using nanopore technology (which sequences the whole genome of pathogens) as a diagnostic tool, to determine and level of community-based infection of COVID-19 in the UK. According to Professor Mike Bonsall, “Using rapid diagnostics, we will explore a new method of pathogen detection, which if widely adopted could prove crucial to early containment of future novel disease outbreaks.” Legal issues in the United States On 1 October 2020, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the US Department of Justice simultaneously made a number of formal allegations against BitMEX and its co-founders, including Ben Delo. Amongst other complaints, the regulators alleged that the BitMEX trading platform was required to have registered aspects of its operations in the US and had failed to do so. The company’s co-founders were also charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering programme to US standards. According to a spokesman for BitMEX’s parent company, Delo and his co-founders “intend to defend the allegations vigorously”.

Early life and education Elron was born in Haifa, the youngest of nine children born to Ovadia and Tzadika Alfarih, Iraqi Jewish immigrants to Israel originally from Mosul. After graduating from \\"Erev Hadash\\" high school in Haifa, he served in the Israel Defense Forces from 1973 to 1977. After being discharged in 1977 with the rank of Lieutenant, he moved to the United Kingdom. He worked in various positions in security organizations from 1977 to 1980, and studied law at the University of Buckingham. After graduating with an LLB in 1983, he returned to Israel, where he clerked in a law firm and in the Haifa District Attorney's Office. He completed an MA in National Security Administration at the University of Haifa in 2001. Legal career After being admitted to the Israel Bar Association in 1985, Elron opened a law office in Haifa and practiced law as an attorney dealing in criminal and civil law from 1985 to 1994. In 1994, he was appointed a judge on the Haifa Magistrate's Court, and in 2003 was appointed a judge on the Haifa District Court. In 2010, while continuing to serve on the Haifa District Court, he was appointed a judge on the Military Court of Appeals as part of his military reserve duty, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In 2012, he was appointed Deputy President of the Haifa District Court. The following year he was appointed President of that Court, and served in this role for over 4 years (July 2013-October 2017).

In February 2017, Elron was appointed a Supreme Court Justice. He assumed the position on 30 October 2017. As a Supreme Court Justice, Supreme Court Chief Justice Esther Hayut requested Elron to chair a committee which was tasked to examine the interactions between judges and attorneys in legal proceedings that take place while conducting criminal investigations, before indicting a suspect. The Committee's conclusions underscored, among other things, the importance of transparency in legal proceedings. These later contributed to the formulation of new Rules of Conduct, which came into force during September 2018, and wished to provide comprehensive guidelines as to the proper nature of the interactions between judges and attorneys.

Originally a Methodist church, it became part of the Uniting Church in Australia following the Methodist Church's amalgamation in 1977. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups.Proudfoot, 1987 The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport.Nichols, 2010 Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. In 1794, the land on which the church precinct stands was first alienated for European purposes in a grant made by Francis Grose of thirty acres to Samuel Wilcox, who named it Wilcox Farm. It is likely that land clearance and agricultural activities as well as some building works took place during this period and during the subsequent of occupation. In the early nineteenth century, it was incorporated into a large holding of 1500 acres known as Peninsula Farm. Lachlan Macquarie replaced William Bligh as Governor of New South Wales on 1 January 1810. The colony prospered under his influence, and he initiated a public works program with 265 public buildings, new public amenities, and improving existing services such as roads. On 6 December 1810, he named the five Macquarie Towns to be erected in the Hawkesbury district: Richmond, Widnsor, Castlereagh, Pitt Town and Wilberforce. Following his proclamation, Windsor became a permanent town with streets, public buildings and a town square. The original Methodist Church on the site, built in 1838-39, was destroyed by a disastrous fire which ravaged this part of the town in 1894. The current church was built in 1875-76, and is considered to be one of the finest examples extant of this type of Victorian non-conformist church. The present site on the corner of Macquarie and Fitzgerald Streets comprises the Uniting Church Church, the church hall, the former parsonage (on the opposite side of Fitzgerald Street) and a house at No. 29 Fitzgerald Street.  Description  Church (1875-6) The church was built in 1875-76 as a result of the fire which destroyed almost a whole block of the town on 23 December 1874. The original Methodist church (1838-39) was destroyed but the schoolhouse (1861) miraculously survived. The church is a fine example of Victorian non-conformist Gothic revival architecture. It is built of rendered brick with Gothic detailing, consists of nave, vestry and porch, and has a steep slate roof. Most of the fittings are original and there is a marble memorial to the pioneer Wesleyan missionary, the Rev. Peter Turner (1803-73), who was associated with Windsor for the last twenty years of his life.Tanner & Associates, 1983 The roof and foundations have suffered some damage by the 25 year old pine trees within three metres of the church building. At the time of heritage listing, the condition of the slate roof had been deteriorating for the last 10 years. The exterior of the church building is also suffering from age and weather damage to painted surfaces and spires etc. Deteriorated condition of the church fabric, its roof stormwater drainage system, rising damp and falling damp deterioration, breaking down of the external paint particularly on the exposed parapets. Church Hall (1861) The hall is a small, simple, rendered brick hall built in 1861 as a Methodist Schoolhouse. It is designed in the Colonial Georgian tradition, with a gabled corrugated iron roof, 12 pane windows, stone cills, doors with transom lights and simple heavy pilasters at the corners of the front elevation topped by curious conical decorations This is one of only a small number of Windsor's early 19th century buildings, being a remnant of the great fire that wiped out many of the buildings within Windsor township, including the former Church building. Church Yard The church yard comprises land fronting Fitzgerald and Macquarie Streets, and O'Briens Lane to the south. A retaining wall faces Macquarie Street, with lawn on its raised surface, on which the site's built elements sit. Some trees are arrayed on the site, including a jacaranda at the south-west near the hall (Jacaranda mimosifolia), two crepe myrtles (Lagerstroemia indica: one west of the church, the other to its north-east near the corner of Fitzgerald and Macquarie Streets) and two others: one in the site's south-east corner near the Church Hall's eastern wall, the other north and slightly west of the church's porch entry.  Heritage listing  The group is considered to be an important item of the State's environmental heritage because of its historic and social associations with the development of the town of Windsor. Its architectural value as examples of various architectural styles with curious stylistic idiosyncrasies. Its cultural significance as a group of buildings associated with the history of the Methodist Church in Windsor. Its aesthetic and landmark value as a group of buildings of great importance to the streetscape of Windsor, located in a prominent location on a major road.

Traditionally, Jordan was considered a companion of Augustine of Canterbury who came to the South West of England in the early 7th century, founded a local church, and was later venerated as a saint. A chapel consecrated to Jordan is known to have existed on College Green in Bristol in the 14th century. From the 19th century, historians and genealogists began to question the traditional portrayal of Jordan's life and propose alternative theories about his identity, while others continued to support the traditional view.  Life  Jordan's background and the origins of his cult at Bristol are contested and unclear. A 15th century hymn to the saint describes him as a companion of Augustine of Canterbury who helped preach the gospel to the English and whose relics were later entombed at Bristol. According to David H. Higgins of Bristol University, Jordan may have been a young monk of the noble Jordan family who lived at St. Andrew's Monastery in Rome, before accompanying Augustine on the Gregorian mission to convert the English. Drawing on toponymic evidence and references to Jordan in the work of 16th-century antiquarians John Leland and William Camden, Higgins argued that Jordan must have traveled with Augustine to the West of England to attend a crucial conference with the Celtic bishops, after which he may have founded the first monastery in the Bristol region and remained there. Accounting for the lack of references to Jordan in Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Higgins explained that Jordan may have been among the \\"many relatively young, probably as yet unordained monks that composed the membership of the Roman missions.\\" He concluded that Augustine may only have ordained Jordan a priest or deacon after he had reached the age of 30 and that his missionary activities may have taken a more \\"folk-centered\\" character, lacking the kind of \\"political weight\\" and \\"central ecclesiastical acclaim\\" that would have ensured a mention in Bede. Higgins further explained the scarcity of historical information about Jordan's mission by pointing to the following factors: Jordan's isolated position \\"among the largely pagan West Saxons [and] politically suppressed Christian British folk\\", the fact that he may have died before the Synod of Whitby in 664, Bede's prejudices against the British Christians which Jordan would likely have served, and Bede's desire to emphasize the senior role of Birinus in converting the West of England. The historian Michael Hare, on the other hand, has suggested that Jordan was more plausibly a hermit of the 13th or 14th century who lived in a chapel on College Green. According to this view, Jordan was only later described as a companion of Augustine of Canterbury by the 15th-century hymn writer. In 1899, George Edward Weare suggested that Jordan may have been a close relative of Robert Fitzharding, the founder of St. Augustine's Abbey, and that the chapel named in his honour on College Green may have been built by him or \\"erected after his death as a memorial\\". Weare concluded that the monks of St. Augustine's Abbey must have transformed Jordan into a saint to increase the abbey's prestige. A. S. Ellis, a genealogical researcher of the Fitzharding and Berkeley families, supported this claim, arguing that Jordan, \\"brother of Robert fitz Harding ... may in his old age have been a canon in the adjoining abbey founded by his brother or [may] have built [the chapel on College Green] with a hermitage to retire from the world therein.\\" If Weare and Ellis's conclusions are correct, Jordan, like Robert Fitzharding, would be the son of Harding of Bristol and the grandson of Eadnoth the Staller, the Anglo-Saxon thegn and steward to Edward the Confessor. Little is known about this Jordan Fitzharding except that he \\"was one of the law-worthy men of Bristol's hundred court on one occasion between 1176 and 1183.\\" A. S. Ellis believed him to be the progenitor of the De La Warr family, a name Ellis thought he may have received as a result of living in \\"that street at Bristol called 'the Weir,' from its proximity to the dam of the mills on the river Frome immediately beneath the [Bristol] castle walls\\".  Veneration  Although antiquarians such as John Leland have traditionally wanted to date the origin of Jordan's cult to a time long before the building of Bristol's Norman-era cathedral, the earliest evidence for its existence can actually be found in the will of widow Agnes Spelly, who left a donation to the chapel of Saint Jordan on College Green in 1393. Later references to Jordan's cult can be found in financial record-keeping of St. Augustine's Abbey, Bristol: in the year 1491–92, funds were described as being taken \\"from the pyx within St. Jordan's chapel on the green\\" (). In the year 1511–12, offerings to Jordan were made in a side chapel of St. Augustine's Abbey. View of College Green, where the chapel of St. Jordan stood before the Reformation and where his relics were, according to a 15th-century hymn writer, entombed. According to M. R. James, a hymn and collect to Jordan, found in a Bristol Book of Hours, were used in the chapel on College Green in the 15th century. The hymn reads, in part, as follows: Based on the content of this hymn and its accompanying collect, David H. Higgins concluded: While the name Jordan had been popularized in England by pilgrims returning from the Holy Land with bottles of water from the Jordan River, Peter Fleming of the University of the West of England has described the relatively greater frequency of the name in 12th-century Bristol, especially among the noble Fitzharding and Berkeley families, as itself evidence of a significant cult of St. Jordan in the city: Fleming concluded that College Green in the 14th and 15th centuries was \\"the focus of the local cult of St. Jordan and the site of his chapel\\"; that \\"during Lent and Easter, the mayor and councillors would attend sermons preached by the cross next to St. Jordan's chapel\\"; and that \\"the Berkeleys had conceived a special devotion to the saint.\\" Samuel Seyer, the early-19th-century historian of Bristol, also supported the view that Jordan, brother of Robert Fitzharding, had been named after an earlier saint, but he firmly believed this saint had been a member of the Gregorian mission, writing, \\"Nothing is more probable than that the pious founder of the abbey [Robert Fitzharding] gave it its name in memory of St. Augustine; and that Harding, his father, named one of his sons Jordan, in memory of the preacher, Augustine's companion.\\" Despite these indications of the cult's presence in the city, Fleming concluded that the extent of Bristolians' veneration of Jordan remained unclear, partly because \\"his name is not known to have been attached to any other location in Bristol,\\" and \\"there is no reference to him in Ricart's Kalendar.\\" In other words, Jordan may always have been seen as a \\"specifically Berkeley, or north Bristol, saint\\" rather than \\"being regarded as... truly Bristolian.\\" Today, Bristol Cathedral displays an icon of St. Jordan in the Elder Lady Chapel. The icon was painted by Helen McIldowie-Jenkins. In 2012, the BBC, Bristol Cathedral, and the University of Bristol called Jordan \\"the patron saint of Bristol\\" and \\"Bristol's enigmatic 'patron saint.'\\"  Historicity  John Speed's 1610 map showing the former chapel of St. Jordan between Bristol Cathedral (A) and St. Mark's Church (C). In 2012, archaeologists began a survey at College Green in Bristol, with speculation on the part of the Dean of Bristol Cathedral, the Very Reverend David Hoyle, that Jordan's chapel and relics might be discovered. Although no evidence was found, the Bristol City Council website explains that \\"any archaeological evidence which might have confirmed the site of St Jordan's chapel was destroyed\\" when \\"College Green was levelled for the building of the Council House in 1950.\\" However, maps of Bristol from the 17th century by cartographers John Speed and James Millerd appear to show the location of St. Jordan's former chapel before it was destroyed. John Speed's map of 1610, in particular, corresponds to William Camden's description of the former chapel's location as a \\"green plain, shaded all along the middle with a double row of trees; among which is a pulpit of stone, and a Chapel, wherein they say, that Jordan, Companion to St. Austin the English Apostle, was bury’d.\\" Due to an absence of references to Jordan in important texts such as Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Michael Hare dismissed as fiction the description of Jordan as a companion of Augustine of Canterbury; instead, he claims he was probably a local saint of the late Middle Ages. Gwen Beachcroft and Arthur Sabin of the Bristol Record Society, on the other hand, claimed in 1938 that \\"the story of Saint Jordan, disciple of Saint Augustine, may have been invented to give an air of sanctity to what had been secular land [of the St. Augustine's Abbey sanctuary].\\"  References  English saints Anglo-Saxon saints West Saxon saints People from South West England People from Bristol Christianity in Anglo-Saxon England History of Bristol ","title":"Jordan of Bristol"},{"id":"58740358","text":"Eva-Maria Mandelkow is a German neuroscientist and Alzheimer's disease researcher at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Bonn.

Stage one of the inquiry, which began in May 2010 and concluded with closing submissions in February 2011, resulted in a report in 2014 which found Ngāpuhi never ceded their sovereignty when they signed the Treaty of Waitangi. While stage two of the inquiry, which began in March 2013, has involved weeks of hearings inquiring into the around 420 Treaty claims brought by hapu from Ngāpuhi, Ngati Wai, Ngati Hine, Patuharakeke, Ngati Rehua, Ngati Whatua and Ngati Manuhiri.  Claim  The Waitangi Tribunal, in Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry (Wai 1040) is in the process of considering the Māori and Crown understandings of He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga / The Declaration of Independence 1835 and Te Tiriti o Waitangi / the Treaty of Waitangi 1840. This aspect of the inquiry raises issues as to the nature of sovereignty and whether the Māori signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi intended to transfer sovereignty. The first stage of the report was released in November 2014, and found that hapu chiefs in Northland never agreed to give up their sovereignty when they signed the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Although the Crown intended to negotiate the transfer of sovereignty through the Treaty, the chiefs' understanding of the agreement was they were only ceding the power for the Crown to control Pākehā and protect Māori.  Decision  Tribunal manager Julie Tangaere said at the report's release to the Ngāpuhi claimants: > Your tupuna [ancestors] did not give away their mana at Waitangi, at > Waimate, at Mangungu. They did not cede their sovereignty. This is the truth > you have been waiting a long time to hear. In terms of mana motuhake He Whakaputanga, creating a Māori state and government in 1835 and/or Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and those who did not sign anything, thus maintaining mana motuhake. In relation to the former, a summary report (entitled ‘Ngāpuhi Speaks’) of evidence presented to the Waitangi Tribunal conclusively demonstrates that: # Ngāpuhi did not cede their sovereignty. # The Crown had recognised He Whakaputanga as a proclamation by the rangatira of their sovereignty over this country. # The treaty entered into by the rangatira and the Crown — Te Tiriti o Waitangi — followed on from He Whakaputanga, establishing the role of the British Crown with respect to Pākehā. # The treaty delegated to Queen Victoria’s governor the authority to exercise control over hitherto lawless Pākehā people in areas of hapū land allocated to the Queen. # The Crown’s English language document, referred to as the Treaty of Waitangi, was neither seen nor agreed to by Ngāpuhi and instead reflects the hidden wishes of British imperial power. The report drew together existing scholarship on the Declaration of Independence and the treaty, with the tribunal noting its report represented continuity rather than dramatic change in current treaty scholarship. The Tribunal asserted that, \\"Though Britain went into the Treaty negotiation intending to acquire sovereignty, and therefore the power to make and enforce law over both Maori and Pakeha, it did not explain this to the rangatira,\\"  Reaction  Te Tai Tokerau MP Kelvin Davis said there was a massive cheer at the presentation of the report in Waitangi, when the finding that rangatira who signed the treaty had not ceded sovereignty was read out. > The big thing for Ngāpuhi is that it affirms what Ngāpuhi always said, that > when we signed the treaty we didn't cede sovereignty. It's correcting the > historical narrative that's gone on since 1840. He called for calm and said it was time for \\"wise heads\\" to sit down and have a conversation about what the report meant for the country in 2014. It was not clear what the longer term ramifications would be. Professor Khyla Russell said the ruling was, > a pivotal turning point\\" and a victory for iwi. It does rewrite history in a > way Maori have been arguing since 1849 when the claim started.

At last, someone has taken a claim over > the wording and the Tribunal has made a ruling, a very brave ruling. In a brief statement responding to the report, Attorney-General and Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Chris Finlayson said: \\"There is no question that the Crown has sovereignty in New Zealand. This report doesn't change that fact.\\"  Non-signatory iwi and hapu  Ngati Tuwharetoa academic Hemopereki Simon outlined a case in 2017, using Ngati Tuwharetoa as a case study, for how hapu and iwi that did not sign the Treaty of Waitangi still maintain mana motuhake and how the sovereignty of the Crown could be considered questionable.

The album debuted at number 17 on the AIR charts and peaked at 11 the next week. Details Keyes was initially inspired to write the album after the death of his father in 2015. He said, \\"It started off that way but moved into an exploration of fathers in those poor neighbourhoods.\\" It ended up with the songs based on a family Keyes knew as child that lived in the James Cook housing commission flats in Waterloo in Sydney. \\"I thought I would write about the dad, because I was pissed off with narcissistic blokes where everything they do is fuelled by self-interest but every time it got to mentioning the kids I would start writing a song about them.\\" The main characters are father, wife-beater, and drug-dealer Jim Salmon; nervous mother Jenny; drug-using son Jimmy, and daughter Iris. They first appeared in the song \\"Queen of Everyone's Heart\\" [I remember your dad in his blue railway shirt, his arm with a snake tattoo/And your mum on Botany Road with her lips real big and her face all black and blue] from Keyes' 2010 album, Johnny Ray's Downtown. The first song depicts Jenny and Jim meeting. Keyes said, \\"It's pretty linear. You say the term concept album and you immediately think of Rick Wakeman and Richard Burton doing the narration. It's something I like to do. It's probably a good discipline for me. I like to come up with an idea of a theme and then create the songs to fit in it. There's a bigger picture there you can jump into if you want.\\" Keyes said the title of the record was, \\"a metaphor. I got it from the idea of salmon fighting their way upstream to survive. The cliches of life being a struggle.\\" The song, \\"Girl In The Crystal Cylinder Hoodie\\" was inspired by an incident in the laundries in the flats at Waterloo. He said, \\"I went out one Sunday afternoon and there was a boy and a girl, probably no older than 14, shooting heroin against the wall of one of them and I’ve got a basket full of clothes. The girl looked up at me, I looked at them, we had that moment where I was about to say something, she looked up at me and said 'don’t worry, we’ll clean our mess up when we’re finished'. \\"Man With The Coppertone Tan\\" makes reference to gangster Lenny McPherson and his contemporaries. Keyes said, \\"I used to go up to the Lansdowne Hotel after high school when I was about year 10. You could actually get into places under-age and they didn't really care and we'd all have a schooner each, me and my mates. There was a great jukebox there that had Elvis Costello's \\"(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea\\" and Buddy Holly's \\"Rave On\\" and I used to play it over and over again. At the bar would be Chris Flannery, Mr Rent-a-Kill. We didn't really grasp who he was until the publican explained we shouldn't be pissing him off by talking too loud or playing Elvis Costello too much.\\" After the \\"relatively muted\\" music on Keyes' previous album, Sunnyholt, Keyes wanted the new album to be more accessible. \\"You hear something on it that sounds a bit like Bob Dylan in the 60s, something like Dire Straits, something like XTC. The sort of music I loved when i was 17 or 18.\\" he said. Some critics felt \\"Ballad Of A Drunk Man's Car\\" sounded like a Bruce Springsteen song, but Keyes said he was trying to write something that sounded like Pat Benatar.

This was the first instance of a lawsuit against a therapist over implanted memories. It was also a first instance of a person who was not a patient bringing a malpractice suit in this field. Background Gary Ramona was a vice president for worldwide marketing of Robert Mondavi Winery and made an annual salary of $400,000, and was married to Stephanie Ramona. Daughter Holly Ramona, a student at the University of California, Irvine, had experienced bulimia and depression and sought treatment in the beginning of 1990. From 1989 to 1990 she was treated at Western Medical Center in Anaheim, California. Marche Isabella, a counselor for children, families, and marriages, told Holly and Stephanie that bulimia was usually caused by incest. Isabella stated that sexual abuse affected 60-70% of her patients experiencing eating disorders. Isabella had not received much training in the eating disorder realm although initial reports stated that this was her specialty. Western Medical chief of psychiatry Richard Rose also treated Holly Ramona. Holly, at this point believing her father raped her, agreed to take sodium amytal, administered by Rose, which was meant to recover memories. Holly Ramona confronted her father at a March 15, 1990 meeting at Western Medical, in which her mother was also present. She accused Gary of raping her from the time when she was 5 until when she was 18, and that these memories were triggered when her father looked at her in a sexually-charged way during a Christmas 1989 visit to their house. Gary's wife Stephanie divorced him, and he lost his family and job. Isabella moved to Virginia and continued her career there, while Rose moved to Hawaii and stopped practicing psychiatry. Holly Ramona entered a master's program in clinical psychology at Pepperdine University. Lawsuit In Napa County Superior Court, Gary Ramona, represented by lawyer Richard Harrington, sued Western Medical, Rose, and Isabella, stating that the parties gave his daughter false memories and that the alleged sexual abuse never occurred. He asked for $8,000,000 for wages he would have earned if he had not lost his job and general damages. Lenore Terr, an advocate of recovered memories, served as the chief witness of the defense. Terr was cross-examined on whether Holly Ramona's flashbacks of abuse were accurate, and she stated that the one in which Holly gave a dog oral sex was not accurate. During the trial, Harrison Pope, a Harvard University employee known as being an expert on bulimia, stated that bulimia was not influenced by one being sexually assaulted as a child. In 1994 the jury voted 10-2 against the defendants, and awarded Ramona $500,000, with half corresponding to damages faced in the future and the other half for wages not being earned. Stephanie Ramona stated that she continued to believe the therapists and her daughter. Jury foreman Thomas Dudum stated that he disliked how Ramona perceived the verdict as a victory and that the jury intended \\"to make it clear that we did not believe, as Gary indicates, that these therapists gave Holly a wonder drug and implanted these memories.\\" B. Drummond Ayres Jr. of The New York Times stated that the decision bolstered critics against the repressed memory theory.

History   Description  Fossil collection The fossil collection is assessed as State Significance. Fossils by their nature are unique and irreplaceable; unlike extant organisms, they can not be replaced. The fossil collections of the Geological Survey of NSW comprise subsets of # larger specimens still in rock matrix, # microfossils prepared from the matrix, and # thin sections prepared for microscope examination. These are not only a unique record of the geological history of the state, but also form the database on which are founded many hundreds of scientific publications and internal reports of this Department. The form the evidence upon which the conclusions of those reports and publications are made, and, being irreplaceable, need to be retained as documentation as necessary as the reports themselves, available for subsequent examination in the light of new ideas or information. Many of the specimens are the reference points on which plant and animal fossil taxa are based 9 type specimen: holotypes, paratypes etc.), the proper preservation of which forms a requirement of both the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) and its Botanical counterpart (ICBN). The collections are documented in hard-copy catalogues and to some extent in digital databases. The major collection of larger specimens (item a) numbers close to 40,000 specimens; the remainder amount to approximately an additional 10,000, cardboard slides. In addition to their scientific value, many of them are of display quality. The collections form a reference point for stratigraphy and paleontology in New South Wales. They are also a source of information for researchers throughout the world. Petrology collection The Petrology Collection contains 70,000 rocks and thin sections. It was started in the 1870s as two separate collections, one with 9,000 rocks and the other with 43000 thin sections. Hand written catalogues exist for each. After 1912, only one collection was continued up to the present day. The two old subcollections have much more significance than their sizes would indicate, because much of the material comes from old mine sites, and many of these are no longer available for sampling. Furthermore, a few samples, have world significance, such as the thin section from the very sample of Copeton dolerite containing diamond. Many samples in the recent part of the Petrology collection are either irreplaceable or extremely expensive to replace, such as the samples from the Snowy Mountain tunnels or the samples from drill holes. Hand written catalogues from the older parts of the collection are no longer used much because the information has been captured into the ROCKS database. However the old and newer parts of the collection are stored together and are frequently accessed on a day-to-day basis. There is a potential heritage value for parts of the Petrology Collections and Catalogues. The historical Catalogues could be archived without hampering use of the collection. The historic parts of the collection are used routinely now and must remain open to supervised access.

Kurth Kiln was established by the Forests Commission Victoria in 1941 on a site about 7 km north of Gembrook on the Tomahawk Creek.Catrice, Daniel. A processing industry in the forest: Kurth Kiln . Historic Environment, Vol. 14, No. 1, 1998: 4-9 Dr Ernest Edgar Kurth from the University of Tasmania was commissioned to design the kiln with the aim of mass-producing charcoal as an alternative fuel in the response to war-time petrol rationing. Gembrook was selected as the ideal site for the Kurth Kiln because it fully met three essential criteria required for successful operation; # Water - the kiln required 2000 gallons (9,100 litres) of water per day in order for its cooling systems to be effective. # Wood - the kiln burnt about 28 cords (~100 cubic metres) of wood per week. # Gradient - sloping land enabled easier top loading of wood into the kiln. Dr Kurth was paid £5 for the use of his patented design (No 2563/41) and the total cost of establishing the kiln was 1,799 pounds 17 shillings and 2 pence. The kiln commenced operation in March 1942 but transport difficulties combined with an oversupply of charcoal from private operators meant the kiln was used only intermittently during 1943 and was shut down soon after. Over the period of its operation, Kurth Kiln produced only 471 tons of charcoal which represented a tiny fraction of Victoria’s total production.Forests Commission Victoria - Annual reports  Petrol rationing  Petrol ration tickets five-gallon, 1940-1945. Source: Museum Victoria. Australia’s declaration of War on 2 September 1939 immediately raised concerns about the security of petrol supplies. At the time Australia was totally reliant on imported fuel and had a limited storage capacity. At the start of the war, the country had sufficient petrol for only three months supply and by May 1940 the Commonwealth Oil Board estimated that only 67 per cent of the total capacity of about 140 million gallons was on-hand.Petrol rationing in Australia during the Second World War. AWM. Issue 36. The Federal Government considered increasing the price of fuel to dampen demand. Another plan was that petrol should be merchandised in two colours, blue for commercial vehicles, and red for private cars, with red petrol being substantially more expensive than blue. The motoring industry and newspapers resisted the changes. When France collapsed, the Minister for Supply stressed to Cabinet that continuity of the already erratic deliveries was under threat, and on 6 June 1940 Cabinet finally made the decision that rationing should be introduced to reduce consumption by 50 per cent. Political expediency came into play and petrol rationing was introduced in September 1940 and restrictions were tightened as the War progressed. On 17 June 1941 the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies announced further restrictions to motorists limiting them to two gallons per month which were enough for 1,000 miles per year so many simply put their cars up on blocks for the duration and switched to public transport or walked. The scheme finally devised for petrol rationing coupons was complicated, and the paperwork was profuse. Drivers had to apply for a petrol licence, from which they were allocated ration tickets based on an assessment of their needs. Forests Commission firefighting vehicles were exempt from the petrol restrictions. District Foresters were authorised to issue petrol coupons for timber industry trucks, which, in the absence of private cars and utes, often served as family transport too. Country school buses were fitted with gas converters and on declared days of Acute Fire Danger they were banned. Some of Melbourne's buses also ran on charcoal. Petrol rationing was not strictly enforced until 1942 but remained in place until February 1950.  Charcoal as a replacement fuel  alt= During the first half of the twentieth century charcoal production in Victoria was small and employed relatively few people. The charcoal was supplied to blacksmiths, coal depots, gas works and some powerhouses. The main areas of State forest producing charcoal were in a broad arc across Central Victoria at places like Beaufort, Trentham, Lionville, Macedon, Broadford, the Dandenongs and Gembrook. Charcoal was also produced in East Gippsland, mainly at Nowa Nowa. The best trees were durable species like red ironbark (Eucalyptus sideroxylon), red box (E. polyanthemos), grey box (E. microcarpa), yellow box (E. mellidora), red gum (E. camadulensis) and for lighter grades of charcoal, yellow stringybark (E. meullerana).Catrice, Daniel (June 1996). History of forest activities in the Central Highlands and East Gippsland. Historic Places Section, DNRE. The charcoal was produced by slow and controlled burning of wood in earthen, brick or metal kilns. The simplest method was the \\"beehive kiln\\" where wood was stacked vertically into a conical heap to allow air and smoke movement and then covered with a layer of sticks and twigs. The stack was then covered further with a thick layer of earth and ash. Once the stack was alight the small chimney opening at the top was sealed. It then required constant tending to ensure no air entered the stack and took about three days to reduce the wood to charcoal. Large beehive kilns each contained about 50 cords of wood and were very labour intensive. They also produced charcoal of uneven consistency with a high ash content and some inevitable soil contamination. Other charcoal producers opted for lined pits in the ground, steel chambers or recycled boilers. With the urging of the Federal Government charcoal quickly emerged as a substitute fuel in response to the national petrol rationing. A special vehicle-mounted unit which converted charcoal into flammable gases (principally carbon monoxide and hydrogen) was known to be suitable to power internal combustion engines. Charcoal was relatively simple to produce but had a well-deserved reputation for being inconvenient to use for short trips, inefficient, under powered, dirty, belching black smoke, catching fire and occasionally exploding.Producer gas and the Australian motorists. Don Bartlett 2008. Engineering Heritage Victoria. http://consuleng.com.au/Producer%20Gas%20&%20the%20Aussie%20Motorist%201939-45.pdf Also, the cost of installation of a heavy and cumbersome producer gas kit was about £100, or the equivalent of 16 times the average weekly wage, and a bag of charcoal lasted between 30 and 60 miles at a cost between 6 and 10 shillings. Charcoal had a cost advantage over petrol and tests earlier in 1938-39 indicated savings in the order 80% for truck operations for producer gas compared to the cost of petrol. At the time, a new car, if you could get one, cost around £250 for a small Austin and £525 for a large Buick. Over the war-years, some 56,000 gas producer units of varying design were fitted to private and commercial vehicles in Australia. This low conversion rate to producer gas technology represented less than 6.5% of all vehicles on the road by 1944. The overall consumption of charcoal in Victoria rose thirtyfold from about 110 tons per month before the War to over 3300 tons by mid-1942. This massive increase required nearly 280,000 tones of dry wood annually to feed the hundreds of kilns set up across State forests, as well as on private land, at a time when labour was critically short.  Forests Commission Victoria  The task of ensuring adequate supplies of charcoal fell to the Forests Commission Victoria (FCV). It subsequently formed the State Charcoal Branch to organise the increased production of charcoal, to build up reserves to meet emergencies and to regulate the cost to consumers. The assistance of an expert Advisory Panel, representing charcoal producers, manufacturers and distributors of vehicle gas equipment, the Department of Supply and Development, and the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, was enlisted under the Chairman of the Forests Commission, Alfred Vernon Galbraith. Preliminary arrangements were made for bag supplies, for railway sidings in Melbourne, and for processing of charcoal bought by the Branch in excess of the requirements of private grading firms. In its first year, 17,421 tons of charcoal were produced compared with 1,650 tons before the War. Production peaked at 38,922 tons in 1942-43. The Commission had the added responsibility of providing emergency firewood to Melbourne for heating and cooking purposes as a result of reductions in the supply of coal, electricity and gas. The Emergency Firewood Project continued long after the war ended and over the period from 1941 to 1954, nearly 2 million tons of firewood was produced. An estimated 221 kilns and 12 pits were producing charcoal by the middle of 1942. Some of the labour was provided by Italian wartime internees. There were also over 600 commercial kilns operating mostly on private property. At least 50 to 60 private charcoal retorts were set up in the Barmah forest alone. The majority of the kilns were metal retorts because charcoal from earthen beehive kilns or unlined pits proved unsuitable for motor vehicles, causing gumming of engine valves and the controls in the gas lines due to the condensation of tar. The Chairman of the Forests Commission, Alfred Vernon Galbraith became aware of experiments by Dr Ernest Kurth, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Tasmania who had been experimenting with the pyrolysis of wood and kiln designs since 1940. His work led to a quarter-size prototype kiln at Dover, Tasmania in March 1941. A second operational kiln was built at a sawmill near Launceston in January 1942. In July 1941, Professor Kurth provided details of his kiln design and nine pages of handwritten notes on its operation to Galbraith which marked the beginning of the project at Gembrook. The kiln was unusual in that it could operate continually with the top loading of wood billets and bottom recovery of charcoal. A water-cooled grate at the bottom of the stack caused the brittle charred wood to crumble under its own weight into manageable pieces, while at the same time maintaining the charring temperature at the critical point to produce a consistent quality charcoal. Not only was this process said to be 50% faster than any other method then in use, but it was also 10-15% more efficient. So cooled charcoal was raked out the bottom as more wood was added into the top. Tests in Tasmania indicated that the prototype could produce about 1.4 tons of charcoal per day which compared favourably with a single ton every three days from a standard steel kiln. Seven tons of wood produced one ton of charcoal with an output of 20 tons per week if the kiln was operated continuously with three shifts per day. The cost of building the kiln was estimated to be about half that required for five or six portable steel kilns needed to produce the same quantity. Good quality charcoal sold for 4s 6d for a 50 lb bag. The claimed advantages could not be ignored by an organisation under pressure to secure Victoria's war-time charcoal supplies, so Galbraith enclosed £5 to Professor Kurth in a letter on 16 July 1941 for the use of his patented design.

The selection of the suitable site on State forest for Professor Kurth's kiln depended on adequate supplies of water, wood, and gradient. Firstly, the kiln needed approximately 2000 gallons (9100 litres) per day for its cooling system, secondly, it needed about 28 cords (100 cubic metres) of wood per week as feedstock, and thirdly a slope of approximately 18 feet (6 metres) was required to facilitate top loading. The site chosen at Tomahawk Creek about 7 km north of Gembrook met all these requirements. Water was supplied by an old mining race from the Tomahawk Creek which also powered a water wheel operating a vibrating screen to grade the charcoal before bagging. Much of the Gembrook landscape had been cleared for agriculture, supported a thriving timber industry and also mined for gold and gemstones since 1859 so most of the older mature forest had been disturbed in some way. More importantly, a large area of older and damaged messmate trees (Eucalyptus obliqua) in the nearby State forest had been deliberately ringbarked as a silvicultural treatment to encourage new regeneration growth by Forests Commission unemployment relief workers some 10 years earlier during the 1930s depression. Approximately 145 men had worked over nearly 4000 acres during 1930-31. This left a large amount of standing dry wood suitable for the kilns operation within a one-mile radius. Access to roads and the railway station at Gembrook for transport was an important consideration. There was also a critical shortage of labour to operate the kiln during the war years which was exacerbated by a major timber salvage program underway in the Central Highlands after the deadly 1939 Black Friday bushfires. Although the site at Gembrook had not been severely burnt in either 1926 or 1939. Earth works commenced in late August 1941. A construction contract for the kiln was awarded to builders Stanley and Nance of Middle Park on 17 October and the detailed design work was done by the Forests Commission’s own architect, Mr S. J. B. Hart. Building commenced in November and by 18 December 1941 was nearly completed. The architect reported on 11 February 1942 to the Secretary of the Forests Commission that the kiln was ready for operations after a small trial run.Kurth Kiln, Heritage Action Plan February 2002 Gary Vines & David Wixted heritage ALLIANCE http://auklanddrive.org/Kurth%20Kiln/Storage/Kurth%20Kiln%20HAP.htm The project cost £1799 17s 2d which included the establishment of the site, construction of the kiln, erection of buildings, purchase of equipment, the connection of telephone and supply of water.

Production was suspended to clear the backlog. Source: Friends of Kurth Kiln. The kiln was a rectangular structure 4m x 3.5m x 8m high on a concrete foundation and the red brick walls were reinforced with iron strapping. The kiln held 25 tons of 3-feet-long billets per load which were carried up on a small inclined tramway to be loaded into the top.Kurth Kiln Picnic Ground. Brochure produced by the Forests Commission Victoria. Circa 1978. The initial firing was on 18 March 1942 and after some initial teething problems with the steel doors the kiln was in full production by mid-1942. Combustion took two days to complete and kiln produced 243 tons of charcoal for its first financial year 1941-42. But in the latter half of the year, this reduced to only 29 tons. Production by July 1942 had been so successful that that problems of storage soon became apparent. Commissioner Finton George Gerraty reported that about 70 tons of graded charcoal was stockpiled and the storage sheds were taxed to the limit. Production was suspended to solve this short-term problem. However, at the same time the kiln suffered further structural problems. An inspection in September 1942 indicated that major repairs were required to some loosening brickwork near the inspection doors and this together with the emerging oversupply of charcoal raised serious questions about Kurth Kilns future. Continuing transport and distribution difficulties from Gembrook combined with an oversupply of charcoal from private operators meant the kiln was used only intermittently during 1943 and was shut down soon after. Petrol rationing also eased at the end of the War reducing the demand for charcoal but didn't end until 1950. Over the total period of its operation, Kurth Kiln produced 471 tons of charcoal which represented only a tiny fraction of Victoria’s total production. But Kurth Kiln was a victim of circumstance and not the \\"white elephant\\" that these low production figures might suggest.  Forest workers camp  After the cessation of war hostilities, the Kallista District of the Forests Commission advised in February 1946, that they could absorb 40 returned servicemen for silvicultural, afforestation, fire protection, and utilisation works. This was part of a five-year statewide plan drawn up and approved by the Allied Works Council with funding allocated for the first two- year period totalling £3,842,175. Similar camps were established on State forest to house and employ migrants and refugees from war-torn Europe. To provide accommodation, eighteen masonite huts were purchased from the Army and erected at the site. By July 1946 the Commission decided to make Kurth Kiln its main base camp for the region to house 80 to 100 men. The forest camp operated continuously until 8 January 1963 when three huts were burnt by bushfires. The remaining buildings began to slowly deteriorate and construction of an all-weather road network meant workmen could be housed at nearby townships instead. The site declined through to the 1970s. Three huts were demolished and the material used to modify a remaining one as a caretaker’s residence in about 1984 for Ron Thornton who lived on-site for another 16 years. The sheds were then mainly used as storage of eucalyptus seed needed for regeneration works and for Forests Commission equipment such and pumps and hoses. The small dam next to the kiln was regularly used to as a pump school to prepare staff for the summer fire season. Kurth kiln began its transformation into a picnic ground in about 1978 led by District Forester Frank May with works supervised by two local overseers Tom Steege and Bob Ferris. The site is now registered as historical and scientific significance with Kurth Kiln being included as an indicative place on the Register of the National Estate (004495) as well as being listed in the Heritage Inventory of archaeological sites maintained by Heritage Victoria (H8022-0013). Remnants of a historic steel charcoal kiln can also still be found at nearby Tonimbuk and another at Kinglake West. Parks Victoria is now responsible for Kurth Kiln and has undertaken conservation works on several of the most urgent building repairs. A small and active volunteer friends group formed in June 1999 which helps to protect and interpret the site.  Gallery  File:Kurth Kiln late 1941.png|Early stages of construction. November 1941.

Early life  Wakefield was brought up in Accrington, Lancashire. Wakefield struggled with undiagnosed dyslexia throughout her childhood and early academic career. At the age of 13, she decided to become a professional painter after successfully rendering Vincent Van Gogh’s The Sunflowers. She studied a B-Tech National Diploma in Art at Blackburn College before completing a Bachelor of Arts Degree at the University of Central Lancashire. The University recognised Wakefield’s dyslexia and she was granted support and assistive technology. Throughout her university years, Wakefield supported herself through freelance graphic design work.  Career  Wakefield uses acrylics and diluted acrylics in a style heavily influenced by film noir and the work of American realist Edward Hopper. Her first collection depicted the urban landscape of her hometown, Accrington, Lancashire. Since then her work has documented urban landscapes throughout modern Britain during an era of urban regeneration. The contrast between the old and the new is conveyed by the juxtaposition between her abstract arrangements and calming expressionism. Wakefield’s early work depicted British cities and the people who live in them with a sense of voyeuristic detachment. In 2012 she transposed this method of interpretation to the topic of New York. The result was her New York Series which depicted the iconic New York imagery and conveyed the lives of the city’s inhabitants in a distant emotionally detached way. The collection showed a departure from the impressionism of her earlier works and a move towards proportional realism. The subject matter itself exuded a cinematic quality not seen in her previous works. The artist attributed this more worldly and considered approach to becoming a mother. She also claims her dyslexia has had a profound impact on how she perceives the world and arranges her compositions. The same year (2012), her painting No.19 from the New York Series, appeared on the cover of British art magazine: Art of England. The cover caught the attention of British film director Danny Boyle and was chosen by Fox Searchlight Pictures to appear in Boyle’s 2013 movie, Trance. In recent years her paintings have been commissioned by British media executive Greg Dyke and Stonyhurst College. Stonyhurst presented Wakefield’s painting of the college to HRH Princess Anne. Today influential art collectors and critics such as Ian Welland and David Latham regard her as one of Britain’s foremost contemporary urban landscape painters.

The author believed that Holly Ramona, who genuinely believed what she stated, was not experiencing genuine recovered memories. According to Kirkus Reviews, the book portrays Gary Ramona \\"as not the best of fathers, but no rapist\\" and his ex- wife Stephanie Ramona \\"as a weak-willed trophy wife whose long-brewing anger at Gary found its expression\\" in her daughter's charges against her now ex- husband. \\\\- Posted online on May 20, 2010. Ann Rule of the Washington Post stated that the book \\"is packed with close-up views of both charlatans and true experts in the field of human memory\\". The title is a reference to the Salem witchcraft trials. Reception Vivian Dent, a San Francisco psychologist writing for The New York Times, stated that the book \\"stands as a reminder of how much in life resists understanding -- and as a caution against reaching too quickly for explanations that make only intuitive sense.\\" According to Dent, the author \\"avoids the virulent righteousness\\" in the false memory debate. Kirkus Reviews stated that it was \\"a frightening look into what happens when pop psychology is mistaken for therapy, and when the dubious fruits of that therapy are mistaken for truth.\\" It added that the book \\"is a bit thin on some of the legal context for this case.\\" Rule stated that \\"Spectral Evidence is an important work.\\" Publishers Weekly stated that the book is \\"a gripping and well-researched account of a grim chapter in both scientific and family politics.\\" Jonathan Kirsch of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the book \\"tells the tale of a doomed family whose badges of success--[...]--concealed a cluster of profoundly dysfunctional relationships that collapsed under the weight of the secrets that they tried to keep from each other and the world around them.\\" Kirsch argued that the \\"not entirely neutral\\" book, which does state that the truth will never be known with certainty, takes the point of view that the accusations were not true; Kirsch praised the book for using the points of view of Gary Ramona and of the people accusing him. Marya Grambs of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that the book is \\"a well-researched and dramatic account of a confusing subject and its intensely emotional contradictions\\" and \\"ably reveals the palpable anguish of the family and shows how intense feelings rippled outward\\" but that it had bias toward Gary Ramona.

Career  Born in Radeberg, Fischer studied with in Dresden. His directing debut took place in Radebeul with Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail. From 1950 to 1960, Fischer worked as an assistant and director at the Dresden State Opera. From 1960 to 1965 he worked under the opera director as chief conductor and artistic director of the Kleiner Haus an der Oper Leipzig; here he set up productions of Fidelio, Aida, Tannhäuser and Nabucco. In 1965 he changed as head director, from 1969 as \\"chief director\\" to the Staatsoper Unter den Linden Berlin. Here he was also director of rarities like The Golden Cockerel, The Nose, Katerina Ismaelova (Stalinist version of the Lady Macbeth von Mzensk), The Devils of Loudun, Les vêpres siciliennes and Hans Pfitzner's Palestrina (with Peter Schreier in the title role). Among the world premieres he staged were Alan Bush's Joe Hill, Günter Kochan's ' and 's Meister Röckle. Fischer's appointment as chief director of the Staatsoper by its chief, the harpsichordist Hans Pischner, proved to be far-sighted, as Fischer represented a moderate opposite pole to the music theatre style of the Komische Oper Berlin, which was influenced by Walter Felsenstein, and yet, as a former comrade-in-arms of directors such as Joachim Herz, he brought both classics and world premieres to success with his skilful directing. Fischer has also been invited as director in the Grand Theatre, Warsaw, the Bolshoi Theatre, Geneva and in various theatres in West Germany, Switzerland and Sweden. He was also (successively) a lecturer and later head of department at the music colleges of the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig, the Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria von Weber in Dresden and the Hochschule für Musik Hanns Eisler in Berlin.

Lantau Tomorrow Vision () is a development project in Hong Kong launched by Chief Executive Carrie Lam in her 2018 policy address which includes the creation of a third core business district by constructing artificial islands with a total area of about 1,700 hectares through massive land reclamation near Kau Yi Chau and Hei Ling Chau of the eastern waters of Lantau Island. The project has met with controversy and opposition for its high cost of estimated HK$500 billion (US$63.8 billion) – amounting to half of the city's fiscal reserves, as well as environmental concerns. Background Land reclamation in Hong Kong: Grey (built), Red (proposed or under development). The large, roughly central red area is the section earmarked for the project. The idea of the massive reclamation in the eastern waters off Lantau Island was suggested by Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying's policy address in January 2014, where he proposed the strategic studies on artificial islands in central waters for the development of the East Lantau Metropolis (ELM) for long-term land supply. In 2016, the government published the Hong Kong 2030 Plus project suggesting the development of an East Lantau Metropolis by reclamations in the waters near Kau Yi Chau and the Hei Ling Chau with a capacity of accommodating population of about 400,000 to 700,000 and creating employment of about 200,000. The Sustainable Lantau Blueprint of 2017 and the Task Force on Land Supply adopted the ELM project, in which the Task Force listed it as one of the 18 options in the five-month public consultation in 2018. During the public consultation of the Task Force on Land Supply, the think tank led by former Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, Our Hong Kong Foundation, proposed a research report on 7 August 2018 titled \\"Re-imagining Hong Kong with a Game-Changer: Enhanced East Lantau Metropolis\\" of reclaiming 2,200 hectares in the eastern waters off Lantau in 14 years of time which would house 1.1 million people that would solve Hong Kong's land shortage problems. It came after Chief Executive Carrie Lam signaled her support for land reclamation when she said he was confident \\"that reclamation outside Victoria Harbour is the way to go, adding that she hopes the task force will also come to that conclusion.\\" Content Carrie Lam proposed Lantau Tomorrow Vision in her second policy address in October 2018. On 10 October 2018, Carrie Lam's second policy address laid out the \\"Lantau Tomorrow Vision\\" which included the 1,700-hectare reclamation project which would provide between 260,000 and 400,000 homes to 700,000 to 1.1 million people, of which 70 per cent of the homes would be public housing. The reclamation project would create artificial islands near Kau Yi Chau and Hei Ling Chau of the waters of East Lantau. The reclamation would be consisting of the construction of artificial islands In the pamphlet, the project also suggested expanding the infrastructure capacity to support Lantau's role as a \\"double gateway\\" to the world and Yuegang'ao Greater Bay Area, including road and rail connecting the artificial islands and Hong Kong Island and Sunny Bay. The project, almost double the size of its original proposal, would be the largest and most expensive to date, with a predicted cost of between HK$400 billion and HK$500 billion (US$64 billion). The project also suggested setting up a $1 billion Lantau Conservation Fund to promote and carry out conservation projects on Lantau. Concerns The Lantau Tomorrow Vision met fierce opposition immediately after its publication. Roy Tam Hoi-pong of the environmental group Green Sense, expressed his worry that the project would drain the city's coffers, estimating it could cost up to HK$1 trillion (US$128.2 billion), almost all of Hong Kong's fiscal reserves. Former Hong Kong Observatory director Lam Chiu-ying warned that the reclaimed area would be vulnerable to rising sea levels and extreme weather due to climate change. Carrie Lam's announcement of the project was also criticised for pre-empting a report from the Task Force on Land Supply, which carried out five months of public consultations and was supposed to advise the government on the best ways to deal with the land shortage, as the project only came barely two weeks after the public consultations and before the publication of its final report. It was also accused of being a gift to private businesses to enable them to make gigantic profits, as a similar proposal by Tung Chee-hwa's Our Hong Kong Foundation was consisting of governors and supporters represent the major developers and powerful insiders including New World, Henderson, Hang Lung, Sino Group, Shui On, Shimao, Shun Tak, Fung Group, Lan Kwai Fong Group, Arthur Li, Elsie Leung, and Bernard Chan.

Back and forth, the players hit a soccer ball with any part of the body except arms and hands. Teqball can be played between two players as a singles game, or between four players as a doubles game. The game is represented at an international level by the International Federation of Teqball (FITEQ). A number of world-class footballers have been attracted by the game, and after being added to the programmes for the 2021 Asian Beach Games and the African Beach Games, the sport is now aiming for Olympic inclusion. History Teqball was invented in 2012 in Hungary by three football enthusiasts, former professional player Gábor Borsányi, Hungarian businessman György Gattyán and computer scientist Viktor Huszár. Teqball table The curved teqball table is unique to teqball. It measures in length and is wide with the highest point at in the middle of the playing surface where the net is installed separating the surface into two parts. The two outer edges of the width are above the ground. Rules Main rules of teqball: * Teqball can be played with balls used in football, with size five being official and recommended. * Teqball can be played by two players (singles game) or by four players (doubles game). * A teqball match consists of best-of-three sets. * Each set is played until a player/team reaches 12 points. * Every player/team has two attempts to complete a successful service. * The players/teams change service after each four points. * It is forbidden to touch the ball with the same body part twice consecutively. * It is forbidden to return the ball with the same body part twice consecutively. * Every player/team is allowed to return the ball with a maximum of 3 touches by any body part, except for the hands and arms. * In doubles, a team has a maximum of 3 touches, however, the teammates must pass the ball at least once to each other. * While playing, neither the table nor the opponent can be touched. * In case of an edgeball, the rally shall be repeated. Intellectual property Unlike equipment in traditional sports, the design of the teqball table is patented, so only Teqball International or others with a license from Teqball Holding SARL may legally manufacture tables. The name \\"teqball\\" itself is trademarked, giving the trademark holder control over who may advertise teqball events or otherwise use the name in public. The teqball inventors view these legal restrictions as essential to their efforts to grow the sport. Competitions Teqball World Championships The Teqball World Championships is an annual competition organised by FITEQ. The Teqball World Championships has both Singles and Doubles competitions with men and women participating together. The first Teqball World Championships was held in Budapest, Hungary in 2017 with more than 20 participating nations. The 2018 version of the event was held on October 12–13 in Reims, France with a total of 90 players participating. The 2019 Teqball World Championships played from 6 to 8 December in Budapest. Around 160 athletes representing 58 countries competed across singles, doubles and mixed doubles events. Asian Beach Games As a sport that is officially recognised by the Olympic Council of Asia, teqball was added to the programme for the Sanya 2020 Asian Beach Games, which was postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19. African Beach Games Teqball was included in the first African Beach Games in Sal, Cape Verde on 14–23 July 2019. Cameroon won the title by beating Nigeria in the final.

It covers an area of around . The MCZ contains two marine Sites of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCIs) - Kingmere Rocks, off Littlehampton, and the Worthing Lumps, off of Worthing. Kingmere Rocks are one of the best-known spawning sites for the black seabream. Kingmere may also be the most important for sea bream in the UK. The rocky habitats and chalk outcrops provide ideal nesting grounds. Lying some three miles off the coast of Worthing, the Worthing Lumps are a series of underwater chalk cliff faces, up to three metres high. The lumps have been described as \\"one of the best chalk reefs in Europe\\" by the Marine Conservation Society. The Kingmere MCZ site is within the jurisdiction of the Sussex Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority (Sussex IFCA) for fisheries management. The site is mainly fished by vessels based on the Sussex coast in Selsey, Shoreham-by-Sea, Newhaven and Littlehampton. The main commercial fishery is potting, followed by netting and trawling. Most vessels fishing in the site are small static gear boats under 10 metres. Fauna Kingmere Rocks is one of the most important sites for the breeding of black sea bream. Male black sea bream search for suitable parts of the sea bed on which to spawn and then use their tails to create nests within the sediment that lies over the rock. Female sea bream then lay eggs in the nest which is watched over by the males until the eggs hatch. The juvenile sea bream then remain in the area of the nest for some time. Because of their delicate spawning bahviour, black sea bream are vulnerable to fishing practices like scallop-dredging that churn up the sea bed. The Worthing Lumps is home to the first and only location for Baillon's wrasse in Sussex, a fish normally found in the British Isles off the coast of Dorset and Galway in Ireland. The Worthing Lumps are home to other rare fish such as blennies and the lesser spotted dogfish.

Since 2011, AtGames has produced and marketed the Atari-licensed dedicated home video game console series Atari Flashback under license from Atari, Inc.. They also produced ColecoVision and Intellivision Flashback consoles, and have worked with Sega on multiple different handhelds and retro consoles.  History  In August 2014, GameFly announced through a statement on its website, that AtGames had acquired its online games distribution service. AtGames relaunched this service under the name Direct2Drive in late 2014. In December 2014, it was announced that through one of its subsidiaries, Silver Lining Systems, AtGames had purchased the IP to Calxeda, is using the technology to build fabric interconnects for A1100-powered servers. In 2017, the company released the Sega Genesis Flashback, based on Sega’s Genesis console. It had wireless controllers and had a cartridge slot for the console’s game’s and slots for the console’s controllers. Upon release, it received largely negative reviews from critics and consumers alike. The units shipped with technical problems, with many reviewers finding fault with lag with controller inputs, numerous bugs and glitches, subpar animation quality, missing frames, and audio problems. As a result, Sega revoked their relationship with Atgames. In 2019, Bandai Namco Entertainment sued them for use of Ms. Pac-Man, false advertising and copyright infringement. In November 2019, United States District Court Judge Vince Chhabria denied Bandai Namco's request for a preliminary injunction. In a strongly-worded order, Judge Chhabria ruled that, \\"Bandai's likelihood of success on the merits is questionable at best,\\" and its \\"allegations of reputational harm fall somewhere between speculative and fanciful.\\" In August 2019, AtGames acquired the royalty interest owed to General Computer Corporation's (GCC) for Ms. Pac-Man.

Personal life MacPherson was born into a large family on 5 September 1922 in Glasgow. He received all of his tuition from his father Iain, who was an army piper during the First World War, and had been taught by John MacDougall Gillies. Iain injured his hand when Donald was aged 5 and rarely played his pipes after that, but gave Donald instruction in all aspects of bagpipe playing. Donald joined the Boys' Brigade pipe band at the age of 12. He entered his first solo competition at the age of 15, at the Cowal Highland Gathering, where he won both the Under 15 March, Strathspey and Reel and the Under 18 Piobaireachd. He also played in the Glasgow Shepherds pipe band under Archie MacPhedran. After leaving school he was an apprentice at the West of Scotland Engineering Company, but volunteered for the Royal Air Force when the Second World War broke out. Shortly before returning from training in Naples he was seriously injured in a vehicle crash, and never regained full mobility in his left arm. While stationed in Wiltshire he met his wife Gwen, with whom he had three daughters. He worked as an engineer and lived for several years outside Scotland, working at Barr and Stroud for many years, and also spending some time at Singer. At times when living outside Scotland he did not compete for several years, but was always able to return to the top level of competition within months. During one of these breaks he became an accomplished pianist. In 1971 he took up a permanent post at the College of Piping in Glasgow, where he was responsible for testing goods for sale and developing the programme of lessons and courses. He left that post after falling out with Seumas MacNeill, and from then on refused to play in front of MacNeill, so never competed in the Glenfiddich Championships. He was awarded the British Empire Medal in 1986 for his services to piping. He died on 21 April 2012 in Edinburgh. Musical career MacPherson was one of the most successful competitive solo pipers of all time. In 1948, at his first outing at the Argyllshire Gathering in Oban, he won the Gold Medal, and later the same day won the Clasp for former winners of the Gold Medal. In 1954, he won both the Gold Medal and the Clasp at the Northern Meeting in Inverness. Over his competitive career he accumulated fifteen first places in the Senior Piobaireachd event for former Gold Medal winners at Oban, nine first places in the Clasp competition at Inverness, and six first places in the Former Winners March, Strathspey & Reel event at Inverness. He also won the Bratach Gorm five times in three attempts. He retired from competitive playing after winning the Gold Medal at the Argyllshire Gathering at the age of 68, but continued to teach and adjudicate. Some of his students include Gold Medal winners Iain Speirs, Stuart Shedden and Douglas Murray. Macpherson was renowned for the quality of the bagpipe sound he produced. Until the early 1950s he played his father's pipes, but from then acquired from a colleague a set of 1936 R.G. Lawrie drones with a Robert Hardie chanter. He produced his own chanter reeds and developed tools for manipulating them. He was among the first solo competitors to use synthetic drone reeds. He composed at least 30 pieces of ceol beag (light music), but despite his competitive success he was not compelled to compose any pibroch.

It was designed by Francis Greenway with a later extension by James Barnet and built from 1821 to 1822 by William Cox. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups.Proudfoot, 1987 The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport.Nichols, 2010 Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. In 1794, the land on which the courthouse stands was first alienated for European purposes in a grant made by Francis Grose of thirty acres to Samuel Wilcox, who named it Wilcox Farm. It is likely that land clearance and agricultural activities as well as some building works took place during this period and during the subsequent of occupation. The farm was subsequently incorporated into a larger holding of 1500 acres known as Peninsula Farm. On 1 January 1810, Lachlan Macquarie replaced William Bligh as Governor of New South Wales. The colony prospered under his influence, implementing a significant public works program, completing 265 public buildings, establishing new public amenities and improving existing services such as roads. On 6 December 1810, he named five new towns in the Hawkesbury region - subsequently known as the Macquarie Towns - including Windsor. Following Macquarie's instigation, Windsor became a permanent township with streets, public buildings and a town square. The Windsor Court House was designed by the Colonial Architect Francis Greenway in 1821, in response to Governor Macquarie's request. It was intended to replace an original timber court house, and despite economic restrictions, Governor Macquarie had no intention to settle for a weatherboard structure. Instead he called upon Greenway to submit designs for a small but substantial brick building. The contract for its construction was awarded to William Cox in October 1821 for the sum of 1800 pounds, on the condition that the building be completed within fifteen months of the award of the contract. The court house was completed within the time specified using convict labour.Bridges, 1986 Macquarie's leadership was investigated by an enquiry into the colony's affairs and the Bigge Report concluded that a free and penal society could co- exist but with tighter controls on convict management. Governor Macquarie resigned and returned to England in 1822. Prior to departing the colony he visited the Hawkesbury with his successor Sir Thomas Brisbane. They inspected Francis Greenway's new St Matthew's Anglican Church as well as other public buildings in Windsor. The Hawkesbury inhabitants presented Macquarie with a public address which commended him on his administration. The residents requested Macquarie to sit for a portrait and flattered by the request, he agreed. The painting was completed in England and returned to Windsor and has hung in the Windsor Court House since the 1820s. Repairs carried out in the 1840s and 50s included the re-shingling of the roof and other building works. Alterations made by Barnet in 1870s and 1882. The last recorded additions were in 1890. In 1961 restoration, renovation and alterations were made plus new toilet accommodation. In 2000, Attorney-Generals' Department restored the fabric of the building, reversing earlier restoration work. The Courthouse had originally been cement rendered, but this had been removed in 1960, a move not beneficial to the building. The courthouse was threatened with closure in 2014 due to state cuts to court funding, but survived after community concern at the likely impact of Windsor residents having to travel to Penrith to attend court. The number of sitting days were reduced to ten per month from 2015, down from sixteen in 2014. In 2017, it received a $160,000 upgrade to install audio-visual link functionality.  Description  The Windsor Court House is one of the earliest surviving court house buildings in Australia. Designed in the Colonial Georgian style, it uses an adapted Palladian form with an enclosing front verandah entrance, a climatic adaptation. The building consists of one courtroom with front and back verandahs, ancillary rooms at each corner of the building and a late 19th century extension by Colonial Architect, James Barnet, in a garden setting. Classically inspired details include multi-panelled windows with flat sandstone lintels over. Other accommodation includes Sheriff's Office, community legal centre office, Chamber, interview room, legal room, legal profession room and a Mmagistrate's room. The Court House is constructed in face brick, with a sandstone base course and window headers. The roofs are clad in corrugated iron. The verandah is supported on timber posts. Interiors feature intact timber joinery and furniture. The courthouse also houses an impressive collection of moveable heritage, including furniture and fittings, ledgers and a rare celebrated portrait of Governor Macquarie commissioned on his departure from the colony in 1822 for seven guineas by grateful local residents in appreciation of his efforts for the area. The artist has been identified by the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland as most likely to have been Scottish artist Colvin Smith. It was restored for the bicentenary of Macquarie's arrival in the colony.Attorney-General's Department Press Release, 1/2/2010  Heritage listing  The Windsor Court House, a rare surviving Colonial Georgian public building that originally dates from the early 19th century. The building has a fine and impressive form which uses an adapted Palladian plan to suit the Australian climate. It is of considerable historical, social and aesthetic significance, as one of the earliest surviving Court House buildings in Australia. The court house was insisted upon by Governor Macquarie, designed by Francis Greenway (himself originally a convict) and built by William Cox using convict labour. It is a combination and the result of all the forces directly at play during the Australia's early development.Ellis, 1973; Pike, 1966 Windsor Court House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Windsor was the most prosperous and successful of the towns founded by Governor Macquarie. The Windsor Court House was commissioned in 1821 by Governor Macquarie to replace its, by then, dilapidated timber predecessor. In 1821 William Cox signed the contract, and agreed to build the court house within fifteen months from October of that year of a sum of 1,800 pounds under Greenway's supervision and using convict labour. In addition to its association with its designer, Francis Greenway, and its builder, William Cox, the court house represents the first steps in the prosperous growth and development of Windsor and the Hawkesbury region, and the efforts of Governor Macquarie to obtain the establishment of a modest but substantial brick court house despite the pressure to reduce government spending. Bridges, 1986; Baker, 1967 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Court House was commissioned by Governor Macquarie in 1821. It was designed by Francis Greenway, Colonial Architect, and appointed Civil Architect in 1816. Greenway also designed such buildings as the Hyde Park Barracks, Macquarie Lighthouse, the Parramatta Female Factory, St Matthew's Anglican Church in Windsor, St Luke's Anglican Church in Liverpool, and St James' Church and the Supreme Court in King Street Sydney.Pike, Ed., 1966 The Court House is also associated with William Cox, its builder, who was an energetic and self improving colonist and contributed much to the development of the settlement. He arrived in 1800 as an officer of the New South Wales Corps, took up farming and in 1810 was appointed a magistrate in the Hawkesbury district. He employed about 50 convicts in agricultural and manufacturing activities on his property near Windsor. He also undertook building contracts for the government and in 1814 supervised the construction of the first road across the Blue Mountains. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Windsor Court House is built in a simple Georgian style. The main room, the Court Room, is flanked front and back by stone flagged verandahs which form an essential part of the building's plain rectangular structure, and provide access to the ancillary rooms. The simplicity of the design is enhanced by the quality of the materials used - hand made sandstock bricks on a sandstone foundation. The windows and doorways have incised stone lintels and stone sills and recessed panels in the brickwork and the stone foundation. The interior is also simple with white walls and cedar panelling. The panelling behind the Magistrate's chair is embellished by a gilded coat of arms. The room is illuminated by light through high clerestory windows. Despite its simplicity in design, the most significant feature of this building is the adaptation by Greenway of his architectural skills and principles to suit the demands of an Australian climate. Greenway realised that architectural conditions in Australia, such as climate, building materials, and the lack of skilled professional labour and craftsmanship, were different from those in England and so he rearranged his design and thinking accordingly. With the exception of his Gothic designs, there is little or no decoration or ornament added to Greenway's designs. Everything in the design is a necessary part of the building.Ellis, 1973; Baker, 1967 The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. First commissioned in 1821 and completed within fifteen months, the Windsor Court House was built during politically and economically trying times (with pressure from England to reduce government spending) and amidst the turbulence of colonisation, the establishment of new settlements, a lack of skilled labour and other resources, and the unfamiliarity of a new and rather harsh climate. As such, the Windsor Court House is a symbol of the growth and successful development of Windsor as the most prosperous town established by Governor Macquarie and of the social, cultural and political forces of the early 1800s.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Thompson Square preserves the early colonial character of Windsor. The centre of Thompson Square is spoilt by a main road which slices diagonally through it and into a cutting, destroying the visual integrity of the space as was originally intended. The conservation area includes the following historic buildings: ;The Doctor's House - 1-3 Thompson Square In 1819 James Doyle leased a dwelling and tenement known as the Freemason's Arms on the site of the Doctor's House from Charles Beasley. The 1828 census states Doyle as an innkeeper at Windsor. In 1830 Doyle was licensed to sell wine at the house known as the \\"Lord Nelson\\" at Windsor Terrace. In 1831 Joseph Delandre is listed as the licensee of the \\"Lord Nelson\\". In 1837 Edward Coffey issued a notice stating that the 'Daniel O'Conner Hotel' at Windsor had opened for the reception of visitors. It adjoined the Kings Wharf, the premises formerly occupied by James Doyle. It has not been established that this was in fact the present Doctors House, though the building is certainly colonial in style.Proudfoot 1987:20 ;House & outbuildings - 5 Thompson Square ;Hawkesbury Museum - 7 Thompson Square The land on which this building stands was part of grant of 12 ha to William Baker in 1800. The site was then given as a town allotment to John Howe in 1811. The building is claimed to have been built about 1843.Proudfoot 1987:24 ;Macquarie Arms Hotel - cnr Thompson and George Streets During Macquarie's tour of the district in 1811 he gave a large allotment in the square to Richard Fitzgerald on the express condition that he immediately build a handsome commodious inn of brick or stone and to be of at least two stories high.

Description  Thompson Square consists of George Street, Bridge Street, Thompson Square and The Terrace. These streets surround a small turfed reserve with pleasant trees that helps to conserve an attractive frontage to the important surrounding buildings. One large old hoop pine tree (Araucaria cunninghamii) over the cutting for the Putty Road is reputed to be all that remains of the mid-late 19th century plantings around the square. Once there were Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla) on the square's western side outside the Macquarie Arms Hotel and in front of the Fitzgerald wall. These were removed, as well as native fig tree species, after protests concerning acts of public indecency by people leaving the nearby hotel relieving themselves under the trees. Also growing around the square are several silky oak trees (Grevillea robusta) and one kurrajong (Brachychiton populneus). Thompson Square is surrounded by a number of Colonial Georgian buildings including; ;The Doctor's House - 1-3 Thompson Square A fine, substantial two storey sandstone brick terrace building. It has a good joinery attic storey, fine front door flanked by engaged columns and a very well designed fanlight. ;House & outbuildings - 5 Thompson Square A brick Georgian single storey cottage of three bays with a corrugated iron roof and three bay timber verandah. ;Hawkesbury Museum - 7 Thompson Square A brick Georgian two storeyed house with corrugated iron roof, five bays wide with a five bay verandah.

This label was intended to recognize a shift in disciplinary norms that first became apparent, in retrospect, in the 1970s. Before that, the history of psychology was harshly criticized by specialist historians of science for being celebratory and Whiggish. In other words, contemporary history of psychology is broadly describable as post- Kuhnian. As a result, it shares traits with contemporary historiography of science, science and technology studies, and the sociology of scientific knowledge. Kurt Danziger's book, Constructing the Subject: Historical Origins of Psychological Research, is often considered exemplary of this approach.  Feminist voices  The realization that previous histories had been celebratory led to a search for subjects who had been dismissed for reasons unrelated to their own merit. This effort continues to rediscover extremely significant contributions by women to the formation of psychology, which had become invisible as a result of the way in which the old histories had been written. In this, the influence of E. G. Boring's old history continues to be felt today.  Internationalization and indigenization  The critique that psychology is itself biased as a science by its focus on WEIRD subjects coincided with a move toward the internationalization of the history of psychology. This now has two main lines—the way in which psychology has developed as a discipline in different geographical locations and the way in which psychological expertise has changed as it has moved between national contexts. This is often referred to simply as indigenization.  Graduate programs  When a university employs a specialist Historian of Psychology to do original research and teach the history course required for accreditation, there is usually only one on staff. However, there are three large research groups in the world that work in English and also offer a PhD: * York University, Canada * University of Groningen, Netherlands * Simon Fraser University, Canada There are many lower-level programs.  Scholarly journals  There are three primary journals where specialist histories of psychology are published: * History of Psychology * History of the Human Sciences * Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences In addition, there are a large number of friendly journals where specialist material can often be found. The most prominent of these include: * American Psychologist * Isis (journal) * History of Psychiatry (journal) * Science in Context (journal) * British Journal for the History of Science Archives Important interpretive work has been done by examining secondary sources. But true historical discoveries are typically made in specialist archives, where unpublished—and sometimes unknown—primary sources can be examined. * Archives of the History of American Psychology  Prominent historians of psychology  *David Baker *Ludy Benjamin, Jr *Kurt Danziger *Donald Dewsbury *Raymond E.

During Crocus' tenure as governor there was a civil war between Cleopatra II and Ptolemy VIII, who made Cyprus his power-base. In one inscription, Crocus' title is given as strategos autokrator, which indicates that he held unlimited authority, analogous to a viceroy. Ptolemy VIII probably gave him this extra power so that he could concentrate on fighting the civil war. After the end of the civil war, Crocus is attested in one more inscription, no longer in the role of governor, but as a close associate of the king (hypermachos), whom he probably accompanied back to Alexandria. His successor in Cyprus was Theodorus, the son of his predecessor. References  Bibliography  * Roger S. Bagnall: The Administration of the Ptolemaic possessions outside Egypt.

He held office as King's Serjeant, and sat in the Irish House of Commons in 1613-15. Although he later developed close links with the town of Carlow, he was born in Dublin. Little is known of his family, although it is possible that Thomas Beere, who is listed as a member of the King's Inns in 1614, was a relative of John. He became King's Serjeant in February 1609 following the death of Nicholas Kerdiffe, and entered the King's Inns the same year. Due to the expansion of the assize system in the early 1600s, the common law judges were unable to cope with the added workload, and the King's Serjeant was often called on to act as an extra judge of assize. Bere carried out this function on at least nine occasions. He seems to have been extremely conscientious in performing this very onerous task. In 1613 he was on assize for 68 days, travelling across most of the southern half of Ireland. In 1615 he went on assize twice, for a total of 92 days. He served as Commissioner of the Irish Court of Wards in 1610, 1613 and 1615. He sat on a commission to inquire into the King's title to lands in County Wexford in 1611, and on a similar commission for County Longford and County Leitrim in 1615. He was knighted in 1615 for his impressive services to the Crown. In the only Irish Parliament (1613–15) called in the reign of King James I of England, Bere was one of the two MPs returned for Carlow Borough, the other being his fellow Law Officer, Sir Robert Jacobe. He also became a Burgess of Carlow under the new Royal Charter granted to the town in 1613. He died in 1617. Sources *Hart, A. R.

The water-powered mill and its edifices were built in the year 1800. It was originally used for milling grain but fell into disuse in the 1930s before being converted into a museum by the Belleval family in the late 1990s.  Owners and curators Marie-Anne and Ludovic Belleval are the mill's owners and curators. Both graduated from the École des Beaux-Arts of Cambrai and are Specialized Educators accredited by the French Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research. Marie-Anne is a technician, ceramic artist and painter conducting watercolors, acrylic painting, engraving, etching and clay-modeling workshops. Painter and sculptor Ludovic also holds a Bachelor's degree in Visual Arts from the University of Valenciennes. His favorite expression techniques are charcoal, sanguine, engraving and sand sculpture. Both have exhibited their œuvres in various venues. The Bellevals are also involved in primary schools located in Solesmes, Caudry, Cambrai, Valenciennes and their surrounding areas. In 1994, Ludovic and Marie-Anne Belleval bought the Lamour mill. Since then, they have not stopped to revive this monument of the Solesmois heritage. A decision that has been reinforced by the fact that this Briastre mill still has its \\"right to water\\". \\"This right was granted by Me Leroy, notary of Napoléon Bonaparte (/nəˈpoʊliən ˈboʊnəpɑːrt/,\\"Napoleon\\", \\"Bonaparte\\". Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. French: [napɔleɔ̃ bɔnɑpaʁt]; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821), and is valid forever.\\" The mill had ceased its activity in 1947. The couple advocates for heritage preservation, the defense of nature and artistic promotion. The couple has completely restored the interior of the mill of 300 m2. The machines are in working order but it is necessary to give them life by replacing a water wheel (French: Roue à aubes) and connect it to the different mechanisms.  The watermill The Lamour mill is the last watermill in the entire Selle valley that remains open to the public. It produces oil and flour using three 5-meter-high (in diameter) paddle wheels. In 2014, the 'Selle Basin Joint Union' in charge of watercourses management announced that eight watermills and dams, including the Lamour mill, would disappear in 2015 on the river affluent of the Scheldt in order to comply with the implementation of European regulations. 'Northern Fishing Federation' director, Emmanuel Petit argued that \\"The more rivers keep their profile, the more the impact of floods is mitigated. This also allows the fish as a good ecological indicator of the river's state to go up the Selle River to reproduce.\\" President of the union Georges Flamengt declared that \\"If these adjustments were not made, Brussels will inflict a 10000€ penalty a day to the French state.\\" The cost of destruction for the eight mills had been quantified to a minimal estimate of 350,000 Euros financed by the French Water Agency (became a European Union Hydrographic District in 2000) which could reach 1.5 million Euros if the union opted for more expensive technical solutions. A consultation process had been initiated with all owners who were given until 2018 to comply with this regulatory requirement. Among those concerned about with The Lamour mill were the 'Siccanor Mill' in Douchy-les-Mines, the 'Malaquin Mill' in Montrécourt, the 'Poirette Threshold' in Haussy, the 'Taupe Mill' in Saint-Python, the Barracks in Solesmes, the 'Bleuse Mill' in Neuvilly and the Third Estate Farm in Saint-Souplet.  Museum The museum is a three-story building displaying more than 300 rare objects and artifacts dating from 1800 to 1960. Pedagogical guided tours in costume are also available to classes of pupils and students, familiarizing them to characters from some of the 17th and 18th centuries' pivotal paintings. An estaminet with traditional wooden games is entirely recreated.  Professional and amateur training  The handi'paint workshops  Marie-Anne and Ludovic Belleval are leading specialized art workshops for the therapeutic needs of people with disabilities and Special needs. Each week, they welcome several groups from specialized Institutions such as shelters or occupational centers. People evolve at their own pace in a friendly and understanding atmosphere conducive to creativity. People are prompted to respect, congratulate and help each other through the acceptance of differences and without animosity. The teaching is individualized and the proposed techniques are rehabilitated according to the intellectual, social or physical difficulties. A workshop on the ground floor allows full access to wheelchairs.  Beekeeping – the belleval apiaries  Professionally trained beekeeper, Ludovic Belleval, produces flower honey, propolis, royal jelly, and pollen. In June and July, he welcomes classes to witness the harvesting of the flowing frames of honey.

Probably immediately after the coronation of Ptolemy VIII in 145 BC, Seleucus was appointed governor (strategos) of Cyprus and ex officio High Priest of the island.

The dedicatory inscriptions of the statues survive and are stored in the Epigraphical Museum in Athens (KM 19, 43, & 60).

Players control a black hole moving around an urban area. By consuming various objects, holes will increase in size, allowing players to consume larger objects as well as smaller players. Critics praised the game when it debuted, and it took the top spot in the free apps section on the App Store and on Google Play. Some critics however, characterized the game as a clone of the 2018 independent game Donut County. It has also been criticized for being promoted as a multiplayer game when in fact the other \\"players\\" are computer controlled NPCs. Gameplay Hole.io combines several gameplay mechanics. In Classic mode, the player's objective is to become the largest black hole by the end of a two minute round by travelling around the area and consuming trees, humans, cars and other objects which fall into the black hole if appropriately sized. Gradually the hole becomes larger and capable of sucking in buildings and smaller black holes. If an object is too big it will not fall in and might block the way preventing other objects from going through. Players need to utilize the game's real time physics to their advantage and optimize their path for effective growth. Other black holes can consume the player's hole resulting in \\"death\\" and respawning several seconds later. \\"Battle\\" mode is a battle royale mode that pits players against each other with the goal of being the last hole standing. While players can still consume the environment, the goal is to eliminate all other holes. Both Classic and \\"Battle\\" mode are not played against players, but rather computers. Additionally, a solo mode exists which allows players to play alone with the goal of consuming as close to 100% of the city within two minutes. The simple mechanics of the game put it in the hyper-casual genre. Players are awarded points at the end of each round that count toward their level. Each level unlocks new skins to customize the hole's appearance. Other skins can also be unlocked by performing certain tasks within the game.  Comparison to Donut County  Donut County is a 2018 independent video game that was in development for at least six years before its release on 28 August 2018, sparking allegations by that game's developer that Voodoo copied his idea. Both games use the same mechanic of a hole in the ground swallowing objects to grow bigger; however, Donut County additionally features a storyline and a cast of characters which Hole.io lacks. Conversely, Hole.io adds a cityscape. According to Variety, Hole.io's developer Voodoo's entire range of games, consists of clones of other games. Voodoo managed to secure a $200 million investment from Goldman Sachs shortly after releasing Hole.io. Reception Soon after its release, Hole.io made it to the top of the free games section on the Apps Store and Google Play, receiving over 10 million downloads on Google Play alone. While some reviewers criticized it for copying core mechanics of Donut County, others characterized the game as being \\"oddly satisfying and addictive\\".

It dates to 678 and was found in 2009 by a joint Russian-Mongolian team in Zaamar sum, Tov Province, 160km west of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia about 2.5km north-east from the banks of the Tuul River and close to the 10th-century Khitan town of Khermen Denzh on the banks of the Tuul River.http://epa.oszk.hu/01500/01521/00022/pdf/EPA01521_joes_2014_2_09-20.pdf The inscription is currently displayed at the Zanabazar Fine Arts Museum in Ulaanbaatar. The tomb of Pugu Yitu, also called the Shoroon Dov Kurgan, showed signs of attempted looting in ancient times. The nearby tomb of Shoroon Bumbagar was never looted and therefore was found to hold far more artifacts including an intact door, many statues and wall paintings of people, dragons and temples, although there was no inscription. The tomb of Pugu Yitu is unusual in that it has an inscription. Apart from the cover inscription of Pugu Yitu measuring 75cm x 75cm with 4 lines of 3 characters each, the main inscription has 28 lines with 31 characters each. The language of the inscription is Classical Chinese and relates the biography of Pugu Yitu the Dudu (都督) or Commander-in-Chief of the Jinweizhou (金微州) protectorate under the Tang dynasty's Jimi system. A photo of the inscription can be found on the Mongol Toli website.https://mongoltoli.mn/history/h/324 History Pugu Yitu is not mentioned in the Tang histories, although his grandfather Gelan Bayan is. The Pugu clan was part of the Xueyantuo, a Turkic people who filled the power vacuum in northern Mongolia after the Eastern Turkic Khaganate was defeated by the Tang Dynasty in May 630. In 647 the Pugu clan accepted the suzerainty of the Tang dynasty under the Jimi (loose rein) system and received the title Dudu (Commander-in-Chief). The first Dudu was Pugu Yitu's grandfather Gelan Bayan (歌滥拔延), followed by Pugu Yitu's father Sifu (思匍) who governed till 657. Judging from the epitaph Pugu Yitu was 44 years old when he died in 678. This means he was 22 or 23 years old when he succeeded his father Sifu in the post of Dudu in 657. The inscription was laid flat on the ground in front of the brick-faced main chamber where a number of painted statuettes were found.https://nsu.ru/rs/mw/link/Media:/36789/sfh_36_88-99_%D0%A8%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%BD_%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80.pdf The main chamber was accessed by three arched passageways. Byzantine-style gold coins were also found. According to the inscription, in the second year of Linde (665) he participated with the Tang Emperor Gaozong in a ceremony on Mount Tai in Shandong Province. The inscription also says he carried out military campaigns against the Mohe in Eastern Manchuria as well as Tibetan Empire (吐蕃). It is notable that General Tonyukuk's Bain Tsokto inscriptions, dated 716, are found eastward in the valley of the same Tuul River in Nalaikh District of Ulaanbaatar. In it he states how Tang influence was still strong in his childhood and how it took him many struggles, including campaigns as far afield as Shandong Province, Tibet and Central Asia to overthrow Tang influence and restore the Turkic Khaganate.

The Dabney was named one of the Best New Restaurants of 2016 by Bon Appétit magazine, it was a awarded a Michelin Star in 2017, and Chef Langhorne won the James Beard Award for Best Chef, Mid- Atlantic in 2018.  Restaurant  A plated meal at The Dabney The Dabney is a 55-seat restaurant focused on Mid-Atlantic cuisine. The open kitchen features a ten-foot long wood-burning stone hearth, visible from the dining room. The restaurant was built on the site of an old row house in historic Blagden Alley. In 2017, The Dabney opened a 30-seat bar in the basement. In the first few months after the restaurant's opening in October 2015, diners were frustrated by menus that changed completely from night to night, but the food became more consistent by the end of winter. Reviewers praised the use of local vegetables and meats, but were less impressed by the desserts. Bon Appétit placed The Dabney on the list of Best New Restaurants of 2016. It was named one of the South’s Best New Restaurants by Southern Living magazine. When the Michelin Guide reviewed restaurants in Washington, DC for the first time for 2017, The Dabney earned a Michelin star. The Dabney was among the restaurants where Barack and Michelle Obama were seen dining in the year after leaving the White House.  Jeremiah Langhorne  Chef Langhorne was born in Washington, D.C. but raised in Charlottesville, Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley. Langhorne did not attend culinary school, but he was trained by John Haywood, a classically trained chef, at OXO restaurant in Charlottesville. While cooking at OXO, Langhorne began reading Ping Island Strike, the digital notebook of Sean Brock, the star chef at McCrady's Restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina. After a chance connection in Crested Butte, Colorado, Langhorne got an opportunity to stage at McCrady's in 2008. He soon earned a spot on the line but then left in 2009 to stage at Noma with René Redzepi in Copenhagen. When he returned to McCrady's, he was promoted to sous chef and began a foraging program to collect local ingredients. Langhorne was promoted to chef de cuisine at McCrady's, and in 2012, he was named one of the top five rising chefs in America by Gayot. He was a member of the Eater Young Guns Class of 2012. In September 2013, Langhorne announced that he was leaving McCrady's to open his own restaurant in Washington, D.C. The Washington Post published a multi-part series leading up to the opening of The Dabney in 2015. In early 2018, Langhorne was the Chef-in-Residence at Chefs Club in New York City. He won the 2018 James Beard Award for Best Chef, Mid-Atlantic. Langhorne named The Dabney from an old family name, after discovering his Dabney ancestors from Virginia. Langhorne's more recent family owns Langhorne Concrete, who poured the foundation and helped to build the hearth at The Dabney. See also * List of Michelin starred restaurants in Washington, D.C.
