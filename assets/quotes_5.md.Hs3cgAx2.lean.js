Khoo is the Executive chairman and Chief Master Trainer of Adam Khoo Learning Technologies Group, one of Asia's largest private educational institutions, which runs educational seminars for over 80,000 people annually in 7 countries. His business interests include advertising, corporate training and professional investing. In 2008, Khoo was ranked among the top 25 richest Singaporeans under age 40 by The Executive magazine. In the same year, he was conferred the NUS Business School Eminent Business Alumni Award. Khoo is the director of seven other private companies. He was also a director of the Singapore Health Promotion Board (HPB) from 2009 to 2010. He is a member of the Singapore Chapter of the Young Presidents' Organization,\\"Young millionaire Khoo to address seminar,\\" The Business Times, January 2002 (no date provided)\\"He made his first million at 26\\", The New Paper, 27 September 2001 whose membership is available only to business owners below age 50, who run businesses with a minimum annual turnover of US$9 million. Background and education Adam Khoo Yean Ann was born on 8 April 1974, to Vince Khoo and Betty L. Khoo-Kingsley. At age eight, Khoo was expelled from St Stephen's Primary School for misbehavior, partly due to poor academic results. His parents hunted for a primary school willing to accept him and finally found Ngee Ann Primary School. Due to his poor results at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), he did not qualify to enter any of the six secondary schools his parents had chosen. He eventually enrolled in a government school, Ping Yi Secondary School, where he passed only five out of eight academic subjects and finished 156th out of 160 Secondary 1 Express Stream students.\\"I want to be a millionaire by 26\\", The Sunday Times, 21 October 2001 Khoo's parents and teachers described him back then as capable but lazy, indifferent and addicted to television.\\"Lousy at learning? Take heart\\", The Straits Times LIFE!, 6 August 1998 He described himself as being totally uninterested in learning (he was frustrated as he felt he could not learn), extremely unmotivated,\\"From underachiever to millionaire\\", The Edge Singapore, 18 December 2006 physically weak and mentally lethargic. His stepsister was a straight-As student in the Gifted Education Programme at Raffles Girls' School while cousins from his close-knit extended family were from the best schools in Singapore. He had poor social skills, did not enjoy reading anything but comics and was addicted to arcade games and TV programs. He tried to join the Scout Movement, but was thrown out six months later for not passing the basic qualifying test, the 'Scout Standard', as he did not bother to try. Turning point in education In 1987, when Khoo was 13, his parents enrolled their \\"under-achiever\\" son for a five-day residential program at Ladyhill Hotel called Super-Teen Camp. The man responsible for spotting Khoo's \\"gifted talent\\" in Super-Teen was Dr. Ernest Wong, founder, principal consultant and master teacher of Ernesco, the Centre for Motivational Language Learning based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (the Super-Teen Camp is now under Learning Mastery Pte. Ltd.) Dr. Wong's teaching tools incorporated and adapted an American- developed learning technology called neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), as well as whole-brain learning. This was the beginning of Khoo's interest and journey in mastering motivational techniques, which formed the foundation of many of his books and seminars. Within three months of the program, Khoo climbed to among the top 18 in his secondary school. He went on to rank among the top 10 in Ping Yi Secondary within a year, topped his school in the GCE 'O' Level examinations with the lowest scoring aggregate, and was the first in Ping Yi Secondary to qualify for the then-top junior college in Singapore, Victoria Junior College. At Victoria Junior College, he was president of the Economics Society and scored three A's for his GCE 'A' Level examinations. He entered the business administration faculty at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and continued his notable academic achievements by making it to the dean's list every year, ranked among the top 1 percent of academic achievers and became a pioneer in the university's Talent Development Programme (TDP), the tertiary equivalent of the gifted education programme for secondary schools. He graduated with an honours degree in business administration from NUS. Career At age 15, Khoo read books on Warren Buffett's investment techniques. While still in secondary school, he formed a mobile disco company with his friends, using his grandmother's house to re- create a disco and charged teenagers who attended a fee. At 16, he began investing most of his time and money to read and undergo training sessions in Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) in the United States. At 17, he became a freelance motivational trainer by visiting schools in Singapore. After completing National Service in the Republic of Singapore Air Force at age 21, Khoo went into partnership with three friends from the National University of Singapore and registered an event management company, Creatsoul Entertainment. The company organised hops, jams and other entertainment activities for individuals, companies and organisations. This was later re-registered as Event Gurus Pte Ltd, an event management company. At 23, Khoo obtained his licence in NLP in Seattle, Washington. At 24, he became a trainer at SuperTeen, conducting courses for organisations like the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC), Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP), Nanyang Girls' High School and the Universitas Pelita Harapan (UPH) in Jakarta. At 25, Khoo was coaching top insurance agents and marketing managers twice his age on how to boost sales. At this time, his father, Vince Khoo, who owned the advertising agency Adcom, bought out all partners and offered the younger Khoo the opportunity to run it. At 26, Khoo earned his first million from giving motivational training at schools and companies, his entertainment company and investments in equities, unit trusts and property. Portfolio Investments Inspired by the book Buffettology, he started dabbling in the stock market while in the army.\\"Big investor but frugal spender\\", Me & Money, The Straits Times, 22 February 2009 As a conservative and long-term investor, Khoo goes for investments with very low risk and high returns, favoring cash-rich companies with low debts and the potential to consistently increase their earnings. He prefers investing in stocks and options, using a variety of investing strategies including momentum and value investing. Property Khoo's portfolio consists of property that he rents out. In 1998, he bought a condominium in East Coast for S$480,000 and rented it out for about S$3,000. He sold it for S$650,000 in 2004. Other properties he owns include a house in East Coast and a condominium at Robertson Quay. Businesses Khoo does not believe in taking on consumer debt and prefers starting businesses with zero capital, paying freelance fees or stocks in the beginning until profit is generated.

More specifically, swing timing commonly refers to the efficiency of ball hitting or kicking skills by achieving optimum power at instant of ball impact. Furthermore, swing timing also refers to the inter-relationship between optimum power as generated and the intended point of ball contact. Perfect swing timing is therefore achieved when ball is struck with optimum power, with least energy expenditure, and at contact point that achieves the desired direction and velocity of ball after impact. Of all the motor skill components essential for expert ball play, swing timing is the most difficult to acquire, and teach, because of the essential millisecond co-ordination of major and minor muscle groups to impart optimal progressive acceleration to the hitting implement until it has reached greatest velocity and optimum angle at moment of ball impact. Arguably the best ball players have superior swing timing to achieve greatest ball impact velocities for greatest speed and/or distance, and a highly tuned muscle memory, or ‚Äòfeel‚Äô, to more consistently repeat or adjust swing as determined by the changing success requirements which vary from one ‚Äòshot‚Äô to another, and the ability to fine-tune swing velocity and impact point and angle. The answer still eluding even top teaching professionals; be it in golf, tennis, baseball, racketball, squash, cricket and even ball- kicking sports including European, American and Australian football, and rugby; is how to more effectively teach correct swing timing, the essence of the ‚Äòperfect swing technique‚Äô. Some common and fairly accurate perceptions of correct Swing Timing include a relaxed posture and muscle groups, which are only called into action in precisely timed intervals, and which relax instantly after ball contact is made; and an apparent ‚Äò80% Only‚Äô effort, which appears to promote the desired relaxed state during the whole swing. But the inability to more accurately observe these split-second, highly complex correlations and co-ordination; therefore, more often than not, encourages the teaching of specific and isolated swing components only, which tends to disrupt ‚Äònatural‚Äô swing mechanics and timing rather than enhancing these. For this reason, correct swing timing, still remains confined to trial and error techniques, where the naturally gifted player eliminates errors more quickly, and acquires accurate muscle memory faster. As visual feedback of actual swing remains elusive, an increasingly popular technique is to focus on correct swing rhythm, which can be more easily internalized, thereby accelerating essential muscle memory. Therefore one of the most effective teaching and practice tools is music, where the rhythm of music and ‚Äòperfect swing‚Äô are identical for a given player. In this method there is a more identifiable correlation of actual swing versus ideal by the degree of synchronization achieved. Other audio and tactile swing timing feedback devices have already been developed. These devices have proven to be highly effective in teaching ‚Äònear perfect swing timing‚Äô even to youngsters in a natural play learning experience. Swing timing versus swing rhythm In the existing related literature, these two terms are freely interchanged. Yet it appears that failure to recognize the key difference is another reason for the difficulty in their understanding, and thereby the difficulty in achieving correct swing mechanics, timing and rhythm. Whereas swing timing is pertinent to the sequence of vital swing components coming into effect for optimum ball contact, Swing rhythm is the tempo of the complete swing, which traditionally includes the backswing, and a vital pause between backswing and final swing towards ball impact. In swing timing the emphasis is therefore on the correct sequence of the various elements of the total swing. Whereas in swing rhythm the focus is on the tempo, and relative 'weight' of each component within that tempo of the ideal personal swing. Focus on swing rhythm, either in teaching or personal practice, is considered preferable. Correct swing rhythm results in faster 'feel' of correct timing mechanics, and reduces interference with that vital process by eliminating risk of undue emphasis on individual components of the total swing. To achieve perfect swing timing in this approach, it only remains to fine-tune this rhythm to ensure that the 'down beat' coincides perfectly with ball impact. Progressive segmental acceleration It is more important to understand this rhythm aspect of swing timing, then to focus on its individual components. And regardless of which sports specific skill, this concept remains constant. First, movement occurs in the most distal of the total swing lever system and progressively moves to each component one increment closer to the final impact point. And this movement sequence is common for tennis, golf, baseball and similar hitting skills. First the knees, which initiate rotation and forward movement of hips, which in turn initiate upper trunk and shoulder rotation, before progressively bringing upper and lower arms into play, followed by wrist and fingers which impart the final control and speed to the club, racket or stick. For ultimate success it is equally important that perfect swing timing occurs in the correct Swing Plane as determined by anticipated ball contact point, intended direction of ball flight, and the desired spin effect to be imparted to ball. Mathematical models can easily demonstrated the effect on racket or clubhead velocity, for each swing component which is subject to exponential acceleration caused by the cumulative effect of all prior components in the total acceleration chain. In simple terminology and concept, this complex action and its effect is comparable to cracking a whip. It is therefore self- evident that if any one component is out of ideal swing synchronization, the resultant detrimental impact will be a similarly exponential increase in loss of power and direction at ball impact. While this is an appropriate model for better understanding of the biomechanics and kinesiology involved in perfect swing timing; it is not an ideal basis for teaching same. It is simply too complex for anyone to consciously synchronize all the component in this chain, especially in only the fraction of a second available to complete this final swing sequence; or indeed observe it or feel each individual component coming into play sequentially. Thus tempo and rhythm, still remain as the key variables in the achievement of correct swing timing. Therefore any theory of correct swing timing, in practice and teaching, must rely on correct swing rhythm emphasis, including learning, teaching and practice devices that provide instant feedback of correct swing rhythm for every swing. Controversy The importance of the pause of the hitting implement at the end of the backswing, that is, before the actual swing aimed at perfect swing timing is commenced; is generally agreed upon, regardless of sport. This Pause is the moment of final deliberation as to when to commence a hitchless and optimum swing. Many swing timing problems can thus be traced back to miscalculations during this critical split-second pause. The continuing 'traditional' emphasis on correct backswing check points, arcs and planes, therefore appears to be seriously misplaced, and simply adds to the overall complexity of Swing Timing. It would therefore also appear that only two things are important in any backswing instructions, First, that the racket or clubhead pauses in the correct place on the desired swing arc and plane as determined by the intended 'shot', and secondly, that the racket or club face has assumed the optimal angle relative to swing arc and plane, so as to require minimal further adjustment in the Final Swing Sequence, and thereby eliminating another adjustment variable and potential cause of error. The achievement of correct swing timing therefore remains over-complicated by breaking down a swing that needs to be continuous and rhythmic, into its sub- components. Instead it can and should be 'discovered' much more easily through an emphasis on correct swing rhythm in ways already described.

Bangued Christian Hospital (abbreviated hereafter as BCH) was established in the year 1948, and grew under the contributions of Mennonite Disaster Service of the Mennonite Central Committee. The hospital is deeply rooted in the Anabaptist cause and it was once under the spiritual guidance of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines. BCH is one of the earliest and most respected hospital in Abra emphasizing Christian concern for its patients and employees. The hospital is widely known among Abrenian people as \\"Mission Hospital\\".  History  First evangelical Christian missionaries arriving in the Philippines in 20th century often combined preaching and medical help for local population. They considered medical healing as part of their mission, as Jesus had commanded them to \\"Heal the Sicks\\". Also, they seeks to demonstrate God's love by working among people suffering from poverty, conflict, oppression and natural disaster. The Bible calls Christians to serve people who are hungry, thirsty, sick, in prison and strangers (Matthew 25:35-36). This command was expressed by Menno Simons, a 16th-century Anabaptist leader from whom Mennonites take their name, who stated that \\"True evangelical faith cannot lie sleeping, it clothes the naked, it comforts the sorrowful, it feeds the hungry, it shelters the destitute, it cares for the sick, it becomes all things to all men.\\" The Mennonite Central Committee is motivated by these principles. Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) is a relief, service, and peace agency of the North American Mennonite and Brethren in Christ churches. Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) was established in the Philippines after the Second World War, and expanded its offices over the country for evangelism together with the healing and social mission. Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) had placed 17 workers in relief assistance to war victims. Their program soon focused on the province of Abra in northern Luzon, whose capital Bangued had been destroyed by bombing. They purchased a land in Bowen Street, Bangued and built a military barrack-like building. They initially set up a clinic and was gradually developed into better equipped hospital. The building was officially inaugurated in the name of Christ as the Christian Hospital in 1948, widely known as the \\"mission\\" hospital. When MCC staff left in 1950, the Northwest Luzon Conference (NWLC) of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines assumed responsibility for the Christian Hospital and Abra Mountain High School (now known as Abra Mountain Development Education Center) in the isolated mountain village of Lamau, Bucloc in 1951. Debt grew quickly as a sign of the post-World War II depression. In 1970, it was relocated to its present location. As a result of the ongoing financial difficulties, the Northwest Luzon Conference (NWLC) of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines sold the hospital to the evangelical medical couple, Dr. Benjamin and Mrs. Loreto Bringas. The hospital was renamed Bangued Christian Hospital. It became an affiliate hospital of the Northwest Luzon Conference (NWLC) of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines.  Activities  At present the Bangued Christian Hospital services include: surgery, obstetrics & gynecology, emergency, family practice, health checkup (wellness), laboratory, x-ray, pharmacy, skilled nursing care. The hospital maintains very high clinical, governance and educational standards, and is a member of Philippine Hospitals Association. It is surveyed and accredited bi-annually by the Philippine Healthcare Insurance Corporation, a major national healthcare accreditation group and licensed for secondary level of services by the Department of Health. Besides medical care it provides spiritual care with its patients and staff. The slogan of the Hospital is \\"God Heals, We Serve\\", which means difference in quality and excellence of service, equipment, spiritual atmosphere, and qualification of nurses and physicians.  Buildings  The hospital consists of a female general ward, male general ward, labor room, delivery room, nursery, recovery room, out-patient and emergency room, operating room, dispensary, laboratory, pharmacy and kitchen. In the compound there is also a chapel for patients and employees now known as the Jesus, Others, and You Christian Fellowship. Outside the gate is the Hospital Canteen. Jesus, Others, and You Christian Fellowship Jesus, Others and You Christian Fellowship (JOYCF) is an independent non-denominational evangelical congregation with a Reformed tradition. It was once a partner church of the Valley Cathedral Philippines through the initiation of Pastor Hector B. Reyes. Its partnership was officiated last July 6, 2008. Now it is a partner church of Tangadan Bible Baptist Church in Tangadan, San Quintin, Abra.

The working titles of this film were Cinderella Goes to War, Reaching for the Stars and High Among the Stars. It was Frank Tashlin's first writing credit on a live action feature film. Plot summary High school music student Sherry Williams is excited that her actress sister Jo has taken time off from her New York stage career to visit Sherry's school to see her perform in a musical play. Jo is about to step off the train when she hears that a famed Broadway show producer, Arthur Hale, is also stepping off the same train, leading Jo to depart from the other side of the train and make her own way to Sherry's play. Arthur also is attending Sherry's school play. He overhears one of the older girls ridiculing Sherry's claim that her sister is a stage singer; the girl doubts that Sherry's sister even exists. Arthur comes to the rescue by praising Jo's performances on stage. Arthur, who is casting a new play, appreciates Sherry's voice but believes she is too young to appear on Broadway. Jo, Sherry, and Arthur meet after the play but no one is the wiser as to the reasons for Jo's mysterious entrance. Jo also turns down an offer to audition for Arthur's play. On a trip to New York with her schoolfriend, Sherry rings Jo's hotel where the clerk tells her she is performing in one of the theatres on 42nd Street. Sherry discovers that Jo is not a Broadway star, but a leading burlesque performer. Initially broken hearted, Sherry schemes that if she dresses to look older she will win the part in Arthur's show and support Jo so she leaves burlesque. Arthur can not believe she can pass for over 18 but a score of servicemen at a nightclub prove Arthur wrong. When bandleader Morton Gould hears Sherry singing along to the music, he invites her up to sing on the stage. Based on this performance, a radio producer in the audience offers her a contract. He retracts the offer, however, when he learns that Sherry's sister is a burlesque performer. Meanwhile, Arthur shows romantic interest in Jo, but she coldly rebuffs him. Stung by this rejection, Arthur retreats to his apartment to work on his upcoming musical, based on the music of Johann Strauss. He feels the show is destined to be a failure because the musical score simply doesn't work. As Sherry and Jo discuss Arthur's musical, Jo expresses the opinion that the show will fail because audiences are looking for something more up-to-date than stuffy old Viennese waltzes. She demonstrates by improvising a jazzy version of a Strauss tune. Sherry then borrows her roommate's recording machine and secretly makes a record of Jo singing her tune. Sherry forces her way into Arthur's apartment and pesters him into listening to the record. He is impressed in spite of himself, and hits upon a new idea for the show. Soon after, the musical hit \\"Mr. Strauss Goes To Town\\" opens on Broadway, co-starring Jo and Sherry. The production mixes the traditional Strauss music (sung by Sherry in an old-fashioned operetta costume) with updated jazz interpretations of the tunes, performed by Jo in a showgirl outfit. As they perform together on stage, Jo tells Sherry that she will accept Arthur's proposal of marriage.

On the same date, the Air Corps assigned the group's operational units: the 55th, 56th, and 57th Bombardment Squadrons (Light) and the 9th Reconnaissance Squadron (Light). These activations resulted from the buildup of military forces known as the \\"First Aviation Objective,\\" in which the Air Corps activated 54 combat groups to prepare for the looming Second World War. Initially the 48th and its four flying squadrons served as a training unit, preparing its pilots and maintenance crews for eventual combat. After training, many of the group's members went on to serve in squadrons stationed in Europe and the Pacific, while the 48th remained in the states. Over the next two years the group moved from Hunter Field to Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma, back to Savannah, Georgia, then on to Key Field, Mississippi; William Northern Field, Tennessee; and Walterboro Army Airfield, South Carolina. Initially the men of the 48th trained with A-20 and A-18 twin-engine attack, light bombers. After moving to Key Field, the group used A-24, A-31, A-35, and A-36 aircraft for training. While at Key Field, on 15 August 1943, the group was redesignated the 48th Fighter-Bomber Group. The flying squadrons were redesignated the 492d, 493d, 494th, and 495th Fighter-Bomber Squadrons. Five days after these organizational changes, the 48th moved again, this time back to William Northern Field, Tennessee. With this move, the 48th abandoned its training mission and served strictly as an operational unit, flying in maneuvers with its first fighters, the P-39 Airacobra and P-40 Warhawk. In early 1944, after years of training and flying across the US, the 48th returned to the East Coast. At first the group conducted coastal patrol missions and training in the single-seat fighter it would use throughout World War II, the P-47 Thunderbolt. After three months in South Carolina, the group moved up to Camp Shanks, New York and prepared for its embarkation to Europe. On 21 March 1944, the men of the 48th Fighter-Bomber Group boarded the RMS Queen Mary, bound for an unknown and uncertain service in World War II. After a week of sea travel, the contingent arrived at Gourock, Scotland. From there they traveled by train for two days to their first overseas base, RAF Ibsley in Southern England and was assigned to the Ninth Air Force. The 48th flew the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and had the following fighter squadrons and fuselage codes: * 492d Fighter Squadron (F4) * 493d Fighter Squadron (I7) * 494th Fighter Squadron (6M) P-47Ds of the 48th Fighter Group at an advanced landing ground Almost immediately after their arrival, members of the 48th began a rigorous training program, flying dive-bombing, glide bombing, night flying, low-level navigation, smoke laying, reconnaissance, and patrol convoy sorties. Over the next two months, the number of sorties steadily increased and the group flew its first combat missions on 20 April 1944‚Äîan uneventful fighter sweep of the occupied French coast. The group and squadrons underwent another name change on 30 May 1944, dropping the designation \\"bomber.\\" Thus, the names that would remain with the units until their inactivation were the 48th Fighter Group and the 492d, 493d, and 494th Fighter Squadrons. Unknown at the time to the pilots of the 48th, all of their training was specifically designed for a campaign against the German positions in Normandy. On 6 June 1944, the 48th participated in a massive invasion of France, which included more than 14,000 sorties flown by the allied air forces. The three squadrons assisted the Normandy invasion by dropping bombs on bridges and gun positions, attacking rail lines and trains, and providing visual reconnaissance reports. Over the course of the Normandy campaign, the 48th flew nearly 2,000 sorties, dropping nearly 500 tons of bombs and fired more than 160,000 rounds of ammunition With the pocket in Northern France secured, the group quickly moved into the recently conquered territory. On 18 June, the 48th moved its operations, along with the 492d and 493d Fighter Squadrons to Deux Jumeaux Airfield (A-4), France. The 494th Fighter Squadron followed on 4 July. From Deux Jumeaux, the 48th began a mission it would continue throughout the war: providing support for the United States First Army. In late July 1944, attacks from the air helped the First Army break through the German positions at Saint-L√¥, France. In saturation attacks, the 48th struck tanks, convoys, gun positions, and ammunition dumps as the allied ground forces pushed the German army back. Keeping up with the front lines, the 48th was constantly on the move. It arrived at Villacoublay Airfield (A-42), France, on 29 August, Cambrai/Niergnies Airfield (A-47), France, on 15 September, and Sint-Truiden Airfield (A-92), Belgium, on 30 September. The 48th twice received the honor of being mentioned in Belgium's \\"Order of the Day\\" and assisted in the attack of German positions in the Netherlands. One of the 48th's most memorable attacks took place on 6 December 1944. Despite difficult weather and heavy enemy fire, the 48th's pilots struck German buildings and troop concentrations in J√ºlich, Germany, allowing ground forces to advance into the sector and earning the 48th a Distinguished Unit Citation. Two weeks later, the group was called on to hold back a massive German assault in the \\"Battle of the Bulge.\\" The 48th flew under heavy weather with its allies as the German military committed its forces in an all-out assault. Often flying as low as 20 feet off the ground, the men of the 48th strafed ground positions, holding back the Nazi armies in their last major offensive. The Commanding Officer during this period was Col. S. Paul Latiolais. By 1945 the allies had gained nearly complete air superiority, allowing the 48th to conduct its missions at will. As the front line moved eastward, so did the 48th Fighter Group: moving into Kelz Airfield (Y-32), Germany, on 26 March; Kassel-Rothwesten Airfield (R-12), Germany, on 17 April; and Illesheim Airfield (R-10), Germany, on 29 April. Within a week of the group arriving at Illesheim, the allied nations celebrated Victory in Europe Day. Finally, on 8 May 1945, the 48th flew its final mission from Illesheim. Captain Troy Smith observed the ground situation: \\"They were in retreat by the tens of thousands. They were walking on one side of the road, guns slung over their shoulders, and our guys were on the other side of the road in convoys going the other way. At that point, I knew it was really over.\\" A month after the war ended, the 48th retraced its steps as it headed toward home. On 5 July 1945, the group arrived in Laon, France. After a few weeks back in France the group received orders to return to the US. With many of the group's members separating at port, those remaining set up the group headquarters at Seymour Johnson Field, North Carolina and was programmed for deployment to Okinawa to take part in planned Invasion of Japan. Training discontinued after Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the sudden end of the Pacific War. Two months later on 7 November 1945, the 48th Fighter Group and its flying squadrons inactivated as part of the massive postwar draw down.

F-86F-35-NA Serial 53-1222 of the 494th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, 1955 On 10 July 1952 the United States Air Force reactivated the group as the 48th Fighter-Bomber Group at Chaumont Air Base, where it assumed the mission, personnel and 58 Republic F-84G Thunderjets of the federalized Oklahoma Air National Guard 137th Fighter-Bomber Group, which was simultaneously inactivated and returned to state control. Similarly, the group's 492d, 493d and 494th Fighter-Bomber Squadrons replaced the 125th, 127th and 128th Squadrons of the 137th Group.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 288‚Äì289 The group and supporting units were assigned to the 48th Fighter-Bomber Wing under the wing base organization plan.Ravenstein, pp. 77‚Äì78 The few National Guardsmen still with the wing departed and the last were released from active duty on 9 July, although a few reserve officers remained on active duty for an additional six to twelve months. Chaumont Air Base was still largely under construction at the time of the activation of the 48th FBG and living and working conditions were primitive. The men were billeted in tents that were heated by pot-bellied stoves; all of the roads on the base were yet unpaved and were basically mud ruts through the turf. The only hardened facilities were a concrete runway and a handful of tarpaper shacks. Within two years, the wing headed up an engineering project that resulted in the construction of permanent barracks, a wing headquarters, flightline shops, and warehouses With the F-84, the 48 FBG supported NATO and the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), activities, participating in exercises with the US Seventh Army. With the F-84, the wing supported the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), and participated in exercises with the Seventh United States Army. In addition, the wing conducted operational readiness exercises and tactical evaluations. The 48th frequently deployed to Wheelus Air Base, Libya, for training in bombing and gunnery skills. In September 1953, the 48th FBG had become so proficient with the F-84 that it assumed the role of the \\"Skyblazers\\" aerial demonstration team in Europe from the 86th Fighter-Bomber Group and commenced flying air shows throughout Western Europe. They would continue with their F-84Gs until the spring of 1954 when the Group's Tunderjets were replaced by F-86F Sabres. In late 1956, the Liberty Wing became USAFE's first unit to convert to the F-100 Super Sabre. However, at this time the Chaumont runway was closed for repair, which resulted in the wing deploying to Berrechid Airfield, Morocco (near Casablanca), to train with its new aircraft. The group was inactivated on 8 December 1957 when its component squadrons were assigned directly to the 48th Fighter-Bomber Wing as the Air Force reorganized its wings into the tri-deputate system. Modern era McDonnell Douglas F-15C-42-MC Eagle 86‚Äì167 On 31 March 1992, the 48th Operations Group was activated as a result of the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing implementing the USAF objective wing organization. Upon activation, the 48th OG was bestowed the lineage and history of the 48th Fighter-Bomber Group and its predecessor organizations. The 48th OG was assigned the Fighter Squadrons previously assigned to the 48th Fighter Wing upon activation, all equipped with the General Dynamics F-111F. it phased out the F-111 aircraft and was equipped with F-15 aircraft, at first 2 squadrons of \\"E\\" model Strike Eagles and then later adding a full squadron of \\"C\\" & \\"D\\" model Eagles. Lakenheath began to receive its first McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagles in 1992. With the departure of the F-111s, the 495th Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 13 December 1991. On 18 December 1992 the last F-111F departed the base. Along with the departure of the F-111F's, the 493d Fighter Squadron was also inactivated. With the pending closure of Bitburg Air Base Germany on 25 February 1994 it was decided to reactivate the 493d as an F-15C/D squadron. Aircraft were transferred from Eglin AFB Florida and the 493d was reactivated on 1 January. The 493rd's arrival meant that the 48th became the largest F-15E/F-15C composite unit in the U.S. Air Force. In August 1998 an F-15D (Serial 86‚Äì182) of the 493d Fighter Squadron paid a visit to Chaumont- Semoutiers Air Base (now called Quartier General d'Aboville), France for an open house static display. This was the first time a Statue of Liberty Wing aircraft was at its original air base in almost 40 years. Balkan/Middle East Deployments F-15E at Ahmed Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait. Remains of a MiG-29, courtesy of the 493d FS With its new weapon systems, the group began a hectic pace of deployments that would keep at least one squadron constantly deployed for nearly six years. On 5 August 1993, the 492d Fighter Squadron conducted the wing's first F-15E deployment when it went to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, under Operation PROVIDE COMFORT (succeeded by NORTHERN WATCH). Thirteen days after the 492d's arrival in Turkey, Iraq violated the exclusion zone by placing surface-to-air missiles outside of the city of Mosul. In spite of repeated warnings to remove the missiles, Iraqi forces failed to comply. On the afternoon of 18 August, Liberty Wing F-15Es struck the site, eliminating the missile threat. For the remainder of the decade, the 492d and 494th continually rotated to Turkey and to Aviano Air Base, Italy, for participation in Operation DENY FLIGHT, supporting operations in the Balkans. Providing combat air patrol with F-15Cs, the 493d also rotated planes to Turkey and Italy. This series of deployments continued into the spring of 1999. In February 1999, while the wing served another rotation in Turkey, acts of aggression by Serbia‚Äîthe core of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia‚Äîagainst its Albanian population in the province of Kosovo resulted in NATO intervention, culminating in Operation ALLIED FORCE.3 Strikes against Serbian targets began on 24 March 1999. Within 72 hours, the 493d Expeditionary Fighter Squadron, stationed at Cervia Air Base, Italy, recorded four aerial victories over Serbian Mikoyan MiG-29s. The 492 and 494 FS flew combat mission from RAF Lakenheath and Aviono AB, Italy, respectively, and employed all the AGM-130 against Serbian Air Defenses. At the same time, the 494th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron, operating from Aviano Air Base, employed its precision guided munitions‚Äîincluding the first combat use of a GBU-28 Bunker Buster by an Air Force F-15E. Starting in May, the 492d Expeditionary Fighter Squadron launched combat operations directly from RAF Lakenheath, the first sustained combat operations flown from England since World War II. During the air war over Serbia, the wing deployed 1,011 personnel to 18 different locations. The group's pilots and aircraft flew combat missions from three locations, using 69 aircraft. Those remaining at RAF Lakenheath not only made up for the work of those deployed, but also launched combat missions. Furthermore, they served as a supply point for their deployed counterparts, sending 3,871 tons of equipment to various locations. In all, the pilots of the 48th serving under expeditionary squadrons flew 2,562 sorties for more than 11,000 combat hours in less than three months, dropping approximately 3 million pounds of munitions and scoring four out of five confirmed Air Force aerial victories. After ALLIED FORCE, the 48th was given a chance to reconstitute its forces for the first time in six years. During this period, the wing upgraded its F-15E fleet with new Block E-210 models. At the same time, the wing participated in training with its NATO allies through a series of deployments across continental Europe while receiving USAFE and NATO strike evaluations, tactical evaluations, and surety inspections. Yet the wing continued to prepare for future taskings, such as its Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) commitments. For the first time since the Gulf War, in December 2000, the 48th's flying squadrons began deploying to the desert of Southwest Asia. As part of AEFs 2 and 4 respectively, the 494th and 492d Fighter Squadrons served as Operation SOUTHERN WATCH's precision guided munitions squadrons based at Ahmed Al Jabar Air Base, Kuwait. The units employed several munitions against Iraqi targets, racking up 690 sorties for 1,229 hours for the 494th in AEF 2 and 730 sorties for 1,173.9 hours for the 492d in AEF 4. The 48th served as the lead wing force provider for the 363d Air Expeditionary Wing at Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, during AEF 4. The 493d also deployed to Prince Sultan and served as SOUTHERN WATCH's air superiority squadron, flying 893 sorties for 2,201.9 hours. Global War on Terrorism After the AEF 4 redeployment in June 2001, the 48th moved into its 10-month training period consisting of exercises and inspections, both at home and at events such as Weapons Training Deployments. However, this period was severely interrupted by 11 September 2001. In response, President George W. Bush initiated Operation ENDURING FREEDOM‚Äîair and ground strikes against terrorist organizations and training camps in Afghanistan. \\"Great harm has been done to us. We have suffered great loss. And in our grief and anger we have found our mission and our moment. Freedom and fear are at war,\\" stated President Bush. As part of this operation, the 492d and 493d Fighter Squadrons deployed to support the humanitarian airlift operations from Ramstein Air Base, Germany. The F-15C and F-15E squadrons ensured air superiority and supremacy for C-17 aircraft delivering humanitarian daily rations to Afghan refugees in Afghanistan. On 21 March 2003, Operation IRAQI FREEDOM began with airstrikes and ground attacks against the Iraqi military. Nearly 500 people from the Liberty Wing served in various roles and locations. Since that time, the 48th OG has deployed to support Air Expeditionary Force commitments in Southwest Asia. In late 2006, the 48th expanded its mission by adding the 56th Rescue Squadron and its five Sikorsky HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters. The 56 RQS moved to RAF Lakenheath from NAS Keflavik, Iceland.

After the IDF outpost on Mount Hermon was captured by Syria on October 6, Israel decided to launch a hasty counterattack. The Syrians repelled the attack, and held on to the Hermon until October 21. Background On Yom Kippur, October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria launched a war against Israel that had occupied the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights since the Six-Day war. As part of the initial Syrian attack near 14:00, a commando force was landed by helicopters near Mount Hermon. The IDF outpost on the mountain was caught by surprise, and fell before the next morning. Several Israeli soldiers managed to escape.Rabinovich (2005), pp. 154-155 Prelude Syrian preparations Following the 82nd Syrian Paratroop Battalion's complete takeover of the Israeli Hermon outpost on October 7, the 82nd Syrian Paratroop Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Ahmad Rifai al-Joju, spent the morning clearing the site. He oversaw the burial of the Israeli bodies and the transportation of the Israeli prisoners out of the area. In the afternoon, he was ordered to prepare a blocking position downslope of the outpost.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 188 The battalion deployed between the upper ski lift and the Israeli outpost, getting ready for an Israeli counterattack. A company, reinforced by the battalion's supporting arms, deployed south of the lower ski lift, mostly west of the road. The fighters deployed along the slopes descending from the curves and built positions by heaping stones between the local rocks. A recoilless gun team took positions in a dugout east of the road. The engineering troops deployed a string of exposed mines on the road about 350 meters north of the \\"tank curve\\". The other two companies deployed in the commanding areas west of the outpost and south of the access road, from the landing-field to Hill 2072. one platoon positioned in the outpost, along with twenty engineering soldiers and the twenty-five men battalion mortar company without the mortars. In that area, two B-10 RCLs, aimed at the road leading from the upper ski lift to the outpost, and four Strela antiaircraft operators were also stationed. The battalion commander command post also took position west of the outpost, and a platoon was deployed near it to break counterattacks. Two observation officers were deployed in the outpost itself.Asher et al. (2008), p. 137 At dawn on October 7, the 183rd Commando Battalion was deployed on high point 1614 on the Hermon mountainside, southwest of the 82nd Battalion. The 183rd Battalion was the northern flank along with the 68th Infantry Brigade and the Moroccan expeditionary force in the 7th Infantry Division's breakthrough attempt. Its mission was apparently to capture Bunker 103 in Majdal Shams and then move through the Ya'afuri Valley to block the Majdal Shams-Masada road and later move across the Banias to Ghajar. On the night of October 6‚Äì7, it moved westward on foot from the Hadar area through the Hermon slopes and deployed on high point 1614. In the afternoon of October 7, its reconnaissance company seems to have attacked Bunker 103 and then retreated back to the battalion area. On the morning of October 8 the battalion was still set for defending high point 1614 and did not advance westward, since the 7th Division was stopped on the Hadar-Masada road.Asher et al. (2008), pp. 137-138 Israeli decision to attack Since 15:58 on October 6, when contact with the outpost was lost, the Israeli Northern Command (NC) knew the outpost fell to the Syrians, but did not know what happened to its soldiers. NC considered it imperative to recapture the Hermon, for both moral and strategic reasons. About an hour after contact was lost, the NC Operations Branch officer, Colonel Uri Simhoni, suggested to plan an infantry assault on the outpost. NC chief, General Yitzhak Hofi, agreed and delegated the planning to the 317th Reserve Paratroop Brigade, under the command of Haim Nadel, which was still being recruited and was transferred to NC. Amir Drori, the Golani Brigade commander, arrived at the command post at Nafakh and asked to be the planner. Hofi agreed, and Drori decided to attack as soon as possible, in order to deny the Syrians time to prepare. During October 7, Golani's 13th and 12th Battalions were fighting in the northern sector of the Golan. Two 51st Battalion companies with the Brigade command post were deployed near the Masada crossroad. Shooting sounds were occasionally heard from the Hermon, leading the Golani Brigade commanders to think that the Syrians have not yet captured the outpost. At around 07:00, Drori spoke to the mortar non- commissioned officer, who escaped from the outpost, and questioned him. The questioning convinced Drori that the Hermon must be attacked quickly. At 11:00, he asked Hofi to attack, but Hofi refused.Asher et al. (2008), p. 138 At noon, when Dov Dror, the 17th Battalion commander, arrived in the northern sector with two squad commanders course companies, Drori ordered Yehuda Peled, the 51st Battalion commander, to brief Dror and his company commander regarding the recapture of the Hermon. Since the evening of October 6, Peled had been studying the outpost using engineering sketches he received from the Israeli Defense Ministry's construction supervisor. When Peled briefed the 17th Battalion before sunset, he focused mostly on the outpost structure and the methods for clearing it, and less on the order of battle, the routes and the expected difficulties. The commanders had no information regarding the Syrian deployment, and the briefing had settled for a 1:50,000 scale map. At dawn on October 8, the Air Force unit commander and a reserve observation soldier, the last two escapees from the outpost, arrived at Bunker 103. The bunker commander called Drori, who questioned them on the spot. They said there were still a few dozen soldiers in the outpost, which convinced Drori that they must be rescued. Their sense of time was distorted, and they said that they escaped only one day before.Rabinovich (2005), p. 254 At 06:47, Drori radioed Hofi, updated him on the survivors, and asked for a go-ahead, which Hofi granted.Asher et al. (2008), pp. 138-139 Israeli Plan When the go-ahead was given, Drori consulted with Peled and decided that the attack would be carried out by the following forces: The 51st Battalion with the battalion command post, the second company and the battalion collecting station; the 17th Battalion with the battalion command post and two squad commanders course companies, one of the reduced; two tanks from the 71st Armored Battalion platoon, which was attached to the Golani Brigade, and Drori's command post. At around 07:00, Drori updated Peled on the attack and ordered him to arrive with his two companies to the bridge over Wadi Sa'ar. After consultation, Peled decided that company A would continue its blocking mission at the Masada crossroad and subordinated the tank company's third tank to it. At that time, the 13th Battalion's company B and a staff company from the Brigade Training Base (BTB), both under the command of the BTB commander, who had organized in Rosh Pina, arrived at Masada. Drori ordered them to defend the Masada crossroad. He also intended to leave half of the reconnaissance company at the crossroad, but after consulting with the company's former commander, who accompanied Drori, it was decided that half the company would join the 1st Battalion. The 51st Battalion's Company B commander, who was with his company in the middle of Majdal Shams, was ordered to wait with his company in the western entrance of the village and join the Brigade column.Asher et al. (2008), p. 139 At around 07:30, Drori quickly briefed Peled, Dror and his company commanders, the reconnaissance company deputy commander and the tank platoon commander, near the bridge over Wadi Sa'ar. In the ten-minute brief, Drori explained that the 17th Battalion would advance on half-tracks on the road to the outpost. The column was to be led by the two tanks, while the reduced 51st Battalion and half of the reconnaissance company were to move along the ridge on foot. Most of the briefing was about the outpost structure. The commanders were told that the first force to reach the outpost would be ordered to clear it. At this point, a Syrian shelling started, and the briefing was cut as Drori ordered the commanders to mount their half-tracks and start moving. The company commanders did not get the time to brief the fighters, and had no information about the Syrian dispositions. The Brigade was not detailed any air or artillery assistance, but Drori assumed those could be provided along the way. The half-tracks were received or \\"borrowed\\" from the emergency reserve stores, and were only half equipped and in a bad technical condition. They had no machine-guns, machine- gun ammunition or machine-gun pedestals, so the units' machine-guns could not be placed. The 17th Battalion lacked rifle grenades and it departed without its battalion collecting station. The half-tracks had almost no fixed radio communication units other than portable ones, so the entire 17th Battalion used the same frequency.Asher et al. (2008), pp. 139-140 Battle At 08:00 the Golani forces started making their way up the road from Masada to Majdal Shams and from there to the lower ski lift. Their movement coincided with a heavy Syrian shelling aimed at the road crossing Majdal Shams, but most of the shells landed between the houses and the ridges above it, did not hit the forces and did not interrupt their advance. The column was headed by the two tanks, followed by the 51st Battalion Company B's half-tracks, the reconnaissance half-tracks and finally the 17th Battalion half-tracks. When the 51st Battalion column reached 1,500 meters from the village, where the road crosses the dirt road ascending from Neve Ativ, the column stopped. The fighters dismounted and organized for a climb up the ridge. The tanks, Drori's command post and the 17th Battalion forces kept slowly driving up the road. At about 08:15, right before the climb, Peled briefed his Company B's commander and the reconnaissance deputy commander about the mission. The communication was conducted on the battalion frequency, and only Peled had another radio unit tuned to the brigade frequency. After several minutes, they began moving in the following order: the reconnaissance force of thirty-three fighters under the deputy company commander, Lieutenant Shaul Lev, moved first on the path climbing up the ridge. The leading force moved on the ridge east of the path, on which the rest of the force moved. A few dozen meters behind the reconnaissance force was the command post. About 200 meters behind it the command post were columns of Company B, under Lieutenant Dov Schechter's command, with fifty-six fighters. The battalion collecting station under Lieutenant Doctor Sidi Yehezkel was last.Asher et al. (2008), pp. 140-141 During the climb, Syrian artillery shells kept falling. Drori ordered the forces to try and spot the enemy while moving. The sky was clouded with medium-strength wind. Every once in a while, a low cloud passed, narrowing the sight. At around 09:45, after an hour and a half's climb up the ascent, when the lead force reached about 350 meters from the foot of Hill 1614, the Syrian 183rd Commando Battalion deployed on the hill opened fire. Soon, several soldiers were hit. The battle continued until around 16:00, with Peled first trying to flank the Syrians from the right (east) with a reduced Company B. The flanking failed, and the company medical aidman was killed and three fighters wounded during the retreat. After that, a platoon was sent to flank from the west, again covered by the reconnaissance company, but the commander was killed and the force retreated. From the \\"tank curve\\" Drori sent down the Hermon mountainside a force of sixteen fighters under the 17th Battalion Company B deputy commander, Lieutenant Moti Rosen, to attack the Syrian force from behind. The force succeeded in sneaking up the Syrians undetected and opened fire, causing many casualties but one of its fighters was killed and three wounded. At around 12:30 the 51st Battalion started getting artillery support from a 334th Battalion 155mm self-propelled gun deployed near Bukata. At about 14:30, under artillery cover, the battalion charged the Syrian force from southwest and captured high point 1614, chasing away the last Syrians left on it. The Company B commander was wounded in the charge. Meanwhile, the battalion was ordered to retreat to the \\"bus parking\\" due to the 17th Battalion's failed attack near the upper ski lift. In the battle of high point 1614 four Israeli fighters were killed and thirteen wounded. The IDF estimated the Syrian casualties at twenty killed and an unknown number of wounded.Asher et al. (2008), p. 141 While the 51st Battalion was climbing up the Hermon mountainside, the motorized column with two tanks kept advancing up the road toward the outpost. The tanks were followed by the 17th Battalion forces in the following order: Company C, under Captain Yaakov Sela, the reconnaissance company's squad commanders course company, totaling at thirty-three fighters on three half-tracks. The fourth half-track was the 17th Battalion commander's command post. Drori's command half-track, followed by Company B, with eighty fighters on seven half-tracks. The brigade doctor, Captain Doctor Shraga Myblum, with two paramedics from the brigade infirmary, joined one of the half-tracks. The advance was uneventful until the lower ski-lift position. The tanks deployed in the parking lot south of the ski lift and fired at the constructions, which were empty since the 13th Battalion fighters left them on Sunday. The constructions were searched and it turned out the Syrians did not reach them. The Israeli flag was removed to be hoisted on the outpost after its recapture. A tracked bulldozer belonging to a contractor who had worked on the upper ski lift was started on Drori's order and attached to the column in case a roadblock was needed. At 09:20, Drori reported to NC that he had passed the lower ski lift and was heading toward the upper ski lift.Asher et al. (2008), p. 142 The Syrian blocking commander spotted the Israeli motorized column as it passed the \\"bus park\\". He briefed his men to the possibility of an assault and reported to the 82nd Battalion commander on its advance. Due to the terrain and low visibility that morning, the column was unseen by him until it reappeared as it ascended from the lower ski lift on its way to the \\"tank curve\\". When the Israeli column reached the sharp curve where the road crosses Wadi Guvta, about 750 meters from the \\"tank curve\\", the B-10 RCL team fired at it. The two shells missed and exploded on the wadi slope. Only the 17th Battalion commander's command post returned fire in the general direction, since no one identified its source. The column kept moving until the two tanks and the two Company C half-tracks passed the \\"tank curve\\" and stopped about 100 meters to its north. It stopped there in order to disembark a force from Company C to scan the ridge and secure its flank. A force commanded by the Company B commander was also left there to assist the 51st Battalion, after being personally briefed by Drori. While the motorized column was heading toward the \\"tank curve\\", at 09:30 a pair of aircraft form Squadron 110 attacked the Syrian forces on the Hermon. The planes had been waiting for a long time over Northern Israel. A Strela missile was fired at one of them, but missed. The aerial attack was not coordinated with Drori, and he was not updated when it took place. At that time the sky was very clouded, and the planes may have attack the Syrian Hermon.Asher et al. (2008), pp. 142-143 At around 10:00, while the 51st Battalion's leading force was exchanging fire with the Syrian force on high point 1614, and the Company B deputy commander force started moving down the range to assist the battalion, Dror ordered the Company C commander to ascend on foot to on the dirt road with two teams from his company from the \\"tank curve\\" up the ridge above the road leading to the upper ski lift, to secure the motorized column's flank, which was planned to arrive from behind. About twenty-two fighters including the company commander started moving on for on the dirt road leading through the ridgeline toward high point 2072. At that time, low clouds began to cover the landscape, and visibility was limited to a few dozen meters. A team under a platoon commander deployed right of the ridgeline and another team was deployed left of it. The company commander moved with another soldier in the center, slightly behind. After a few minutes of climb, when the first team had ascended about 200 meters up the ridge, and ahead the terrain was starting to slant, the leading force suddenly spotted below and to the right a group of ten to fifteen soldiers on the move. When they identified them as Syrians, they ran to capture the commanding area. The Syrians were also running there while opening fire. The Syrians charged several times while throwing grenades at the Israeli force, who took cover. In a very short range encounter, the Syrians were stopped and lost several soldiers. Another Syrian contingent, already located in hidden positions inside a commanding mound, fired RPG-7 shells and accurate sniper fire at them. The Israeli force was caught in a crossfire and could not advance. The Israelis were completely exposed and could not raise their heads. The Syrian force was the counterattack force of the 82nd Battalion commander with about twenty fighters. They were armed with AK-47s, RPD submachine guns, RPG antitank weapons, antitank grenades and hand grenades. The battalion commander sent it after the blocking force reported that the motorized Israeli column had reached the \\"tank curve\\". It took positions in a rocky mound about 500 meters north of the \\"tank curve\\", commanding the string of mines the Syrians had laid on the road two days earlier.Asher et al. (2008), p. 143 Since the encounter the two Company C teams were practically separate. The commander of the first team and its sergeant moved upfront with about half the team, got into a battle with a small Syrian force and were wounded. The Syrians charged at them but were stopped, mostly by the team's machine gunner, who was killed in the battle. When their ammunition started to run out, the first team retreated. The dead soldier was left on the spot. Meanwhile, the company commander tried to advance with the rest of the first team, but was wounded twice during the advance. He asked for artillery support, but was denied. When he felt he was losing control of the battle, he asked for permission to retreat. His request was approved after about an hour and fifteen minutes of fighting. The second team moved between the ridgeline and the road and heard the fire aimed at the first team. The commander and his sergeant moved ahead to look for the source of the fire. After about 100 meters up the ridge, they too drew fire from the rocks commanding the road. They called the team to join them and started moving, covering each other, until they spotted Syrian soldiers firing and throwing grenades at both the half-tracks on the road and the first team. The commander, the sergeant and the machine gunner charged, and entered the Syrian formation. In a very short range battle they succeeded in killing and wounding approximately ten Syrians, but the commander and two fighters were killed and their bodies were left on the spot. The sergeant and the other fighters kept charging northward and arrived at the western slopes of Hill 2072, where they exchanged fire at medium range with the Syrians located on the slopes. After a while the team began to retreat toward the \\"tank curve\\", evacuating the wounded. Two fighters who were killed could not be evacuated were left on the spot due to the Syrian fire. Because of the debacle and the fact that the commanders were hit, the battalion frequency became disorderly, with hysterical reports of casualties and requests for assistance. The commanders switched to the brigade frequency and could not understand the actual situation. The artillery officer's request for artillery support to aid the 17th Battalion was answered a few shells at the upper ski lift, before the battery was moved to a different sector. At about 11:30 Drori authorized the Company C force to retreat to the \\"tank curve\\". Out of the twenty-two company fighters who ascended the ridge, four were killed and nine wounded. The four dead bodies were left on the spot, on Drori's permission. The wounded were evacuated to the \\"tank curve\\" and then taken by half-tracks to the brigade medical corps company deployed west of Masada.Asher et al. (2008), pp. 143-144 While the two Company C teams were fighting up the range leading to high point 2072, Drori ordered Dror to take his tanks and Company B on half-tracks toward the upper ski lift. The string of mines laid on the road and the Syrian blocking force stopped them. Dror, his Intelligence officer and the 334th Battalion artillery officer were killed during the mine clearing, and the brigade doctor and operations officer were wounded. After the mines were cleared, the two tanks and three half-tracks moved ahead, under the command of Captain Aryeh Peled. About 500 meters after the \\"tank curve\\", the Syrian blocking force fired antitank and sniper fire at the Israelis, and stopped them. Eight Company B soldiers were killed and many wounded near the upper ski lift. A Company B platoon sent parallel to the motorized column to assist Company C was climbing the ridgeline uncoordinated with the Company C commander arrived at the lower part of Hill 2072. An attached officer and two fighters were killed and left on the spot. When Drori ordered a retreat, the rest of the platoon retreated with its wounded down the hill. Under the cover of the heavy fog, all the armored vehicles were evacuated backwards, and all the Israeli forces retreated to the tank curve, and later to the \\"bus park\\". Drori remained in the \\"tank curve\\" until the 51st Battalion stopped fighting on Hill 1613 and the Company B force got there. The Brigade Training Base staff company was ordered to stay around Masada, but followed the column up to the lower ski lift. It retreated to the \\"bus park\\" along with the others. Only the 12th Battalion command post and his Company A, who were ordered during the battle to reinforce the motorized column, remained at the \\"tank curve\\" until about 16:15.Asher et al. (2008), pp. 144-145 Aftermath The Israeli objective, recapturing the outpost and rescuing the soldiers trapped in it, was not achieved.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 189 The Israelis lost twenty-three killed and fifty-five wounded. Four bodies were left on the spot: one was left on Drori's approval, and the three who died attacking Hill 2072 were only known to be absent at the convention at Banias. The bodies of four reconnaissance soldiers were left on Drori's approval due to the Syrian fire. The Syrian 82nd Battalion suffered two killed and four wounded at the blocking force, and the reinforcement had at least seven dead and seven wounded, including three wounded officers. The 183rd Battalion had twenty killed.Asher et al.

The screenplay is by Bill MacIlwraith from a novel by Nan Maynard. It concerns a bored housewife living in a run- down inner city London house who begins an affair with her mother's lodger, who lives next door. Plot On Jubilee Place in Battersea housewife Margery (June Ritchie) lives a life of drudgery in a working class area of terraced housing with her unambitious husband Sid (Mike Pratt) and her small daughter, Cindy. Lodging next door with her mother is Harry (Ian Hendry), a flashy salesman and nightclub owner who repeatedly attempts to seduce Marge. Marge works in a Department Store in the handbags department. Her boss, Mr Fingus, is trying to have an affair with Margery. In the next house Kitty and Steve live with their good-time girl daughter, Maureen. Maureen works in a cafe with young Charlie (John Hurt). She is having an affair with a rich dentist, Mark. One day Cindy goes missing and Harry helps Marge search. Finding Cindy in a scrapyard, Marge realises Harry is much more paternal than Sid and she agrees to go for a drink and has a very nice afternoon. Meanwhile Maureen sets her eyes on another rich man, Mr Ransom, while out in a club with Mark. Marge begins an affair with Harry and they meet regularly at a mews owned by Joe. After an argument at Harry's club, Maureen and Mark have a car crash: Mark is killed and Maureen badly injured, scarring her face, and she accepts the offer of a date with Charlie, whose offers had previously received short shrift. Harry eventually tires of Marge when he meets her younger, educated sister, Jinny (Annette Andre) who has returned from college. It is clear that he is a man for whom the chase is more interesting than the catch, in this case even more so because Jinny has a boyfriend, hospital doctor Paul (Tom Adams); the two men, with their differing class backgrounds, show mutual resentment of each other, with Paul denigrating Harry as a barrow boy. Marge is still infatuated with Harry and jealous of Jinny, and suggests eloping and leaving Cindy behind. When she discovers Harry plans to marry her sister she attempts to kill herself by putting her head in the gas oven. She is saved by a shower which leads her mother to bring in the washing, close enough to the house that she smells the gas. She has left a suicide note exposing her affair with Harry, but her mother‚Äôs chance intervention means an ambulance rushes her to hospital. Mother evicts Harry, and Jinny breaks it off with him. Mother suggests to Sid that he finds another job in ‚Äòa nice clean area‚Äù. Marge recovers and Jinny marries Paul. Harry is left alone with the final scene showing Marge rejecting his renewed advances before going home to her old street and what appears to be a happier household.

The Singapore Polo Club was founded in 1886, making it the oldest polo team in what was once British Malaya and one of the oldest sporting and social clubs in Singapore. From its formation until 1914, it played at the Race Course, a major sports venue up until the 1930s, in present-day Farrer Park. Grounds The Singapore Polo Club was located at Balestier Road since 1914, but moved to Mount Pleasant for needs of better facilities. After numerous fundraising attempts, the grounds were finally founded by Singapore Turf Club, on the condition that they use it as a practice and recreational grounds and had status of it. The Japanese Imperial Army sent volunteers to collaborate in the attempts of a national identity, and the ground was complete and open for play by 1941. However, during The Second World War, the ground was used as a gun emplacement area by The Japanese Defence Forces and was rented as a squatters camp by the Salvation Army and Japanese Defence Forces. After the war, Lord Mountbatten became the patron of the ground and re-established the Polo Club. He used his British and Royal influence to renovate the Grounds and establish it as an improved playing area, with a newly renovated pitch. Pitch A new type of grass called Desso GrassMaster was installed in 2000 to improve to surface's quality. The grass, which is natural grass with enhanced artificial roots, is suitable for polo, Gaelic football and hurling, as well as the other sports played there.

In the 1920s and 1930s the company was known for the publication of the Caf√© HAG albums of heraldic emblems. The coffee brand Sanka spun off from Caf√© HAG in 1910 for the French market (\\"Sanka\\" is a contraction of sans caf√©ine), and American rights to the Sanka name were sold in 1913. The Kellogg Company purchased Roselius's American branch (based in Cleveland, Ohio) in 1928, then sold it to General Foods in 1939. General Foods acquired the original German company in 1979. In 1990 Kraft Foods merged with General Foods, thus HAG and Sanka became brands of the American company. The spelling Caf√© HAG was standardized in the 1990s. HAG has been owned by Jacobs Douwe Egberts since 2015. Caf√© HAG TV adverts were popular in the 1980s; in particular the character Klaus (played by Roger Callister) became something of a cult figure among advertisement aficionados.

Plot Having been sent a picture of her husband, a war hero killed in France, Meg Elgin is led to believe he is still alive and arranges a meeting at a London railway station. When she arrives there with the police accompanying her, she catches sight of a man in the distance wearing an old coat of her husband's. When he is pursued and captured, he turns out to be Duds Morrison, a former soldier and out-of- work actor recently let out of prison. He refuses to tell them anything, and having nothing they can charge him with, the police release him. His interest aroused by the pictures sent to Meg, her new fianc√© Geoffrey Leavitt follows Morrison and tries to demand an answer from him about his sudden appearance masquerading as Meg‚Äôs dead husband. Morrison again refuses to talk, and tries to flee from Leavitt - into an alley where he is set upon by a gang of ex- soldiers who beat him to death and take Leavitt off as a prisoner. It is soon revealed that they are ex-commandos, and former comrades of Morrison, with whom they served on a raid in Brittany in the Second World War. The commander of the raid had been Meg's husband, Major Elgin. The men had been led to believe that Elgin secreted a large amount of treasure in a house in Brittany. Now that he is dead they are desperate to get their hands on it. They are wary of their former sergeant, a psychopath named Jack Havoc, who has recently escaped from prison, committed several murders, and is also seeking out the treasure. They had attacked Morrison because they believed he was an accomplice of Havoc. Wearing their old uniforms they have spent the past few years trying to carve out a living as street musicians, begging from passers by. Realising that releasing Leavitt might open them to being charged for the murder of Morrison, they bind him up and keep him as a prisoner. He is rescued later by a beat constable who investigates the squat while the musicians are out. Leavitt returns to Meg and together they head to Brittany to find the treasure. Havoc, now united with his former comrades, also travels to France where he discovers to his disgust that when Major Elgin had spoken of his ‚Äòpriceless‚Äô treasure, he had in fact been referring to its artistic beauty rather than its monetary worth. The treasure is in fact a statue of the Madonna.

Because of its nature it can be shaped into a variety of forms and as such is found in different archaeological contexts, such as window panes, jewellery, or tableware. This is important because it can inform on how different industries of sections of societies related to each other ‚Äì both within a cultural region or with foreign societies. Glass trade is mainly studied by compositional analysis of glass objects creating groups with specific chemical compositions that hopefully allow to differentiate between production centres (both geographically and chronologically). Complications arise from the fact that for long periods of time glass was made following very similar recipes and as such the major elements found do not vary significantly. It is made by a mixture of raw materials which means that different sources of each raw material even for the same production centre further complicate the situation. That it is a material that lends itself well to recycling can only add to this. However, as scientific techniques improve it is becoming increasingly possible to discern some compositional groups, together with other archaeological and textual evidence a picture of glass technology, industry and exchange is starting to emerge.  Mesopotamia and Eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age  Coloured glass rods ready to be worked into finished products, excavated from an Ancient Egyptian glass workshop. 18th Dynasty, 16-14th century B.C.E. Glass beads are known from the 3rd millennium BC but it is only in the late 2nd millennium that glass finds start occurring more frequently, primarily in Egypt and Mesopotamia. This is not to say that it was a widespread commodity, quite the contrary. It was a material for high- status objects with archaeological evidence for the Late Bronze Age (LBA) also showing an almost exclusive distribution of glass finds at palace complexes such as that found in the city of Amarna ‚Äì Egypt. Texts listing offerings to Egyptian temples would start with gold and silver, followed by precious stones (lapis lazuli) and then bronze, copper and other not so precious stones with glass mentioned together with the lapis lazuli. In this period it was rare and precious and its use largely restricted to the elite. Shortland 2007 The oldest glass ingot was discovered in the 1300 B.C. Egyptian Uluburun shipwreck off the coast of Turkey Production of raw glass occurred at primary workshops of which only 3 are known, all in Egypt: Amarna, Pi-Ramesses and Malkata.Walton et al 2009 At the first two sites cylindrical ceramic vessels with vitrified remains have been identified as glass cruciblesRehren & Push 1997Nicholson et al 1997 where the raw materials (quartz pebbles and plant ash) would be melted together with a colourant. The two sites seem to show a specialisation in colour, with blue glass, via the addition of cobalt, being produced at Amarna and red, through copper, at Pi-Ramesses. The resulting coloured glass would then be fashioned into actual objects at secondary workshops ‚Äì far more common in the archaeological record. It seems certain that glass making was not exclusive to Egypt (in fact current scholarly opinion resides with the industry having originally been imported into the country) as there are Mesopotamian cuneiform texts which detail the recipes for the making of glass. Further supporting this hypothesis are the Amarna Letters, a contemporaneous diplomatic correspondence detailing the demand and gift giving from vassal princes in Syro-Palestine to the Egyptian King, in these the most asked for item is glass. The evidence then points to two regions that were making and exchanging glass. It seems logical to believe that at an initial stage it was glass objects, as opposed to raw glass, that were exchanged. The major element composition of glass finds from Mesopotamia and Egypt is indistinguishable with as much variation found within a specific assemblage than between different sites. This is indicative of the same recipe being used in both regions. As analytical techniques develop the presence of trace elements can be more accurately determined and it has been found that glass is compositionally identical within each region, but it is possible to discriminate between them.Shortland et al 2007 This could be a huge step in uncovering trade patterns, however at present no Egyptian glass has been found in Mesopotamia, nor have any Mesopotamian glasses been found in Egypt. Across the sea, Mycenaean glass beads were found to have been made with glass from both regions. The fact that the beads are stylistically Mycenaean would imply an import of raw glass. Archaeological evidence for this trade comes from the Uluburun shipwreck, dated to the 14th century BC. As part of its cargo it carried 175 raw glass ingots of cylindrical shape. These ingots match the glass melting crucibles found at Amarna and Pi-Ramesses. It is not yet possible to discern if trade in glass was occurring directly between the glass producing regions and foreign consumers, it is quite possible that indirect routes via trading and seafaring partners along the Mediterranean coast, trace element analysis of the Uluburun ingots might allow us to learn more. At this point we know glass was being consumed by the elites of Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia, it was produced in Egypt and Mesopotamia with workshops possibly specialising in colour and distributed locally presumably through state control to state sponsored artisans, and exported further out as raw glass ingots.  The Mediterranean during Roman times  From Hellenistic times glass production sees considerable technological developments culminating with the introduction of glass blowing in the 1st century BC. Glass objects could now be made in large scale production, with less raw material and faster and as a consequence became more common. From the early Roman times, to Byzantine and early Islamic periods the glass from Northern Europe to Eastern Mediterranean shows an incredible compositional homogeneity in its major elements. Unlike the LBA glass, Roman glass was made from the melting of sand and natron ‚Äì mineral soda ‚Äì from the Wadi Natron in Egypt.Freestone et al 2000 With one raw material being common to all glass it should be possible to differentiate between glass made from different sands using composition variation of the trace elements and certain isotope ratios.Baxter et al 2005, Freestone et al 2003, Leslie et al 2006 These compositional analyses aimed to investigate two models for glass production: glass was produced in large scale primary workshops along the Levantine coast and Egypt,Nenna et al 2000 mixing natron and sand from the mouth of the Belus river ‚Äì as mentioned by Pliny ‚Äì and then traded to local glass working workshops. If natron was traded and mixed with local sands following a strict recipe could result in the homogeneous composition. Glass making furnaces have been uncovered in Israel at two sites ‚Äì 17 at Bet Eli'ezer and 3 at Apollonia.Gorin-Rosen 2000 These are rectangular in shape measuring about 2m x 4m and matching in size a glass slab found inside a cave at Bet She'arim. The resulting slabs would be broken up into chunks that were traded to glass workshops in the Middle East and across the Mediterranean as evidenced by the contemporaneous shipwrecks carrying such glass chunks. The situation is not so simple; these workshops are dated from the 6th to the 11th century AD and although similar the compositions do not exactly match those of the earlier Roman period. Pliny, writing in the 1st century AD, describes glass making in the Levantine coast but also in Italy, Spain and Gaul ‚Äì however the installations that produced the large quantities of primary glass needed to supply the Roman industry have yet to be located.Leslie et al 2006 These same authors report a difference in isotopic ratios for oxygen and strontium that differentiates between Middle eastern and Roman glasses. Other authors counter idea of a unique centralised production with primary production reported from Northern EuropeJackson et al 2003, Baxter et al 2005 and Wolf et al 2005 and inferred for Italy.Silvestri et al 2006 Evidence for large scale production has only come the Eastern Mediterranean and from latter dates and assumes a continuing glass making tradition. That there was a large scale and centralised production even this early is evidenced by the Ouest Embiez I shipwreck ‚Äì 3rd century ‚Äì carrying 8 tons of raw glass.Foy & Jezegou 2004 This however does not exclude the smaller scale local production reported elsewhere. The Julia Felix, also sunk during the 3rd century AD, was carrying as part of its cargo glass cullet presumably for recycling.Silvestri et al 2008 Trace element analysis of colourless glass showed these were made using sands from different sources and giving some support to the de-centralised production hypothesis. By the 9th century the raw materials for glass shift again to quartz pebbles and plant ash and the 'forest glass' of medieval Europe. Natron was no longer in use and the low lime composition of the Bet'eliezer glass would be suggestive of a decline in access to the material from at least the 6th century onwards.Freestone & Gorin-Rosen 1999 This could in turn be suggestive of a shift from a trade both in natron and raw glass to tighter control over natron and increase of centralised production.  South East Asia, Africa and the Indian Ocean  Glass shows up in Northern India at the end of the 2nd millennium BC becoming more common throughout South East Asia during the following millennium. Glass beads in particular become extremely popular and together with bangles form the largest group of glass finds. From its Indian origins, glass beads spread to an area from Africa to Japan, sailing with the monsoon winds and leading to their christening as 'Trade wind beads'.van der Sleen 1973 The most common compositional type, representing 40% of the glass finds for the region, is known as mineral soda- alumina glassDussubieux et al 2008 and is found from the 4th century BC to the 16th century AD. As the name indicates this it is typically characterized by a high alumina content and was made by the probably melting of reh with local, alumina rich, sands.Brill & Rising 1999 Through LA-ICP-MS analysis, however, Carter found that Cambodia had a large amount of glass beads made of potash glass and predominantly high alumina soda glass. Potash glass is a glass that uses potash or K2O as a flux in order to decrease the melting point of the glass and is the most common type of glass found in SE Asia. Detailed compositional data recently summarised by (Lankton, & Dussubieux 2006) has uncovered several distinct and yet contemporaneous glass technologies across the Indian Ocean, but the geographical assignment is not completely clear. Two small groups show compositions matching those of natron based Mediterranean glass and Plant-ash Mesopotamian glass, demonstrating trade with these other regions. Trade in raw glass from Egypt to India was described in the 1st century texts of Periplus of the Erythraean, Mesopotamian glass increases in presence with increased Sasanian control of the Indian Ocean from the 4th to 6th centuries. It is also possible that some glass was traded via the Silk Road. The majority of glass beads found in Sub-Saharan Africa pre dating European contact are from Indian or Sri Lankan origin with a recent paper (Dussubieux et al. 2008) demonstrating contact between Kenyan sites and Chaul in the West coast of India for the 9th to the 19th century. Previously analysed samples from the East coast of Africa and Madagascar could potentially fit this group but further work is still needed. Whether Chaul was the single port for trade in glass beads or if it was part of several competing ports on that coast is still unknown. Data from a site in South Africa, near the borders with Botswana and Zimbabwe, has tentatively assigned some beads to Islamic 8th century compositions.Prinsloo & Colomban 2008 This suggests that the old camel caravan routes that connected this region to Egypt and the Mediterranean were still in use even for glass at a site with easy access, via the Limpopo river, to the Indian Ocean trade and therefore to the West Indian glass that seem to be the most common. There is enough evidence that in ancient Sri Lanka, glass was manufactured in order to use for magnifying glasses or spectacles.

He returned to England after the Revolutionary War and served in the House of Commons from 1790 until 1796. He was known for his marriage to Angelica Schuyler Church, of the prominent American Schuyler family, and being the brother-in-law of Alexander Hamilton, who died in a duel in 1804 with Aaron Burr, with whom Church had also had a duel in 1799. Early life John Barker Church was born on October 30, 1748 in Lowestoft in eastern England, the son of Richard Church (1697‚Äì1774) of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk by Elizabeth Barker (1701‚Äì1800), daughter of John Barker. Career Church was set up in business in London by his mother's brother, a wealthy uncle named John Barker who was a director of the London Assurance Company. It was reported that speculation on the stock exchange and gambling were responsible for his bankruptcy in August 1774.The Whig Club (1794), 120‚Äì21; Gent. Mag. (1774), 391. To escape his creditors he went to America, where he became one of three commissioners appointed by the Continental Congress in July 1776 to audit the accounts of the army in the northern department. There he operated under a nom de guerre as John Carter. He resigned his commission in September 1777,Journals of Continental Congress ed. Ford, v. 612; vii. 327, 341; viii. 744. and moved to Boston, Massachusetts. In Boston, he began a variety of businesses, including banking and shipping, and speculated in currency and land. In 1780, along with his business partner, Col. Jeremiah Wadsworth of Hartford, Connecticut, he secured a contract for provisioning the French forces in America, becoming Commissary General. Two years later, they were contracted as sole suppliers to the American army as well, and ended up making a fortune. Return to England After the war from 1783 until 1785, Church and his family lived in Paris while he performed his duties as a U.S. envoy to the French government. After briefly returning to America in 1785, Church and his family left for England the same year. In 1788, the Churches bought the Verney property at Wendover so that he could run for Parliament, which he did in 1790, when he was elected a Member of Parliament for Wendover. Prior to his election, he was involved with the Marquis de la Luzerne, the French ambassador in some unsuccessful stock speculation during the Nootka Crisis, a dispute between Great Britain and Spain. Verney property at Wendover Member of Parliament In December 1790, during his time in Parliament, he voted to approve Prime Minister William Pitt's plan to pay off the debts incurred in rearmament, after having previously been against the government on the Spanish convention. After his vote, he suggested the government should investigate the great amount of money held by trustees of public lands, himself included, not being utilized rather than interfere with unpaid Bank dividends. The Prime Minister thanked him for highlighting the issue. In 1791, William Curtis raised the issue again with a motion for inquiry into the trustees of Ramsgate harbour over their possession of funds. Church was appointed to the select committee as he supported the idea. In 1791, he voted in favor of the unsuccessful attempt to repeal the Test Act in Scotland. Also in 1791 and again in 1792, he voted with the opposition in the Oczakov debates concerning the Russian occupation of the Turkish port of Ochakiv on the Black Sea. In 1793, he joined the Friends of the People and voted for Grey's motion for inquiry into parliamentary reform, which did not achieve success until 1832. In December 1792, he voted against his fellow Whig, and party leader, Charles Fox's Libel amendment, but opposed the French war. Thereafter, Church regularly voted with the Foxite minority for the rest of his parliamentary career. In 1795, Church was described part of \\"a party of English Jacobins\\" who if acted upon their statements, would be \\"compromised to the extreme,\\" by Gouverneur Morris, the former American minister to France. In 1794, he tried with Fox, to stall discussions of an emigration bill in the House.Morris Diary, ii. 101; Harewood mss, Canning jnl. 17 Apr. 1794. In 1795, Church defended the proceedings at the Middlesex County meeting that was called to petition against the proposed legislation that he deemed repressive. Church was known for his hospitality of French √©migr√©s after the Reign of Terror, paying for Talleyrand's journey and tour of America, and being involved in an attempt to free the Marquis de Lafayette from prison. By 1796, he sold his property at Wendover to the Right Hon. Robert, Lord Carrington, and retired from the House of Commons. Return to the United States Wood engraving from a portrait of Philip Schuyler Church, son of John and Angelica Church The Church family returned to America for a visit in 1797, and then returned permanently in 1799 to New York, where Church became a founding director of the Manhattan CompanyChernow, p. 587 and a director of the Bank of North America. In May 1796, Church accepted a mortgage on of land, a portion of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase in present-day Allegany County and Genesee County, New York, against a debt owed to him by his friend Robert Morris. After Morris failed to pay the mortgage, Church foreclosed, and his son Philip Schuyler Church acquired the land in May 1800. To take possession of the land, Philip Church traveled to the area, near the Pennsylvania border, with his surveyor Moses Van Campen. Philip Church selected specific acreage along the Genesee River for a planned village, which he laid out to be reminiscent of Paris, including a village park in the center of town, enclosed by a circular road with streets radiating from it to form a star, and five churches situated around the circle. Philip settled there in a log cabin, and built a house when he married in 1805. He named the village Angelica, New York, after his mother. John and Angelica Church befriended many French upper-class refugees from the French Revolution, helping them settle in Allegany County and elsewhere throughout the United States. In 1806, the Churches began construction on a thirty-room mansion near the village of Angelica, called Belvidere, which still stands as a privately owned home on the banks of the Genesee in Belmont, New York. Although they had intended to make it their summer home, it instead became the residence of their son Philip and his wife when it was partially completed in 1810. In 1800, Church was admitted as an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati. Burr‚ÄìHamilton duelling pistols Church was an experienced duellist, and owned the Wogdon pistols used in the 1804 Burr‚ÄìHamilton duel. The weapons had already been used in an 1801 duel, in which Hamilton's son Philip was killed. Following the duel, the pistols were returned to Church, and reposed at his Belvidere estate until the late 19th century. See also: Later legend claimed that these pistols were the same ones used in a 1799 duel between Church and Burr, in which neither man was injured. This makes sense according to the accepted rules of the 'code duello', in which the challenged (in this case, Church) had the right to choose the weapons. However, the same rule was apparently ignored in the 1801 duel, where Philip Hamilton was the challenger and also supplied the weapons borrowed from his uncle. Also, Aaron Burr claimed in his memoir that he owned the pistols used in his duel with Church. Hamilton biographer Ron Chernow accepts Burr's version of the story.Chernow, p. 590 Personal life Mrs. John Barker Church, Son Philip, and Servant, oil on canvas, John Trumbull, c. 1785 In 1776, Church met Angelica Schuyler (1756‚Äì1814), a daughter of General Philip Schuyler, during a visit to her father's house, the Schuyler Mansion. Knowing that her father would not bless their marriage because of his suspicions about Church's past, Angelica and John eloped in 1777. It is not clear when her parents learned of their new son-in-law's actual name, as General Schuyler complained, \\"Carter and my eldest daughter ran off and married on the 23rd inst. Unacquainted with his family, his connections and situation in life, the match was exceedingly disagreeable to me, and I had signified it to him.\\" Together, John and Angelica had: *Philip Schuyler Church (1778‚Äì1861), served as aide de camp to Hamilton, who married Anna Mathilda Stewart (1786‚Äì1865), daughter of General Walter Stewart; and was a founder of the Erie Canal and Erie Railroad *Catharine \\"Kitty\\" Church (1779‚Äì1839), who married Bertram Peter Cruger (1774‚Äì1854) *John Barker Church II (1781‚Äì1865) *Elizabeth Matilda Church (1783‚Äì1867), who married Rudolph Bunner (1779‚Äì1837) *Richard Hamilton Church (1785‚Äì1786), died young *Alexander Church (1792‚Äì1803), died young *Richard Stephen Church (1798‚Äì1889), who married Grace Church *Angelica Church (b. 1800) Belvidere, the Church family estate in rural western New York, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 as a prime example of Federal style architecture. After the death of his wife in 1814, Church returned to England. He died in London on April 27, 1818, after a short illness,New York Evening Post, 19 June 1818 and was buried at St. James, Piccadilly. By this time, his estate was only worth a modest ¬£1,500.

Flowering plants have a rosette of leaves at the base of the plant and a single translucent white flower with dark green veins on a flowering stem with up to 20 stem leaves. It is one of a number of bearded orchids, some of which have yet to be formally described, all of which have a distinctive feather- like labellum.Labelled image of Pterostylis barbata Description Pterostylis barbata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of stalkless, pointed leaves. Flowering plants have a similar rosette and between ten and twenty stem leaves. The leaves are long, wide and dark green with pale areas. There is usually only a single flower long and wide on a flowering stem tall. The flower leans slightly forward and is shiny, pale translucent green with darker green veins and purple-brown markings at the front. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column and the dorsal sepal has a thin point long. The lateral sepals are joined at their bases which are dark reddish and the free part is narrow, green and long. The labellum is long and feather-like with a few pale yellow, thread-like branches and a dark brown knob on the end. Flowering occurs from July to September. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis barbata was first formally described in 1840 by John Lindley and the description was published in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet (barbata) is a Latin word meaning \\"bearded\\". Distribution and habitat The western bearded orchid grows in shrubby woodland and forest, often in thick Casuarina leaf litter and often in small clumps. It occurs between Bindoon and Albany and is common in the Darling Range near Perth. Its range includes the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions. There are twelve undescribed species of Pterostylis in Western Australia and the range of this species may be redefined when those descriptions are published. Conservation Pterostylis barbata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Broadcast monthly from 2007 to 2013, it usually featured three guest cabaret artists in addition to the hosts. After the program's surprise cancellation in 2013, it was resurrected in 2014 under the title Die Anstalt, replacing hosts Urban Priol and Frank-Markus Barwasser with Max Uthoff and Claus von Wagner. History ZDF had not broadcast a political cabaret program since the cancellation of Notizen aus der Provinz with Dieter Hildebrandt in 1979, who, as a result, switched to the other German public broadcasting channel, Das Erste, where he created the Scheibenwischer. Neues aus der Anstalt was first broadcast on 24 January 2007, when it aired just after heute journal. About the show The show was broadcast live from Munich, one Tuesday evening a month. Its theme was a fictional psychiatric clinic where Priol acted as the head of medicine, while Schramm portrayed some of his characters as patients. Schramm's pensioner Lothar Dombrowski acted as the patients' spokesperson. He also appeared as the old Hessian social democrat August and the Bundeswehr officer Oberstleutnant Sanftleben (\\"Softlife\\"). Up to three guest artists portrayed other characters, either fellow patients or outside visitors, as well. Frank-Markus Barwasser in his alter ego Erwin Pelzig replaced Schramm as the co-host of the show in 2010. Similar to the Scheibenwischer, Neues aus der Anstalt strove to limit its content to political cabaret and did not feature other kinds of humor, such as stand-up or situational comedy. The German word Anstalt (institute) is used for both mental institutions (Irrenanstalt, Nervenheilanstalt) and public broadcasting institutions (Rundfunkanstalt). Reception The show surpassed the Scheibenwischer's ratings by over a million viewers in its first episode. However the second episode was less successful. Ratings fell to the level of Scheibenwischer, although the show attracted a larger number of younger viewers, compared to the usual demographic of ZDF viewers. Although the ratings were lower than the first episode, they remained good, capturing a 13% market share (2.73 million per show) in its first year and stayed at that level.

Around the middle of the 8th century BC colonists from Euboea arrived. The city became well known for its Temple of Dionysus, which appears to have been built in the second half of the 8th century BC. At Aphytis, Ammon was worshipped, at least from the time of the Spartan general Lysander, as zealously as in Ammonium, sanctuary in Libya. According to Pausanias, the patron of Aphytis, Ammon Zeus, appeared in a dream to Lysander and urged him to raise the siege, which he did.

During archaic and classical times Aphytis was a prosperous city, minting its own coins, which depicted the head of its patron, Ammon Zeus, the city's economy appears to have been mainly based on farming and vine-culture.

Woods, along with colleagues Dr. Dirk Vanderwall of University of Idaho and Dr. Ken White of Utah State University, led a team of scientists in 2003 that cloned Idaho Gem, the world's first cloned mule. The cloning of Idaho Gem was a part of a larger scientific study intended to understand human diseases. Horses, mules, and other equines have lower rates of cancer than humans. Woods, Vanderwall, White and their team hoped that the cloning of mules and other equines would provide an important scientific insight into the different cancer rates between humans and equines. Woods was particularly interested in the role that calcium played in the development of cancer. Horses and mules have less calcium in their cell walls than humans. Woods' colleague, Dirk Vanderwall, later explained Woods' goals during the Idaho Gem cloning, \\"That certainly was another primary focus of Gordon's...to use the horse as a model to try to understand age-onset diseases in people. Gordon's hypothesis was that excessive intracellular calcium in human cells could be an underlying factor in age-onset diseases.\\" Woods departed the University of Idaho in 2007 and joined the faculty of Colorado State University.

The building sits between 81st and 82nd St. on Columbus Avenue in New York City's Upper West Side diagonal from the American Museum of Natural History. The origin and construction of the hotel The original hotel was built by Charles A. Fuller and designed by Edward Angell, who also designed several other prominent buildings on the Upper West Side. The hotel was originally intended to be an apartment house, the Endicott. The original plans filed in April 1889 called for two buildings, each with 44 families and seven stories high. But the initial plans were not approved by the Building Department. After several changes to the plans, the Endicott began construction in 1889 at a cost of over $1,500,000. The first building, opening on 81st Street for 52 families was finished in 1890; the second building on 82nd Street for 72 families opened in 1891.New York Times, June 29, 1902 When the hotel opened, it was described as \\"in all respects, the finest and best appointed in this part of the city.\\" The Hotel was built of Roman brick and terra cotta and boasted many modern marvels of its day including steam heat, lighting by its own electric plant, and good ventilation. The original decor was elaborate, sporting marble tile and onyx wainscoting.History and Commerce of New York, 1891 By American Publishing and Engraving Co The original hotel included a glass-roofed Palm Room where today in its place is the restaurant The Milling Room. There was a dining room on the second floor which could seat upwards of 500 to 600 people, as well as a cafe, barber shop and newsstand on the ground floor. Outside, the platforms of the Ninth Avenue El's 81st Street station ran by the hotel's third floor windows.The Upper West Side, Michael V. Susi, The early days of the hotel (1890s) From its earliest days, the hotel often played host to meetings of the elite of society and often served as the meeting place for the city's Republican Party. The cost of a suite at that time was $65 a month or upward furnished, or $50 a month unfurnished. The hotel also faced issues with race relations early on. In 1893, soon after opening, the hotel's chambermaids and pantry girls threatened a strike when a non-union \\"colored waiter\\" took the place of a union striker. The manager made an agreement with the strikers to pay them $32 a month and discharge the non-union (colored) waiter.The New York Times, May 2, 1893 In 1897, there was an explosion at the hotel when Charles E. Tripler, a chemist and inventor, was exhibiting a \\"secret fluid compound\\" made of nitrogen and oxygen to some friends. Tripler poured the liquid on bread, whiskey and pure alcohol, freezing them. One of the spectators touched a lighted match to the alcohol, shattering the glass and injuring several onlookers.The New York Times, March 30, 1897 The hotel seemed to run into hard financial times almost from the beginning. The Hotel Endicott changed hands several times during the period, from Charles Fuller to Cyrus C. Marble and Benjamin Gates to Cyrus Marble and Isaac Anstatt. The turn of the century (1900-1909) Throughout the 1900s, the hotel was frequently mentioned in the society pages. By then, according to an article in the Brooklyn Eagle, a room at the Endicott cost $3 on the American plan (including room and meals) and $1 for the European plan (room only). The hotel was home to several disasters and scandals during the first decade of the century. In 1900, the hotel was the site of a grisly murder when Mrs. Mary Hayes was shot in the left temple by Dr. Franklin Caldwell, who then shot himself. Dr. Caldwell was an assistant to Mrs. Hayes' husband, Dr. E.P. Hayes, a dentist at the Siegel Cooper Company. Caldwell allegedly had an infatuation with his employer's wife.The New York Times, February 25, 1900 The year 1904 was particularly tough for the hotel. In May, a \\"mentally unbalanced\\" forty-year-old woman dropped from one of the hotel's sixth story rooms and died shortly afterward.The New York Times, May 21, 1904 A month later, a former state senator was assaulted in the lobby of the hotel.The New York Times, June 13, 1904 Then in September, Don Carlos Frederico von Bauditz, the 26-year-old head of a wealthy Venezuelan family, shot himself in the head after a shattered romance.The New York Times, September 28, 1904 In 1909, the hotel witnessed one of the stranger events in its storied history. One of the chambermaids of the hotel had fallen in love with the superintendent of a nearby building on W. 83rd St. According to the Joseph Freal, the object of her affections, he had avoided the woman who appeared to be stalking him. Out of desperation, the chambermaid showed up to his apartment, drank carbolic acid, then knocked on the door of Freal's apartment. She died soon after.The New York Times, December 17, 1909 There were two major fires in the Endicott during the 1900s. In 1902, a fire broke out in the hotel when chemicals used by a chamber maid blazed up in some unexplained manner and set fire to the hangings.The New York Times, March 9, 1902 Then in 1905, another fire broke out due to a faulty flue in the kitchen. The fire ate its way through the flooring of the second floor dining room.The New York Times, January 24, 1905 The hotel continued to change hands throughout the period. In 1901, the Hotel Endicott property, was sold by Isaac Anstatt and Cyrus C. Marble to the Hotel Endicott Company for $499,500 plus the assumption of all liens on the property. 1910-1929 From 1910-1929, the Endicott continued to play an important role in the social life of New York. It was the site of several major society weddings and hosted several political and scientific conferences over the years. But the property's financial misfortunes continued. In late 1911, the executors of the Marshall O. Roberts estate brought suit against the hotels owners, who at the time included John D Rockefeller, to secure two mortgages made to Charles Fuller for $650,000.The New York Times, November 25, 1911 In August, after considerable legislation, the property was sold under foreclosure and transferred to the trustees of the estate, for an expressed consideration of $750,000.The New York Times, September 13, 1912 Later in October that year, the property was leased by the trustees for $1 million for 21 years to William and J. Manger, bankers of 10 Wall Street, who at the time also owned the Plaza Hotel in Chicago.The New York Times, September 14, 1912 Depression and the decline of the Endicott (1929-1978) When the depression hit in 1929, the neighborhood began to spiral downward and the hotel gradually fell into disrepair. In 1932, the building was auctioned to Diederich A. Christoffers, on a bid of $10,000 above a mortgage of $500,000.The New York Times, November 29, 1933 Throughout the 1930s, the building became a center for organized crime. The infamous gangster Dutch Schultz maintained a residence in the building. It also likely served as the headquarters for the Moe and Shim Syndicate, an alleged liquor ring during the age of prohibition that distributed more than 650,000 gallons of alcohol.The New York Times, January 15, 1983 By the late 1940s and 1950s, the hotel had gone downhill. According to one mafia drug pusher, \\"Uncle Sonny,\\" it was a venue where he could fill his packets with money from addicts, \\"some rich and famous, and some down and out losers who apparently had money.\\" According to Sonny, jazz singer Billie Holiday had a room there and by then had become a hardened heroin user.For Members Only: The Story of the Mob's Secret Judge, G. T. Harrell In 1951, the hotel was leased by Milner Hotels, owner of the Eagle Hotels chain. It was to be completely remodeled and renamed the New Endicott Hotel. Yet the hotel continued its decline. By the 1960s, the hotel had been branded one of the worst welfare hotels in the city. A person could get a room there for $3 a night or, as most of its residents did, from $13.95 a week.November 5, 1967 Described by one neighbor as \\"a scene from Calcutta,\\" scores of desperate people could be seen drinking, fighting, and screaming with prostitutes roaming up and down the metal stairways selling themselves. In 1964, a 33-year-old man was arrested for shooting off a rifle on the roof of the hotel.The New York Times, August 20, 1964 By the early 1970s, the Endicott had become very dangerous. At the time, about 40-50% of its tenants were receiving welfare. Management tried to evict \\"undesirable elements\\" from the premises but was unsuccessful. A violent crime wave struck the building. In 1972, there was a slaying of four women in the hotel. In 1973, a 63-year-old welfare recipient was found murdered and the body set afire. Then in 1974, a man was stabbed to death in the elevator. The sole highlight was that it played host to the American rock band, the New York Dolls' first public performance around Christmastime 1971. Workers at the hotel were organizing a party for the residents; they heard the Dolls jamming across the street and asked if they'd play in exchange for free food.http://www.americanheritage.com Gentrification and conversion to coops (1979-present) By the late 1970s, the neighborhood had begun to recover and gentrification hit several upper west side buildings including the Endicott Hotel. In 1979, Robert Quinlan embarked on an $8.2 million project to convert the Endicott hotel into Museum Park Apartments, featuring 146 coop apartments and several commercial condominiums. Stephen B. Jacobs, who led several other condominium conversion projects at the time, was the architect for the ambitious project.The New York Times, March 29, 1981 The 144 apartments were put on the market in March 1981. They had nearly all sold by June, at prices ranging from $67,000 to $205,000.New York Magazine, Aug 30, 1982 Peter Salwen in his book Upper West Side Story wrote that ‚ÄúBy 1983, even the Endicott Hotel had been emptied, fumigated and converted to expensive co-ops.‚Äù The newly revived building included ground floor shops with wood facades including the Penny Whistle Toys Shop, Salou (a custom florist), and Endicott Book Sellers. In November 1982, movie mogul Dino De Laurentiis turned the restored Palm Court into DDL Foodshow, a specialty food shop. On a 34-foot marble counter, De Laurentiis served countless varieties of cheeses, breads, salads, even a suckling pig or two. By April 1984, DDL Foodshow had succumbed, along with many neighbors, to what the Times then called ‚Äúone of the biggest retailing busts in recent memory.‚Äù After several other unsuccessful attempts, the space became what is now the Milling Room, with Executive Chef Scott Bryan (formerly of Veritas). Olde Good Things, New York City's architectural salvage company, had a shop in this building from about 2010 to 2014.http://ogtstore.com/blog/?p=4162#.Va444nix768 See also * List of former hotels in Manhattan Notes Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1891 Category:Defunct hotels in Manhattan Category:Upper West Side ","title":"Endicott Hotel"},{"id":"24153846","text":"M.

He was educated at Berkhamsted School, an independent school in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, and attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and served with the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers as a lieutenant in Ireland and Germany. He soon realized that the military was not what he was looking for and attended Saint Martin's School of Art in London. At the beginning of the 1960s, while still at Saint Martin's, Laing was introduced to artists in New York City. He met Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Jim Rosenquist and Robert Indiana. After art school he moved there, and with his connections, his art career began to take off.  Career  Laing's career took him from the avant-garde world of 1960s pop art, through minimalist sculpture, followed by representational sculpture and then back full circle to his pop art roots. He also taught sculpture at the University of New Mexico and at Columbia University in New York City. In 1993 the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh staged a retrospective exhibition of his work. In 2012 Sims Reed Gallery staged an exhibition of his prints and multiples, his most comprehensive show of work to date. Laing did a series of anti-war paintings, based primarily on photographs from the atrocities at Abu Ghraib. These paintings were the beginning of his return to pop art. They were followed in 2004 by a series of Amy Winehouse paintings, as well as a painting of Victoria Beckham and Kate Moss. On 19 February 2012 a bronze sculpture by Laing, Dreamer, was stolen from Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow. In February 2014, Laing's Brigitte Bardot painting from 1963 work sold for ¬£902,500 in an auction at Christie's in London, a record sum for the artist.http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/gerald-laing-brigitte- bardot-5766936-details.aspx Sims Reed Gallery represents the Estate of Gerald Laing.

During its operation, it held approximately 3,000 political prisoners, of whom about 2,500 died at Jiabianguo, mostly of starvation.Wen Huang (2009): I hope to be remembered as a writer who speaks the truth, guest post at Three Percent - a resource for international literature at the University of RochesterSarah Halzack (2009): Surviving Jiabiangou, The Washington Post, August 23, 2009 Jiabiangou was a camp for \\"re-education through labor\\" that was used to imprison intellectuals and former government officials that were declared to be \\"rightist\\" in the Anti-Rightist Movement of the Communist Party. Some inmates were sent to Jiabiangou on the grounds that they had relatives who had owned a business or held a position in the Kuomintang government. Originally designed as a prison to hold 40 to 50 criminals, the camp was overcrowded with 3,000 political prisoners. The camp is located to the northeast of Jiuquan City,James D. Seymour, Richard Anderson (1998): New ghosts, old ghosts: prisons and labor reform camps in China, And East Gate Book, p. 179, footnote B on the edge of the Badain Jaran Desert. As a consequence, agriculture in the camp area was limited to small patches of grassland in an oasis surrounded by salt marshes and desert. Yet, no external food supplies were offered to the prisoners. The result was a famine that started in the fall of 1960. In order to survive, prisoners ate leaves, tree barks, worms and rats, human and animal waste, and flesh from dead inmates. The bodies of the dead were left unburied on the sand dunes surrounding the camp as the surviving prisoners were too weak to bury them. The starvation at Jiabianguo took place during the Great Leap Forward (1958-1961) and the Great Chinese Famine (1959-1962), which is estimated to have caused many millions of excess deaths. In December 1960, senior officials of the Communist Party learned of the situation in the camp and launched an investigation. As a result, amnesties were issued to the survivors and the camp's remaining population evacuated early in 1961. In October 1961, the government ordered the closure of Jiabiangou as well as a cover-up. Authorities in GansuN.N.

The highway begins at Wittsburg and runs northeast to Highway 1, Highway 1 Business (AR 1B) and Crowley's Ridge Parkway (CRP) in Jonesboro. A spur route runs in Jonesboro. All routes are maintained by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ArDOT). Almost all of the route is concurrent with Crowley's Ridge Parkway, with a portion also serving as an Arkansas Heritage Trail for its use during the Civil War. Route description Highway 163 runs in Northeast Arkansas, a region mostly characterized by the Arkansas Delta, a sparsely populated rural area with farms and small settlements. However, Highway 163 runs its entire length along Crowley's Ridge, a small loess ridge rising above the flat Delta. The route passes several cultural and historical points in the region, including a historic cotton gin and an American Civil War trail. State maintenance begins at Wittsburg near the Wittsburg Store and Gas Station, with the roadway continuing south as a county road. Highway 163 runs north to a junction with US 64 and the Crowley's Ridge Parkway (CRP). The routes briefly overlap to the east, with Highway 163/CRP turning north and passing the John H. Johnston Cotton Gin Historic District and the Capt. Isaac N. Deadrick House, both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Highway 163/CRP run north, serving as the eastern terminus for Highway 364 and meeting Highway 42 near Birdeye. After crossing into Poinsett County, the routes serve as the southern terminus of Highway 373 before passing Lake Poinsett State Park. Highway 163/CRP intersect Highway 14 east of Harrisburg, including a brief overlap. Continuing north, Highway 163/CRP intersect Highway 214, Highway 158, and Highway 69 before entering Craighead County. Highway 163 has a junction with Highway 158 in southern Craighead County before turning northwest toward Jonesboro. Shortly after entering the city, Highway 163 Spur begins at the parent route, running north as Apt Drive through a residential subdivision. Highway 163 continues west, intersecting with Highway 1, where it terminates, with the roadway continuing north as Highway 1B. History Between Jonesboro and US 64, Highway 163 is designated as an Arkansas Heritage Trail. During the Civil War, Union General John Wynn Davidson used the route to march cavalry from southeast Missouri down Crowley's Ridge, following a rumor Confederate General Sterling Price's army was planning to attack Missouri via Crowley's Ridge. After marching and finding no Confederates, General Davidson headed west and started the Little Rock Campaign in 1863. The route was established by the Arkansas State Highway Commission (ASHC) on July 10, 1957, beginning at the Poinsett County line and running south through Birdeye to a county road.. The southern terminus was extended south by on September 17, 1958.. The route was created in accordance with Act 148 of the 1957 General Assembly. It was extended south to Levesque on June 29, 1960.. A second segment was created from Lake Poinsett State Park to Harrisburg on June 23, 1965,. though the gap between the routes was closed four months later.. The route was extended north to Jonesboro on July 29, 1976; the same order created the spur route. On June 30, 1983, the route was extended south from Levesque to Wittsburg, along the original 1926 alignment of Highway 163\\\\. The extension was made in exchange for decommissioning a segment of Highway 364 at the request of the county judge of Cross County. Major intersections Mile markers reset at some concurrencies.

It serves the ZIP Code 10927, which covers the village. It was built in the mid-1930s as a New Deal project. Like many other post offices from that era, it is a brick building in the Colonial Revival architectural style. It features a high level of ornamentation, possibly due to the influence of James Farley, a native of the Haverstraw area who was Postmaster General at that time. In 1988 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The post office is located on the south side of Main between Front and South streets, across from the Haverstraw King's Daughters Public Library. To the east the land slopes gently down through a park to the Hudson River a short distance away. Houses are located to the west and south. Its square main block is a one-story, five-bay structure of brick in Flemish bond with an east wing and a slightly projecting pavilion on the north (front) elevation. The flat roof is topped with a cornice and parapet. Fenestration on the front pavilion consists of three round-arched openings. All are flanked by limestone Greek Revival-inspired Corinthian pilasters with a similar keystone in the arch. Above the pilasters on the facade is a frieze with rosettes at the ends and \\"UNITED STATES POST OFFICE\\" in carved lettering. The windows at the sides of the pavilion have a Federal style carved garland lintel, recessed panel above and rusticated piers on the sides. The south and west facades follow a similar pattern. On the east is a wing with a loading dock. Granite steps and a wheelchair ramp lead up to the main entrance, modern aluminum doors between two Doric pilasters supporting an entablature with swan's-neck pediment. It leads into a wooden vestibule with carved rosettes and triglyphs, which opens onto the main lobby. There, terrazzo flooring is complemented by panelled wainscoting and plaster walls, ceiling and Gothic cornice. The door to the postmaster's office is framed with carved rosettes, sheaves of wheat and dentils. History Haverstraw's first post office, also the first in Rockland County, was established in 1815. A post office was located on the present site from the 1880s to 1915, and afterwards in a leased location on New Main Street. In 1931 the construction of a new post office in Haverstraw was authorized when Congress passed an amended version of the Public Buildings Act of 1926, in an early attempt to ease the Great Depression. Construction did not begin until 1935, when James Farley, then Postmaster General, a native of nearby Stony Point, laid the cornerstone. Farley's influence may not only have secured funding for the building, it may have affected the design. Most new post offices of the era were also brick Colonial Revival structures, designs often reused in different locations. Haverstraw's, designed by Treasury Department Supervising Architect Louis Simon, shares a similar basic form with the Norwich post office upstate, built two years earlier. Few have the intricate ornamentation of Haverstraw's, with liberal use of limestone and terra cotta. Since its construction there have been some alterations. A balustrade on the roof was removed. All the front window sash save for the window above the main entrance has been replaced, and the loading area was moved from the south to the east. New lockboxes and lighting have also been installed in the lobby.

Licensed to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States, the station serves the Williamsport area. The station is currently owned by Van Michael, through licensee Backyard Broadcasting of Pennsylvania LLC. History The previous call letters, WRVH, once belonged to a Hudson Valley, New York, FM station, located at 105.5 on the FM dial, broadcasting as a class A facility with 3,000 Watts of effective radiated power. Its studio was located on New York State Route 292 in Patterson, NY. That station was licensed in 1982 and was the brainchild of Edward Valentine, who served as the station's general manager, as well as co-owner. It was owned by Richard Novik of North Salem, and Edward Valentine of Wappingers Falls, a retired engineer with International Business Machines. The station played \\"Beautiful Music\\" format during the weekdays and on Sunday evenings at 7:30PM, the station featured an audiophile-oriented program called \\"Adventures in Sound\\", hosted by Anthony Fast. The station changed to Adult Contemporary format after the Beautiful Music format ended in 1986. The WLMY calls were originally on the station known today as WAGL, in suburban Olean, New York. WBYB is a semi-satellite of WLMI in Kane, PA. In 2008, Backyard Broadcasting had attempted to buy WBYB (then known as WFRM-FM), but could not follow through and lost the bid to WLMI's owners. WLMI changed the call sign to WLMY, but then, switched it quickly to WBYB (while the owner claims this was a reference to the Bob FM brand that WLMI was running, BYB was also, coincidentally, an abbreviation used by BackYard Broadcasting), began broadcasting its own country music format against Backyard's market leader, WPIG, and hired several former WPIG staffers. Thus, Backyard likely picked up the WLMY calls as a (relatively weak) retaliatory gesture. In another coincidence, WOTH was, in a previous incarnation, the FM sister station to WLYC (AM 1050), which was owned by the same company as WLMI until 2010. On January 7, 2020, WLMY changed its callsign to WOTH.

After a successful trial, he moved to the south coast in December 1895 making his debut for the \\"Saints\\" when he took over from George Marshall against Chatham at the Antelope Ground on 18 January 1896. Hodgkinson retained his place for the rest of the season, making seven appearances, scoring twice (both in a 5‚Äì0 defeat of New Brompton on 28 March) with Southampton finishing in third place. Saints' trainer, Bill Dawson, nicknamed him \\"Ironside\\", as his short cropped hair and rolled-up sleeves gave him a tough image, which he maintained throughout his time with the Saints. Hodgkinson retained his place for the start of the next season, as Saints went through the season undefeated. Hodgkinson and his fellow defenders only conceded 18 goals in 20 matches, as Southampton claimed the Southern League title for the first of six times over the next eight seasons. Hodgkinson missed the final five matches of the League season through injury, with local schoolmaster William Ponting replacing him. Hodgkinson was ever-present in the FA Cup where the Saints reached the Second Round proper, losing 3‚Äì1 to Newton Heath after a replay.

The Canon XL-1 is a three-CCD standard definition camcorder made from 1997 to 2001. The camera was designed for the prosumer market, and was very popular with independent filmmakers. The XL-1 was the follow-up camera to the GL-1, and it adds new features such as a more powerful 3CCD system. The successor to the XL-1s is the Canon XL-2. The XL-1 and XL-1s have many features of a high-end camera such as interchangeable lenses, viewfinders, and XLR inputs. Many features of the XL-1s were carried over into the Canon GL-2 and XL-2. The Canon XL-1 and the XL-1s were designed to be very customizable. The camera's features include: *4:3, and electronic 16:9 (non native) anamorphic aspect ratios. *60i, as well as \\"Frame\\" 30p picture modes. *Optical Image Stabilization with the included 16X L ISII lens. *ND Filter The feature-length film 28 Days Later was partly shot using an XL-1. Canon XL-2 Canon XL2 with some peripheral attachments, including wireless microphones and external monitor The Canon XL-2, released in 2004, is Canon's prosumer 3CCD standard definition camcorder. The XL-2 is the big brother to the GL family and the successor of the similar looking Canon XL-1s. It is succeeded by the Canon XL-H1 with a similar 20x lens and similar design, but in black. The Canon XL-2 was designed to be very customizable, along with an array of pro-grade features. Some of these include: *4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios *60i, 24p, and 30p frame rates **with selectable 2:3 or 2:3:3:2 pulldown in 24p mode *4-channel audio *Optical Image Stabilization with the included 20X L IS lens *Control of gamma, knee, and much more to get the desired picture *Open architecture Design *Interchangeable lenses, one of the most popular lenses is the 3x zoom wide angle lens often used for short films as it has a low price. The camera also has 2 XLR inputs in the back, as well as the capability to add 2 more with an adapter that plugs into the accessory shoe. This makes it useful for use with wireless microphones or other audio sources. The XL2 records to a miniDV tape and can export to a computer via a FireWire (IEEE 1394) port. The XL2 is one of only a few cameras that can record to all 4 miniDV audio tracks simultaneously. Canon XL H1 The Canon XL-H1 HDV camera, with a few accessories. The Canon XL H1 is Canon's first HDV camcorder with interchangeable lenses. It is the successor to the Canon XL-2 which is the successor to the widely used Canon XL-1s. It can shoot in the HDV standard resolution of 1440√ó1080 pixels and has 3 native interlaced 1440√ó1080 CCDs (The photosites are 1.33:1 aspect ratio, allowing for a full 16:9 frame.) where Sony's HVR-V1U has 960√ó1080 diagonal photosites, and Panasonic's AG-HVX200 pixel shifted 960√ó540 (goes to 1280√ó1080 but theoretically with pixel shift, has a resolution of 1440√ó810). The camera can also shoot in standard definition in either 16:9 or 4:3. It has an HDSDI uncompressed output. There's also component uncompressed HD output. Shooting formats NTSC configuration: *1080: 60i, 30f, 24f. *480: 60i, 30f, 24f. PAL configuration: *1080: 50i, 25f. *576: 50i, 25f. Users can pay for Canon to re-configure the camera to shoot in 50i and 25f. 24f, not to be taken as 24p, is derived from cooler running interlaced CCDs that are clocked at 48 Hz. Every two of the 48 fields are captured at precisely the same moment in time providing an image capture in camera without the need of any additional internal cooling devices for the CCDs. The digital signal processor that enables the CCDs to capture in the \\"f\\" frame rate is called DIGIC DV II (DIGital Image Core ‚Äì DigitalVideo version II). The technology is similar to the DIGIC II that Canon uses for their digital still cameras. Much of the technology is being kept under wraps, and the manufacturer of the CCDs is being kept secret. Compatibility The XL H1 is shipped by Canon in one of two basic configurations, aiming the unit at either NTSC or PAL markets. The NTSC configuration supports NTSC DV and NTSC HDV 1080i60 30f and 24f. The PAL configuration supports PAL DV and HDV at 1080i50. A modification is available from a Canon Authorised Service Centre to make a single unit capable of both sets of systems, allowing users to switch \\"personality\\" through an on- screen menu selection. Owners of the PAL / 1080i50 version will probably require this modification, as it is a pre-requisite to obtaining 24f operation. At present, the XL H1 24f and 30f HDV is supported by major non- linear editing systems such as Canopus/Grass Valley Edius 5.0, Sony Vegas, Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0, Apple Final Cut Pro 5.1.2 and Avid Xpress Pro. As of January 29, 2007, Final Cut Pro does not support Standard Definition 24f or 30f. 1080i60 and 1080i50 are cross-compatible with Sony's implementation of HDV; Canon 1080i50 and 1080i60 can play on Sony HDV cameras and decks. Canon's 24f, 25f, and 30f are not cross-compatible with Sony's implementation of HDV. No 1080 HDV footage will play on JVC HDV cameras or decks. 2008 updates In 2008, Canon updated their XL line with the addition of the XL H1A and XL H1S. The H1A and H1S are almost exactly the same except for the exclusion of the \\"Jackpack\\" (HD SDI, Genlock, Timecode) on the H1A. The kit lens includes an iris ring and a more sensitive zoom. The H1S and H1A also have a stronger headphone jack. They are no longer made out of plastic, but metal, making them less prone to breaking. Canon XH-A1(s)/XH-G1(s) Canon XH A1 The XH A1 and the XH G1 are professional handheld HDV camcorders manufactured by Canon. The form factor of the cameras is a close successor to the Canon GL2, with the newer HDV models being slightly larger and heavier. The cameras are marketed towards independent and documentary filmmakers, and for broadcasters and journalists for electronic news gathering. Both cameras share the same basic design and body, though the XH G1 is geared towards professional multi-camera production and includes connections for HD-SDI/SD- SDI Out, genlock, and time code. The cameras were originally released in 2006, the updated versions XH-A1s and XH G1s came out in December 2008. The Canon XH A1 has been used in a variety of applications in broadcast, on-line, and theatrical productions. Use of the camera in professional applications includes the Chicago Tribune's on-line videos,DV Magazine - Canon XH A1: Read All About It! and the camera was used for the production of the motion picture Crank: High Voltage.Crank 2: High Voltage Being Shot With Cheapo Best Buy HD Cameras, Still Ridiculous Technical details The XH A1 with a typical ENG setup The camera is capable of shooting and recording with either 60 Hz or 50 Hz scanning rates. The default rate depends on the region where the camera is sold, but the camcorder can be made 50 Hz / 60 Hz switchable for additional fee. Video is recorded to MiniDV cassettes with a maximum record time of 80 minutes. CCDs are the image sensor technology used in the camera with a resolution of 1440 √ó 1080 in high definition Mode. When recording in standard definition in a 4:3 aspect ratio an area of 1080 √ó 1080 pixels is used on the sensor, and the entire 1440 √ó 1080 sensor is used for 16:9 standard definition recording.Canon XH-A1 SpecificationsThe XH-A1 showing a professional shotgun microphone and XLR audio Customizations to the image on the camera include gamma, knee, black levels, color gain, and sharpness settings. These settings allow the operator to develop a look for the production within the camera. Shooting modes of both HDV and DV include 60i, 30F, and 24F for a 60 Hz version. 50 Hz version offers recording modes of 50i and 25F. Vertical resolution of the progressive video shot in \\"F\\" mode is about 25% lower than theoretically possible, because it is generated from interlaced CCD sensors by using row-pair summation, but is still higher than the resolution of a single field.Progressive: what you need to know Tapes, recorded in HDV \\"F\\" mode are compatible with Native Progressive Recording mode offered on some Sony camcorders. A progressive video output is available via a FireWire (IEEE 1394) port. 1080i or 480i component video is via a D3 connector more commonly seen on Japanese consumer electronics. To preserve compatibility with existing interlaced equipment, 480i composite video is always available via either a BNC connector, or a 3.5mm TRS connector. Video shot in DV \\"F\\" mode is recorded to tape in interlaced format. 2008 updates Canon released its model XH A1S and XH G1s in 2008. Updated features include acceleration/deceleration control of the zoom, separate audio sensitivity settings for the two input XLR audio channels and the ability to simultaneously record sound from the input and external microphone.Canon Press release: New XH A1S and XH G1S Camcorders ..., accessed 12. April 2009 Optics The XH A1 lens with its three control rings visibleThe built-in lens has a focal length of 4.5 mm - 90 mm (equivalent to 32.5 mm - 650 mm for 35 mm), with a maximum f/stop of f/1.6. Canon also includes its image stabilization technology on the camera, the same technology used in many of their Single-lens reflex camera lenses. The lens body has three rings affecting focus, zoom and aperture; however these rings do not manually drive the lens. Instead, sensors measure the movement of the rings and electronically drive the lens through built-in motors allowing for smoother operation and more feedback telling the user exactly what focal range, aperture f-number and zoom number the lens is set to. The lens thread supports 72 mm filters and adapters such as fish-eye and wide angle lenses. Modern devices such as the Letus35 also allow for 35 mm lenses to be attached providing a very shallow depth of field and create a more \\"film\\" like feel which is often desired by many amateur film makers and allows for even greater operational flexibility of the XH A1. Audio Canon XH A1 showing two channels of XLR audio with a number of features present through physical slide button settings.The XH A1 provides two channels of audio through the built-in microphone or via external XLR audio. In HDV mode the camera can record two 16-bit channels at a rate of 192 kbit/s and 1.5 Mbit/s in DV mode. The official web site states that (HDV standard): HDV: 2-channel recording MPEG1 Audio Layer II: (bit rate 384 kbit/s) In SD mode: DV: 2-channel recording PCM digital recording: 16 bits (48 kHz), 12 bits (32 kHz, 12 bits selectable). XH-A1s improves audio connections and dessing flaws from original XH-A1. Canon XM2/GL2 The GL2 has fewer features than the GL1, but is much more portable. Canon XM2/GL2 is a PAL or NTSC Mini DV camcorder, the successor to the Canon XM1/GL1. Features Part of their high-end, \\"prosumer\\" range, notable features include zebra patterning, colour gain, phase and sharpness. It has a 2.5 inch LCD display and 0.44 inch viewfinder, a bulky auto/manual focus button on the front, and a large rubber manual focus ring for quick or pull focusing. It also includes such features as 3‚Ä≥ CCDs, manual and auto focus and white balance, and the ability to attach a wide variety of accessories, making it popular with amateur and independent filmmakers. It has a fixed fluorite zoom lens and records to MiniDV cassettes. Its operating weight, when batteries and tapes are included, is under four pounds. The GL2 differs from its predecessor, the Canon GL1, in a few notable ways. First, The CCD was improved to allow more accurate edge-to-edge imaging. While this was entirely in the overscan area of broadcast television, the improvement is visible in conversions to film and in video distributed on the web. Slower shutter speeds were introduced, all the way down to 1/8 of a second in video mode. The GL2 also introduced features for digital effects and colour bars in- camera, as well as 1.7 Megapixel still camera features for use with an SD Card.

Still images may be recorded onto an SD flash memory card with an image resolution of either 1280√ó960 or 640√ó480 and an image quality of either fine or standard. When held in the hands, the Canon DV 012 is a sturdy camcorder that imparts a heavy feeling of ruggedness. It was replaced by the Optura 200 MC, which has a nearly identical exterior appearance. *Canon MVX250i (known in North America as the Canon Elura 70) Canon MVX100i Canon MVX100i The Canon MVX100i is a MiniDV camcorder. It features a 16√ó optical zoom and a 320√ó digital zoom, a 2.5-inch LCD screen, and a manual focus feature. It also features manual adjustment for brightness, audio volume, exposure, white balance and has several built-in digital effects, including nine fades and nine video effects. The MVX100i also has the ability to take still pictures that can be saved to an SD memory card, and can record video in long and short play. The audio system is a PCM digital stereo and can capture in 16 or 12 bits. The terminal features sockets for headphones, external microphones, analogue-in, direct print, AV and S-video, and the video is captured to a computer via either FireWire or USB. It has an accessory shoe on the top and takes a Li-ion battery. It weighs 620 grams.Canon UK Canon MVX250i The MVX250i (as it is known in Europe), or the Elura 70 (as it is known in North America), is a digital video camera manufactured under the Canon brand. One of its features is an optional aspect ratio of 16:9.PC World article Canon HV10 The Canon HV10 is a consumer high definition video (HDV) camcorder released in September 2006. The HV10 features both HDV and DV recording. DV can be recorded in both 4:3 and 16:9 formats. In Europe, the camcorder is called the HV10E and features PAL DV recording in addition to HDV 1080i50 mode. The HV10 does 1080i60 and NTSC. It can capture video at the full 1920 √ó 1080 interlaced resolution, however the horizontal resolution is reduced when it is stored to tape in the HDV standard of 1440 √ó 1080 resolution. Canon HV20 Canon HV20 camcoder The Canon HV20 is an HDV camcorder. Announced January 30, 2007, it is the first consumer-grade camcorder to shoot 1080p24.usa.canon.com Consequently, it has become popular with low-budget film/video makers. It is the successor to the HV10, which was Canon's first consumer HDV camcorder. The NTSC-region camera shoots at 24p which gives a film-like look in PF24 mode, using 2:3 pulldown in a 60i stream. In PAL regions, it can record in native 25p mode and as such does not require the same pull-down removal techniques that the NTSC edition does. The camera is capable of recording in both HDV and DV formats, on MiniDV, though it's unable to record 24p in the DV format. The camera uses a 1/2.7\\" CMOS sensor, which is shared with other consumer high definition cameras manufactured by Canon, such as the HV10, HR10 and HG10. The replacement for the HV20, the HV30, was released in March 2008, soon followed by the HV40. Canon HV30 Canon HV30 camcorder The Canon HV30 is an HDV camcorder. It was announced in January 2008 and went on sale in March 2008. In the NTSC version, it is the first consumer-grade camcorder to shoot 1080p30 video in addition to PF24 24fps mode that was pioneered by its predecessor, the HV20. The HV30 has since been replaced by the 2009 model, the HV40. The NTSC-region camera shoots in three modes: the standard 60i interlaced video, 24p film-like video with 2:3 pulldown, and 30p PsF-style video. In PAL regions, it can record in 25p mode, which is also recorded to tape in PsF fashion. The PAL version does not record 30p or 24p. The camera is capable of recording in both HDV and DV formats, onto MiniDV tape, though it's unable to record 24p in the DV format. The camera uses a 1/2.7\\" CMOS sensor, which is shared with other consumer high definition cameras manufactured by Canon, such as the HV10, HV20, HV40, HR10, HG10, and DC50. Canon HV40 The Canon HV40 is an HDV camcorder. It was announced in January 2009.Canon Press release The NTSC version supports native 24p in addition to 24p-over-60i. The latter was the only 24 FPS format available on the HV20 and HV30. Canon HG10 Canon HG10 The Canon HG10 is Canon's first AVCHD codec high definition, hard disk drive camcorder and also the first hard disk drive camera from the company. Its hardware is similar to the popular HV20. The 1/2.7\\" bayer pattern CMOS sensor in the camera is manufactured by Canon and is used in other Canon cameras such as the Canon HV10, Canon HV20, Canon HV30 and Canon HR10. The size of the hard disk drive is 40 GB. One of the key features of the 60 Hz- market models is its ability to capture 24frame/s progressive video in the PF24 mode which is recorded as 60frame/s interlaced video to the hard disk drive by use of a 2:3 pulldown.  HR Series  *Canon HR10  HG Series  *Canon HG10 *Canon HG11 *Canon HG20 *Canon HG21  HF Series  *Canon HF11 *Canon HF20 *Canon HF100 Canon VIXIA HF100 camcorder The VIXIA HF100 and VIXIA HF10https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/details/camcorders/support- high-definition-camcorders/vixia-hf10 are tapeless camcorders unveiled in January 2008 and put on sale in April 2008. Fifteen VIXIA HF10 units were used as crash-cams during the filming of Crank: High Voltage. The camcorders record high definition AVCHD video onto a secure digital memory card. It has no viewfinder and no focus ring. Video can be recorded in four quality settings: FXP (1920 √ó 1080, 17 Mbit/s), XP+ (1440 √ó 1080, 12 Mbit/s), SP (1440 √ó 1080, 7 Mbit/s), and LP (1440 √ó 1080, 5 Mbit/s). A SDHC card with the capacity of 16GB can hold up to 2 hours of video recorded at highest quality setting. When recording to a memory card, the recording time depends only on capacity of the card. The HF100 uses full-size SDHC memory cards. One 4GB card can fit roughly 30 minutes of video at highest quality setting (FXP). A Class 4 or higher card is required to be able to record in FXP mode. In earlier versions of the firmware, Class 10 cards could not be used to record in FXP mode. Firmware version 1.0.3.0 released in July 2011 enabled support for Class 10 cards. The VIXIA HF10 has 16GB of internal memory, complementing the same full-size SDHC memory card slot as the HF100. The distinguishing features of this camcorder include: * External microphone jack * Headphone jack * Mini Advanced Shoe (proprietary) * Threaded lens barrel for attachments (37mm)  Specifications  * Sensor: 1/3.2-inch 3.2 Megapixel CMOS * Lens speed: F/1.8-3.0 * Filter Diameter: 37mm * Optical Zoom: 12x * Image Stabilizer: optical * Viewfinder: No * LCD Screen: 2.7 inches * Headphone Out: Yes * Microphone In: Yes * Recording media: SDHC memory cards (card is not included) * Weight: 380g (without battery)  HF R series  Canon VIXIA HF R5xx, R6xx, and R7xx are practically identical camcorders despite being numbered successively.

A person sentenced to life imprisonment may normally apply for parole after having served 15 years. If the parole court rejects the application, the inmate may reapply after a court determined blocking period no longer than two years (¬ß 57a IV StGB). If the court has determined a \\"severe gravity of guilt\\" exists (besondere Schwere der Schuld), parole is delayed for a non-specific period beyond 15 years (¬ß 57a StGB). In declining a prisoner's first application for parole, the parole court determines a lack of suitability based on the extreme gravity of the offence, as well as the development (or lack thereof) of the prisoner behind bars. Such determination includes how many additional years the inmate must serve before again being eligible to apply for early release. There is no legal limit on the term the parole court can hand down, though in practice the average term is about 5 years, and longer periods are rare. Notable cases of life imprisonment In the case of one Red Army Faction terrorist,http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/raf/ex- raf-terrorist-christian-klar-kommt-nach-26-jahren-frei_aid_350794.html (in German; Article about former Red Faction Terrorist Christian Klar leaving prison after 26 years in jail) the parole court ordered a deferment of at least 11 years (making his sentence a minimum of 26 years) before he again became eligible for parole. Such a long length was due to his involvement in multiple killings, lack of remorse, and his affiliation with a terrorist group. In another case, a court ruled the defendant had to serve at least 38 years in prison for the killings of five people.http://dejure.org/dienste/vernetzung/rechtsprechung?Gericht=OLG%20N%FCrnberg&Datum;=02.08.2010&Aktenzeichen;=2%20Ws%20172/10 (text in German) He was incarcerated beyond the required 38 years after it was determined he was a danger to society. Such a ruling mandates continued imprisonment de jure, as being safe toward society is required to be paroled from a life sentence (¬ß 57a I Nr. 3 StGB in conjunction with ¬ß 57 I Nr. 2 StGB). However, the case was appealed to the German Constitutional Court (BVerfG, Judgment from 29.11.2011 - 2 BvR 1758/10),http://www.hrr- strafrecht.de/hrr/bverfg/10/2-bvr-1758-10.php (text in German) which held that the decision to hold the prisoner beyond the original 38 years was unconstitutional for case-specific reasons. One of the most prominent \\"long termers\\" has been Heinrich Pommerenke, who in total had served 49 years, from 1959 until his death in 2008, for mass murder and rape.article from 2008-12-19 in \\"Stuttgarter Nachrichten\\"article from 2008-12-30 in \\"Stuttgarter Nachrichten\\" Currently (May 2014), the record is held by Hans-Georg Neumann who was sentenced to life in prison in 1963 for murdering a pair of lovers and completed 52 years (including pretrial detention) in prison in 2014. Online news article in N24 (Text in German) Release and imposition of preventive detention In instances where the convict is found to pose a clear and present danger to society, the sentence may include a provision for preventive detention (German: Sicherungsverwahrung) after the actual sentence is satisfied. This is technically not considered a punishment, but a decision to protect the public, and elements of prison discipline that are not directly security-related are relaxed for those in preventive detention. The preventive detention may be continued every two years until it is found the convict is unlikely to commit further crimes or be a menace to the public. Since 2004, it has also been possible for preventive detention to be ordered by a court after the original sentencing if the danger that a criminal poses upon release becomes obvious during their imprisonment. Despite its non-punitive status and the broadness of its potential application, though, preventive detention is used only in exceptional cases. Paroled prisoners usually must stay in regular contact with a civilian \\"parole helper\\" (Bew√§hrungshelfer) for the duration of their parole. The parole period in the case of life imprisonment is five years (¬ß 57 III StGB). 1977 judgement on life imprisonment Prior to 1977, all life sentences in Germany were imposed without the possibility of parole (though pardons were sometimes granted). In 1977, the German Constitutional Court found that mandatory sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in all cases are unconstitutional because the respect of human dignity requires a \\"realistic prospect of being released\\", and the principle of the Rechtsstaat requires a legal regulation for when a prisoner is released. The imposition of life sentences was thus found constitutional, as long as the laws allow for some hope of release. As a consequence, ¬ß57a StGB was introduced in 1981, allowing parole even for life imprisonment. In consequence, mandatory life sentences are still imposed in Germany for murder, although with the possibility of being released. The ruling does not mean that every convict has to be released, nor does the ruling mean that mandatory life sentences cannot be imposed, but that every convict must have a realistic chance for eventual release, provided they are considered safe to the community. It is at the discretion of the court to decide the length of the parole period, or if the offender is actually eligible for parole. If the convicted person is found not to be safe to the community, they either may be ordered never to be released or be released after an extensively longer period of time, such are parole is delayed for a non-specific period of 15 years or longer. Although German law does not explicitly provide for life imprisonment without parole, there is a possibility that some convicts serving life sentences may never be released, particularly if they are considered too dangerous and unlikely to be rehabilitated, or if they are sentenced to extensively long non-parole periods in prisons that would generally last beyond a normal life span, such as 40 to 50 years. As a formality, the inmate has to agree to his release on parole (¬ß 57a I Nr. 3 StGB). Displays of contrition or appeals for mercy are not a condition for such a release. Today, most life sentences are normally given for murder. Statistics According to data from the federal ministry of justice (1998) the average time served for a life sentence in Germany is 19.9 years. Crimes allowing for life imprisonment Mandatory sentence Murder,¬ß 211 German federal punishment code genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes against a person.¬ß 6, 7 and 8 German federal code of crimes against international law Possible sentence Planning a war of aggression, high treason, treason, illegal disclosure of secrets, engaging in relations that endanger peace, child abuse causing death, sexual assault causing death, robbery causing death, arson causing death, abduction for the purpose of blackmailing causing death, taking hostages causing death, effecting a nuclear explosion causing death, effecting an explosion causing death, misuse of ionizing radiation causing death, attacking a driver for the purpose of committing a robbery causing death, and attacking air or sea traffic causing death.German criminal code References Germany Category:Penal system in Germany de:Lebenslange Freiheitsstrafe ","title":"Life imprisonment in Germany"},{"id":"24154540","text":"Urban Priol (born 14 May 1961 in Aschaffenburg) is a German Kabarett artist and comedian.

Offenders under the age of 21 on the day the crime was committed can not be sentenced to life imprisonment. Records and statistics In October 2015, 142 inmates served life sentences in Sweden, all excluding one was convicted of murder (including accessory, attempt and incitement to murder). One was convicted of genocide (Stanislas Mbanenande, convicted for the role he played in the Rwandan genocide). Seven of those who served life sentences were women.  Longest- staying inmates  In 2006, convicted murderer Leif Peters died in psychiatric care after 39 years of confinement. As of 2011, Leif Axmyr, who, in 1982, killed his former girlfriend Ulla-Britt Jacobsson and her new fianc√©e Tommy Larsson, has spent nearly three decades in prison. He has the longest record of confinement which is still ongoing and within the duration of his confinement has filed a total of 11 appeals, with one (in 2010) overturning his imprisonment in favor of a determinate sentence of 46 years (which would have implied his release in 2013, with two-thirds served), but this appeal was overturned and was later appealed to the Supreme Court of Sweden, which was denied. In 2016, he was finally released after having his sentence converted to 51 years imprisonment, meaning he could leave on probation after 34 years inside (two thirds of the sentence).https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/leif- axmyr-frislappt-efter-34-ar-i-fangelse His effective sentence was thus the longest for many years, although there have been psychiatric inmates imprisoned effectively for longer periods than Axmyr.  Commutation  Increased criticism from prison authorities, prisoners and victims led to a revision of practices and in 2006, a new law was passed which gave prisoners the right to apply to have the sentence commuted to a determined sentence at the √ñrebro District Court. A prisoner has to serve at least 10 years in prison before applying and the set sentence cannot be under 18 years (With 1/3 of the sentence suspended), the longest determined sentence allowed under Swedish law.Erwin James, ‚ÄúWhy is Sweden closing its prisons?‚Äù The Guardian, 1 December 2013. Retrieved 4 December 2018 from https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/dec/01/why-sweden-closing-prisons When granting a determinate sentence, the court takes into account the crime, the prisoner's behavior in prison, public safety and the chance of rehabilitation. However, some prisoners may never be released, being considered too dangerous. Of those who have been given set sentences under the new law, the sentences have ranged between 25 and 31 years. In 2007, the Swedish Supreme Court ruled that ten years in prison should overrule life imprisonment as the \\"general option\\" for premeditated murder. In 2009. Options to sentence people to more than 10 years but less than life became available Under the new law anyone convicted of murder will be sentenced to 10-18 years or life in special circumstances, On average when there is no special circumstances a sentence of 14 years may be imposed. In mitigating circumstances 10-13 years. in aggravating circumstances 15-18 years or in some cases life.

It is the main tertiary and referral hospital in East Malaysia. In its earlier years it was known as Kuching General Hospital. History Kuching General Hospital between 1900 and 1930 Sarawak General Hospital has been in existence since 1870. However, no proper historical records have been preserved of its existence. The earliest record about the hospital is from 1910. Based from this documentation, the hospital was initially located at the current site of the Kuching Central Prison and a total of 920 patients were admitted to the hospital during that year. In 1925, construction of a new hospital started at the hospital's current location at Jalan Tun Abang Haji Openg. The new hospital was operational from 1931. From its foundation up until at least the outbreak of World War II, the hospital was known as Kuching General Hospital. After World War II, the hospital was unable to meet the growing needs of the population. In 1957, a proposal to build a new and modern hospital was put forward. A total of RM13.5 million was spent for the 1964 - 1968 Development Plan and the consultation and management fees amounting to RM8.2 million was paid for by the Australian Government under the Colombo Plan. The construction of the hospital was planned in 2 phases. Phase I involved the building of an 8-story Main Block, including the Emergency Unit. Phase I construction began in 1965 and was completed in May 1970. By then, the cost of construction grew to RM17.8 million. The lion's share of the cost amounting RM17.3 million was borne by the federal government while the rest was paid by the state government. Phase II involved the completion of an extra floor in the east wing and an additional five stories in the western part of the Main Block. Phase II construction began in September 1970 and was completed in 1972. The new hospital then was able to accommodate 582 patients and had many modern facilities. The subsequent years, many additions were made to the hospital, including: * 1977 - Houseman quarters A * 1978 - New mortuary * 1980 - Laboratory block * 1988 - Renovation of the Pharmacy Department * 1993 - Construction of the Specialist Clinic block * 1994 - Houseman Quarters B * 2000 - Clinical Block and Inpatient Block completed * 2009 - Main tower block refurbishment completed * 2009 - Houseman quarters A conversion to Isolation Ward for infectious disease completed The main block of the hospital underwent renovation and refurbishment, which was completed in September 2009. SGH currently has 1005 beds and is on par with other hospitals in Malaysia and Asia. Specialisations and services SGH offers many specialisations and it serves as a referral centre for East Malaysia. Chronology of some units formed: * 1985 ‚Äì Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology was operational * 1987- Physiotherapy Unit * 1989 - Haemodialysis unit was formed In Medicine, prior to 1987 there was only the department of general medicine with 3 general physicians. In August of that year Dr Chew Peng Hong was transferred to head the dept. of medicine of the hospital & by the time he retired in 2003' he had set up the following subspecialties in Medicine: nephrology, dermatology, neurology, rheumatology, chest medicine, cardiology, infectious diseases.gastro-enterology, haematology besides playing a major & key role in helping plan a brand new medical school, The School Of Medicine & Health Sciences of the University of Malaysia, Sarawak, which uses SGH as its teaching hospital. For his contribution the University appointed him adjunct Professor of Medicine till to date. In 2006 the Federal Government recognised his selfless contribution to medicine in Sarawak in particular & Malaysia in general conferred on him by the Agong ( the Malaysian King) the honorific of PJN which carries the title of Datuk. During his tenure Dr Chew had managed to get the department to achieve international standards for which he received numerous awards from the State Government of Sarawak, the Federal Government & the ministry of health. Teaching hospital SGH serves as a teaching hospital for a wide field of medical and allied health personnel. The medical faculty of Universiti Malaysia Sarawak uses the hospital as a teaching hospital for its medical students. SGH is also a popular place for elective attachment for medical students. Elective students from UK, Australia & New Zealand started to come regularly after 1987 when the department of medicine was headed by Dr Chew Peng Hong. Since then it has become a favourite elective destination for British medical students particularly from the London Medical schools, Newcastle, Leeds, Liverpool, Glasgow, Southampton, Hull & York, Peninsular as well as medical schools in Germany & Denmark. Nearer to home students from Australia & New Zealand, Hong Kong & Japan are coming in increasing numbers in addition to medical schools in Malaysia, both public & private. Much of the effort making it a popular institution are from the contribution of Dr Wong Jin Shyan ( presently of Borneo Medical Center) & Professor Datuk Dr P.H. Chew, honorary consultant physician to the hospital & adjunct Professor of Medicine of the faculty of medicine & health sciences of the University of Malaysia Sarawak(UNIMAS).

He currently plays for General D√≠az. Career Vel√°zquez began his career in the youth divisions of Atl√°ntida Sport Club. After scoring 45 goals in an under-15 tournament with the team, he joined Libertad in 2003. He scored his first professional goal with the team in his debut, 10 December 2005, against 12 de Octubre. In 2009, Vel√°zquez was loaned to Rubio √ëu. There, he got the chance to play regularly and seized the opportunity by becoming the top scorer in the Paraguayan Primera Divisi√≥n Apertura championship, with 16 goals in 20 games. After finishing top scorer, Argentine club River Plate tried to sign him in July. However, the transfer did not materialize because the club wanted him on loan at a price well below that set by the owner of Vel√°zques transfer rights, Libertad (that had set the price at US$3 million). A few weeks later, the player rejected an offer from CSKA Sofia of Bulgaria. Then in August, River attempted to sign him again, and this time the talks came to be quite close to the deal. The press even confirmed the transfer, but eventually the clubs could not agree on the form of payment. Almost immediately came an offer of another Argentine team, San Lorenzo; though this time River reported that the transfer deadline was due and San Lorenzo had not registered the Paraguayan player. After various comings and goings, Vel√°zquez's continued his career with Rubio √ëu. In the Torneo Clausura, he scored 10 goals in 19 games, totalling 26 in 39 during the 2009 season. Therefore, he was the season top scorer of the Paraguayan Primera Divisi√≥n. After the season, his loan ended and he returned to Libertad. On 30 December 2010, Vel√°zquez was announced as the new signing of San Lorenzo, of the Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n. After good performances at Libertad, Vel√°zquez has been linked to a move to Mexican side Deportivo Toluca where the Paraguayan international Edgar Ben√≠tez plays. Toluca's coach, former Paraguayan international and Toluca striker Jos√© Saturnino Cardozo requested Vel√°zquez along with Olimpia's Paraguayan international Richard Ortiz. Other teams looking to sign Vel√°zquez are Brazilian teams Palmeiras and Atletico Paranaense as well as teams in France and Italy.

Criminal laws allowing for life imprisonment are enacted by the Parliament of Canada and apply uniformly across the country.  Mandatory life sentence  High treason and first degree murder carry a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment with a full parole ineligibility period of 25 years. Previously, in the case of high treason or first-degree murder (where the offender had been convicted of a single murder) offenders could have their parole ineligibility period reduced to no less than 15 years under the Faint hope clause. However, that option under the Criminal Code was ended by Act of Parliament, effective in December 2011. Second degree murder also carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment but with a parole ineligibility period of between 10 years and 25 years. Courts will determine the parole ineligibility period based on the gravity of the offence. Contrary to common belief, public safety plays a lesser role given the fact that the offender will be subject to a life sentence and the Parole Board of Canada will presumably assess the present danger posed by the offender at the time of a parole application.  Multiple murders  The above penalties for murder apply when an offender is convicted of a single murder. When an offender is convicted of multiple murders (either first or second-degree murder), the court has the option of imposing consecutive periods of parole ineligibility for each murder. These provisions of the Criminal Code came into force in December 2011, and permit a trial judge, after considering any jury recommendations, to impose consecutive parole ineligibility periods extending beyond 25 years. In the most extreme cases, this can result in a de facto term of life imprisonment without parole (i.e. a total parole ineligibility period extending beyond the offender's life expectancy).nationalpost.com: \\"Harper government supports private bill that could bring minimum 40-year sentences for some violent crimes\\", 25 Apr 2013G+M: \\"Five fundamental ways Harper has changed the justice system\\", 6 May 2014 These provisions have been used in several cases since 2011, with parole ineligibility periods of 35 years (Benjamin Hudon-Barbeauhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/consecutive- murder-convictions-1.5144202), 40 years (Travis Baumgartner and Alexandre Bissonnette), 50 years (Edward Downey,https://calgarysun.com/news/crime/remorseless-judge-sentences-downey- to-50-years-for-killing-mother-five-year-old-girl Emanuel Kahsai and Mark Smich), 70 years (Basil Borutskihttp://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/basil- borutski-sentencing-life-prison-1.4435066), and 75 years (Justin Bourque, John Paul Ostamas,Brutal homeless killer gets 75 year minimum Douglas Garland,Douglas Garland to serve at least 75 years for horrific triple killing Derek SaretzkySaretzky sentenced to life, no parole for 75 years and Dellen Millard, Mark Smich's accomplice (originally 50 years, extended to 75 after sentencing for the murder of his father).  Other offences  Offences under the Criminal Code that carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment in Canada (with a parole ineligibility period of between 7 years and 25 years) include treason, piracy, mutiny, aircraft hijacking, endangering the safety of an aircraft or an airport, endangering the safety of a ship or fixed platform, refusing to disperse after a riot proclamation, arson (disregard for human life), robbery, kidnapping, break and enter with intent, attempted murder, accessory after the fact to murder, conspiracy to commit murder, manslaughter, causing death by street racing, impaired driving causing death, causing death by criminal negligence, killing an unborn child in the act of birth, and aggravated sexual assault. Under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, trafficking, exporting or production of schedule I or II substances also carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a parole ineligibility period of between 7 years and 25 years. Current sentencing practices ensure that, except in the case of murder, a life sentence is rarely imposed, even when the offender is found guilty for particularly grievous offences. One common exception is cases which involve terrorism-related conspiracies. http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/via-rail-terror- sentences-1.3240050https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canadian- terrorist-handed-life-sentence/article1208729/ https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-upholds-anti- terrorism-laws/article6354739/ As of 2013, 4,800 offenders were serving life sentences in Canada, though only 2,880 (around 60%) were incarcerated (the remainder being on parole). The vast majority of these offenders (about 96%) were serving their sentences for murder. \\"Lifers\\" constituted 23% of the federal offender population.http://globalnews.ca/news/1864132/by-the-numbers- lifers-in-canadas-prisons/ There is no guarantee that parole will be granted to an offender. If the Parole Board of Canada determines that an offender still poses a risk to society, that person may be detained in prison past the parole eligibility period.Criminal Code of Canada Any person released on parole from a term of life imprisonment or an indeterminate term of imprisonment must remain on parole, with conditions by the Parole Board, and are subject to electronic tagging for the remainder of their natural lives.  Dangerous offender  While life sentences are rare in non-murder cases, the courts may apply a dangerous offender designation in cases involving serious violent or sexual offences. Such a designation may result in an indeterminate sentence with no maximum limit, but a parole review occurs after 7 years and every 2 years after that. Despite formal parole eligibility after seven years, full parole is rare in cases where a dangerous offender is serving an indeterminate sentence as this provision is reserved for individuals assessed as likely to commit further serious violent offences. In violent non-murder cases involving repeat offenders, it is more likely to be used than a sentence of life imprisonment. As of 2012, nearly 500 inmates had a \\"Dangerous Offender\\" designation constituting about 3% of the federal offender population.http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/cntrng-crm/crrctns/protctn-gnst- hgh-rsk-ffndrs/faq-eng.aspx Three years later, in 2015, 622 federal offenders had a Dangerous Offender designation. Of these, 586 (or some 94%) were incarcerated (representing 3.9% of the In-Custody Population) and 36 were in the community under supervision.https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/pblctns/ccrso-2015/index- en.aspx#e3 This supervision lasts for the remainder of the offender's life.

The sentence is of indeterminate length. People receiving a life sentence in Denmark can request a pardoning hearing after 12 years. If the hearing is successful, the Justice Minister (or someone authorized by the Minister) grants a pardon, subject to a parole period of up to 5 years. Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment serve an average of 17 years. A person with a life sentence will not be released if it is considered likely that the offender will recommit. This means that some offenders have served a considerably longer time than the average and in recent history there are four where this has surpassed 30 years: (34 years as of 2018, still incarcerated in the closed unit of Sankt Hans Hospital), Palle S√∏rensen (33 years, released in 1998), Seth Sethsen (32 years as of 2018, still incarcerated) and (32 years, released in 1978). Murderers are eligible for a life sentence, but it is generally only used when the person has a previous history of committing serious crimes or the murder is considered particularly grave. Otherwise a murderer will typically receive a time limited sentence, which can be up to 20 years in Denmark. In recent history all people receiving a life sentence have been murderers, but a person committing treason, use force against the Danish Parliament, espionage during wartime, terrorism, arson under circumstances that are life-threatening, hijack a vehicle under aggravated circumstances or willfully release nuclear substances is eligible for a life sentence. On average, slightly more than one person receives a life sentence each year (14 from 2006 to 2018), and in 2015 there were a total of 21 people serving a life sentence. \\"Custody sentence\\" and \\"placement sentence\\" Criminals considered dangerous can receive a \\"custody sentence\\" () instead of a life sentence. This can also be used for certain crimes where a life sentence is not possible, such as rape, violence and aggravated robbery. It is often used for people with deviant personalities (for example, antisocial personality disorder) and is typically served in the Herstedvester Prison. It should not be confused with a \\"placement sentence\\" (), which is reserved for mentally ill people that are ineligible for a normal prison sentence and serve their sentence in a closed unit of a psychiatric hospital. A custody sentence always lacks a time limit and a placement sentence often lacks a time limit, but both are subject to periodic pardoning hearings. A review covering 1990‚Äì2011 showed that on average a person with a custody sentence was released after 14 years and 7 months. Minors A person aged between 15 and 18 years old at the time of their crime can not receive a life sentence, but is eligible for all other penalties in the Penal Code. Until 2010, their maximum possible sentence was 8 years or a \\"custody sentence\\". A person that is under 15 is below the age of accountability and can not receive a prison sentence.

It is located in Bandar Tun Razak, Kuala Lumpur and is administered by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM). The hospital has a special ward for cancer treatment sponsored by MAKNA and Maybank. History UKM Medical Centre has an interlinked history with the Faculty of Medicine, UKM. The faculty was formed on 30 May 1972. This faculty started the premedical course at the Faculty of Sciences, Main Campus of UKM at Jalan Pantai Baru, Kuala Lumpur on May 1973. The first batch numbering up to 44 students attended the course. Preclinical Medical Course started on May 1974 at the temporary building allocated for Medical Faculty in the Kuala Lumpur Hospital (HKL) area. On 27 February 1975, the Ministry of Health officially agreed to designate HKL as the teaching hospital for UKM and since May 1976 all clinical courses are done at HKL. In 1977, a permanent building for the Medical Faculty beside HKL was completed and could be used fully. Alongside the faculty building, courses related to medicine are also being conducted at the Branch Campus, Hospital Branch Tanjung Karang and Health Clinic Ibu at Tanjung Karang, Selangor. Research in the field of medicine was increased to improve the faculty‚Äôs role in the field of medicine and education. By increasing the number of medical students and by starting the Degree Continuation Program, the usage of clinical equipment training at Ministry of Health hospitals was expanded. Furthermore, with the Ministry of Health and the Faculty of Medicine worked in close co-operation, more doctors have successfully graduated. The medical students are trained in General Surgery, Orthopedic Surgery and Otolaryngology Surgery, Ophthalmology Surgery, Radiology, Pediatric, Psychiatric, Anesthesiology, Medicine and Obstetric & Gynecology. The Faculty of Medicine currently offers courses at the Doctor of Philosophy level for the preclinical program. Support for expansion and in line with the needs of the nation caused the allocated building for Faculty of Medicine and HKL unable to fulfill the current requirements for educating, service and research. In 1990, the Faculty of Medicine decided to set up its own teaching hospital for long-term use. On 2 November 1993, construction of the Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia in Cheras commenced. By 1 July 1997, HUKM was completed and started operating and on 14 July 1998, YAB Dato Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, the then Prime Minister of Malaysia officially opened HUKM. However, on 14 December 2007, the Faculty of Medicine and HUKM have combined to create the entity known as Pusat Perubatan UKM, or UKM Medical Centre, with the motto For Integrating Learning and Research Society. PPUKM was led by a Dean cum Director who is responsible for managing all of the academic, research and clinical services at the Centre. The restructured entity will allow the functions and activities of the separate institutions, faculties and hospitals to coordinate and run more efficiently, improving productivity and ways of working. This will ensure that the administration course activities and research can be done more efficiently, including services offered. All this will improve PPUKM performance and increase its standard in international medical institutions.

In actual practice, life imprisonment rarely lasts for the remainder of a convict's life; it currently consists of imprisonment in closed prison and possible periods of imprisonment in a halfway house, supervised parole and full parole. The death penalty was abolished in Finland in 1949 for peacetime offences and for all offences in 1972. Life imprisonment is the only possible penalty for the crime of murder and a possible penalty for high treason, treason, espionage, war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, homicidal acts of terrorism, and crime against peace. Under the Finnish criminal code of 1889, life imprisonment consisted of at least 12 years of imprisonment after which the convict was conditionally released and remained on probation for the rest of their life. After 1931, release was by presidential pardon and the probationary period was eight years. Today, those sentenced to life imprisonment may be considered for parole after 12 years and most are released after serving between 12 and 15 years. Since 2006, Helsinki Court of Appeals (Helsingin hovioikeus) has acted as Parole Board and a life prisoner has been considered for parole even after serving 10 years.Finland's Penal Code, chapter 2c, 10¬ß, , Releasing of long-term prisoners Act (781/2005), If the parole is rejected, a new parole hearing is scheduled in 2 years. If the parole is accepted, 3 years of supervised parole follows until full parole, assuming no violations. If the convict was less than 21 years of age when they committed the crime, the first parole hearing is after 10 years served. Juveniles cannot be sentenced to life imprisonment in Finland, the maximum penalty for an offender who was under 18 years of age is 12 years for a single murder and 15 years for multiple murders or sentences where a murder conviction is combined with conviction for other serious crimes. As of 2017, the longest incarceration for a life sentence convict in Finland has been 22 years. The paroled offender committed another murder the following month and was again sentenced to life imprisonment. The average duration of a life sentence in the 2010s has been 14 years.

The then German congregation broke ground in 1874. The Mission Church was constructed in Romanesque style, of Roxbury puddingstone, quarried from what is now Puddingstone Park, just down the block. An octagonal, cupola-topped lantern rises over a hundred feet above the crossing. The stained glass windows in the nave were made by F.X. Zettler, and the windows in the shrine were made by Franz Mayer and Co. from Munich, Germany. Side altars were dedicated to the Holy Family and St. Patrick, respectively. The church was dedicated in 1878. At this time the church was not an ordinary parish in which all sacraments were administered, but was instead limited to penance and Holy Communion. Our Lady of Perpetual Help became a parish of the Archdiocese of Boston in 1883. The Hutchings organ was installed in 1897. It was one of the first organs in the country to successfully use electric action, which Hutchings invented and patented. The organ has 62 stops, and close to 3,200 pipes. The spires, added in 1910, were designed by Swiss architect Franz Joseph Untersee, who also designed the rectory. Due to the church's sloping foundation, the west cross tops its tower at ; the other spire is two feet shorter. The western tower houses twelve bells. The length of the church is also , presenting a perfect proportion. The church was elevated to basilica status in 1954 by Pope Pius XII. The church complex was designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 2004. Our Lady of Perpetual Help icon Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help A replica icon of Our Lady of Perpetual Help was installed over the main altar of the original church on May 28, 1871. Not long after, cures were reported, attributed to the intercession of Our Lady. In November 1874, the weekly practice of bestowing a blessing on the sick was formerly established. When the new church was built, the picture was relocated to the new Chapel of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. As reputed cures continued, crutches, braces, and other devices were left as votives at the shrine. In 1900 Fr. Frawley began a quarterly publication, The Little Messenger of Mary, which included among other features, accounts of favors received at the shrine. This was later superseded by the Annals of the Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help.\\".Byrne C.SS.R., John F. The Glories of Mary in Boston, Mission Church Press, Boston, 1921 An account of the sick flocking to the shrine was published in the New York Herald in March 1901, under the headline \\"A Lourdes in the Land of Puritans\\".Pronechen, Joseph. \\"In Boston, a Taste of Miraculous Lourdes\\", National Catholic Register, January 11, 1998 Accounts of activities at the shrine were also covered by the Boston American General News of March 28, 1909 under the caption \\"Heaps of Crutches Left at Altar by Afflicted\\", and by the Boston Globe of December 10, 1910, and again in a Globe article of August 3, 1919. During World War I, the Roxbury shrine became popular with family members praying for the safe return of soldiers. Between 1878 and 1884 over 300 cures were documented. Mission Grammar School was completed in 1889, located behind the church on Smith Street. With 24 classrooms to accommodate 1,200 pupils, the School Sisters of Notre Dame arrived from Baltimore to begin the new endeavor of educating the parish's boys and girls. Under the direction of the Xaverian Brothers, Mission Church High School opened in 1926. After 66 years of service Mission Church High School was closed due to declining enrollment at the end of the school year in 1992. The building was sold to the Boston Public School system and continues to be operated today as New Mission High. The grammar school is currently located on St. Alphonsus Street and continues to educate children in K-8.Mission Grammar School In 1900, St. Alphonsus Hall was opened as an early form of community center to serve a large immigrant population, most notably from Ireland. It housed a library, meeting hall, gym, bowling alley and theater. The Passion Play \\"Pilates Daughter\\" written by Rev. Francis Kenzel, C.Ss.R. was performed for the first time in St. Alphonsus Hall in 1902. With an all female cast, the fictitious drama centers around the daughter of Pilate, Claudia, who threw a rose at Christ as he passed by carrying his cross. The flower touches Jesus and has miraculous powers that impact the lives of many. As a central attraction during Lent, parishioners acted out the play every year for over 50 years until performances ended in the late 1960s. In 1903, the old Brinley Mansion was replaced by a new priests' residence. The rectory includes references to then Irish heritage of the neighborhood. The small chapel for resident Redemptorists has stained glass windows decorated with green shamrocks. The rectory also served as a house of formation for Redemptorist seminarians studying at Boston College and St. John's Seminary in Brighton until August 2017. The basilica is located on Tremont Street, almost at the center Mission Hill, a Google maps Boston neighborhood of approximately 18,000 people. The church is considered the symbol of the neighborhood, to which it gives its name. It continues to serve descendants of Irish immigrant families who still remain in the neighborhood, in addition to newly arrived immigrants from Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Haiti. Senator Edward Kennedy's funeral took place there on August 29, 2009. He had often prayed at the church due to its proximity to the hospitals in the Longwood Medical Area of Boston, where he had visited sick and injured members of his family.Barry, Dan. \\"A Home to Prayers of Healing and Hope\\", New York Times, August 28, 2009Gilgoff, Dan. \\"Ted Kennedy's Funeral at Church Where He Sought Healing\\", US News and World Report, August 27, 2009 See also *List of churches in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston * Our Lady of Perpetual Help, the shrine's namesake saint * The Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston, MA, listed in the National Register of Historic Places References External links * Boston's Basilica (official website) * Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help: Photo Gallery by The Catholic Photographer * FOXNews.com, Wednesday, August 26, 2009\\"Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica -- commonly known as the Mission Church -- in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston. ...The cavernous basilica on Tremont Street, built in the 1870s\\" * Byrne C.SS.R., John F.

The landing in Klintholm Havn On 5 May 1945, the day Denmark was liberated from German occupation during World War II, a barge with 370 starving prisoners from the Stutthof concentration camp near Danzig (now Gdansk) was brought into Klintholm Havn. When Russian forces moved into the areas close to Stutthof on 25 April 1945, those in control of the concentration camp forced the remaining prisoners to march to the coast and then commanded them to board river barges. After a few days, they were taken ashore in R√ºgen, Germany, but then were again forced onto another barge on 3 May. This was allowed to drift across the Baltic Sea until it was finally towed into the harbour at Klintholm Havn by a German tug two days later. Prisoners' graves in Magleby churchyard Fortunately the local inhabitants managed to rescue 351 of the prisoners. The other 19 could not be saved and died of disease or starvation during the next few days. Some of them are buried in nearby Magleby churchyard. Many different nationalities The prisoners on the barge were nearly all political prisoners, most of whom had been involved in resistance operations. There were also several members of Jehovah's Witnesses which had been banned by the Nazi regime. Danish Red Cross archives, which draw on an analysis undertaken by Zygmunt Szatkowski (one of the prisoners), show that the majority of the prisoners were Poles followed by a large number of Russians. There were also small numbers of Czechoslovakians, Germans, Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Turks and Frenchmen as well as a few citizens from the Free State of Danzig. One of the Poles had a U.S. passport. Danish assistance Shortly after the barge was towed into the harbour, Rasmus Fenger, the local doctor, boarded the vessel and assessed the health of the prisoners. They were nearly all suffering from diseases such as dysentery, typhus, tuberculosis and the effects of malnutrition. In addition, they all had fleas. The top priority the first day was to find emergency food supplies for them all. Bread, milk and butter were found in the surrounding area and large quantities of fresh water were provided. A rescue committee was then set up consisting of members of the Red Cross and the Danish resistance movement. The most critically ill prisoners were moved to Stege hospital or to Hotel S√∏bad, a few hundred metres from the harbour. The remainder stayed on the barge for up to 10 days until accommodation could be found for them in community centres or hostels. The local Red Cross organised the rescue operation assisted by Danish doctors and nurses and by those prisoners who were fit enough to help. Within a few days, the spirits of the prisoners improved as they received nutrition and medical care.L√¶gememorier - 10 danske l√¶gers oplevelser under Bes√¶ttelsen, Gyldendal, 1945. The memorial stone Board next to memorial A memorial stone now stands on the shore of Klinthom Havn at the point where the barge came in. It was erected on 5 May 1995, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the event.Unfettered Joy from Gramma.dk. Retrieved 28 August 2009.Erindringens dugdr√•ber from Arbejderen.dk . In Danish. Retrieved 28 August 2009. The Danish inscription on the stone reads: :Fra sult og n√∏d, tortur og d√∏d :De m√∏dte p√• en fremmed kyst :I hj√¶lpsom √•nd, en udstrakt h√•nd. which, roughly translated, means: :From hunger and peril, torture and death, :They encountered on a foreign shore :In helping vein, an outstretched hand. The board beside the stone carries explanations in four languages including English. The English reads: :On the day of the Liberation of Denmark, 5 May 1945, a barge was washed up on this spot, carrying 370 prisoners from the Nazi concentration camp of Stutthof near Danzig. Close to death from starvation and illness, they had been ordered by their captors to their fate on the Baltic Sea. On the 50th anniversary of the landing, this memorial was erected to commemorate those people who, with no thought for their own safety, saved the lives of 351 of the prisoners. This memorial also honours the memory of those victims who never reached the outstretched hands of the rescuers of Klintholm. A personal testimony In her autobiography Unfettered Joy, Hermine Schmidt, a German woman who had been a prisoner at Stutthof because of her religious beliefs as a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, tells her own story of the desperate voyage across the Baltic Sea. She recounts how on 25 April 1945 she and 370 other inmates from Stutthof were pushed out into the Baltic in a derelict barge. For 10 days the barge drifted around the sea north of Germany and south of Denmark. But on the 10th day the vessel was sighted from a little Danish island. It was soon brought into Klitholm Havn harbour on M√∏n. The date was 5 May 1945, Denmark's liberation day. \\"It was unbelievable how they welcomed us. We had lice and fleas and looked like walking skeletons but they came down to the harbour and hugged us. The following day you could read in the local paper: Go down to the harbour and see the floating coffin.\\"Modstand og Martyrium (Resistance and Martyrdom) by Erik Nielsen, www.eriksfreelance.dk. In Danish. First published in Politiken PS in April 1998. Retrieved 30 April 2009. A word of thanks The following article, drafted by prisoners Szatkowski, Wysocki and Sister Hilda, appeared in M√∏n's local newspapers and in one national Danish paper between 25 and 30 May 2009: :\\"We thank you Danes for our lives. Thank you for the really heartfelt welcome you gave us unfortunate souls from Stutthof when we arrived after months or even years of suffering, culminating in 11 days of extreme peril. As a result of poor sanitation and terrible conditions, there was typhus on our ship. Disease spread terrifyingly among us, claiming many lives. Without food, we were driven through wind and storm until we landed happily on the little Danish island of M√∏n. Its inhabitants received us as if we were their own. You took care of us with real concern, you took the sick off the ship and did your very best for us. Our story is full of gratitude. Special thanks to the Red Cross which, under Mrs Mortensen's leadership, and all the time and strength she devoted to us, has given us back both spiritually and physically so much of what we missed in Stutthof. Just as warmly, we thank the doctors, especially Dr Fenger, Dr Mortensen and Miss S√∏nderskov, and all the others in Klintholm and the rest of M√∏n, even if unfortunately we can no longer remember all their names. This is our word of thanks. But it is in our hearts that our greatest gratitude will always be borne.\\" Sources The primary sources for details of the Klinthom rescue are to be found in Danish newspaper reports from May 1945. In his book Aktion Prammen (see Bibliography), Erik Haaest draws on reports from Nationaltidende, M√∏ns Dagblad, M√∏ns Social-Demokrat and M√∏ns Folkeblad, all of which published several lengthy articles on the event. They include interviews with the prisoners and eye-witness accounts of conditions on the barge and in the temporary hospital at Hotel S√∏bad. Not all the accounts are in agreement on details of the journey from Stutthof, some referring to only one barge across the Baltic and most others to a transfer onto a second barge on R√ºgen some three days before the arrival in Klinthom. Most also refer to a German boat which finally towed them into harbour, some referring to an SS boat while others refer to a civil German tug.

It is not necessarily \\"life imprisonment\\" in practice, as not all of the life sentence is generally served in prison custody. The granting of temporary or early release of life sentenced prisoners is a feature of the Irish prison system handled by the Minister for Justice and Equality. In deciding on the release from prison of a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment, the Minister will always consider the advice and recommendations of the Parole Board of Ireland. The Board, as of 2007, will normally review prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment after seven years have been served; however, the sentencing judge can extend this to a maximum of 30 years or order that the prisoner is to spend the remainder of their life in prison. Prisoners serving very long sentences, including life sentences, are normally reviewed on a number of occasions over a number of years before any substantial concessions are recommended by the Board. The final decision as to whether a life sentenced prisoner is released rests solely with the Minister, and as such, the length of time spent in custody by offenders serving life sentences can vary substantially. Mandatory sentence Life imprisonment is the mandatory sentence in Ireland for murder or treason. Possible sentence Life imprisonment is a possible sentence in Ireland for assault causing serious harm, possessing firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury, aggravated robbery, possession of controlled drugs with intent to supply, rape resulting in death or serious injury, and possession of drugs with intent to supply.

Within two weeks a society was formed, and by the end of 1932 there were 132 members. The first meetings of the York Sunbury Historical Society were held on the second floor of the Post Office on Queen Street, and shortly after the society received the first of many donations of its historical artefacts. The Society was incorporated on February 10, 1934. Its structure and purpose are set out in the bylaws accompanying that incorporation. Its purpose was to discover and preserve the history and heritage of York and Sunbury counties in New Brunswick (Canada). Its structure provided for a Board of Directors elected by the members at the annual meeting and for committees to deal with different aspects of the Society's mission. Today, the society still has some 150 members, each one committed to the original mission of the York Sunbury Historical Society.

Unlike in other countries in Europe, there is no possibility of release for anyone sentenced to life imprisonment. Though the prisoner can appeal for pardon, it must be granted by royal decree. This is effectively the only way a life convicted prison could ever be set free from a life sentence; however, this almost never happens and only a few pardons for life convicted have ever been successful in recent history. Since the 1970s, only two such pardons have been successful, with both prisoners being terminally ill. Since 1945, 41 criminals (excluding war criminals who were sentenced to death under special justice) have been sentenced to life imprisonment. There has been a noticeable increase of life imprisonment sentences being given in the last decade, and more than triple the number of life imprisonment sentences in the last few years than the previous decades. Due to the strict nature of the sentence, most \\"common\\" murders result in a sentence of around 12 to 30 years. The judicial panel (always composed of three members) is not able to award sentences of longer than 15 years' imprisonment for manslaughter alone (so not combined with other facts constituting an offence), so if malice aforethought has not been proven, a criminal will never receive a sentence of longer than 15 years. The only life sentence for a single murder without aggravating circumstances was given in 2005 to Mohammed Bouyeri for the murder of Dutch film director Theo van Gogh, due to its strong political nature. In all other cases, there has been circumstances of recurrence (murder committed after sentencing for another murder), multitude (several murders) or severe gravity to the crime (i.e. torture murder).

It can be imposed for treason, the assassination of the Polish President, war of aggression, genocide, crimes against humanity, unlawful use of a weapon of mass destruction, war crimes, murder, homicide and serious bodily harm resulting in death. The prisoner must serve at least 25 years in order to be eligible for parole. The court may also choose to set a higher minimum term than 25 years at sentencing. Since the reintroduction of life imprisonment in 1995, the highest minimum term is 50 years. By comparison, life sentences in Canada, with the 25-year minimum non- parole period, are mandatory for high treason and, in some cases, murder, while the highest minimum term is 75 years (a sentence a judge can hand down to some murderers convicted of multiple counts of murder). While the law does not explicitly provide for life without parole, life sentences in Poland with extensively long non-parole periods (such as 50 years, the maximum allowed) typically last beyond a normal life span, and this makes it almost certain that the convicted person will never be released from prison alive. , 71 prisoners are serving a longer minimum term than 25 years: 39 convicts can apply for parole after 30 years, 24 after 35 years, 4 after 40 years and 2 after 50 years. The President of Poland has the power to end the prisoner's life sentence by granting clemency at any time; however, this has never happened. , there are more than 200 people serving life sentences in Polish prisons. All were convicted of murder. If no changes in law are made, prisoners serving life imprisonment will first become eligible for parole in 2020. For a person who was under the age of 18 at the time of any offense where the maximum penalty is life imprisonment, the maximum penalty is a term of 25 years' imprisonment, with eligibility for parole after a term of 15 years has been served. While life imprisonment exists in the country as the most severe punishment, its use as a punishment is never mandatory and is only handed down at the discretion of the court.

Courts could not sentence criminals to life imprisonment at that time. Only those who had been sentenced to death penalty could have their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. When the new Criminal Code of Russia was adopted in 1996, life imprisonment became a separate punishment. Overview Article 57 part 2 of the Criminal Code of Russia forbids women, men that were below the age of 18 at the time of the offense and men that were over the age of 65 at sentencing from being sentenced to life imprisonment. If the offender was below the age of 18 at the time of the offense, the maximum sentence is 10 years' imprisonment. Since 2002 changes have been made in Criminal Code of Russia. Multiple crimes with the same subject and direct object (simply - one article of Criminal Code) are counted as one crime for the sentence (counts separately for each offender), with these exceptions: * Crimes committed by minors are counted as the first, but only the final result is taken into the total sentence. * If the special object of the crime has changed or de facto never been, its counts as attempt to special subject crime in addition to the committed crime. * If the offender neither knows nor sees the special subject, it doesn't count as a special subject crime (but it may be as \\"regular\\" crime). Thus, multiple life sentences are concurrent. Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment are held in maximum security prisons (e.g. VK-240/2 White Swan (prison) in Solikamsk). After 25 years or 30 years (if a male offender is aged 65 years and over), a criminal sentenced to life imprisonment may apply to a court for \\"conditional early release\\" (—É—Å–ª–æ–≤–Ω–æ-–¥–æ—Å—Ä–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –æ—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ) if the prisoner has made no serious violations of prison rules, and has not committed a serious crime during imprisonment, but this can only be for a conviction for a single murder. Parole, if granted, may carry restrictions, such as that the subject may not change residence, visit certain locations, and so forth. If the criminal commits a new offense, the court may retract the parole. If the application for parole is declined however, a new application can be filed 3 years later. Life imprisonment was introduced in Russia in 1992 as a pardon at death penalty replacement. The first prisoners became eligible for parole in 2017. Crimes punishable with life imprisonment According to the Criminal Code of Russia, as of April 5, 2014, the crimes punishable with life imprisonment are: * Article 105 part 2 - aggravated murder (i.e. murder of two or more persons, murder of a pregnant woman, murder committed with particular cruelty etc.) * Articles 131 part 5 and 132 part 5 - rape or coercive sexual actions committed against a person under 18 years, if the criminal had already been sentenced for a sexual crime against a minor * Article 134 part 6 - sexual intercourse with a person under 16 years, if the criminal had already been sentenced for a sexual crime against a minor * Article 205 part 3 - act of terrorism committed with intrusion into nuclear energy objects; committed with radioactive materials, sources of radioactive rays, toxic or poisonous materials, dangerous chemical or biological materials; act of terrorism that caused the intended infliction of death * Article 206 part 4 - hostage taking that caused the intended infliction of death * Article 210 part 4 - organising a criminal community committed by a person occupying the highest position in the criminal hierarchy * Article 228.1 part 5 - illegal producing, selling or transmittal of illegal drugs or drug-containing plants in especially large amounts * Article 229.1 part 4 - illicit trafficking of illegal drugs or drug-containing plants or drug- producing equipment committed by an organised group or in especially big amount or with violence against a person in charge of border or customs control * Article 277 - infringement on life of a statesman or a public person with purpose to stop his/her political activity or as an act of revenge for this activity * Article 281 part 3 - sabotage that caused the intended infliction of death * Article 295 - infringement on life of a person who executes justice * Article 317 - infringement on life of a law enforcement official * Article 357 - genocide Conditions Life sentence prisoners are taken separately from other prisoners in cells typically of two inmates each, unless he is deemed dangerous to others. When they are being moved outside of cells to walking cages, they must remain handcuffed, and are also prohibited from lying on their beds at hours which are not their sleeping times. They are allowed to \\"walk\\" in special tiny courts one and half hours a day, which are very often just bigger rooms, the largest being seven meters by seven meters. Thus, inmate may spend years without being outside of the building and breathing fresh air. Most of these conditions are inherited from the conditions in which death row inmates awaited execution in the last years of the Soviet Union. Presidential pardon The president can pardon prisoners by reducing the minimum to and/or granting parole.

It is a mandatory punishment for premeditated murder, gang rape, serial rape including rape where the rapist knew they were HIV positive or if the victim was under 18 and/or mentally disabled. In certain circumstances, robberies and hijackings (and aircraft hijacking) also carry a mandatory life sentence. Section 51 of South Africa's Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1997 prescribes the minimum sentences for other types of murders, rapes and robberies to 25, 15 and 10 years respectively, so parole is almost always granted to prisoners serving life sentences after the minimum sentence for the lesser crime has been served. However, a prisoner must be given a parole hearing after having served 25 years. In special cases, life imprisonment without any possibility of parole or pardon for an extensively long period of time (such as 1,000 years) can be imposed, such as in the case of serial killer Moses Sithole.

The ship also served as Ypoploiarchos Grigoropoulos (L161) in the Hellenic Navy from 1958 to 1993. She was the last known surviving LSM in its original configuration. Her last location before scrapping was Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. LSM-45 was donated to the Museum of the Marine by the now defunct Amphibious Ship Museum under the understanding that it would be put on display at the museum, and was towed to North Carolina in 2004 from Omaha, Nebraska. The museum decided in 2007 that the ship would not be a part of the museum and tried looking for another home for the ship. In 2009, there were reports that the Museum was considering scrapping or sinking the ship as an artificial reef, and she was scrapped sometime between 2010 and 2014.  Career  USS LSM-45 was laid down on 6 June 1944 at Brown Shipyard Co. in Houston, Texas, and was launched on 30 June 1944. She was commissioned on 31 July 1944, Lt. Charles D. Freight USNR, in command. During World War II LSM-45 was assigned to the Pacific Theater and saw service in the Philippines. She was decommissioned on 27 March 1947 at Green Cove Springs, Florida, and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Florida Group, Green Cove Springs. On 3 November 1958, the ship was transferred to Greece, and served in the Hellenic Navy under the name Ypoploiarchos Grigoropoulos (L-161). AMA ownership In early 1998, the Amphibious Museum of the Americas (AMA) found the former LSM-45 in Greece, half sunk. The AMA raised and restored the ship and had it towed back to the United States. A press release stated, \\"We have found USS LSM-45 in the Grecian Isles and she is being returned to the United States to be placed in the National Naval Museum at Freedom Park, Omaha, Nebraska, right on the Missouri River.\\" Getting LSM-45 ready for towing to New Orleans took a month in the Greek naval base's repair yard. In August 1998, the ship came under full control of the USS LSM-LSMR Association, made up of former shipmates who served on LSMs and similar ships from 1944 to 1970. Intermarine of New Orleans, Louisiana, volunteered its services to the Landing Ship, Medium (LSM) Association of America and committed to deliver the ship over the distance from Greece to Omaha, Nebraska. The LSM departed Hellenic Naval Base, Skaramagas, Greece, on 9 September 1998 under tow of the chartered Russian tug, Ost. After a stop at Tenerife, in the Canary Islands for fuel, the tug made way across the Atlantic Ocean heading directly west on course 270¬∞ at a speed of . Rounding the Florida Keys, the Ost and her tow then headed up through the Gulf and arrived at the Port of New Orleans on 20 October. Intermarine assumed the responsibility as agents for the LSM Association and Freedom Park, managing all registration and berthing efforts upon the LSM's port of entry arrival. Additional port services were arranged with gracious vendors and many volunteers who donated their services. The timing of the tow from New Orleans to the nation's heartland at Omaha, Nebraska, was the next big hurdle primarily because the Missouri River was closing to navigation traffic around mid-November. Barge and tow operators are usually busy getting their equipment out of the rivers before the winter freeze. Towing from New Orleans, up the Mississippi River to St. Louis, was made possible by American Commercial Barge Lines. Blaske Marine then provided the AMA a dedicated towboat, the M/V Omaha, Captained by William Beacom, to push LSM-45 up the Missouri from St. Louis to a permanent riverfront berth at Freedom Park, arriving on Monday, 23 November 1998. While in Omaha, restoration work was done by volunteers including a fresh coat of paint, unstepping the mast for storage, and work on all decks. The bulkheads below deck were lined with rows of walnut plaques with the names of those hundreds of individuals that had given of their time and money to restore and save the LSM. There is evidence on every deck, in every compartment, from the galley to the engine room that many hours of restoration had taken place by dedicated workers. Donation to Museum of the Marine The Amphibious Ship Museum, a group of former military members who served on LSMs during World War II and the Korean War, were unhappy with the maintenance and upkeep of the LSM-45 at Freedom Park and began looking for a new home for the ship. Museum representatives contacted Headquarters Marine Corps' historical branch, which put them in touch with the Marine Corps Museum of the Carolinas. The Amphibious Ship Museum agreed to turn over rights to the ship and its artifacts to the Marine Corps Museum of the Carolinas once the ship anchored at Mile Hammock Bay, near Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. On 11 December 2003 the State Department granted approval for the moving of the LSM-45. The ship was towed to the Museum of the Marine in Jacksonville, North Carolina, in April 2004. Once docked behind the museum, it was to be opened to the public and the ship's deck was to be filled with equipment used during World War II. After nearly three years, the Museum of the Marine announced it was pulling anchor on the donated World War II ship and looking for someone who could better afford its preservation. Initially, the museum planned to incorporate the 500-ton vessel into a site plan that, at the time, focused on waterfront property on the New River next to Jacksonville's proposed civic center. Location prospects fizzled, though, along with the civic center plans. Now ready to break ground sans water, the Museum of the Marine rethought its ability to keep the ship afloat. The museum's announcement to break ties with the ship came shortly after members of the USS LSM/LSMR Association - an organization closely tied to the ship's donors - began questioning the fate of the ship after learning of the museum's plans to build in the landlocked Lejeune Memorial Gardens. By May 2003, the Museum of the Marine has identified several organizations as a suitable home for the vessel and hoped to share transportation costs with the benefactor. In photos taken in February 2009, the ship appears to have significantly deteriorated since being handed over to the Museum of the Marine, and will again need new paint. Reports of plans to scrap By late 2008 reports had begun to surface that the Museum of the Marine had not found a suitable home for the ship, and that due to a request by the Coast Guard for the return of the pier where it was moored, were considering scrapping the ship, or sinking it as an artificial reef. The ship was also closed to visitors, although members of the restored were able to visit and tour the ship in February 2009 by making contact with the museum. In May, 2009, a working group from removed parts and material for use in the restoration of their ship (in Albany, New York). In February 2010, crewmembers from LST -325 also removed parts. The Museum of the Marine plans to remove the 40 mm mount and the conning tower for possible display, with LSM-45 then being used as a barge by a private owner. In October 2010, the last surviving crewmember of LSM-45 from World War II died. At that time it was also reported that LSM-45 had been sold to Justice Marine, Sneads Ferry, North Carolina to be altered into a barge. However, in February 2014 it was reported that it was not suitable for use as a barge so it was scrapped instead. Status as last known survivor Up to 2010, USS LSM-45 was one of three known survivors, along with LSM-333 and LSM-469, which were owned by the Royal Thai Navy. On 1 February 2003, LSM-469 was sunk as an artificial reef off the coast of Pattaya, Thailand. On 17 September 2006 the Royal Thai Navy sank LSM-333 off the coast of Thailand at Pattaya, leaving LSM-45 as the last known survivor in original Naval configuration. Other LSMs have been converted to commercial use.

It is based on the 2006 novel of the same name by Swedish writer Stieg Larsson, the second entry in his Millennium series. The film follows Lisbeth Salander as she returns to Sweden after spending a year abroad. She falls under suspicion of having murdered a journalist and his girlfriend, as well as her own social services guardian, Nils Bjurman. Mikael Blomkvist has to do what he can to find her before the authorities do. A sequel, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest, was released two months later, on 27 November 2009. Plot Lisbeth Salander purchases an apartment in Stockholm. On returning to Sweden after nearly a year living abroad, Salander reconnects with her best friend and former partner Miriam Wu and offers her free use of her old apartment in return for forwarding her mail. Later, Salander confronts Nils Bjurman after hacking into his mail and discovering that he has an appointment booked with a tattoo removal specialist. Threatening him with his own gun, she warns him not to remove the tattoo that she etched on his abdomen. Millennium magazine welcomes Dag Svensson, a new journalist who is writing an expos√© on prostitution and human trafficking in Sweden. Dag's girlfriend, Mia Bergman, is writing her doctoral thesis on sex trafficking. Dag is nearly finished with the story and is confronting those who will be exposed by the article. Dag and his girlfriend are about to leave on a holiday and ask Mikael Blomkvist to come to his apartment and collect some photographs. At the same time Dag also asks Blomkvist to inquire about someone called \\"Zala,\\" who may have a connection to his present research. Blomkvist arrives at their apartment and finds the two lying dead. The murder weapon is tracked to Bjurman who is also deceased. Salander is the prime suspect, as her fingerprints happen to be on the gun. Salander tells Blomkvist that she did not kill anyone and that he needs to find the mysterious \\"Zala.\\" Blomkvist is contacted by Salander's boxing trainer and friend, Paolo Roberto. While he is unaware of Salander's whereabouts, Paolo does know Miriam, who also trained with them, and promises to pay her a visit. Near her apartment, Paolo witnesses Miriam being kidnapped by strongman Ronald Niedermann. Paolo follows his car to a deserted barn, where he hears him beat Miriam for information about Salander. Paolo comes in to rescue her but Niedermann beats him too. He then sets the barn aflame, but the two manage to escape. News breaks of the attack, and Paolo gives his account to the police. After Blomkvist leaves information that he has discovered about the case on his computer for Salander to hack into and read, she leaves a message to him saying, \\"Thank you for being my friend.\\" He realizes that she intends to set out alone to find the man who framed her and that she may not survive. A disguised Salander visits Miriam in hospital to apologize for getting her involved. Without giving anything away, Salander confirms the police sketch of Niedermann with Miriam and then disappears. Knowing now that he is Salander's friend, Miriam calls Blomkvist to the hospital to give him keys that Lisbeth dropped during her visit. Noticing that one of them is for a post office box, Blomkvist is able to access and read Salander's mail and locate her apartment. Meanwhile, Salander continues her efforts to find Niedermann by patiently staking out his post office box. She eventually sees someone retrieve his mail and follows him to a small house near Gosseberga. Reading the material in Lisbeth's apartment, Blomkvist finds the video of Bjurman raping Salander. In the offices of Millennium magazine, Paolo explains that he tracked down Niedermann and learned that he has congenital analgesia which makes him unable to feel pain. They trace Niedermann to a company owned by \\"Karl Axel Bodin.\\" Blomkvist has Erika Berger forward documents to Bublanski and sets out to find Salander. Salander crosses the grounds and enters the Gosseberga house, but Niedermann has been alerted by motion detectors and knocks her out. She awakens to see her father, Alexander \\"Zala\\" Zalachenko, an old man who walks with a stick and is heavily scarred by the burns that she inflicted as a child. He dismisses her mother as a whore and belittles her rape at the hands of Bjurman. He reveals that Niedermann is her half-brother and that Niedermann killed Bjurman to prevent him from revealing any of Zalachenko's secrets. They lead Lisbeth to a shallow grave in the woods. She tells him that the police will find him soon and all that he has said has been published online through her hidden cellphone. Seeing through her bluff, he shoots Lisbeth several times as she attempts to escape and buries her alive. Salander digs her way out using her cigarette case. Hidden in the woodshed, she surprises Zalachenko sticking an axe into his leg. She then keeps Niedermann at bay with Zalachenko's gun as Blomkvist comes coasting up the driveway. Ambulances and police arrive to take away Salander and Zalachenko who are both very badly injured. Cast Production Daniel Alfredson takes over from Niels Arden Oplev, who directed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the first part of the trilogy. Reception Film showing at theater in Buffalo, New York Critical response The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, although some noted it a step down from its predecessor. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 69% based on 156 reviews with an average rating of 6.2/10. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gives the film three and a half out of four stars, describing the film as a step down from The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, but only because the first film was so \\"fresh and unexpected\\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times praises Rapace's performance, stating, \\"tiny and agile, her steely rage showing now and then the tiniest crack of vulnerability, belongs to another dimension altogether. She makes this movie good enough, but also makes you wish it were much better.\\" Lisa Kennedy of The Denver Post describes Lisbeth Salander as \\"worth the trouble\\" and having a \\"cold stare\\" the like of which has not been seen since \\"Clint was roaming the Italian hillsides.\\" She notes the film uses the linked themes of bureaucratic corruption and misogyny, where the previous film linked misogyny with fascism. The review contrasts the violence against women and heroism of Fire with the violence of The Killer Inside Me, complaining that the latter gives in to the worst impulses, noting that only the former story \\"works,‚Äù as some redemption is provided through revenge. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune writes that the film is much the same as its predecessor, despite the new director (Daniel Alfredson) and screenwriter (Jonas Frykberg), and is likely to please those who enjoyed the first film. He observes that Rapace remains the chief asset of the series, and that she works well with Michael Nyqvist, who he likens to a more sincere, Swedish version of Larry Hagman. He writes further that even though Rapace and Nyqvist \\"could not be better\\" in their roles, the film should acknowledge the middle ground between the righteous heroes and the evil villains in order to work better as cinematic pulp fiction. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gives the film 3 out of 4 stars. Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail describes the film as \\"Tepid and downright confusing\\" for those who have not read the books, although he suspects there are few who have not; he notes that the plot, \\"already thick on the page, often seems impenetrable here.\\" Although he concedes the plot generates some suspense, he complains it more often results in confusion but hopes the final film in the trilogy will bring greater clarity. Box office Prior to released in the United States, the film had already earned $51,259,526 at the international box office. During its first week of release in the United States, it grossed $904,998, being released in three times as many theaters as the first film and grossing three times as much. The film has a worldwide gross of $67,126,795.

Astorga was located on the flank of the French invasion of Spain and Portugal, and was meant to be used as a headquarters during the campaign. For several weeks no attack took place, as neither side had artillery enough to fight well. Shortly after the French guns arrived, however, a hole was made in the wall and the city fell shortly thereafter. The French overpowered the Spanish garrison inside and took the city on April 20, 1810; with a loss of 160 men. Location Astorga is located in the province of Le√≥n, in northwest Spain. Because of its location, it sat on the flank of the French army as they advanced into Spain, and then invaded Portugal. The city was built into a hill, part of the Manzanal mountains; and therefore was provided with natural defenses. The French had already been defeated once trying to take the city, in September 1809, after which General La Romana repaired the walls of the city and built up its defenses. Forces The French forces, part of Andr√© Mass√©na's army, were led by Jean-Andoche Junot. Junot arrived at Astorga on March 21 with Napoleon's 8th corps, consisting of 12,000 men, including 1,200 cavalry forces. Junot's forces included the Irish Legion; they had joined earlier that month. Astorga would be the first action for the Second Battalion of the Legion. Junot placed Bertrand Clausel's division in the position Loison had held, with Solignac in support, and St. Croix to watch the rear. Campaign General Loison attempted to take the city in February 1810, as it was meant to be his headquarters during the invasion of Portugal; but was unprepared to attack the defenses he found there, and was forced to retreat. Junot's troops came to assist Loison, but brought no siege guns with them; It took Junot weeks to gather enough artillery to assault the town. In the meantime, the French forces dug trenches to besiege the town. Incidentally, the English and Spanish troops under Wellington had the same troubles when they recaptured the city in 1812. The garrison in Astorga had no siege guns, either: for several weeks there was a standoff. During these weeks, Santocildes emptied the town of 3,000 of its residents and stocked up on supplies for the siege, which began on March 21 of 1810. The Spanish could expect no hope from Wellington's forces, which remained in Portugal. Until the siege guns arrived, there was no action except nuisance fire from what little artillery Junot had, and skirmish parties sent out from Astorga. Junot's 18 siege guns arrived on April 15 from Valladolid, and by the 20th, the wall of the city was breached. The French stormed the city the next evening; however, their first attack was repulsed at the cost of 300 men. Those of the storming company who were not killed holed up just inside the wall and held the position for the night. The next morning, Santocildes surrendered as the French were preparing for another attack. Aftermath Santocildes was almost out of ammunition when he surrendered: he had fewer than 30 rounds of ammunition left per man, and only 8 rounds of artillery. He gave the French 2,500 prisoners and the city, but cost the French 160 men, with 400 wounded. His garrison lost only 51 dead and 109 wounded. Most of the French casualties came in the assault on the breach. The Irish Legion led the charge over the wall, and suffered heavy losses: Captain John Allen's company's drummer boy continued to beat the charge after having lost both legs, for which he was given the French Legion of Honor.

This was Yuen Woo-ping's first film directing since 1996's Tai Chi Boxer. The film has been shown in both 2D and 3D, and was promoted as the first Chinese 3D film. It was a rather large financial loss for producer Bill Kong, making only RMB 46.5 million (US$6.82 million) against an estimated budget of US$20 million. It was released in the U.S. on May 13, 2011 by the distribution company Indomina, where it grossed US$62,200 during its run. This was one of Carradine's final performances and it was released posthumously. Plot Su Can is a general who leads a military force to save a prince from a large fortress of enemies in the mountains. In return, the prince promises that the Emperor will make him governor of Hubei. Su's step brother Yuan is envious of Su, but Su loves him and asks the prince to make Yuan governor instead. Su wants to leave the military and lead a life pursuing the perfection of wushu, eventually in the hopes of starting his school and teaching his skills. Su gives his great prestigious sword to a comrade Ma, then tells Yuan of his plans. Yuan expresses that he is always in Su's shadow but accepts the governorship. Early next morning, Su leaves on a horse. Five years later, Su and his wife Ying (Yuan's sister) have a child, Feng. Su's father informs them that Yuan is returning from the military to be a governor. He warns Su that Yuan may not have come back simply to reconcile with family but to seek revenge. This is because years ago, Su's father killed Yuan's father when the latter went too far in learning an evil martial arts technique called the Five Venom Fists. Su's father then took Yuan in, but he harbours concern that Yuan is still vengeful. Su is naive and assures his father that everything will be alright. When Yuan returns, a homecoming party is held. Yuan greets his sister Ying, Feng, and Su's father. Su's father knows what is impending and asks Yuan to take his revenge on him alone, sparing Su and his family. Using his mastery of the Five Venom Fists, Yuan kills Su's father and decapitates him. He expresses his desire to be with his sister (Ying) and her son Feng as a family. When Su hears the news of his father's murder, he rushes to the scene of his father's death and is attacked by the Iron Twins. He chases them to a rapid where Yuan is offering Su's father's head to his real father's shrine as a symbol of revenge taken. A battle ensues between Yuan and Su. Yuan has a dark armour sewn into his body, making him partially invulnerable to blades. Using his Five Venom Fists, Yuan deals a deadly poisonous blow to Su who is defeated. Feng begs for Su's life and Yuan spares him but throws him into the rapids. Ying jumps into the rapid to save Su and Yuan is heartbroken at the loss of his beloved sister. He takes Feng in as his only family. Ying awakes in forest area and tries to bring her husband to civilization and safety. They are found by a herb researcher and wine maker, Sister Yu, who treats Su's wounds. Su comes to consciousness but is broken to find his right arm severely weakened with all tendons torn. At first, he is desperate and turns to drinking, but with Ying's support, he focuses on training in order to save Feng. He meets Wu Shu God and an old sage and asks to be their disciple. At a sacred site, he trains with the Wu Shu God for years, always trying to defeat him but never able to. Later, by checking Su's pulse, Dr. Du reveals to Ying that Su is going mad and that there is probably no Wu Shu god or Old Sage since she is the only one living in the area. Ying follows Su into the forest one day and finds him fighting (seemingly) with himself, oblivious to the fact that he is only battling with the Wu Shu god in his mind. Ying pleads with Su to come to his senses but he does not believe her. By the time Su realizes the truth, it is too late. Ying has left to try to save Feng by herself. At Yuan's palace, Ying is now a captive of Yuan. Su arrives shortly after and fights his way through the guards. He also battles the Iron Twins and with his improved skills, impales both on a podao, a saber like spear. Yuan orders his men to bury Ying alive in a box and then kills the men who buried her so that only he knows her location. A crazed Su battles with Yuan in his training chamber and ultimately defeats him, even gnashing though a poisonous snake in the process. Feng screams that Yuan must not die because only he knows Ying's location, but a maddened Su delivers a fatal blow to Yuan's throat, thus executing him in anger. Realizing the words of Feng, he rushes out and a dying soldier reveals the vague location of Ying. Su and Feng rush to search for her but are too late digging her out. Ying dies from lack of air, and Su goes mad with grief. The era changes from the dynastic to the colonized. Su has lost his mind after the loss of his wife and the previous delusions he had. A homeless Feng leads his father through the streets by rope and takes care of him. A Kung Fu master is killed in a fighting arena - part of a foreigners' club - leaving Su's old friend, Ma, as leader of the Wu Shu Federation. The arena is a stage below which tigers lurk freely, waiting for any unfortunate fighter to drop below. In the meantime, Su goes into an inn and creates trouble by stealing wine and countering people bent on stopping him with martial art moves. He then meets a fellow drunkard (the Wu Shu god in disguise) who spars with him and gives him a few philosophical tips. The two of them start using Drunken Fighting (Zui Quan) techniques, and Su regains his sanity. The inn lady calls Ma to deal with Su and Ma recognizes Su. They have a talk and Ma gives Su back his sword. Su asks Ma to take care of Feng since he is unfit to be a father but Feng persists, staying with his father instead. The next day, Su and Feng show up to support Ma in his arena battle. Su goes about drinking in the club's bar area, oblivious to Ma receiving a serious beating in the ring. When Feng tries to save Ma from being killed, the opposing wrestler grabs Feng and holds him in the air. Feng screams for help from his father. His son's cries awake Su from his drunken state and Su rushes into the arena. As Ma and Feng are being taken out of the arena by bystanders, Su battles and defeats the wrestler. Anthony, owner of a wrestling stable, orders his lot to pour into the arena, resulting in a mismatch of three wrestlers to one (Su). Using the drunken martial arts technique learned from his fellow drunkard in the inn, Su's defeats the fighters although he is heavily injured. At the end of the battle, the other fighters are either dead or unconscious, and only after a vision of Ying and the dramatic cries of Feng in an otherwise silenced arena, does a semi-conscious Su manage to stand up. He is declared the winner. The film ends with a seemingly restored Su practising his moves of old but with long hair reminiscent of the insane period of his life, with Feng and (presumably, in Su's mind) Ying observing. Su has seemingly found his passion.

Bill Kong reportedly recommended Vincent Zhao for the role of Beggar Su. Saying that Zhao has been doing television dramas in recent years and should act more in movies. Yuen Woo Ping after looking through some of Zhao's old works decided to choose him for the lead role. In order to prepare for the role Zhao had to lose up to nine kilograms' worth of weight as he explains \\"Beggar Su can't be too plump.\\" Zhao also had to take up to 2 months' worth of break dancing classes due to the fact Yuen wanted to have a more rhythmic and modern form of the drunken fist. Yuen originally wanted actor Feng Xiaogang to play the role of Old Sage but due to schedule conflicts Feng had to turn the role down and was given the chance to direct his own scene in the movie where he appears as a Pickpocket in which he teaches Little Feng portrayed by young actor, Suen Hanwen to pickpocket. Despite this Yuen and the producers thought that the scene wasn't needed in the movie and thus the scene was deleted in the final cut of the film instead. True Legend began shooting in the mountain region in a suburb of Beijing on August 28, 2008 that was quite low-key. Filming wrapped up in late January, 2009. The set of the scene in which Su Can saves the Imperial Prince / General broke an all-time record for the largest set ever built inside a Chinese filming studio. The filming period of this film took five months to complete. While still in pre-production, Yuen Woo Ping and some of his workers took more than four months to scout for possible filming locations. They finally chose Yellow Mountain, Hukou Waterfall of the Yellow River and the traditional Anhui hui-style residences. Yuen Woo Ping preferred to shoot their original structure rather than building it in sound stages, which may look fake. The scene in which Andy On and Vincent Zhao fights at Hukou Waterfall is said to be the hardest fight scene to shoot in the entire film according to Yuen Woo Ping. Yuen Woo Ping stated, \\"The safety issue for that scene was the biggest challenge of the whole movie. The landscape looks magnificent but are very dangerous; there was no chance for us to make any mistakes. We meticulously planned out the whole choreography and tested and rehearsed it for many times before rolling the camera. We also double-wired our talent just to make sure they were completely safe. This fighting sequence took us 15 working days to complete.\\" The films action choreography has been praised and ridiculed with some saying that the action choreography is unmemorable. Despite this Yuen has explained that he doesn't wish to create too fanciful action sequences and explains that \\"if it's too fanciful than the audience won't be able to see the moves all that clearly.\\" Instead he wanted to create a mixture of traditional and modern form of martial arts thus the action scenes in which Beggar Su uses his Drunken Fist, he did a lot of modern break dancing. When asked why the full movie isn't in 3D but around 20 minutes in 3D, Yuen explained that making a 3D film is very expensive and takes a lot of human resources. Yuen added that he hired up to one hundred digital artists in order to convert the two action scenes that he thought were the most important in the movie to be converted into 3D. It took up to six entire months just to convert these two fight scenes into 3D. Despite his efforts, a number of countries who bought the movies distribution rights didn't release the movie in 3D because workers in movie theaters would have to tell the audiences when they should put on their 3D glasses and take it off as there are scenes in between the 3D scenes that are in 2D. Jay Chou also helped with designing some of the actor's outfits as well. DVD release On October 25, 2010, DVD was released in Optimum Home Entertainment in Europe in Region 2.

It was the third and final installment of the film series, released two months following The Girl Who Played with Fire. It also marked the final film appearance of Per Oscarsson, who died in a house fire on 31 December 2010. Plot The film begins at the conclusion of The Girl Who Played with Fire. Computer hacker Lisbeth Salander is airlifted to a hospital in Gothenburg to recover from gunshot wounds inflicted by her father, crime boss Alexander Zalachenko. Journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who Salander helped on a previous case, resumes his efforts to clear her of several murder charges, knowing that she was framed by the \\"Section\\", a group within the Swedish Security Service that illegally sheltered Zalachenko after he defected from the Soviet Union. Section members Evert Gullberg and Fredrik Clinton decide to silence Zalachenko and Salander to preserve their secrets. Gullberg arrives at the hospital and kills Zalachenko, but is unable to reach Salander; he then commits suicide. Clinton plans to have Salander recommitted to the mental hospital where the Section had her institutionalized as a child after she nearly killed Zalachenko. His collaborator in this plan is Dr. Peter Teleborian, the hospital's administrator, who \\"treated\\" the young Salander by putting her in restraints for the smallest infractions. Blomkvist persuades her doctor to sneak an Internet phone into Salander's room, whereupon Salander contacts her fellow hacker, Plague, to see if he can find something on Teleborian. She then tells Blomkvist that Annika Giannini, her lawyer and Blomkvist's sister, has permission to use a video showing her state-appointed guardian Nils Bjurman raping her; Bjurman, a former Section employee, is one of the people she is accused of murdering. Ronald Niedermann, Zalachenko's son and enforcer who previously tried to kill Salander's girlfriend Miriam, remains a fugitive, wanted for killing a police officer. Sonny, a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang Salander encountered in the previous film, learns that Niedermann went to his home to hide out. There, Sonny finds his brother dead and his girlfriend badly injured. She tells him that Niedermann was the culprit, and Sonny vows revenge. On the day of her murder trial, Salander enters court with piercings, a mohawk, black makeup, and black leather clothing. Called as an expert witness for the prosecution, Teleborian characterizes Salander as delusional and violent; but Giannini gradually demolishes his credibility, using Salander's words and files from the hospital. She also presents the video proving Bjurman raped Salander. As Giannini presents her case, the police arrest the people involved with the Section and seize their place of operation. In court, Blomkvist and Giannini prove that Teleborian made a false diagnosis on orders from the Section, and that the evidence against her was planted. Teleborian is then arrested for possession of child pornography, which Plague discovered after hacking into his laptop. The court releases Salander. Salander checks on a property she has inherited from her father and discovers the warehouse where Niedermann is hiding. He tries to kill her, but she nails his feet to the floor with a nail gun. She calls Sonny and tells the bikers where to find him, and then calls the police. Blomkvist visits Salander to tell her that the motorcycle gang killed Niedermann and were arrested at the warehouse afterward. They then reconcile and go their separate ways.

Reception The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 53% based on 125 reviews, with an average score of 5.8/10, the consensus being, \\"Slow and mostly devoid of the stellar chemistry between its two leads, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest is a disappointingly uneven conclusion to the Millennium trilogy.\\" Despite the low rating, the film did receive positive reviews from such noteworthy critics as Peter Travers, James Berardinelli, and Roger Ebert, who gave the film three out of four stars, stating, \\"These are all very well-made films. Like most European films, they have adults who are grown-ups, not arrested adolescents. Mikael and Erika, his boss and lover, have earned the lines in their faces, and don't act like reckless action heroes. They make their danger feel so real to us that we realize the heroes of many action movies don't really believe they're in any danger at all.\\" Reviewing the original Swedish version in national daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, Jan S√∂derqvist is dismissive of the thin plot: his article is titled 'No, it doesn't last the distance', and laments that \\"the whole responsibility for carrying this grandiose production rests on Lisbeth Salander's slender shoulders\\". But S√∂derqvist remains enthusiastic about Rapace and her character, Lisbeth Salander: \\"Salander is, on the other hand, undeniably an original and fascinating character, full of possibilities and secrets, and if Noomi Rapace builds an international acting career on these three films I have nothing to say against it.\\" S√∂derqvist continues: \\"There is an enticing darkness in her glance and a brittle hardness about her defences that more than matches her tattoos.\\" Maaret Koskinen, reviewing the film in Sweden's national daily Dagens Nyheter, found it a pity \\"that the subsequent Millennium films dribble away a given golden opportunity\\" and \\"devalue an unprecedented accumulation of popular cultural capital.\\" All that remains in the third section, writes Koskinen, is a skeleton (of the book's power).

Forming from a tropical wave late on August 28, 2009, off of Mexico's Pacific coast, the system rapidly intensified into a Category 2 hurricane on the next day. Two days after developing, Jimena strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane. After peaking close to Category 5 intensity on September 1, it encountered cold water and began to weaken. When the hurricane made landfall on the Baja California Peninsula on September 3, it was only a Category 2 hurricane. On the next day, the tropical cyclone entered the Gulf of California, though the storm weakened into a remnant low after looping back eastward towards Baja California. The storm's remnants drifted westward into the Pacific afterward, before dissipating on September 8. When the storm made landfall, Jimena caused $173.9 million USD in damage. The system killed four people across the peninsula. In Baja California Sur, the town of Muleg√© was devastated with other areas in the region also receiving major damage. In Sonora, record rainfall fell, with some areas receiving more than . Statewide damage totaled at $37 million USD while five people were killed and two others were listed as missing. The remnants of the storm also triggered thunderstorms in the Southwestern United States, causing minor damage. Meteorological history Hurricane Jimena originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August 15. The tropical wave traversed the Atlantic Ocean with little or no convective development. On August 25, the National Hurricane Center began monitoring a broad area of low pressure, while the system was located over Central America. The system moved westbound and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean later that day. Initially, there were no signs of additional development. However, shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase and an area of low pressure developed within the wave on August 27. Around 1800 UTC on August 28, the low had become sufficiently organized for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to designate the system as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was situated roughly 220 miles (355 km) south of Acapulco. Tracking westward in response to a mid-level ridge over Mexico, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on 0000 UTC August 29. In real time, however, it was not classified until early on August 29 while located west of Acapulco. Tropical Storm Jimena featured only a small area of gale-force winds upon being named; however, the small size of the storm allowed for its subsequent intensification. Deep convection developed around the center of circulation and well-defined convective feeder band to the north. Rapid intensification began to take place early on August 29 as extremely deep convection developed and microwave satellite imagery depicted a developing eye feature within the center of the storm. Jimena turned towards the northwest by this time, and moved over very warm sea surface temperatures, averaging . The hurricane was upgraded to Category 2 intensity in the late evening hours on August 30, and was upgraded to the season's third major hurricane ‚Äì a storm with winds of or greater ‚Äì on the morning of August 30 when the eye became visible on satellite imagery. Continuing to intensify, it was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just six hours after becoming a major hurricane and 24 hours after becoming a tropical storm. Meanwhile, the eye became better defined. Hurricane Jimena intensifying to the southwest of right Late on August 29, the cyclone leveled off in intensity as a mid-level Category 4 hurricane due to an eyewall replacement cycle, where one eye gets replaced by another. The cycle continued for another 24 hours, only to start another burst of intensification. By the evening of August 31, Hurricane hunters measured winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) and a pressure of 931 mbar (hPa; 27.49 inHg) while the powerful cyclone began to turn to the north due to nearby Tropical Storm Kevin and a low pressure area west of Baja California. Wind shear increased as the hurricane moved over progressively cooler water. Despite weakening slightly, Jimena was anticipated by meteorologists to still remain a major hurricane as the storm moved ashore. This did not occur and Jimena steadily weakened. On September 1, Hurricane hunters found Jimena weaker, reporting winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a pressure of 940 mbar (hPa; 27.76 inHg). About 12 hours after the flight, the winds of Jimena dropped below major hurricane intensity despite an increase of convection. On 1200 UTC September 2, Jimena made landfall on Isla San Margarita, Baja California del Sur with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a pressure of 971 mbar (hPa; 28.67 inHg). An hour later, Jimena made a second landfall (after re-entering the Pacific) at the same intensity near Cabo San L√°zaro. It then moved over land, weakening into a Category 1 later that day, only to move back offshore as a Category 1 hurricane. The hurricane made a third landfall near San Junacio with 85 mph (150 km/h) winds. After its third landfall, Jimena returned to tropical storm status over land. After emerging into the Gulf of California, steering currents collapsed and increased wind shear continued to weaken Jimena. By late on September 3, Jimena was just a minimal tropical storm. It turned to the west, weakening into a tropical depression the next day. With winds of 30 mph (45 km/h), the system made a fourth and final landfall near Santa Rosal√≠a, Baja California Sur. Within five hours, the tropical depression had degenerated into a remnant low. At midday on September 5, the remnant low had dissipated; however, the remnant circulation of Jimena continued to track westward into the Pacific for a few more days. Preparations Upon Jimena crossing Central America, the NHC noted the possibility locally heavy rainfall spreading across much of Central America and in extreme Southwestern Mexico. As the storm moved parallel to the Mexican coast, interests in the region were asked to watch the progress of the system and officials in the area opened shelters due to the risk of high winds. The Sonora state government issued a blue (initial) alert for 14 municipalities on the southern portion of the state the afternoon of August 31. Later on the day, the blue alert was upgraded to a green alert, citing the risk of large rainfall amounts. Early on August 31, about 54 hours prior to landfall, the Government of Mexico issued a hurricane watch from Bahia Magdalena to San Evaristo in the southern Baja California peninsula. A state of emergency was declared in five districts of Baja California Sur requested via the local government. In La Paz, residents rushed to get groceries before the stores closed and residents boarded up windows. In Los Cabos, residents frantically stocked up on supplies before the tropical cyclone struck. On August 31, civil defense authorities in Los Cabos announced that they would have to evacuate 20,000 families from their homes. Officials urged a total of 10,000 people to evacuate from shacks. Most people evacuated; however, they feared that there items would be stolen if they had left. While they did struggle with evacuations, officials managed to evacuate 15,000 people living in hurricane prone areas. However, many people such as tourists and the poor failed to evacuate, though 2,000 foreigners did leave the Los Cobos area. On August 30, Robbie Berg from the National Hurricane Center noted that the hurricanes remnants may help fire relief in California and also interests Baja California should monitor the progress of the system. Impact Southwestern Mexico In Acapulco, the storm produced overcast skies, but ports in the area remained open. In addition, the states of Guerrero, Colima, and Jalisco suffered mudslides, landslides, and heavy rain from outer rainbands related to the system. Baja California Sur right When the tropical cyclone passed over the Baja California Peninsula, storm chasers in Puerto San Carlos reported a minimum pressure of 973 mb (hPa; 28.73 inHg). Ciudad Constitucion reported peak winds of , with a peak gust of , and a statewide peak of . A secondary peak rainfall occurred at Santa Rosal√≠a. However, no reports of storm surge or storm tide were received by the National Hurricane Center. When the storm was over, Jimena's winds and heavy rain brought devastation across the Baja peninsula. One man was reported killed in Muleg√©. Most of the homes and businesses there received extensive damage and water was deep. Damage there was considered worse than Hurricane John in 2006. One bridge in Mulege was under of water. The downtown area of Santa Rosal√≠a was severely damaged with flash floods. Hurricane-force winds battered the area for hours before diminishing to the next day. Water supplies ran low and two bridges were washed out. In a nearby canyon, floodwaters washed out many cars and livestock. In Cabo San Lucas, Jimena produced little damage. However, the entire town of Punta Chivato were flooded and damaged, with some being destroyed. In addition, 75% of homes were damaged in Puerto San Carlos, and power was lost in many areas including Comond√∫ and Loreto. In the town of Puerto Lopez Mateos, half of the cannery buildings were destroyed and every wood home was destroyed, thus leaving a quarter of the population homeless. Nearby, the storm nearly destroyed two isolated villages, Punta Abreojos village and Laguna San Ignacio. Both areas got hit by Jimena at its first landfall. Although in Bahia Asuncion damages was minor, the villages of Abreojos and San Ignacio Lagoon were badly damaged. Seventy percent of the electric network form Santa Rosal√≠a to Ciudad Constituci√≥n was damaged due to power outages. In both of the towns, the Mexican Red Cross branches received some damage. The roads from San Jos√© del Cabo to Tijuana was affected because any nearby creeks overflowed their banks. The airports in Los Cabos, La Paz and Loreto and ports were briefly closed, but were later re-opened after the storm passed since the airports received only minimal damage. A total of 35,000 people were reported homeless and hit 29 transmission lines in the cites Cabo San Lucas, San Jos√© del Cabo, La Paz and Ciudad Constituci√≥n affecting 50,000 customers. The worst was in the former, with a total of 27,000 customers affected and 17 transmission lines. Severe damage also occurred in the agricultural sector; 400 hectares of citrus was lost, 80 hectares of greenhouses was destroyed. Losses in the sector were estimated to be at least MXN$500 million (US$37.3 million). Damages to infrastructure amounted to MXN$300 million (US$12.5 million). Total losses related to Hurricane Jimena reached 2.3 billion pesos ($173.9 million). Local water authorities reported that 14,000 people were waterless, because eight pipelines broke. The worst damage occurred in the aqueduct in Santa Rosal√≠a. The officials estimated that the repair would cost about $652,224. A total of 72,000 people were affected and four people were reported dead. Sonora Jimena produced record rainfall in Sonora. By September 3, rainfall had reached and the state newspaper then noted the possible of a dam overflowing. A few days later, in Guaymas, rainfall from the storm had reached , thus setting a state rainfall record. The peak 24-hour rainfall record was set by Jimena as it ultimately topped out at while 43.39 inches (711 ml) of rain was reported in 36 hours. The towns of Guaymas and Empalme became unreachable from the rest of the state because Mexico Federal Highway 15 was closed due to flooding. Some river channels overflowed due to flooding. In addition, a total of 15 people were stuck on the roof of a middle school and was later rescued by air. A total of 775 people were evacuated in Bahia Kino, Guaymas, Navojoa, and √Ålamos. Major highways were impassable because of bridges that had washed out. The main highway in San Carlos was washed away due to flash floods. Marina Seca was badly damaged, with boats being washed out over the highway onto the beaches, where there was no water, telephone, or internet services for over 15 days. In all, the damages associated with Hurricane Jimena in Guaymas and San Carlos totaled over $37 million. More than 200,000 houses were destroyed or damaged so severely that people could not return to them for several months, mainly in the poorest areas. School was suspended for over two months in most areas. Hundreds of local stores were destroyed; over 2800 acres of farm land were severely damaged. Due to the damage caused by the hurricane, a state of emergency was declared in southern Sonora. Two people died near Guaymas during a car accident; two others were reported missing. According to a report by Mexico's Centro Nacional de Prevenci√≥n de Desastres, the magnitude of the event was analyzed to be a once in 2000 year occurrence. United States While the storm was weakening, a cold front lifted deep tropical moisture that triggered flash flooding and severe weather in the Mojave Desert. In San Diego County, California, a severe thunderstorm rolled through the area midday on September 5, breaking 19 pipelines and causing $100,000 in damage. Major flooding also occurred east of Barnwell on Ceader Canyon Road. South of Barnwell, hail and rainfall up to was reported. At the Nipton trading post, water and debris flowed on the roads. Flooding occurred on Interstate 15, forcing the local highway patrol to escort cars on to the highway while part of U.S. Highway 95 was closed for 2 hours, and 17 minutes. Near the town of Ocotillo Wells, flash flooding was reported due to heavy rainfall, causing an additional $20,000 in damage. Strong winds associated with the thunderstorms downed power lines and resulted in dust storms across the Imperial Valley, some of which reduced visibility by up to 25%. In Valle Vista, Arizona, water, rock, and other debris covered many roads. In addition, several power lines were down at the Bullhead City Airport. Northwest of Golden Valley, severe thunderstorms produced golf ball sized hail, roughly in diameter, that broke windows. In Riviera, seven mobile homes were blown over by winds up to , resulting in four injuries. North of Mohave Valley, mudslides destroyed two homes and damaged twenty-five others, resulting in roughly $600,000 in losses. Heavy Rain near Sedona caused flooding along Highway 179. In Quartzsite, Arizona, washes overflowed their banks, flooding nearby areas. In Tanca, about of rain fell in 30 minutes, resulting in flash flooding that washed out a road and damaged a business. Aftermath Shortly after the hurricane made landfall, Mexico's natural disaster fund provided $1.45 million in aid to repair pipelines, highways, and buildings. The United Methodist Committee on Relief distributed food baskets to 720 survivors and provided 180 families with wood for rebuilding their homes. In addition, the Civil Protection Agency in Baja California, the Baja bush Pilots, and the Mexican Red Cross asked for donations of such as utensils, flashlights, lanterns, batteries, clothing, and light bedding. Following the hurricane, a riot in Santa Rosal√≠a broke out due to lack of water. There was also a lack for shelter, as such this left many people sleeping in their cars. Within a week, the Mexican government assessed the damage form the hurricane, with 15 of them begin sent to Santa Rosal√≠a and shortly thereafter, the Mexican Red Cross sent out relief efforts to the devastated area, especially in Santa Rosal√≠a3. A total of 4,460 food kits were sent, 1,152 hygiene kits, 765 cleaning kits, 225 children's kits, and 181 kitchen kits.

The fighting saw Australian infantry from 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) attack a heavily fortified communist base camp in Long Khanh Province, while Centurion tanks providing close support crushed many bunkers and their occupants. Regardless, the VC fought hard to delay the Australian advance and although the bunker system was subsequently captured, along with a second system further south, the Australians suffered a number of casualties and the loss of a UH-1 Iroquois helicopter. With the Australians unable to concentrate sufficient combat power to achieve a decisive result, the bulk of the VC/PAVN force successfully withdrew intact, although they probably sustained heavy casualties in the process. Background As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, 8 RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty in December 1970. 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. The Australian area of operations (AO) remained the same however, with the reduction in forces only adding further to the burden on the remaining battalions. Regardless, following a sustained effort by 1 ATF in Phuoc Tuy Province between September 1969 and April 1970, the bulk of PAVN/VC forces had become inactive and had left the province to recuperate. Accordingly, the Australians shifted focus, turning their attention to denying the VC the chance to resupply by close ambushing around villages and towns, such as Dat Do and Hoa Long. Although not always successful, such operations yielded significant results and by the end of 1970 the Army of the Republic of Vietnam were increasingly responsible for the security of major population centres. Indeed, the major battles of earlier years were now seen as a thing of the past in Phuoc Tuy. However, in May 1971, following a request from Brigadier Bruce McDonald‚Äîthe task force commander‚Äîthe Australian AO was extended a further north across the border into Long Khanh Province. Several reconnaissance patrols from the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) were subsequently inserted in the vicinity of the Courtenay rubber plantation, and later on the other side of Route 2. These patrols were highly successful, detecting the presence of a substantial PAVN/VC force, while a number of VC were also killed. Prelude Intelligence reports in June, in conjunction with the invaluable information gathered by the SASR, located the VC D445 Battalion and the PAVN 3/33 Regiment east of Route 2 along the border between Phuoc Tuy and Long Khanh in an area north of the Australian base at Nui Dat. These reports indicated that the PAVN/VC were attempting to disrupt the continuing pacification program, and were also using the area to rest, retrain and refit. In response the 1 ATF commander, McDonald, launched a brigade-sized 'search and clear' operation, known as Operation Overlord. Named after the D-Day landings during the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944, the operation was scheduled to begin on the same day, 27 years later. Notably, there was some trepidation among the Australian sub-unit commanders with the use of this name for operational security reasons, as it was felt that it might telegraph their intentions. The concept of operations called for a significant blocking force to be inserted, with 4 RAR/NZ (ANZAC) deployed along the line of Suoi Ran river, A Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment to their west and United States Army 2/8th Battalion, 3rd Cavalry Regiment to the north-east. Meanwhile, 3 RAR‚Äîunder the command of Lieutenant Colonel Peter Scott‚Äîand the Centurion tanks from C Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment were tasked with driving the PAVN/VC into these positions. A number of fire support bases would be established, with A Field Battery and 104 Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery providing indirect fire support in conjunction with American gunners, while 3 RAR would search its AO‚Äîbelatedly designated as AO Gwenda‚Äîwith three rifle companies (A,B, and C), while D Company would be held in reserve. The plan envisioned movement by road of both troops and equipment using Route 2, as well as air insertion. The terrain in the new AO was thickly wooded with some areas of secondary growth beneath the high canopy, as well as numerous water courses, spurs and re-entrants. Battle The operation commenced on 5 June with the insertion of blocking forces consisting of Australian, New Zealand and US troops, followed by the aerial insertion of 3 RAR. The Landing Zone (LZ) was clear of large trees to about and was secured by the M113 Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) from A Squadron. As A Company landed it was suddenly engaged by intense fire, which also targeted the unsecured B Company LZ to the south-west. The firing eased after a few minutes however, thereby allowing the insertion of the remaining companies. The Australians subsequently began patrolling and it soon became apparent that they had been dropped within of an extensive bunker system. Signs of a strong PAVN/VC presence were detected almost as soon as 3 RAR began its sweep, while the blocking elements also had a number of sightings, and a few contacts with small parties moving north. Possibly alerted by allied air and road movements, the PAVN/VC seemed to be avoiding open combat. Late on the afternoon of 6 June 5 Platoon, B Company located what was thought to be the main PAVN/VC position, however with nightfall approaching, it was decided not to press the attack that night. During the evening a few shots were exchanged between the Australians and VC, and the Australian platoon subsequently withdrew into a night harbour. At 06:00 artillery commenced bombarding the position, and following a half-hour of preparation, 5 Platoon resumed its advance expecting the PAVN/VC to have vacated the position during the night, as they had done numerous times in the past. However, after having proceeded only the Australians came under heavy fire from the front and both flanks, suffering several casualties in the initial volleys. It soon became apparent that the platoon was pinned down on the edge of a strongly defended and well-concealed bunker system, with the platoon commander calling for assistance from helicopter gunships, as well as indirect mortar fire rather than risking further casualties by withdrawing. Moving to support the platoon in contact, Scott ordered D Company to conduct an assault against the flank and rear of the bunker complex, mounted in APCs with tanks in support. Two troops of Centurions spearheaded the assault through the jungle from the north, and they soon began receiving heavy small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades, one of which subsequently suffered external damage. Realising that the bunker system was larger than previously estimated, the tanks were forced to halt while the infantry were brought up to begin the assault. Meanwhile, 5 Platoon was in dire straits and was beginning to run low of ammunition, while a number of its M60 machine-guns were also beginning to fail because of the prolonged firing. Moving to outflank the heavily outnumbered Australians, VC were observed emerging from their bunkers. Indeed, only heavy indirect fire and effective suppressing fire from helicopter gunships prevented them from being overrun. Attempting to gain a better position to direct the fire, the B Company Forward Observer, Lieutenant Ian Mathers, moved forward to 5 Platoon and was killed almost immediately. However, by 09:15 the remainder of B Company was able to link up with the beleaguered platoon, and after an aerial resupply of ammunition, stabilised the situation temporarily. At 11:00, however, a second attempt to resupply B Company resulted in an Australian Iroquois helicopter being shot down by heavy ground fire and exploding on impact. Two crew members were killed and another two injured, while another soldier was injured on the ground. With ammunition exploding among the burning wreckage a number of Australians rushed to aid the injured, scrambling through the debris and removing the unexploded ammunition and pulling the survivors to safety. Subsequently, another winch point was established to the rear of the Australian positions for casualty evacuation and resupply. By mid-afternoon, D Company had finally moved into position and commenced an assault, pushing through the bunker system from the north-east with the Centurion tanks in close support crushing many bunkers and their occupants with their tracks. The progress of the Australian assault was slowed by thick vegetation and the size of the position, even as the resistance slackened and volume of fire diminished. Indeed, the bunker system was later found to cover nearly a square kilometre and was wider than the front of the assaulting company. Painstakingly the Australians searched each bunker systematically. With the action now over, D Company and the tanks subsequently linked up with B Company and established a night defensive position. During the final assault, C Company, located to the south, had uncovered a second bunker system which was subsequently captured by the Australians after being hastily abandoned. More than 16,000 rounds of M60 ammunition had been fired during the fighting, along with 6,000 rounds of M16 ammunition. The artillery had fired over 1,453 rounds of 105 mm and 200 rounds of 155 mm high explosive in support. Over the next six days Australian pioneer and engineer demolition teams proceeded to destroy the remaining bunkers. Aftermath Despite significantly underestimating the size of the position they faced, the Australians had succeeded in the pushing the D445 Battalion and the 3/33 Regiment out of a valuable base area intended for long-term use. Regardless, there were few other tangible results to show for the casualties they had incurred as, although numerous blood trails and body parts scattered around the battlefield indicated that PAVN/VC casualties had been heavy, the majority of their dead had either been removed from the battlefield or were entombed in the bunkers that had been crushed by the Australian tanks. The battle had cost the Australians three killed and six wounded, while only five VC bodies were recovered. The PAVN/VC had defended strongly in order to allow an orderly evacuation of personnel and stores, and with the Australians unable to concentrate sufficient combat power rapidly enough to ensure a decisive result, they were largely able to achieve this objective. Unfazed by the loss of their base-camps, the bulk of the PAVN/VC force remained intact and later carried out a highly successful ambush by VC 274th Main Force Regiment on 12 June. Seven Australians were killed and three wounded from the HQ 1 ATF Defence and Employment Platoon in this subsequent action, with the bulk of the casualties occurring when an RPG-7 exploded on a box of M18A1 Claymores sitting atop an M113 armored personnel carrier, igniting them with catastrophic consequences. Operations in Long Khanh continued however, and the Australians established a number of ambushes on possible withdrawal routes, although little contact subsequently occurred. Operation Overlord finally ended on 14 June and 1 ATF returned to Nui Dat. Overall, despite the heavy contact experienced early on, it had yielded little for the Australians although neither the D445 nor the 33rd Regiment were encountered in Phuoc Tuy again. Overlord was one of the larger task force operations of the war, while it was also the last joint US-Australian battalion-sized operation. Indeed, although the fighting continued, Australian operations began to wind down. On 18 August 1971, Prime Minister William McMahon announced that 1 ATF would cease operations in October, commencing a phased withdrawal. Ultimately, the last Australian forces were withdrawn from South Vietnam by 1973.

The show celebrates the anniversary of the founding of CMLL, originally known as Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre. This year is the 76th anniversary of CMLL, the oldest professional wrestling promotion. in the world. The anniversary show is CMLL's biggest show of the year, their Super Bowl event. The CMLL Anniversary Show series is the longest-running annual professional wrestling show, starting in 1934. The show featured six matches, with the main event being a Lucha de Apuestas, mask vs. hair match between M√≠stico and Negro Casas. The second featured event is an eight-man, or At√≥micos match featuring a team of Mexicans facing a team of Japanese wrestlers. Team Mexico consists of √öltimo Guerrero, Atlantis, Black Warrior and H√©ctor Garza. Shocker was originally scheduled to be part of the team but in the days leading up to the event, he was quietly replaced with Atlantis without announcing why. Team Japan consisted of Jushin Thunder Liger, who had traveled to Mexico for the match, No Limit (Yujiro and Naito), who had been in Mexico for several months to gain experience and finally CMLL regular Okumura. The event also featured three regular Six-man tag team matches, a six-man Mini-Estrella match, and a women's tag team match. Production Background Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue and location of the Anniversary Show The Mexican Lucha libre (professional wrestling) company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) started out under the name Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (\\"Mexican Wrestling Company\\"; EMLL), founded by Salvador Lutteroth in 1933. Lutteroth, inspired by professional wrestling shows he had attended in Texas, decided to become a wrestling promoter and held his first show on September 21, 1933, marking what would be the beginning of organized professional wrestling in Mexico. Lutteroth would later become known as \\"the father of Lucha Libre\\" . A year later EMLL held the EMLL 1st Anniversary Show, starting the annual tradition of the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows that have been held each year ever since, most commonly in September. Over the years the anniversary show would become the biggest show of the year for CMLL, akin to the Super Bowl for the National Football League (NFL) or WWE's WrestleMania event. The first anniversary show was held in Arena Modelo, which Lutteroth had bought after starting EMLL. In 1942‚Äì43 Lutteroth financed the construction of Arena Coliseo, which opened in April 1943. The EMLL 10th Anniversary Show was the first of the anniversary shows to be held in Arena Coliseo. In 1956 Lutteroth had Arena M√©xico built in the location of the original Arena Modelo, making Arena M√©xico the main venue of EMLL from that point on. Starting with the EMLL 23rd Anniversary Show, all anniversary shows except for the EMLL 46th Anniversary Show have been held in the arena that would become known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". On occasion EMLL held more than one show labelled as their \\"Anniversary\\" show, such as two 33rd Anniversary Shows in 1966. Over time the anniversary show series became the oldest, longest-running annual professional wrestling show. In comparison, WWE's WrestleMania is only the fourth oldest still promoted show (CMLL's Arena Coliseo Anniversary Show and Arena M√©xico anniversary shows being second and third). EMLL was supposed to hold the EMLL 52nd Anniversary Show on September 20, 1985 but Mexico City was hit by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. EMLL canceled the event both because of the general devastation but also over fears that Arena M√©xico might not be structurally sound after the earthquake. When Jim Crockett Promotions was bought by Ted Turner in 1988 EMLL became the oldest still active promotion in the world. In 1991 EMLL was rebranded as \\"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\\" and thus held the CMLL 59th Anniversary Show, the first under the new name, on September 18, 1992. Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, replacing their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. Storylines The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The peineta was once made of tortoise shell, but is now usually made of synthetic materials such as acrylic or plastic. The origin of the peineta goes back to the 19th century in Spain, but there is evidence of its use on the Iberian Peninsula as early as the 5th century BC and in other areas from the 17th century. It is used today primarily during special occasions such as weddings, bullfights, Holy Week processions, and traditional performances of flamenco music. The peineta is usually worn with a mantilla, a veil worn over the head and shoulders. The mantilla is also a common element of some Valencian and Andalusian costumes.

LSM(R)-194 was laid down at the Charleston Navy Yard, Charleston, South Carolina on 21 November 1944. The ship was under the command of Lt.jg Allen M. Hirshberg, USNR. It sank on 4 May 1945 when it was hit by Japanese suicide plane while on radar picket duty.  Service history During World War II, the ship was assigned to the Asiatic Pacific theater. At that time, the fleet was under the command of Admiral Spruance and named the Fifth Fleet. Vice Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner was Commander of Amphibious Forces Pacific and was to be in charge of operations until the beachhead was established. At 1840 on 26 March 1945, struck a floating mine which exploded her two forward 5\\"/38 magazines and her forward boiler. There was a tremendous explosion which sent a column of smoke and flame several hundred yards into the air. As soon as the smoke cleared we saw that the destroyer was still afloat. She circled erratically and moved forward at a slow rate. We immediately sounded general quarters and broke out fire hoses. The order left full rudder was given and we proceeded at full speed to her assistance. Two or three survivors were noted in the water about one half-mile off our starboard and LSM(R)-195 was directed to pick them up. Upon arriving at the scene we saw that her hull forward of the first stack (including the bridge structure) had been blown away. We tied up alongside her starboard side and played hoses on the few flames forward. Our Pharmacist's Mate directed the evacuation of the injured. Many dead bodies were noticed on deck. The surviving Radar Gear was apparently jettisoned. One of the 3 PCs tied up alongside the destroyer's port side and began evacuating survivors. Our ship took aboard seventy-two men, two of whom were seriously wounded. The PC evacuated approximately the same number, and LSMR-195 picked up two men from the water. The Kerama Retto islands were a small chain of islands 15 miles west of the southwest tip of Okinawa. The invasion of the Kerma Retto was an opportunity to break in all twelve of the 188-class LSM(R)s. One of the reasons that Admiral Turner wanted to capture Kerama Retto was his knowledge that the Japanese Sea Raiding Units had suicide boats hidden there. On the morning of 29 March three of these boats, called kaiten, attacked the USS LSM(R)-189 but were promptly destroyed. The northern half of the six-mile-wide invasion beach was assigned to Task Force 53, under the command of Rear Admiral Lawrence F. Reifsnider. The northern support craft included LSM(R)194, , , , , and . At 1715, 5 April 1945, LSM(R)-194 received 20mm shell holes from an enemy suicide plane as it passed forward of the conning tower. One officer was wounded slightly by a small piece of shrapnel. While on screening patrol off Hagushi Landing Beaches, LSM(R)-197 destroyed OSCAR by 40mm gunfire. LSM(R)-194 while patrolling at radar picket station 10 on 18 April 1945, fired at a Betty with 5\\"/38\\" and observed the plane going down in flames. On 3 May 1945, the 188-class LSM(R)s was put to the test. The Japanese launched their fifth kikusui attack on 3 May. Picket station 10 was the hardest hit. LSM(R)-194 was hit by a kamikaze and soon sank. For her overall performance of duty on the radar picket line the ship was awarded a Navy Unit Commendation.  Okinawa Radar Picket Line The American plan for defense against the kamikazes was to have fighters intercept the Japanese as early as possible. Sixteen radar picket stations were established around the island, in some cases almost 100 miles out, to give early warning of the Japanese planes which might be coming from any direction. Each station was manned around the clock by a handful of ships ranging from destroyers down to minesweepers. Their job was to sound the alarm and vector fighters to intercept before the Japanese could attack the fleet anchored off Okinawa and the Allied forces and supply dumps ashore. Unfortunately, some of the eager- to-die Japanese wanted to attack the first American ships they saw: the pickets. Dennis L. Francis LSM Commander, Flotilla Nine for the period 2 ‚Äì 20 April, Action Report indicated that these ships are not particularly suited for picket duty. Since their primary function is to deliver rockets during invasion operations, it seems feasible that subjecting them to continual enemy air attack will allow this secondary duty to seriously effect their ability to perform their primary function due to damage. They have no great value in combating enemy air craft due to the absence of air search radar, adequate director control for the 5\\"/38 main battery, and director control for the 40mm single guns. The fact that they carry a considerable quantity of explosive rockets in their magazines presents another hazard. In general, it is believed that assigning them to picket duty should be avoided since it means risking the operation of a limited number of specialized ships which could be performed by any number of other landing craft whose primary function is more closely coincident with screening operations. Before these recommendations were implemented, the USS LSMR-195 was sunk on 3 May 1945 with 9 killed and 16 wounded, the USS LSMR-190 was sunk on 4 May 1945 with 13 killed and 18 wounded, and the USS LSMR-194 was sunk on 4 May 1945 with 13 killed and 23 wounded. Casualties American casualties at Okinawa were the highest of any campaign against the Japanese. Total casualties were 49,151, of which 12,520 were killed or missing and 36,631 were wounded. Of this number the Navy casualties were 4,907 killed or missing and 4,824 wounded. The ship losses were 36 sunk and 368 damaged, with many of the damaged ships never being returned to combat readiness. Approximately 110,000 Japanese were killed.

Objectives The main objective of SRE-2 was to realise a fully recoverable capsule and provide a platform to conduct microgravity experiments on Microbiology, Agriculture, Powder Metallurgy etc. Design SRE-2 capsule would have four major pieces of hardware: * Aero Thermo Structure (ATS) * Spacecraft platform * Deceleration and flotation system * Microgravity payloads New systems developed for SRE-2 included Carbon-Carbon Nosecone, Indigenous Beacons, etc. Payloads The SRE-2 was to carry three experiments devoted to biological science and an improved isothermal furnace with 1000 ¬∞C temperature to carry out materials science experiments. * The first experiment ‚ÄúBiological effects of Microgravity: A genomic and proteomics approach‚Äù is being developed in collaboration with CCMB, Hyderabad and a biorack is being developed to enable this experiment. In this experiment, a colony of E. coli bacteria will be grown in microgravity condition and brought back to earth to carry out genomic and proteomic studies. Comparison of these with that obtained during bench mark ground experiments will enable us to identify the genes whose expression is affected by the microgravity. This experiment is designed to explore why microgravity alters some of the growth behaviour of the biological system. * A second experiment will carry a joint biological payload between JAXA, and Indian Scientists at ISRO and CCMB. The payload is being developed by JAXA with close interaction with ISRO engineers. The experiment will carry cynobacteria which will be cultured under microgravity condition. The aim is to study the effect of microgravity on the photosynthetic ability of these bacteria. * The third experiment will carry seeds of rice and medicinal plants that will be exposed both to microgravity and space radiation. A dosimeter will measure the amount of radiation. The exposed seeds will be planted on return and the growth of these plants will be compared with the plants of the unexposed seeds to evaluate the effect of microgravity and space radiation. The materials science experiments will be carried out in the modified isothermal furnace. The main experiment by scientists at IIT Kanpur, is designed to study the effect of gravity on the liquid phase sintering behaviour of the powders. A model copper tin alloy will be studied to explore the basic nature of the sintering process which has important implication in powder metallurgy.

He considered this essence to be an incorporeal, eternal occupant of our being. Plato said that even after death, the soul exists and is able to think. He believed that as bodies die, the soul is continually reborn (metempsychosis) in subsequent bodies. The Platonic soul consists of three parts which are located in different regions of the body:Long, A. A. Psychological Ideas in Antiquity. In: Dictionary of the History of Ideas. 1973-74 [2003]. link. # the logos (ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ), or logistikon, located in the head, is related to reason and regulates the other parts. # the thymos (Œ∏œÖŒºŒøŒµŒπŒ¥Œ≠œÇ), or thumetikon, located near the chest region and is related to anger. # the eros (·ºêœÄŒπŒ∏œÖŒºŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ), or epithumetikon, located in the stomach and is related to one's desires. In his treatise the Republic, and also with the chariot allegory in Phaedrus, Plato asserted that the three parts of the psyche also correspond to the three classes of a society.\\"Plato's Ethics and Politics in The Republic\\" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ‚Äì Retrieved August 29, 2009 Whether in a city or an individual, Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœÉœçŒΩŒ∑ (dikaiosyne, justice) is declared to be the state of the whole in which each part fulfills its function, while temperance is the state of the whole where each part does not attempt to interfere in the functions of the others.Plato Republic IV (433a) The function of the epithymetikon is to produce and seek pleasure. The function of the logistikon is to gently rule through the love of learning. The function of the thymoeides is to obey the directions of the logistikon while ferociously defending the whole from external invasion and internal disorder. Whether in a city or an individual, ·ºÄŒ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒØŒ± (adikia, injustice) is the contrary state of the whole, often taking the specific form in which the spirited listens instead to the appetitive, while they together either ignore the logical entirely or employ it in their pursuits of pleasure. In the Republic In Book IV of the Republic, Socrates and his interlocutors (Glaucon and Adeimantus) are attempting to answer whether the soul is one or made of parts. Socrates states that, \\"It is clear that the same thing will never do or undergo opposite things in the same part of it and towards the same thing at the same time; so if we find this happening, we shall know it was not one thing but more than one.\\"Republic IV: 436 b6‚ÄìC1 (W. H. D. Rouse translation) (This is an example of Plato's Principle of Non-Contradiction.) For instance, it seems that, given each person has only one soul, it should be impossible for a person to simultaneously desire something yet also at that very moment be averse to the same thing, as when one is tempted to commit a crime but also averse to it. Both Socrates and Glaucon agree that it should not be possible for the soul to at the same time both be in one state and its opposite. From this it follows that there must be at least two aspects to soul.Plato‚Äôs Psychology of Action and the Origin of Agency; \\"Ancient Theories of Soul\\" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Reason (ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ) The logical or logistikon (from logos) is the thinking part of the soul which loves the truth and seeks to learn it. Plato originally identifies the soul dominated by this part with the Athenian temperament.Republic IV 435 e8‚Äì9 Plato makes the point that the logistikon would be the smallest part of the soul (as the rulers would be the smallest population within the Republic), but that, nevertheless, a soul can be declared just only if all three parts agree that the logistikon should rule.Republic IV 442 a Spirit (Œ∏œÖŒºŒøŒµŒπŒ¥Œ≠œÇ) According to Plato, the spirited or thymoeides (from thymos) is the part of the soul by which we are angry or get into a temper.Republic IV 439 e3‚Äì4 He also calls this part 'high spirit' and initially identifies the soul dominated by this part with the Thracians, Scythians and the people of 'northern regions.'Republic IV 435 e4‚Äì8 Appetite (·ºêœÄŒπŒ∏œÖŒºŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ) The appetite or epithymetikon (from epithymia, translated to Latin as concupiscentia or desiderium)Dixon, T. 2003.

Reincarnation Plato combined the conception of the soul of Socrates and Pythagoras, mixing the divine privileges of men with the path of reincarnations between different animal species. He believed the human prize for the virtuous or the punishment for the guilty weren't placed in different parts of the underworld, but directly on Earth. A guilty soul should be disembodied and embodied in a woman or in animal species, listed at lower levels of the natural scale. Gods created women after men just to be the temple of degradated souls and this was for quadrupeds, snakes and fishes.

Beginning in the 19th-century, the municipal identity of Leesville was founded upon being one of the first Justice of the Peace Precincts of its original county-area, as prescribed in the Texas Constitution; as well as once generally serving as the primary seat of a former Texas House District 90, once rated at more than 1,000 constituents. Straddling and nearing the southeastern border of Guadalupe County, the real estate origins of Leesville go back to the 1800s survey-plots of Texas Revolution figures Ezekiel Wimberly CullenEzekiel Wimberly Cullen (1814-1882) (late owner of Sandies Creek) and Count Joseph de la Baume of France (late owner of Capote Hills); the latter retaining Texas's founding father Stephen F. Austin as an attorney, to reacquire the early-1800s Spanish land-tract, after Mexico's Independence from Spain in 1825. Divided by joining with Gonzales‚ÄîGuadalupe County Road 121 West, Leesville's northern territory is closest to the Austin Metropolitan Areas through , while the southern territory is closest to the San Antonio Metropolitan Areas through . In 1844, De la Baume's heirs sold out to Michael Erskine, a then-future Confederate Army commander of the Sandies Creek, Leesville area; the namesake of Leesville's founder \\"N. Guinn\\" serving under this \\"Sandies Home Guard\\" as a Third Lieutenant in 1861. Erskine held the land until 1882 when it was purchased by a group of speculative investors, including Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt. The lien on the property was held by the Scottish-American Mortgage Company, Ltd., financiers of the well-known Swan Land and Cattle Co. and Prairie Land and Cattle Co. The original 12-acre residential ranch- headquarters in the \\"Alameda\\" of Downtown San Antonio, formerly known as \\"La Baume Place\\" upon the St. Joseph Catholic Church, has since been relinquished and divested from the property. As the 19th-century concluded, its expatriate George W. Littlefield acted as a significant Texan architectural patron and proprietor of the Driskill Hotel, the Littlefield House and the Littlefield Building in Austin, Texas; he relocated to what is now Downtown Austin after three of his family members died in a gunfight in 1880s Leesville. During the Spanish-American War, Theodore Roosevelt rode a Capote, Leesville area horse, \\"Seguin\\", at the Battle of San Juan Hill (1898). Several other horses from the area were used by the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry (\\"Roosevelt's Rough Riders\\") as well. Through the early 20th-century, rail transport and interurban rail were proposed and built intermittently, including a 1916 Houston‚ÄîSan Antonio electric railway concept and proposal, with Leesville as a main line station. Towards the late 20th-century, the ventures either remained undeveloped or developed then terminated with the rail easements sold to the Lower Colorado River Authority, as an overhead power line. At present, the primary industries of the Capote-Sandies, Leesville area are under the real estate holdings of vast Texas Wildlife Management Areas, and the primary Quien Sabe Ranch that raises Santa Gertrudis cattle of King Ranch Running W Bull descent. The most valuable asset in this area is a $149-million water facility and 40-mile pipeline, that can store and move up to 11.6 million gallons of water towards the Greater San Antonio areas.

Water Upon Sandies Creek, Leesville, the Schertz-Seguin Local Government Corporation transports water from the local Carrizo Aquifer utilizing a 40-mile pipeline. This project was arranged in 2012 at a reported cost of $149-million. In 2014, this facility was permitted to pump 19,363 acre-feet of water per year, with a then-present utilization of 10,000 acre-feet. Over 60,000 households can be sustained through this water supply. The location of the SSLGC water supply upon Leesville, between Gonzales and Guadalupe Counties, was a strategic choice to mitigate cost and provide long-term reliability of the water source for nearby cities. As of 2016, the system can store up to 11.6 million gallons of water. Fitch Ratings remarked on this water company's inability to directly assign liabilities to either the City of Schertz or Seguin. It has also remarked that COVID-19 has not affected the demand of water from the facility. As of 2020 through 2016, the facility makes over $9.2-million in revenue each year and serves additional cities such as Selma and Universal City.

One of the earliest forms of social establishment and organization in the Leesville area, or interchangeably Leesburg at the time, involved common-property of \\"the people of Leesburg\\" most-especially a single crowbar; quoted as being shared contiguously by the community from 1863 until as late as 1883, when it was thought to have been used in a local theft of the Peebles & Brown store. Name Ezekiel Wimberly Cullen, an original owner of Leesville The first settlement and commerce of the area began around Sandies Creek, said to be once landmarked by a giant granite stone; leading to the Leesville area once being referred to as Sandies. From the 1830s until the 1870s, significant amounts of social activity climaxed around this area; with theft of watermelon, corn and food occurring at a nearby property. The nearby proprietor destroyed the granite landmark in response, ending the original rapid growth of the area....early settlers used to gather by Sandies Creek around a huge granite stone. From the 1830s until 1870, it was a spot for revivals, picnics and general get-togethers...The landowner of the property adjacent to this granite gathering became quite annoyed...They would raid his fields for watermelon, corn and other food. So, in 1870, he blew up the piece of granite. The general area was then named Capote, named after its hills. In the late 1800s, local land developer Newburn H. Guinn attempted to name the town Leesburg after his daughter Lee. The local post office at the time refused to recognize the name, as another Texas town had already claimed the name Leesburg. It was then compromised that the city would be named Leesville....Sometime between 1868 and 1887, Mr. Newburn H. Guinn divided land on the west bank of the creek into town lots and sold them to various businesses. In about 1870, Guinn decided to name the town Leesburg, after his daughter, Lee. When the town applied for a post office however, they had to do so under the original name of Capote -- there was already a Leesburg in Texas at the time. The post office opened in 1873. Finally, in 1874, the town became known as Leesville... The greater federal government recognized Leesville, Texas as early as 1885, in patents ‚Äú315,236‚Äù and ‚Äú325,154;‚Äù the former being an ‚ÄúIndicator for Merchandise‚Äù and the latter being a ‚ÄúMarking Device.‚Äù In the 1800s, a significant portion of Leesville's southern territory was owned by Ezekiel Wimberly Cullen, with Leesville alternatively and legally known as the Ezekiel W.

Industry Leesville School House with Historical Marker Original businesses and organizations since the area's settlement used to include, in greater capacity:...One of the first businesses began there in the 1860s when Sylvester A. Hubbard built an ox-powered treadmill to grind corn and saw lumber. In 1868, Daniel Brown and his brother opened the first general merchandise store to be located at old Capote. About the same time, a brick kiln along with a saddletree and stirrup factory began operations...the Leesburg (Leesville) Male and Female Institute on January 21, 1873...At one time the school system had an accredited high school.

Most of the company had rifles, some shot guns and some of them had six shooters. The recruits who did not have arms assured Erskine that they would be procured on reasonable terms as soon as possible. The names of those appearing on this muster are listed as follows.

The citizens are anxious to induce the road to come by Leesville and a nice bonus will be offered when building begins. In the same time period, engineers of the \\"Quanah, Seymour, Dublin and Rockport Railroad\\" completed a preliminary survey for the construction of a line through Leesville. In 1916, to \\"J. H. Berryman & Co.\\" served by its president Steve Holmes from Leesville; with vice- president and general manager W. A. Reinhardt from Houston: An \\"electric railway\\" contract was awarded to grade the first 60 miles out of Houston for the \\"Houston Richmond & Western Traction Co.\\" A line was proposed to reach San Antonio from Houston; stopping at Richmond, Garwood, Gonzales, Steve Holmes' home of Leesville, Willow Springs and New Berlin; totaling 190 miles of proposed track. The expected material cost was written as ‚Äú530,000 cross- ties,‚Äù equivalent to ‚Äú16,000,000 feet of lumber;‚Äù as well as ‚Äú32,000 poles.‚Äù This was considered a notable ‚Äúprospective order‚Äù for the lumber industry at the time. Events James W.

He was elected to a second-term, in the same Leesville district, from 1891. In 1903, the Southern Coal and Coke Company noted ‚Äúa vein of coal two feet thick‚Äù in Leesville, in the coal industry journal. In 1909, there were over a dozen cases of smallpox around Leesville, spanning over months with only one case of quarantine. Traveling African-Americans were reported to be disproportionately affected.Houston Post Special...LEESVILLE, Texas, January 22 (1909)...Three miles north of this place a dozen or more cases of smallpox exist. It has prevailed almost continuously in some part of this county for many months and only one case (that in the town of Gonzales) has been quarantined. If quarantine is not immediately established there soon may be a hundred cases, as it is among (African-Americans) and they are traveling night and day, some with it broken out on them. Littlefield-Martin George W. Littlefield, notable former resident of Leesville In 1880, two generations of Leesville families LittlefieldWILLIAM W. LITTLEFIELD has for practically half a century been actively identified with the farming and stock-raising interests of Gonzales County, his home being at Leesville, and he has also for a number of years been a prominent political figure in that section of the state. The Littlefield family has been one of prominence in Texas and elsewhere for a number of generations. The name is of Scotch origin, and Philip Littlefield, grandfather of the Leesville resident, was one of three brothers who left the old country and came to the United States about 1801... and Martin, received national attention after three Littlefield belligerents died in a revolver gunfight between the two families. It was postulated that the family feud would continue....A triple tragedy lately took place at Leesville, Texas. Three leading citizens and brothers, Houston, William and Phipps Littlefield, while working on a road, met Orvie, James, and Edward Martin. Houston Littlefield had had a previous difficulty with the party, and separated without settling it. Meeting again, they renewed the quarrel. Houston Littlefield drew his pistol on Orvie Martin, who was unarmed. James Martin, seeing his brother in danger, ran up and struck Houston Littlefield with a hoe, felling him to the ground. At that Phipps Littlefield drew his revolver and shot James Martin, the ball hitting him on the head. By this time all hands had drawn revolvers, and a general fire began. Ed. Martin was wounded in the hand, but not before he had shot and instantly killed Houston and William Littlefield. The two Littlefields lay dead, while their brother, mortally wounded-cast his dying gaze upon their ghastly bodies, reddened with gore. The Martins then left...Phipps Littlefield died a few hours after the fight. It is thought the Littlefield family connections will take up the fight and wreak vengeance on the Martins. The late George W. Littlefield was the grandson of one of the belligerents, through a son named Fleming Littlefield; in 1883, George Littlefield relocated to the state capital of Austin, Texas from South Texas. His Littlefield Building on Congress Avenue in downtown Austin now houses Capital One Bank. From 1895 to 1903, Littlefield owned the Driskill Hotel, located near the Littlefield Building. He installed the first electric lighting system in the hotel, which became a gathering place for Texas politicians during much of the 20th century. He willed his residence, the Littlefield House, to the University of Texas. El Capote Ranch Joseph de la Baume served as an officer to Marquis de Lafayette (above) in the American Revolution, before acquiring the local land tract of 6 leagues (27,000 acres) from Spain in 1806 Former location of the El Capote Ranch owner-headquarters, once known as \\"La Baume Place,\\" now an urban park across from San Antonio's St. Joseph Catholic Church and Rivercenter Roosevelt's 1898 horse, depicted above, is claimed to have been from the El Capote Ranch The founder of El Capote Ranch was Joseph de la Baume (1731-1834), a French army officer who came to North America with the Marquis de Lafayette and fought in the American Revolution. He later joined the Spanish Army and for his services received title in 1806 to 27,000 acres of Texas land in what is now Leesville - the original El Capote Ranch. \\"El Capote,\\" meaning \\"The Cape,\\" was probably derived from nearby hills of the same name. De la Baume's grant was reaffirmed after Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821. Virginia-born Michael Erskine (1794-1862) acquired the property in 1840. He raised cattle here and drove his herds to California and New Orleans. Since the San Antonio to Gonzales Road forded the Guadalupe River on El Capote land, many travelers passed this way. The Erskine family hosted several eminent visitors, including William Bollaert FRGS (1840), Ferdinand von Roemer (1845-1847), and Frederick Law Olmstead (1857). After the Erskine family sold the ranch in the 1870s, part of the land was deeded to Edith Kermit Carow, the second wife of Theodore Roosevelt. During the Spanish-American War, Roosevelt rode an El Capote horse, \\"Seguin\\", at the Battle of San Juan Hill (1898). Several other horses from El Capote were used by the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry (\\"Roosevelt's Rough Riders\\") as well. Its former cabin (now preserved in Lubbock), dating from the late 1830s or early 1840s, was probably built by \\"French\\" Smith, de la Baume's resident overseer. Its former building served as headquarters for ranching and farming operations until the 1880s and thereafter as tenant quarters, being occupied as late as 1920. It represents the earliest form of dwelling utilized on the Texas frontier. The ranch was acquired in 1897 by Judge Leroy Gilbert Denman (1855-1916), a Justice of the Texas Supreme Court, and is owned by his descendants; the cabin was donated to the Ranch Headquarters of the Museum of Texas Tech University by the heirs of Judge Denman. The property-at-large through its latter liquidation in the mid-1800s, was attached to De la Baume\`s 12-acre residence in the \\"Alameda\\" of Downtown San Antonio; formerly known as \\"La Baume Place\\" in \\"Cotton Wood Grove,\\" being a \\"double-stone house\\" located on East Commerce Street across from the St. Joseph Catholic Church, in what is now a city park. In common, the original will of the property-at-large was signed by the first Texan mayor of San Antonio, John W. Smith. In 1880, the editors of the San Antonio Express rated the remainder of the ‚ÄúCapote Farm‚Äù under its then-new proprietor Major Alexander Moore, as ‚Äúthe largest and most complete farm in Texas...if not in the south;‚Äù giving examples of the diversity of livestock and crops that were raised at the scale of 75 workers over 20,000 acres. The farm‚Äôs stock included 2,800 heads of cattle, 6,000 Berkshire pigs and various other segments of livestock and agriculture. Within the same time period, the lien on the property was held by the Scottish-American Mortgage Company, Ltd., financiers of the well-known Swan Land and Cattle Co. and Prairie Land and Cattle Co. Ecology Oaks trees (Quercus) and wildflowers, west of Leesville The Leesville-Belmont area has an annual average of 33.1 inches and 35.8 days of rainfall. The average day consists of 12.6 hours of light. Temperatures are high with very mild winters. Generally, described as a humid subtropical climate.MONTHLY - ALL WEATHER AVERAGESClimate Summary Subregion Description In 1851, William Bollaert FRGS of the Royal Geographical Society became lost in the Leesville area, generally describing it as ‚ÄúBig Hill prairies.‚Äù He found the soil to be ‚Äúrich looking‚Äù and ‚Äúblack, reposing upon recent sandstone, forming beautifully undulating lands.‚Äù Herds of mustangs, wild horses, wolves and forests of pecan trees were described. Near Guadalupe River, he found the land ‚Äúfit for all agricultural purposes, although the surface soil is sandy,‚Äù the sand upon masses of silicon containing selenite. He found chiltepin peppers to be ‚Äúmost abundant.‚Äù The main Capote Hill was described as a ‚Äúconspicuous object...isolated in the prairie‚Äù at ‚Äú350 feet above.‚Äù Within, he found disintegrated limestone, gypsum, oyster and other shells; compromising a great variety of former marine life. In 1852, Frederick Law Olmsted, then-future designer of New York City‚Äôs Central Park; noted the area‚Äôs principal species of trees as pecan, hickory, cypress, cotton wood, box elder, white oak and walnut. He described the bottom land's \\"rich, black clay soil\\" as difficult to cultivate yet \\"producing high yields\\" of agriculture. Earlier in 1830, Byrd Lockhart described the lands beyond the river as rolling prairie, with sandy hills which were removed far from the Guadalupe River. This \\"rolling\\" sandy soil was of lower quality and was found to be covered with post oaks and blackjack oaks. Dr. Ferdinand von Roemer, in 1846, described the area summarily: \\"...the road leading us in agreeable changes through fertile valleys or over low hills composed of gravel and sand. The country was more settled here, as we came upon farms every few miles.\\" Events Tropical Depression Eight of 1981, Rain Totals; Leesville indicated with Indigo (>15-inches of Rain) In 1848, over 12,000 bushels of corn were grown and sold in the Capote, Leesville area at 45 cents each; a record-size crop in Southeast Texas for facilities the size of El Capote Ranch, the record held for several years time. In 1903, implicitly due to heavy rains, cotton crops failed at a rate of one bale per thirty acres of land. In 1910, an agricultural report in The Houston Post on Leesville, Texas crop conditions indicates excessive dryness with most crops and pastures in a \\"burned\\" state; with cotton crops in a derelict state. Local farmers indicated cotton yields had lowered to one bale per 8 acres of land; approximately half of the year before. Corn yields improved year-on-year.HOUSTON DAILY POST...August 4, 1910...LEESVILLE Texas. August 3.-It Is exceedingly dry In this section and all crops and pastures arc about burned up. Half of the leaves and all squares and small bolls on the 'cotton have fallenoff. The opinion of farmers are that it will require eight acres to make a bale of cotton; that It Is the shortest cotton crop since 1904. Picking Is now pretty general and gins are now running every day. If this dry weather continues all will open this month and soon be gathered. Corn Is some better than last year but cotton about half. In 1912, Leesville cotton yields were rated as generally poor with corn yields excellent, despite a two-month drought. Hay crops reported satisfactory. The cotton shortfall was reported at a record low since 1904, one-third lower year-on-year.LEESVILLE COTTON POOR. Corn Is Excellent Despite Two Months Without Rain. Houston Post Special. LEESVILLE Texas August 26 (1912) There has been no rain In this section for over two months and only partial showers In county. Farmers have made fine corn and hay crops but cotton Is shortest since 1904. From Interviews with a great number of leading farmers we find they agree that cotton Is one-third shorter than last year. Very nearly all cotton is opened and being gathered very slowly on account of scarcity of cotton pickers. A large majority of Mexicans have left this country since the rebellion In Mexico. In 1918, the Dallas \\"Farm and Ranch\\" of March 23 reported that G. N. Linecum of Leesville raised 47 bales of cotton in the previous season, on 30 acres of black sandy land \\"in a drought stricken area of Texas.\\" The result was described to have been achieved through \\"irrigation from artesian wells and intensive cultivation.\\" In 1936, Leesville was once established with a number of grocery stores, barbershops, cotton production and a pharmacy; now said to be non-existent and depopulated due to flooding and displacement from a local creek, after 26 inches of sudden rain....On June 30, 1936, over 26 inches of rain devastated the town and the surrounding area. After the flood, many people moved out. Although some businesses were rebuilt a half mile west of the original site on Highway 80 -- the flood signaled an end to any future growth for the town...Leesville still exists, to some extend, and although it may not be the thriving place that it once was, before the great flood in 1936 -- the memories remain for those folks who were brought up there and the people who still call Leesville, home... Through the summer and fall of 1939, G. A. C. Haiff constructed a bass pond in the Leesville area; producing a 10-inch largemouth black bass in the spring of 1940, as noted by the American Fisheries Society. During Tropical Depression Eight of 1981, several dwellings in and around Leesville suffered water damage after the O'Neill Creek reached its highest level since at least 1936. Leesville experienced some part of the county's $5-million estimated damages, caused by the storm. Culture Leesville is a hub of the collection of historical remnants and cemeteries it houses, as well as its historical city center acting as an election precinct. Philosophy Texas Governor Thomas Mitchell Campbell dispatched a campaign surrogate to the Leesville Farmers' Union in 1906 In 1896, nominated for vice president by a Leesville delegate, Thomas E. Watson championed poor farmers as a leader of the Populist Party Michael Erskine, a founding settler of the area, described the values of its people summarily in 1845: \\"I move along here as well as I can‚Äîwork hard, live poor and am respected by the poor chaps. There are but few rich people in this part of the country. And no claims to be superior to another on account of his wealth.\\" Politics As late as 1906, Leesville farmers were majorly unionized under the Leesville Farmers' Union, a focus of Thomas Mitchell Campbell's 1906 Texas gubernational election During the William Jennings Bryan 1896 presidential campaign, Leesville resident William W. Littlefield (grandfather of George W. Littlefield) acted as a delegate from Texas for the Populist Party, nominating Thomas E. Watson as an alternative vice presidential candidate against the Democratic ticket's Arthur Sewall. According to The New York Times, during the 2016 United States presidential election, 82% of participating Leesville-Gonzales voters voted for Donald Trump and 16% voted for Hillary Clinton. In Leesville-Belmont-Luling, 79% voted for Trump and 18% voted for Clinton. In Leesville-Seguin, 75% voted for Trump and 21% voted for Clinton.

His African-American identity was not revealed until 1998. Notably, alone he had captured an armed bank robber at the Pacific Southwest Bank on LA's 7th Street. * Lance Corporal Billy Ray Baker USMC of Leesville, Texas received the Silver Star, as cited by the U.S. government: :\\"...on 24 April 1970, while the lead platoon of Company H prepared a night defensive position during a company-sized combat operation in Quang Nam Province, Lance Corporal Baker skillfully positioned his machine gun team in emplacements which could effectively cover possible avenues of enemy approach and, while he was thus engaged, the Marines came under a heavy volume of rocket-propelled grenade fire from a large North Vietnamese Army force. Reacting instantly, he fearlessly exposed himself to the hostile fire to pinpoint the hostile soldiers and direct the accurate suppressive fire of his men. :With a marked increase in the tempo of battle, the machine gun nearest him became low on ammunition and he instructed a nearby Marine to procure additional rounds. Observing that the man was repeatedly forced back into his emplacement by the intensity of the North Vietnamese Army fire, Lance Corporal Baker valiantly braved the enemy fusillade as he raced across the fire-swept terrain to the nearest supply point but, as he was rushing back to the machine gun with the vitally-needed supplies, he was extensively wounded. Struggling desperately, he used his last remaining strength to crawl another twenty-five meters, dragging the ammunition behind him, until he lapsed into unconsciousness...\\" Folklore In folklore, locals claim to see a ghost of a little girl in a blue dress, playing in Leesville Cemetery; seen only at a significant distance.The Leesville Cemetery Ghost...Many people have reported seeing a little girl in the Leesville cemetery, and they always see her from a distance.

Mytens was born in The Hague. According to Houbraken, Johannes (Jan) Mijtens was trained by Anthony van Opstal and later by Nicolas van der Horst. Both of his uncles, Isaac Mijtens and Dani√´l Mijtens, were painters, and his son Cornelis became an engraver.[ Johannes Mytens biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature This statement has often been repeated by various art historians, but unfortunately, Houbraken mixed up his notes on this artist with his notes on Jan Meyssens, the engraver. This Jan Mytens did not have a son Cornelis who was a good engraver. That was Jan Meyssens (and the Meyssens lived in Antwerp, not the Hague). Mytens became a member of The Hague Guild of Saint Luke in 1642 and helped set up the Confrerie Pictura.Johannes Mijtens in the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie He painted for Dutch royalty and specialized in portraiture, genre pieces, and historical allegories. Mytens was especially skilled at rendering the clothing of affluent Dutch. According to the RKD, his students were Nicolaes Lissant, Gerard de Nijst, Adriaen Stalpert van der Wiele, Pouwels van de Velde, Andries Thijsz. de Wit, and Urbanus Talibert van Yperen. He died in The Hague. In his 1652 painting of the family of Mr. Willem van den Kerckhoven, the youngest son Pellegrom (leaning against his father's leg) was added later in 1655 (he was not yet born in 1652).

It has a population of 652. History The name derives from the presence of the lake near the town of the same name (Lacus Pensilis), dried up at the beginning of the twentieth century. Lagopesole, between the eighth and tenth centuries, played a military role for the control of the ancient Via Herculea, linking Melfi and Potenza. Castel Lagopesole At the top of Lagopesole is located a castle, attributed to Frederick II that was probably built between 1242 and 1250. A distinguishing feature of this castle from all the others attributed to Frederick II is the presence within it of a real church (not a simple chapel) in an austere Romanesque style. Pope Innocent II and Abbot Rinaldo of Montecassino met there, in the presence of Emperor Lothair II of Saxony during the war against Roger the Norman. In 1268 and 1294, Charles I of Anjou stayed at the castle. In 1416, both this fortress and the Melfi castle were acquired by the Caracciolo family. In 1531, Emperor Charles V donated it to the Doria family.Associazione Promozione Basilicata. In the nineteenth century, the castle was the refuge of bandits, led by Carmine \\"Donatelli\\" Crocco, who during April 7, 1861, occupied it with another 400 brigands.

Construction and commissioning Kirwin was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS Kirwin (DE-229) on 14 February 1944 by the Philadelphia Navy Yard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was launched on 15 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Andrew J. Kirwin, the mother of the ships namesake, Lieutenant John J. Kirwin. The ship was reclassified as a Crosley-class high- speed transport and redesignated APD-90 on 17 July 1944. After conversion to her new role, she was commissioned on 4 November 1945 with Lieutenant Commander Lloyd G. Benson, USNR, in command.  First period in commission, 1945-1946  After shakedown in the Chesapeake Bay, Kirwin cleared Norfolk, Virginia, on 29 January 1946, and arrived at Green Cove Springs, Florida, on 31 January 1946. She was decommissioned there on 6 April 1946 and placed in reserve there on the St. Johns River in the Florida Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.  Second period in commission, 1965-1969  In the autumn of 1964, the high-speed transport USS Earle B. Hall (APD-107) suffered a major engineering casualty that caused her to lose all power, and she was deemed not worth repairing. Kirwin was chosen to replace her. Accordingly, on 30 November 1964, Kirwin arrived under tow at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek at Virginia Beach, Virginia, and was berthed alongside Earle B. Hall. There Kirwin underwent reactivation, with Earle B. Halls crew readying her for recommissioning. On 15 January 1965, after almost 19 years in reserve, Kirwin was recommissioned and Earle B. Hall was simultaneously decommissioned, with Earle B. Halls crew transferring to Kirwin. In February 1965, Kirwin moved to Newport News, Virginia, for overhaul. She got underway for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 6 July 1965 and spent the next five weeks on nuclear defense, antisubmarine warfare, and gunnery exercises. She visited San Juan, Puerto Rico, then returned to Little Creek, arriving there on 22 August 1965. On 29 November 1965, Kirwin departed for the Caribbean to join Task Force 184 for amphibious warfare and antisubmarine exercises. She returned to Little Creek on 16 December 1965. In 1966 Kirwin operated out of Little Creek on training exercises along the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean until heading for the Mediterranean on 15 August 1966. Arriving at Naval Station Rota at Rota, Spain, on 25 August 1966, she visited Italy, Malta, Greece, Tunisia, Spain, and Morocco before returning to Little Creek on 3 December 1966.

Background The set of 23 poems was first published by the famed publisher Jean-Jacques Pauvert, three years after the death of Vian in 1959 and at a time when his literary stock was rising on the heels of the publication of Romans et Nouvelles and the re-publication of L'√âcume des jours. The collection is named for the title of the first poem; the manuscript has no title. The poems, many of which deal with tragedy and death, were written in 1951-51, when Vian was undergoing marital, financial, and creative difficulties.No√´l Arnaud, \\"Introduction,\\" in They are often discussed as if they are autobiographical. In the edition edited by No√´l Arnaud (first published in 1972 and republished in 1989), the poems are followed by four letters (written between 1953 and 1959) to the College of 'Pataphysics, the Parisian philosophical group of artists and writers dedicated to the study of what lies beyond metaphysics. Also included are two brief texts by Vian on literature and the role of the writer. The influence of Je voudrais pas crever The book has proven inspirational for many French artists, especially singers. Serge Reggiani, one of the most influential French chansonniers of the 1960s, sang Boris Vian songs and also recorded Je voudrais pas crever.Released on Polydor Records, #2392010. In 2001, for instance, Lib√©ration published a full-length article on the French band Eiffel, whose leader, Romain Humeau, claims Vian's book was the inspiration for their 2000 album Abricotine. Je voudrais pas crever in 2009 In 2009, fifty years after Vian's death, a wave of books about him and his work as well as re-issues of his books (including no fewer than thirty- three Le Livre de Poche editions) proved that Vian is more popular than ever, as the French magazine Le Point stated; one of the new books is a reissue of Je voudrais pas crever, illustrated by Jacques de Loustal and others.

It remained in production for slightly under two years before being replaced by the Audi Front UW 225 featuring a larger 2.25-litre engine. The larger-engined car introduced in 1935 was built till April 1938 and continued to be listed into 1939. Between 1933 and 1938, the Front was the only Audi in volume production.Oswald, p 43 The engine installation At launch the Front UW 220 featured a straight-six-cylinder ohv engine of 1,950 cc. Claimed maximum power output was at 3,500 rpm. The two-litre engine was shared with the Auto Union group‚Äôs Wanderer W22 introduced at the same time. The letters \\"UW\\" in the car's name stood for \\"Umgekehrter Wanderer\\" and referred to the fact that it featured a Wanderer engine that had been \\"umgekehrt\\" (turned around) through 180 degrees in order to drive wheels which, on this application, were actually ahead of the engine. The car In common with many performance cars of the period, the Front UW 220 provided a claimed top speed of : presumably actual performance data would have varied according to the weight and wind-cheating qualities of each individual car body. Various body styles were offered, including four-door sports limousines and two-door cabriolets / roadsters. 1935 upgrade For the UW 225 produced from 1935, engine size was increased to 2,257 cc, and reported maximum power rose to or , respectively at 3,300 or 3,800 rpm: increased power was reflected by a modest increase in the claimed top speed to . The ohv engine came, again, from fellow Auto Union group member Wanderer, being shared with the Wanderer W245 and its successors. Despite the relative novelty of the front-wheel-drive configuration, the manufacturer quoted the car's turning circle as which was not greatly above the norm for cars of this size. The rear-wheel-drive Wanderer with which the Audi shared its engine featured an advertised turning circle of 12 meters. Manufacturing arrangements J√∏rgen Skafte Rasmussen who till 1932 owned and controlled the companies that comprised the Auto Union had acquired Audi in 1928, and as part of the deal had acquired their manufacturing plant at Zwickau. However, since 1931 the Audi Zwickau plant had been producing the DKW F1, replaced in 1932 with the DKW F2. The small front-wheel drive DKWs proved popular, and completely utilised the production capacity at what had hitherto been the Audi plant. The Audi Front was therefore assembled at the nearby plant of Horch, another automaker purchased by Rasmussen in 1928, and one which, after Rasmussen's bank enforced a restructuring in 1932, became another of the four Auto Union group companies.Oswald, pp 42 - 43 Commercial Approximately 4,500 Audi Fronts were produced, including 1,817 of the earlier UW 220 model built between April 1933 and November 1934. By 1938 2,591 of the successor UW 225 model had been produced. A rear wheel drive \\"successor\\" Production of the successor model, the Audi 920, began in November 1938. The Audi 920 was designed to be built and branded as a Horch, and the last minute decision to badge it instead as an Audi was led by marketing considerations. The 920 neatly slotted into the Auto Union range between the larger and more costly Horch models and the slightly smaller cheaper cars produced by Wanderer. Under these circumstances, the description of the rear wheel drive 920 as a replacement for the front wheel drive Audi Front UW 225 is not unchallenged.

Kirwin (1918‚Äì1943) was a United States Navy officer who received the Navy Cross posthumously for his actions in combat during World War II. Biography John Joseph Kirwin was born in Newport, Rhode Island, on 4 July 1918. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve on 11 December 1935. He was appointed midshipman on 11 August 1937, and commissioned as an ensign on 7 February 1941, reporting for duty aboard light cruiser USS Savannah (CL-42). During World War II, Kirwin was appointed Lieutenant, junior grade, on 16 June 1942, and saw action aboard Savannah in the Battle of the Atlantic and in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa. He was promoted to Lieutenant on 1 December 1942, and saw further combat aboard Savannah in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Savannah then supported Operation Avalanche, the Allied invasion of mainland Italy at Salerno. On 11 September 1943, while bombarding German shore defenses in Salerno Bay, Savannah was among cruisers which came under heavy German aerial attack. The cruisers and British Supermarine Spitfire fighters drove off nearly 60 German bombers before a Dornier Do 217K-2 bomber hit Savannah with a Fritz X radio- controlled, armor-piercing guided bomb. It pierced the armored roof of the No. 3 gun turret immediately in front of the ships bridge, passed through three decks into the lower shell-handling room, and exploded there, blowing a gaping hole in the ships bottom, and tearing open a seam in the ships port side. For 30 minutes, secondary explosions in the gun room hampered fire-fighting efforts. Kirwin was at his battle station as turret officer in No. 3 turret when the bomb struck. He remained behind in the turret to supervise the evacuation of as many men as possible, was overcome by heat and toxic smoke, and died at his station. Awards For his part in this action, Lieutenant Kirwin was awarded the Navy Cross with the following citation: > \\"For extraordinary heroism as a turret officer. . . . When the detonation of > an enemy bomb set off numerous fires and filled the turret with dense smoke > and toxic gases, Lt. Kirwin promptly ordered the area abandoned and despite > the imminent danger, stood by his station in the turret booth. With full > knowledge of the serious hazards involved and with complete disregard for > his own personal safety, he calmly supervised evacuation and deliberately > remained behind to aid in saving the lives of as many of his command as > possible ... he eventually succumbed in the stricken booth, gallantly > sacrificing his own life in order that his men might live.\\"Dictionary of > American Naval Fighting ships (at > http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/k4/kirwin.htm). Commemoration USS Kirwin (APD-90) The U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Kirwin (DE-229) was named for Lieutenant Kirwin. She was converted during construction into the high-speed transport USS Kirwin (APD-90), and was in commission from 1945 to 1946 and from 1965 to 1969.

Dr Henry Stephens (1796‚Äì1864) was the inventor in 1832 of an indelible \\"blue-black writing fluid\\" which was to become famous as Stephens' Ink and to form the foundation of a successful worldwide company for over 150 years. The family moved to Finchley, north London, in 1844 where Dr Stephens bought and renovated a large residence named Grove House, in Ballards Lane. The outbuildings of Grove House were used by the inventor as a laboratory for research and manufacture of ink and wood stains; thus Henry Charles grew up among his father's work and learnt the business from a young age. After an early education in France, the boy returned to England to attend University College School. He left school at the age of 16 but continued with chemistry and science studies (at the School of Mines, Kensington - now part of Imperial College London) while also involved in the family business. At the age of 23, in 1864, he took over the management of the company upon the sudden death of his father, who collapsed and died at Farringdon station. The year before (1863), he had married Margaret Agnes Mackereth, the daughter of an old medical-student friend of his father. They lived for a while in Grove House with Stephens' widowed mother, then in 1874 purchased nearby Avenue House in East End Road and ten acres of adjacent land, on a site formerly known as Temple Croft Field. Stephens enlarged and improved the house and in the 1870s sought advice about having the grounds developed, and employed landscape gardener Robert Marnock (1800‚Äì1889). Marnock's plans included lawns, ponds, mounds, paths and steps, and a walled kitchen garden and park-keeper's dwelling known as The Bothy (1882). Stephens added a water tower with adjacent building, a lodge, coach house and stable block and arranged for a number of rare trees to be planted throughout the grounds. In 1872 the ink factory and offices were moved from Aldersgate Street to 275 Holloway Road, Holloway; in 1892 the factory moved again to nearby Gillespie Road, close to Arsenal station. In January 1888 Stephens was admitted to the Freedom and Livery of the Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers. The Stephens' Ink company was innovative and profitable and Henry Stephens was a very wealthy man. Stephens was popular in Finchley as a businessman, lecturer and philanthropist and was known as \\"Inky\\" Stephens, the \\"uncrowned king of Finchley\\", as a result.BBC Radio 4 Making History Henry 'Inky' StephensThe Stephens Collection Aside from the family business and politics, he was a chemist, a local benefactor and philanthropist, and had an interest in agriculture and water management. He owned an estate in Cholderton, Wiltshire, where he set up the Cholderton and District Water Company in 1904.Cholderton Village Profile of the Parish Political life He was elected as MP for the Hornsey constituency, which included Finchley, at a by-election in 1887 (defeating the later-to-be- disgraced Horatio Bottomley) after the sitting Conservative MP was elevated to the peerage. He was re-elected in 1892, returned unopposed in 1895, and stood down from Parliament on a point of principle at the 1900 general election. Legacy In 1887 he proposed, and later partially financed, the establishment of a park in Finchley to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, and this was finally opened in 1902 as Victoria Park, Finchley's first public park. When Stephens died in 1918, he bequeathed Avenue House and its ten acres of grounds to 'the people of Finchley'. In his will he bequeathed Avenue House and its ten acres of gardens to 'the people of Finchley' held in trust by Finchley Urban District Council, subject to the condition that they be 'open for the use and enjoyment always of the people, subject to reasonable regulation'; the house and grounds, now known as Stephens House and Gardens, are now run by a local charitable trust for public benefit and as a memorial to Dr Stephens and his son.\\"http://www.stephenshouseandgardens.com\\" The estate, now with a new visitor centre and cafe, contains a small museum - The Stephens Collection - featuring the history of the Stephens family and the estate, the development of the Stephens ink company into a worldwide brand, and the history of writing materials generally.

It was published in 1891 CE.http://www.alislam.org/library/links/80-books.html Subject Having specified what he perceived as the diverse moral and religious corruption raging at the time and the prevalence of materialism, Ghulam Ahmad describes the efforts that the Christian missionaries were making to convert Muslims to their own faith and the various measures employed by them against Islam. He then states that he has been raised by God in order to counter these 'evils', to revive the religion and establish it in the hearts of people. Outlining his work, Ghulam Ahmad, in order for the reformation of mankind and to attract people towards ‚Äòthis Divine Dispensation‚Äô, has distributed its spheres of activities into five branches or departments which could be summarised as the following: *The writing and publication of books *The publication of posters and handbills in order to ‚Äòestablish the truth of the Islamic belief over other creeds.‚Äô *to cater for and offer spiritual assistance through speeches and discourse for visitors who ‚Äòseek after truth‚Äô. Those who visit for further understanding and thereby derive benefit from the ‚ÄòAssociation of the Righteous‚Äô. *The writing of letters to people in different parts of the world. *To organise those who are initiated into the field and the widening of the circle of devotees. After having discussed the logistical and financial aspects of his work, Ghulam Ahmad elaborates upon the sacrifices and zeal of the early Islamic community and of the companions of Muhammad. He appeals for assistance, stating that such fervour is needed in this age too and explains why it is essential for the Muslims to believe in him and assist him. At the close of the book Ghulam Ahmad has made an announcement to the effect that all those who would like to ask any questions or who have any objections against Islam, the Qur'an and the prophet Muhammad, or against himself (Ghulam Ahmad) or his claims or the work that he is doing, should write to him and seriously and sincerely ask for his answers. He states in this announcement that he will publish their questions or objections with his answers in a book form.

It emerged after the dotcom bubble when many investors abandoned the conventional private equity fund format in favour of angel investor clubs that allowed members to decide on whether to take part in a certain investment opportunity. The model itself isn't limited to venture financing and can be applied across a multitude of business sectors wherein investments are made on per-deal basis. Unlike the traditional private equity fund, the pledge fund allows investors to opt-in or opt-out of each investment opportunity the manager presents. The capital is contributed to a special purpose entity that purchases the shares. The fund may be organized within one SPV or establish separate SPVs for every portfolio investment. Execution of investors' right to opt-in and opt-out of deals makes pledge fund management, administration and documentation more complicated than of traditional private equity fund. Pledge fund model minimizes investing partners' capital risks but has certain drawbacks. For example, the extra time required to assess and screen investment opportunities and deal execution uncertainty may be disadvantageous in competitive acquisition process.

Early life The first son of coffee farmers in his native village of Guzang ‚Äì Batibo sub division, Fomunyoh attended Christian primary education institutions in Guzang, Ambo, and Eka-Bifang, then went on to the Cameroon Protestant College, Bali for secondary school studies, graduating in 1973. He later attended the Cameroon College of Arts, Science and Technology Bambili and obtained the General Certificate of Education Advanced levels in 1975, before proceeding to University of Yaound√©, Faculty of Law and Economics. Academia Fomunyoh holds a License en Droit from the University of Yaound√©, 1979; an LL.M. in International Law from Harvard Law School, 1989; and a Ph.D. in political science from Boston University, 1993. He also holds a professional certificate in Air Law from the Universit√© Paul C√©zanne Aix- Marseille III. Dr. Fomunyoh is an adjunct faculty at the African Center for Strategic Studies, and a former adjunct professor of African Politics & Government at Georgetown University. He is perfectly articulate in both French and English. Career Upon graduation from University of Yaound√©, he worked for the Water Corporation, Societ√© Nationale des Eaux du Cameroun (SNEC) and later for Cameroon Airlines both in the coastal city of Douala where he established and managed the Legal department for more than six years before departing Cameroon to pursue further studies at Harvard University. Shortly after graduating from Harvard, Fomunyoh served on internships with the Law Offices of the Bank of Boston (USA), and Standard Chartered Bank in Douala, Cameroon. In 1993, he joined the National Democratic Institute as senior program officer. Today, as senior associate and regional director at NDI, Fomunyoh has organized and advised international election observation missions, designed and supervised country specific democracy support programs in partnership with civic organizations, political parties and legislative bodies across Africa. In the course of his work, Fomunyoh interacts regularly with heads of state and government, cabinet ministers, elected officials, political and civic leaders. He recently designed and helped launch the African Statesmen Initiative a program aimed at facilitating political transitions in Africa by encouraging former democratic Heads of State to stay engaged in humanitarian issues, conflict mediation, public health and other key sectors of political economic and human development on the continent. As an authority on democratization in Africa, Fomunyoh is highly solicited by news organizations and makes frequent guest appearances on major mainstream media including Cable News Network, British Broadcasting Corporation, National Public Radio, Voice Of America, Radio France Internationale and Radio Deustche Welle. He provides interviews for print news organizations such as the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Washington Times, Le Monde and 'International Herald Tribune. In one of his multiple media outings, Fomunyoh considered colonial rule as \\"...a terrible moment in African history and for the world too...\\", but he also places culpability for Africa‚Äôs current problems on what he unambiguously terms \\"...bad governance and lack of visionary leadership...\\" VOA 5 June 2003 Fomunyoh upholds the supremacy of the constitution and strongly objects to distortions of the document to suit personal or sectional whims. He points to the Ghanaian example as schemata for budding democracies. Chris Fomunyoh recently remarked: > It is extremely important to frequently renew political leadership in every > country so new leaders can bring a fresh perspective to global trends and > developments, and help move their countries in ways that may differ from > previously long held typical and traditional approaches. Civic advocacy Through his life, work and pronouncements, Christopher Fomunyoh espouses respectful communication even amongst disagreeing parties ‚Äì the kind of dialogue that reaches for compromise by considering the views of all parties involved through ‚Äòyesable‚Äô proposals. Fomunyoh remembers putting this practice to use in the mid 1970s, as one of the executive and founding members of the UNESCO Club at the University of Yaound√©; and before that, in his activist days as a student leader and president of the Moghamo Students Association from 1975 to 1979. Fomunyoh‚Äôs Foundation Radio, in Bamenda Cameroon vigorously upholds the creed of ‚ÄòGiving Voice to the Voiceless‚Äô and strives to provide a platform for airing the concerns of the silent/impoverished majority and the establishment of the right contacts for obtaining much-needed skills for self-reliance. His family foundation TFF, partners with various traditional civic and administrative institutions within Cameroon to foster these goals. That has earned him encomiums among various Cameroonian constituencies such as: the Sawa Women of Bonendale, Douala in the Littoral region, some of whose cultural and development projects the Fomunyoh Foundation has supported; the Moghamo Women Empowerment Center in Batibo; and the chieftaincy in Dschang in the Western Region where Fomunyoh holds the honorific traditional title of ‚ÄòSuffo‚Äô. In the months leading to the 2004 presidential elections in Cameroon, Fomunyoh‚Äôs name was touted by various interest groups, parties and independent observers as a potential candidate for the race. A few years before the 2011 presidential contest, speculation is rife in the Cameroonian media of both French and English expression, the blogosphere and the Cameroonian Diaspora about the possibility of a Fomunyoh vs Biya Paul Biya show-down. While many Cameroonians ponder the possibility of holding credible, free and fair elections when the election administration body ‚Äì ELECAM ‚Äì is perceived as partisan, they also see 2011, as likely to be an epoch-making poll. Fomunyoh has not dropped a traceable hint about his immediate plans; yet a lot seems to be submerged in the unsaid. His more recent (early this year) comments to the media have been a blend of nostalgia for some aspects of the country of his teenage years and an unflappable optimism for better years ahead and the possibilities and potential for positive and meaningful change for Cameroon and Africa as a whole. Growing calls for Fomunyoh to jump into the political fray in Cameroon represent a variety of things to a variety of people: Cameroonian democrats need a boost to their advocacy efforts in favor of good and accountable governance given the government‚Äôs performance; while Cameroonians in the Diaspora would love to see someone at the helm of the state that could use his/her international stature to regain credibility for the country and its reputation on the world stage. Fomunyoh‚Äôs silence on the issue of his candidacy is yet to quell the speculation that seems to be growing by the day as 2011 year draws nearer, and as many Cameroonians take personal initiatives to reserve domain names, create Fomunyoh fan clubs and online discussion groups in an effort to persuade and pressure him to step forward and get into the presidential race.

At that time, he signed a publishing deal with the producer Joe Boyd. In 1993, folk-rock band The Levellers, who cite Burbridge's band as a major formative influence, covered one track, Dirty Davey, on their own eponymous recording, which briefly topped the UK album charts.\\"McDermott's Two Hours. That's who we've been most influenced by really. People always say to us Oh, you must be really influenced by The Pogues and The Waterboys, but in fact it's this band out of Brighton more than anything else.\\" Jeremy Cunningham of The Levellers, Q Magazine, February 1993.Berger, George. Dance Before the Storm, Virgin Books, 1998, pp. 33‚Äì35. The band have rarely performed together in recent years, but four ‚Äì uncommercial yet critically acclaimed ‚Äì albums of Burbridge's songs have been released since 2000. Burbridge recorded tracks at the Levellers' studio in Brighton, and other musicians augmented his work. The first three, World Turned Upside Down (2001), Claws And Wings (2003), and Disorder (2004) were released as McDermott's Two Hours vs Levellers recordings, while the last, Goodbye To The Madhouse (2007) appeared as a McDermott's Two Hours album.'Goodbye to the Madhouse' in Sean McGhee and Dave White (eds.), R2 Vol 2 No. 5 (Sep/October 2007)'Disorderly Conduct' in Sean McGhee and Dave White (eds.), R2 Vol 2 No 12 2012 saw the release of Gathered, an acoustic recording, with multi- instrumentalist Tim Cotterell, while the following year a McDermott's Two Hours digital compilation album, Anticlockwise, appeared. 2017 marked the release of a sequel to Gathered, entitled Resolved, the best received, critically speaking, of all the albums. Burbridge's songs have been covered by folk artists like Damien Barber and Mike Wilson on Under The Influence and Maggie Boyle. In 2008, he combined poetry-reading with music and effects by The Levellers' Jon Sevink, on a privately released album entitled All Kinds of Disorder, an elaboration on the themes in his book, and an original form of statement on life at the margins. In R2 Steve Caseman called it \\"an exemplary combination of poetry and music,\\"Steve Caseman, R2, Vol2 No12 while fRoots recorded how \\"human drama and frailty is read out with relish along with keen observations of behaviour that celebrates the outsider and encourages the closet revolutionary in us all\\".Simon Jones, fRoots, March 2008 Reception Reviews of his three books of poetry On Call, All Kinds Of Disorder, and The Unicycle Set praised the \\"richness and variety\\" and the \\"lyrical, personal voices\\".

Born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, she married Gaye's estranged father, minister Marvin Gay, Sr., after relocating to Washington, D.C., in her early twenties. She was the only other person present at the murder of her son committed by his father. Biography Early life Alberta was born Alberta Williams Cooper on New Year's Day, 1913, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. She had three sisters, Pearl, Tolie and Zeola, and a brother, Aster, but she would endure a troubled childhood while growing up in North Carolina: her father once shot at her mother during an argument. Although her mother survived, her father would later die in a psychiatric hospital. Alberta told David Ritz that she felt she really didn't have a father, and her family didn't put her in a school until she was eight years old. At 20 years of age, she had a child, a son named Michael, and as a result her mother sent her to live with a relative in Washington, D.C., where she met minister Reverend Marvin Gay in 1934 and after a year of dating, the couple married on July 2, 1935. The young couple first settled at an apartment located at 1617 First Street SW, only a few blocks from the Anacostia River. The First Street neighborhood was nicknamed \\"Simple City\\" owing to its being \\"half city, half country\\". Due to his belief he couldn't raise another man's child, Marvin Gay eventually sent Alberta's son Michael to live with Alberta's sister Pearl. Michael Cooper later learned as a teen that Alberta was his mother, according to Alberta's daughter, Jeanne. Allegedly, when Michael began living with his half-siblings, he told young Marvin to stand up against his father's abuse; when he did, Marvin Gay, Sr. responded by sending Michael to live with his aunt, Zeola, another one of Alberta's sisters, in Detroit. However, Jeanne Gay said Michael Cooper was moved to Detroit without the alleged confrontation between father and son. Family life Children With Marvin Gay, Sr., Alberta had four children. The first, Mable Jeanne, was born in 1937. Marvin, Jr. followed on April 2, 1939. A younger son, Frances \\"Frankie\\", followed in November 1941, with a younger daughter, Zeola (named after her aunt), following in 1945. With her husband, she converted to the strict House of God, an eccentric Christian sect that took its teachings from Hebrew Pentecostalism. Since her husband barely worked jobs, Alberta worked as a domestic worker, cleaning houses in the Maryland and Virginia areas to provide income for her family. Gay, Sr. fathered another son, Antwaun Carey Gay, in 1970 by another woman during one of his extramarital affairs without Alberta's knowledge. Marriage to husband and domestic work Alberta often found herself caught up in the middle of her husband's level of brutal \\"disciplining\\" of their children. She also confided that her husband hated young Marvin. She told Ritz in 1979, \\"My husband never wanted Marvin. And he never liked him. He used to say he didn't think he was really his child. I told him that was nonsense. He knew Marvin was his. But for some reason, he didn't love Marvin and, what's worse, he didn't want me to love Marvin either. Marvin wasn't very old before he understood that.\\" By the end of her husband's ministerial period, he developed an addiction to alcohol and began developing an interest in cross-dressing. Alberta later explained that her husband \\"liked soft clothing. Soft things of all kinds attracted him. He liked to wear my panties, my shoes, my gowns, even my nylon hose. Marvin saw him like that sometimes.\\" When asked if she had thought of leaving or divorcing her husband, Alberta admitted she did but \\"felt sorry\\" for her husband due to his own abusive upbringing and stuck for him because he needed help. She also said that her husband wasn't ready for children because he didn't understand how to treat them and prior to her death, she told David Ritz that she had thought of leaving her husband many times before he shot Marvin, but had been unable to do so due to a lack of courage. Her daughter Jeanne stated her mother's strong beliefs in the House of God religion prevented her from divorcing her father. Marvin Gaye would say of his mother as someone who \\"lived by principles\\". Of his mother, Marvin said, \\"her kindness and generosity were legendary. She took in people and fed neighbors, even when we were still dirt poor. The woman suffered so, and yet her suffering seemed to make her stronger. The older I've gotten, the more I've wished that all women were like my mother.\\" In comparison to his volatile relationship with his father, Gaye said, \\"if it wasn't for Mother, who was always there to console me and praise my singing, I think I would have been one of those child suicide cases you read about in the papers.\\" Alberta's marriage to Marvin Sr. was always contentious and he was a womanizer who cheated on her and sometimes violently abused her. He was also resentful that he was not the breadwinner due to earning very little as a pastor.https://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/DCARead?standardNo=046501769X&standardNoType;=1&excerpt;=true Marvin's marriage to Anna and house moves When Gaye married his first wife, Anna, his duet partner and friend Kim Weston said that Anna reminded him strongly of his mother.What's Going On: The Life and Death of Marvin Gaye Gaye continually supported his mother throughout his life, and after becoming successful, he moved his parents out of the by now derelict projects and into a large house that he had bought for them on Fifteenth and Varnum in the black middle-class section of Washington, DC. In 1973, he moved his parents to a residence at 2101 Gramercy Place in the West Adams district of Los Angeles, and the rest of the family moved to California as well. Marvin's depression By 1979, Marvin had moved his belongings there and David Ritz interviewed him at the house that year as they worked on a biography. Noting her son's battle with depression, Alberta spent months with her son in Maui and in London. Kidney surgery and Marvin's final years In October 1982, Alberta Gay was rushed to a hospital in Los Angeles after falling critically ill to a near-fatal kidney infection that required surgery. Her sons Marvin and Frankie rushed from Belgium to be by her side, but Gay Sr. was in Washington, D.C., to fix up and sell their old house in Varnum Place and unwilling to return to California to support Alberta during her surgery or recuperation. Marvin believed that Alberta was owed half the money in the sale of the old Washington, D.C., house, but Gay, Sr. would not acknowledge that he had sold it.http://msoldschool.ning.com/profiles/blogs/marvin-gayethe-agony- and-the During Gaye's final years alive, he and Alberta slept together in Alberta's bedroom. Around that time, Gaye's parents had virtually separated, with Marvin Sr. sleeping in an adjacent bedroom a few blocks away from Alberta's. By the time of the events of April 1, 1984, the couple hadn't slept in the same bed for almost a decade. Son's death On March 31, 1984, Alberta and her husband had an argument over misplaced business documents, including an important insurance policy, which Alberta was blamed for misplacing. When the argument spilled over to Marvin's bedroom, Marvin awoke from a sleep and immediately took his mother's side, demanding his father to leave her alone. Gay, Sr. left the room without incident that afternoon but, according to Alberta, carried on rambling through the house. The next day, April 1, the arguments started again. This time, Gay, Sr. yelled for his wife to come downstairs from Marvin's room. Marvin again intervened, telling his father if he wanted to talk to her to do it directly. When Gay, Sr. refused, Marvin warned him not to come in his room. Ignoring Marvin's demands, Gay, Sr. marched to his room to argue with Alberta, prompting a despondent and angry Marvin to yell at him, and then pushed and shoved him out of the room into the hallway. According to Alberta, Marvin hit his father and also kicked him. Alberta eventually convinced her son to leave his father's room. At approximately 12:38 pm (PST), Marvin Sr. returned to Marvin's room carrying an unlicensed Smith & Wesson .38 caliber pistol that Marvin had given him as a Christmas present, shooting Marvin in his right chest area. The shot perforated his vital organs, including his heart, and proved to be fatal. Marvin was shot again at point-blank range. Alberta had already run out of the room following the first shot and pleaded for her husband to not shoot her next. Marvin Gaye later died from his wounds after arriving at the California Hospital Medical Center. Final years, divorce and death Following her son's murder, Alberta Gay filed for divorce from her husband after 49 years of marriage. Two days later, however, she posted a bond to bail him out of jail after his arrest for their son's murder, because she still sympathized with him and didn't believe he should suffer any longer. At her son's funeral, she kissed her son on his forehead. Alberta struggled with bone cancer for the remainder of her life and was taken care of by her daughter Jeanne at her Burbank home. In 1986, Alberta founded the Marvin P. Gaye, Jr. Memorial Foundation in dedication to her son to help people with drug and alcohol problems. Before the memorial opened, however, she died on May 8, 1987, at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, after years of suffering from bone cancer, at the age of 74.The Los Angeles Times Notes Sources  * Category:1913 births Category:1987 deaths Category:African-American Christians Category:American Pentecostals Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Deaths from bone cancer Category:People from Rocky Mount, North Carolina Category:Marvin Gaye Category:American domestic workers Category:People from West Adams, Los Angeles Category:Burials at Rose Hills Memorial Park ","title":"Alberta Gay"},{"id":"24156284","text":"The molecular formula C26H26N2O3 may refer to: * JWH-198, a drug which acts as a cannabinoid receptor agonist * Naltrindole, a delta opioid receptor antagonist ","title":"C26H26N2O3"},{"id":"24156287","text":"The molecular formula C19H17ClN2O4 may refer to: * Glafenine, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, with risk of anaphylaxis and acute kidney failure * Oxametacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ","title":"C19H17ClN2O4"},{"id":"24156288","text":"Namuggala Kagali was Kabaka of the Kingdom of Buganda, between 1741 and 1750.

Originally opening on May 20, 2000, as Jazzland's signature ride, the coaster has been abandoned and left in a state of decay as a result of the park's closure following 2005's Hurricane Katrina. History One of the Mega Zeph trains going down a hill. Mega Zeph takes its name from the original Zephyr or Big Zephyr coaster that operated in the now-defunct Pontchartrain Beach amusement park. The coaster celebrated its topping out ceremony on September 10, 1999, with the installation of the underpinnings of the coaster's highest hump. At the time of its completion, Mega Zeph served as both Jazzland's signature attraction as well as its most visible due to its location adjacent to the Interstate 10/Interstate 510 interchange. The coaster's opening would coincide with the grand opening of Jazzland on May 20, 2000. After Hurricane Katrina Shuttered since August 2005 due to severe flooding in the park as a result of Hurricane Katrina, the park has remained closed. Decisions haven't been made as to what to do with the rides. Each ride is decaying, damaged, and unusable. More information will be released at a later date. In 2007, Six Flags was in the process of removing some its rides. The first ride to leave was Batman: The Ride, which was removed and taken to Six Flags Fiesta Texas, where it was refurbished and reopened as Goliath on April 18, 2008. Bayou Blaster and Sonic Slam were removed and taken to Great Escape in Queensbury, New York, where it was refurbished and reopened as Sasquatch on May 10, 2009. The final ride to leave Six Flags New Orleans was the Road Runner Express, which was removed in 2009 and taken to Six Flags Magic Mountain, where it was refurbished and reopened on May 28, 2011 under the same name. As of February 2016, the Mega Zeph has remained unused since August 2005, but may potentially reopen as part of a redevelopment of the park announced in August 2009 by New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin. Rumors still float around regarding the history of the park. A large section on the Mega Zeph track has completely fallen to the ground due to the decaying of the wood. The majority of the wood from Mega Zeph has decayed and the steel track has severely rusted. Also, the only train has been sent to Six Flags St. Louis. They are now being stored under Batman the Ride. Mega Zeph will cost around $3 million (USD) to fix and have the ride back to operating after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Mega Zeph was featured in the 20th Century Fox film Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters along with several other rides including Ozarka Splash, released August 16, 2013. Mega Zeph was lined with lights along the coaster and resurrected just enough to have a car zoom in and out of frame during the shooting of the film. In the film, Six Flags New Orleans portrayed the park Circeland on the island of Polyphemus, that was built by the goddess Circe, only to be destroyed by the cyclops Polyphemus. Ride Layout View from Paris Road Highway After passengers leave the station, passengers climb a lift hill culminating in its first drop. The train then makes a quick descent towards a high speed turnaround near the lake's edge. The physical construction of the ride is unique in that it consists of steel construction with a wooden track.

National Statistical Coordination Board. Retrieved August 31, 2009.  History  The present name, believed to have been adopted in the mid 1900s, was, according to many traditions, derived from a native tree called bituon which once grew abundantly in the area. A contending theory states that the name came from the native Waray word for Star, also bituon.  Geography  Cabiton-an is located at the northernmost point of the island municipality of Daram, which lies within the western part of Samar Sea and the Zumarraga Channel. The north and western boundary is the Samar Sea; the eastern boundary is the Zumarraga Channel. It can be reached by a 30-minute boat ride from the provincial capital of Catbalogan.  Government  Cabiton- an comprises three puroks (zones), Purok One, Purok Two and Purok Three respectively. Like all other barangays in the country, it is governed from the Barangay Hall by a Barangay Captain, an elected official entitled for three- year term, who is aided by seven Sangguniang Barangay members (barangay kagawads or councilors), also elected. In 2008, it has a budgetary allocation of PHP 615,795 from the Philippine government.FY 2008 Indicative Internal Revenue Allotment For Barangays, Region VII, Province of Samar Department of Budget and Management.

Livelihood  Being a coastal area, the main livelihood is fishing and agriculture. Seafood is a local speciality, in fact, many fish are sold in the markets of nearby Daram, Catbalogan and Tacloban. The major fishing products caught in the seas around Cabiton-an are galonggong, alumahan, tamban, pompano, bisugo (bream), lapu- lapu, rabbitfish, slipmouth and assorted. Other fish resources are seaweed, mussels/oysters, crabs and shells. Agricultural income is derived mostly from coconuts, bananas, corn and other crops such as sweet potato, cassava, and legumes.  Infrastructure  Cabiton-an offers basic rural infrastructure that includes water-based transportation, a plentiful public water supply, power supply from SAMELCO II, cellular and cable communication facilities, sports and recreational facilities, tourist spots, and common service establishments.  Education  Cabiton-an has one primary school, Cabiton-an Public School, with 205 students attending grades one through six.Master List of Schools Department of Education. Retrieved August 31, 2009. Students desiring to attend grades beyond six must matriculate to nearby secondary schools in Parasan or Catbalogan.

A Heldentenor, Burian earned acclaim in Europe and America for his powerful performances of the heaviest Wagnerian roles.

Inititially Burian had intended to become a lawyer and had attended Prague University for a year in pursuit of this goal. However, a professor at the university heard his voice and encouraged him to pursue an operatic career, putting him in touch with Pivoda for lessons.

However, he sang only one other major role with the company, Manrico in Giuseppe Verdi's Il trovatore, before joining the opera house in Reval for the 1892-1893 season. He sang at the opera house in Aachen during the 1893-1894 season, notably appearing in the world premiere of Leo Blech's first opera, Aglaja.Casaglia, Gherardo (2005). \\"Karel Burian\\". Almanacco Amadeus. Retrieved 15 January 2013 . By the mid-1890s Burian was beginning to build a substantial reputation in Germany for the quality of his performances of the heldentenor repertoire. From 1894 to 1896 he was the leading Wagnerian tenor at the Cologne Opera. While there, he sang (among other things) in the world premieres of Karl von Kaskel's Sjula (1895) and Arnold Mendelssohn's Elsi, die seltsame Magd (1896). He left Cologne to take up a commitment to sing at the Staatsoper Hannover in 1896 to 1898, followed by a three-year term at the Hamburg State Opera in 1898-1901. He was also active at the Berlin State Opera during the 1898/99 season. By 1899, Burian had been engaged to appear at the best opera house of his home nation, the National Theatre in Prague. However, he did not remain for long with that theatre, as he was now a much-in-demand singer in Germany, where he could earn higher fees and greater prestige. For more than a decade prior to World War I, Burian was a leading and much-admired tenor at the Semperoper in Dresden, where he made a powerful impression as Herod in the world premi√®re of Richard Strauss‚Äôs Salome in 1905. He later repeated the role for the first productions of Salome in New York City and Paris (in 1907). The operas of Richard Wagner were Burian's major focus on the international stage. He notably sang Tristan in the Hungarian premi√®re of Tristan und Isolde, and also appeared as several of the principal Wagner heroes at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, during four seasons between 1904 and 1914. He also sang almost all of the major Wagner roles at the Metropolitan Opera, where he performed for seven seasons.Metropolitan Opera Archives. Burrian, Carl (Tenor). Retrieved 15 January 2013.

Among other things, they contain his recollections of the composer/conductor Gustav Mahler and the conductor Arturo Toscanini. In 1920 Burian mistakenly drank bleach believing it to be mineral water and suffered severe burns to his mouth and larynx.

His death was marked by a black flag draped on the National Theatre. The Czech Philharmonic played Siegfried's funeral march from Twilight of the Gods. He was known for his powerful stage presence, and according to the music critic Desmond Shawe-Taylor, his voice was praised for its \\"golden quality\\" and the \\"penetrating clarity\\" of its tone.

In 1941-42, he commanded the destroyer . Promoted to captain in mid-1942, during the rest of World War II he led several destroyer units in combat in the Central Solomons, off Iwo Jima and Okinawa and during raids on Japan. As Commander of Destroyer Division 23, Higgins was aboard Gwin when she was torpedoed at the Battle of Kolombangara on 13 July 1943. Two officers and 59 men were killed and Gwin was later scuttled. For his \\"aggressive and brilliant leadership\\" during this battle, as well as his \\"extraordinary heroism and distinguished service\\" during the preceding New Georgia Campaign, Higgins was awarded the Navy Cross. Following the Japanese surrender, Higgins held important staff positions and was commanding officer of the battleship (March 1947-January 1948). After promotion to the rank of rear admiral, he commanded Cruiser Division 5, and was also commander of the Southern and Eastern Support Groups in operations against enemy forces in the Korean War from 25 June to 27 December 1950. For his \\"exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service\\" Higgins was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. In 1951-52, he led the Pacific Fleet Mine Force. Higgins held several shore billets during the remainder of his service, including commandant of two naval districts, and Chief of the Military Advisory Group, Japan, in 1957-59.

Striptease is considered a form of public nudity and subject to changing legal and cultural attitudes on moral and decency grounds. Some countries do not have any restrictions on performances of striptease. In some countries, public nudity is outlawed directly, while in other countries it may be suppressed or regulated indirectly through devices such as restrictions on venues through planning laws, or licensing regulations, or liquor licensing and other restrictions.  National issues   Canada  There have been annual attempts to amend the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), passed in 2001. The 2009 version of the bill (Bill C-45: An Act to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act) had specific provisions related to tightening the issuance of Exotic Dancer Visas as a means to combat human trafficking. In addition to Canada, the Irish and Japanese governments had at one time special visa categories for 'entertainers' which enabled the trafficking of women for strip clubs and prostitution.  Cyprus  The former immigration chief in Cyprus was found guilty in 2001 of accepting bribes to issue work permits to foreign women (from Ukraine) who worked as strippers in clubs, some of whom were forced into prostitution.  Iceland  In March 2010, Iceland outlawed striptease under a law made by the Icelandic Parliament (Al√æingi). It is now an offence for any business to profit from the nudity of its employees. No other European country has subsequently implemented a strip club ban. Strip clubs and nudity among their employees remains legal in most of Europe. Around 15 strip clubs had been operating in Iceland in the late 1990s and early 2000s, mostly in and around Reykjav√≠k, and stripping was a multimillion-dollar business. At that time nude dancing was regulated and stripping was generally considered to be illegal, although a small number of clubs had been given a legal exemption to feature striptease. Those exemptions were rescinded when the ban officially took effect on 31 July 2010 and Iceland's strip clubs all closed. A few \\"champagne clubs\\" subsequently opened in an old strip club district, providing a private area in the back where clients could purchase private time with a female worker. In 2015, a women's crisis center, St√≠gam√≥t, campaigned against these clubs and accused them of trafficking and prostitution. The clubs were subsequently raided by the police and closed. Siv Fri√∞leifsd√≥ttir of the Progressive Party was the first presenter of the bill. Kolbr√∫n Halld√≥rsd√≥ttir, the politician behind the bill, was concerned about alleged links with drugs and prostitution. She was also of the opinion that strip clubs violated women's rights. She said: \\"It is not acceptable that women or people in general are a product to be sold\\". J√≥hanna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir, then Iceland's Prime Minister, said: \\"The Nordic countries are leading the way on women's equality, recognizing women as equal citizens rather than commodities for sale\\". Another politician, Steinunn Vald√≠s √ìskarsd√≥ttir, spoke in support of the ban, saying: \\"Women who work at strip clubs are in many cases the victims of human trafficking and other kinds of abuse\\" and \\"I have been working in this field for almost 15 years and not yet have I met one woman who dances at strip clubs because she wants to\\". Club operators dispute the notion that strippers are unwilling victims. They argue that Icelandic police have found no evidence of organised crime or prostitution at their clubs. The decision to pass the law was seen as a victory for anti-pornography feminists, and criticized by sex-positive feminists. In 2015 St√≠gam√≥t made a presentation on the results of their activities in Iceland at a sideline event of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women.  United Kingdom  In the 1930s, when the Windmill Theatre, London, began to present nude shows, British law prohibited performers moving whilst in a state of nudity.Martin Banham, \\"The Cambridge guide to theatre\\", Cambridge University Press, 1995, , page 803 To get around that rule, models appeared naked in stationary tableaux vivants. To keep within the law, sometimes devices were used which rotated the models without them moving themselves. Fan dances were another device used to keep performances within the law. These allowed a naked dancer's body to be concealed by her fans or those of her attendants, until the end of an act, when she posed naked for a brief interval whilst standing stock still, and the lights went out or the curtain dropped to allow her to leave the stage. The Lord Chamberlain‚Äôs rules prohibiting moving nude dancers did not apply to private members club, a loophole exploited by the ‚ÄúRaymond Revuebar‚Äù in Soho, London at the start of the 1960s. Changes in the law in that decade brought about a boom of strip clubs in Soho, with \\"fully nude\\" dancing and audience participation.Murray Goldstein (2005) Naked Jungle - Soho Stripped Bare. Silverback Press A 2003 United Kingdom study reported statistics which said that in the London Borough of Camden the number of rapes increased by 50% and indecent assaults by 57% after four lap dancing venues opened. According to the Lilith Report on Lap Dancing and Striptease in the Borough of Camden, these statistics were calculated from information published by the Metropolitan police relating to the years 1998-99 and 2001‚Äì02. The percentages however were incorrectly calculated and Metropolitan police provided the UK Guardian newspaper with the following figures: 72 rapes and 162 indecent assaults in the borough in 1998‚Äì99, and 96 rapes and 251 indecent assaults in 2001‚Äì02; a 33% increase in rape and a 55% increase in indecent assault. The overall crime rate decreased over the same period. However, in 2011 Brooke Magnanti published a statistical re-analysis criticizing the Lilith report for its lack of incidence rate calculation, lack of control population, and using results from too short of a time period. The authors of Government Regulation of \\"Adult\\" Businesses Through Zoning and Anti-Nudity Ordinances: Debunking the Legal Myth of Negative Secondary Effects, a meta-analysis of 110 studies looking at the impact of strip clubs and other adult businesses, have concluded that the studies that favored prohibiting exotic dancing suffered from research flaws, and that in the papers that did not contain fatal flaws, there was no correlation between adult-oriented business and any crime.Bryant, P Linz, D and Shafer, B, 2001. Government regulation of adult businesses through zoning and anti-nudity ordinances: Debunking the legal myth of negative secondary effects. Communication Law and Policy 6(2): pp 355-91 Ethnographic work also supports the conclusion that there is no relationship between adult entertainment and crime.Hanna, J L, 2005. Exotic Dance Adult Entertainment: A Guide for Planners and Policy Makers. Journal of Planning Literature 20(2): pp 116-134. British House of Commons. The UK has seen a recent legislative trend leading to a more conservative treatment of striptease, in contrast to many areas in Europe and the US which have more liberal sexual attitudes. In 2009, the United Kingdom passed the Policing and Crime Act following government concerns about an increase in the number of striptease venues in the country. The act defines \\"sexual entertainment venues\\" as those venues in England & Wales (and later Scotland) which have been licensed for the performance of nudity for profit where the primary intention of the entertainment is sexual gratification or titillation. Most of the venues licensed in this way are lap dance or gentleman's clubs specialising in female striptease for an assumed male audience, but some offer more general sexual entertainment, burlesque, or male striptease. Any strip club where live entertainment takes place more than 11 times a year must now apply for a license from its local authorities. Such clubs are routinely opposed by those who feel that these 'lower the tone' of particular neighbourhoods, and the introduction of licensing legislation under the 2009 Policing and Crime Act (in England and Wales) and the 2015 Air Weapons and Licensing Act (Scotland) has reduced the number of relevant premises to fewer than 200 across the UK, significantly down on the 350 or so existing in the early 2000s. The reasons for licence refusal vary, but usually it is on grounds of the club being in an inappropriate locality.Hubbard, Philip, \\"Law, sex and the city: regulating sexual entertainment venues in England and Wales\\", International Journal of Law in the Built Environment 7, no. 1 (2015): 5-20. The London Borough of Hackney council used the Act to introduce a \\"nil\\" policy on adult entertainment in early 2011. However, the council's own consultation found that over 75% of the people in Shoreditch (where most of Hackney's existing clubs were located) opposed the ban. Police noted that crime and antisocial behaviour around the existing clubs was extremely low compared to late-night bars. Trade unions estimated that up to 450 jobs could be lost and the TUC argued that dancers who worked in the existing establishments should be better protected instead.  United States  Many U.S. jurisdictions have various laws related to striptease, public nudity and related issues. For example, the \\"six foot rule\\" in some jurisdictions requires strippers to maintain a six-foot distance from customers while performing topless or nude.For example, San Diego Municipal Code 33.3610 This rule does not apply when in a bikini or other work outfit, but is indicative of the level of scrutiny prevailing in some jurisdictions on dancer-customer interaction. Other rules forbid \\"full nudity\\". In some parts of the United States, laws forbid exposure of female nipples, but does not apply if a stripper wears pasties.Houston passed such a law in 2008, and Detroit passed a similar law in 2010.  Social attitudes  A relatively liberal social climate keeps many jurisdictions in the United States from passing stricter legislation against strip clubs, or from enforcing it fully. However, in recent years, many cities, such as New York City and San Francisco, have enacted ordinances prohibiting \\"adult entertainment\\" businesses from within a certain distance of houses, schools and churches, and perhaps each other. Often, a distance of nearly half-a-mile is stipulated, which ensure that new strip clubs can not open in many major cities. Courts have generally upheld these zoning laws.  Decency regulations  Many United States jurisdictions have laws pertaining to striptease or public nudity. In some parts of the United States, laws forbid exposure of female nipples, but does not apply if a stripper wears pasties. In early 2010, the city of Detroit banned fully exposed breasts in its strip clubs, following the example of Houston which began enforcing a similar ordinance of 2008. The city council has since softened the rules eliminating the requirement for pasties but kept other restrictions.  Topless and fully nude clubs  In several parts of the United States, local laws classify strip clubs as either topless or all/fully nude. Dancers in topless clubs can expose their breasts, but not their genitals. Topless dancers typically perform in a G-string and, depending on local laws, may be required to wear pasties covering their nipples. Fully nude clubs may be subject to additional requirements such as restrictions on alcohol sales or no-touch rules between customers and dancers.Nude Dancing (from the First Amendment Center website) To get around these rules two \\"separate\\" bars‚Äîone topless and one fully nude‚Äîmay open adjacent to one another. In a small number of states and jurisdictions, where it is legal for alcohol to be consumed but not for alcohol to be sold, some clubs allow customers to bring their own beverages. These are known as BYOB clubs.  Independent contractors  In the U.S., striptease dancers are generally classified as independent contractors. While a few smaller strip clubs may pay a weekly wage, for the most part all of a dancer's income is derived from tips and other fees they collect from customers. In most clubs, dancers have to pay a \\"stage fee\\" or \\"house fee\\" to work a given shift. In addition, most clubs take a percentage of each private dance. It is customary‚Äîand often required in the United States‚Äîfor dancers to also pay a \\"tip out\\", which is money (either a set fee or a percentage of money earned) paid to staff members of clubs, such as DJs, house moms, make-up artists, servers, bartenders, and bouncers, at the end of their shift.  Touching of strippers  Touching of strippers is illegal in many states. However, some dancers and some clubs condone touching of dancers during private dances. This touching often includes the fondling of breasts, buttocks, and in rare cases vulvae. In some locales, dancers may give a customer a \\"lap dance\\", whereby the dancer grinds against the customer's crotch while he is fully clothed in an attempt to arouse him/her. One of the more notorious local ordinances is San Diego Municipal Code 33.3610, specific and strict in response to allegations of corruption among local officials which included contacts in the nude entertainment industry. Among its provisions is the \\"six foot rule\\", copied by other municipalities in requiring that dancers maintain a distance while performing topless or nude. While in their bikini or other work outfit this rule is not in effect, but is indicative of the level of scrutiny prevailing in some regions on dancer-customer interaction.  Status of underage dancers  In July 2009, it was discovered that, in addition to not having a prostitution law (prostitution in Rhode Island was outlawed in 2009), Rhode Island also does not have a law to stop underage girls from being exotic dancers. The Mayor of Providence, David Cicilline signed an executive order, effective July 31, prohibiting the city Board of Licenses from issuing adult entertainment licenses to establishments that employ minors. The club owners also made a pledge to not employ underage girls.  Court cases  In 1991, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. that nudity in itself is not \\"expressive conduct\\" (or \\"symbolic speech\\") entitled to free speech protection of the First Amendment.Pennsylvania case may be Supreme Court's chance to clarify nude-dancing limits (from the Freedom Forum website, Wednesday 19 May 1999) It also ruled that topless or nude dancing may be expressive but that a state may nevertheless outlaw public nudity (i.e., not the dance itself) on the basis of furthering public's interest in maintaining morality and order. In 2000, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its finding in Erie v. Pap's A. M. ruling that nude dancing was expressive conduct \\"marginally\\" protected by the First Amendment, but that it could be regulated to limit the \\"secondary effects\\", such as crime.  Prostitution in strip clubs  Rules governing strip clubs and the overall adult entertainment industry vary around the world, and formats sometimes are combined under a single roof or complex. For example, in Bangkok, Thailand, the Nana Entertainment Plaza is a large four-floor compound with over 40 bars. Most of the bars are go-go bars where girls dance in various stages of nudity. They are not formal brothels, since customers must negotiate with the female workers for services up to and including sex without an intermediary. The Zona Norte red light district in Tijuana, Mexico has a number of legal brothels which are modeled on strip clubs and feature U.S.-style striptease performed by its prostitutes. Zurich, Switzerland also has legalized prostitution, and its strip clubs throughout the city offer sex among their services. Differing from Zurich brothels, sex services in the strip clubs are typically performed off site. Eastern European strip clubs have a similar model. A \\"sex zone\\" in Tokyo, Japan which is only 0.34 square kilometers had approximately 3,500 sex facilities as of 1999. These included strip theaters, peep shows, \\"soaplands,\\" \\"lover's banks,\\" porno shops, telephone clubs, karaoke bars, clubs and more all offering adult entertainment services. Filipino red light districts contain go-go bars and strip clubs tightly concentrated with other types of businesses and each other similar to the U.S. In Dubai, a city governed by very strict cultural norms and laws, there are several Indian strip clubs offering at least partial- nudity. Newspaper reportsPolice raid Seattle strip clubs indicate that customers can occasionally purchase sex in some American strip clubs. Both the U.S. municipalities of Detroit, Michigan and Houston, Texas were reputed to have rampant occurrences of illicit activity including prostitution linked to its striptease establishments within their city limits. Prostitution is illegal in all states except in some rural counties in Nevada. Prostitution in Rhode Island was outlawed in 2009.

It has no drainage out, and drainage into it frequently results in shallow ponding at various low areas over the floor. Notching the rim at the southwest is a smaller basin, also without outlet, and separated from the larger one by a low divide.

Morris was a strong influence on United States law professors and criminologists including James B. Jacobs (NYU), Marc Miller (Arizona), Kevin Reitz (Minnesota), Michael Tonry (Minnesota), Franklin E. Zimring (Berkeley), Albert Alschuler (Northwestern) and Myron Orfield (Minnesota). He was a close friend and colleague of U.S. Supreme Court associate justice Harry A. Blackmun and of federal district court judge Abner Mikva. Morris was widely regarded as an advocate for the rights of inmates in prisons and mental hospitals. His theories on prison reform were implemented at the Federal Correctional Complex, Butner, N.C. Morris was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Fellow of the American Bar Foundation, a Fellow of the American Society of Criminology, a board member of the Chicago Bar Foundation (1982‚Äì88), a chairman of the board and board member of the National Institute of Corrections. Career Norval Morris was born in 1923 in Auckland, New Zealand. He served in the Australian army in World War II. He earned LL.B. and LL.M. degrees at the University of Melbourne, where he was a resident student at Trinity College from 1940, and gained second-class honours in Introduction to Legal Method and Law of Wrongs (Civil and Criminal) in 1941.The Fleur-de- Lys, Oct. 1942, p. 6. He received his PhD in law and criminology in 1949 from the University of London, and was appointed to the Faculty of Law at the London School of Economics. In the 1950s, Morris was chairman of the Commission of Inquiry on Capital Punishment in Ceylon. Drawing on his experiences there, he later wrote The Brothel Boy & Other Parables of the Law (1992) a fictional reconstruction of the experiences of Eric Blair (George Orwell) as a Burmese policeman and magistrate, which Morris used to examine ethical and legal issues. At the University of Melbourne, Morris was Secretary and Foundation Member in the Department of Criminology (1951‚Äì58), Associate Professor of Criminology (1955‚Äì58) and Senior Lecturer in Law (1950‚Äì58). He was Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Adelaide (1958‚Äì62). In the United States, Morris was a visiting professor at Harvard University, the University of Utah, the University of Colorado and New York University. In 1962-64, he was founding director of the United Nations Institute for the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of Offenders (Asia and Far East). In 1964 he became a member of the University of Chicago Law School faculty and from 1975 to 1978 was Dean of the University of Chicago Law School. He and Omaha lawyer Robert J. Kutak precipitated the creation of the National Institute of Corrections within the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in 1971-1972. Morris served on the institute's board until his death. In 1978, his stance on the Fourth Amendment and gun control in his 1970 book with Gordon Hawkins (\\"There can be no right to privacy in regard to armament\\") cost him an appointment to the federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, even though he dismissed the proposals in the book as \\"Utopian\\" and \\"science-fiction\\". From 1979 to 1987, Morris served on the Police Board of the City of Chicago. In 1994 Morris took emeritus status at Chicago Law School, working as a consultant and advisor until his death in 2004 at the age of eighty. He was survived by a wife, three sons and three grandchildren. Underscoring Morris' lasting legacy on the field of legal and criminological research, his work has been recently cited by the Supreme Court in Davis v. Ayala (Kennedy J, concurring), Docket No. 13-428 (decided June 18, 2015).

Chelsea's performances and results were erratic throughout the season, typified by large victories over Arsenal, Newcastle United and West Bromwich Albion and heavy defeats against Manchester United, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Burnley, culminating in a sixth consecutive mid-table finish since their Championship success in 1955. The club were also victims of an upset in the FA Cup, losing 2‚Äì1 at home to Fourth Division side Crewe Alexandra. The season was nonetheless a watershed in the club's history; frustrated at the club's lack of direction, Chelsea's star player Jimmy Greaves joined AC Milan at the end of the season. Manager Ted Drake, his position weakened by the Crewe result in particular, would also leave the club early into the next season. Despite the lack of tangible success, the season produced a series of records. Chelsea scored 98 league goals, a record that stood until Chelsea's record breaking 2009‚Äì10 season and conceded 100 goals ‚Äì another club record. Greaves scored 41 league goals, plus another two in the League Cup for a seasonal total of 43, which has never been bettered by another Chelsea player. Greaves also notched six hat-tricks (another club record for a single season), and during the campaign scored his 100th career league goal; at the age of 21, still the youngest ever player to do so.

Armament The original armament was four 7-inch R.B.L. guns and it was decided in 1872 to replace them with four 64pr R.M.L. guns. In 1876 one 64pr was removed from the left flank of the battery and this position was replaced with an earth traverse to prevent enfilade fire from ships at anchor in the Culver Cliff area.

It was built by Goud Saraswat Brahmins of Karkala and was installed on 25 April 1537. Etymology This shrine lies to the west of Tirupati while original shrine is in the east. The name itself signifies its meaning. Padu means 'West' in Kannada and Tirupathi means Tirumala temple. History and origin This ancient temple of Karkala, Karnataka, India was built by Goud Saraswat Brahmins of Karkala. They migrated from Goa after the Portuguese invaded it. They could not suffer their tortures. So they migrated to places like Karnataka and Kerala, where they brought all their household items. Original installation This temple has a history dating from about the 14th century when the Jain Bhairarasa Odeyars ruled Karkala and surrounding places. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins were given land by the Jain Odeyars so that these people can lead a happy life. They also gave them lands for agriculture as these Brahmins had it as an occupation. The priests of this community namely Joishys, Puraniks and Tantris were the main people who had an existence from the 14th century. The exact date of installation of this temple is still unknown as during that time there were no written materials or documents. Installation ceremony and its history The main attraction of this temple was its installation ceremony. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins (GSBs) came to Karnataka in search of place food and shelter. They paid a visit to all the places along the coastline. Some of them settled in Karwar, Ankola, Kumta, Bhatkal, Shirali and so on. Few of them went to Kerala side and settled in Ernakulam, Cochin, Manjeshwar etc. Rest of the others went to Udupi and Dakshina Kannada (which was previously under Mysore State). These GSBs came and settled in Pandya Nagari of Jains between 1400 AD and 1450 AD (now been called as Karkala). They brought with them all their articles and household items which included idol of Lord Venkataramana. The first GSB to enter Karkala was Soire Prabhu whose great grandson is K. Ramesh Prabhu the present trustee of the temple. They are also called as the first citizen of Karkala. One more family who migrated from Goa along with Prabhu's were the Soma Sharmas. He was a priest in Tirupathi Temple. Prabhus started their life in Karkala as usual how they used to live in Goa with all the rites and rituals. Their priests joined them. Some of the GSBs came to this place wandering from place to place for shelter and food. They met the Jain kings and they told them about Prabhus, Sharmas and GSB priests. They gave these people permission to stay with them. One fine day all these GSBs came to Jain King Immadi Bhairava, asking for a land to build a temple for Lord Sree Venkataramana in 1450 AD. The Jain king happily gave them the land for the very same purpose with some black stones which were prevalent in the area. This shows that the Jains patronised other religions. The land which they gave to the GSBs was occupied by a lady of some Mutt (religious institution for learning Vedas and Puranas). The lady heeded to the people and Jains only one condition that > \\"There are four powerful Ganas [Lord Shiva's servants] who should be > worshipped and given sacrifices of coconuts, green pumpkins, Turmeric and so > on; unless they would get angry. Also a yearly sacrifice should be performed > as no unholy things may happen in and around here.\\" The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins and the Jain king openly said yes to lady, and the temple was built. Initially a huge platform was built and four pillars were made to stand in the corners. Entangled coconut leaves were made as a roof. The idol was installed inside and prayed for the betterment of people. The compound wall was in its progress for building up the blocks. Soma Sharma returned to Karkala from Tirupathi with another idol of Lord Sree Venkataramana which was given to him by the Tirumala priests at the end of the 14th century. He installed this idol with the previously installed idol of Lord Venkataramana in the newly built stone platform. During 1500 AD, some dacoits attacked Karkala and started stealing all the gold and silver ornaments and idols. Karkala GSBs got scared about these bad events. They made up their mind and took all their precious articles with the two idols and ran away to some other place. They asked the Jain kings to protect their area. The king promised them and gave 100% moral support. Karkala GSBs reached an area called Mulki where threw all the materials they had with them in a well. In Karkala there was a huge fight going on between Jain rulers and the dacoits. At last the dacoits had to run away from Karkala since they had been defeated. As the happenings cooled down Karkala GSBs returned to the well and tried to retrieved all the idols and articles. But they could not retrieve the idol which Soma Sharma had brought with him. They got depressed and returned to Karkala. One morning, a Mulki person was passing near the well and found something shining. He went down and tried to look at it. It was the same idol the Karkala people were searching for. He thought Lord must have made his mind to stay in Mulki, so he took it and made a plan install it in Sree Veera Vittal Temple of Mulki established by Soira Vittal Bhat. As soon as Karkala GSBs received this news in few days, they rushed to Mulki. But by that time Mulki people had installed it in the temple. The Karkala GSBs stayed there and slept over. That night the idol (Lord Venkataramana installed at Mulki) appeared in their dream and said > \\"You all please go to Karkala and stay there, don't get frustrated or > depressed because of this event. I will come again to your place and stay > there; a Saint from Tirumala Tirupati will be coming to Karkala with me. > There will be Sampurna Sannidhi [meaning that the idol would be having > powerful grace of Tirupathi] in me. Install it with the idol which you have > at present in your temple.\\" The very next morning they met Mulki residents, told them about the dream, and went back to Karkala with a hope that Tirupathi Sreenivasa would come. Months passed by while the GSBs waited. One day an old person arrived in Karkala with a bag on his shoulder and dressed as a hermit. He asked for a place to take rest with the Gaud Saraswat Brahmins. They gave him a small place to stay. He had some idol of Lord Vishnu which he used to take it with himself for a pilgrimage. That night when everyone was in deep sleep a strange dream appeared for the GSBs and the saint. Lord of Tirupathi was the main character in the dream. For GSBs the dream was, \\"Devotees of mine I have already come over here as I promised. The saint who came to this place has come Tirumala and the idol which he has is mine. You take the idol from him and install it but as per my instructions. During the ceremony a cow and her calf should be left for feeding after pooja. The place where the cow drops her milk after milking the calf will be my sacred place. Do all these things first and then rest leave it to me.\\" For the saint the dream appeared as, \\"Oh Saint you have travelled much in your life and now its time for you to take rest in your life. I like this place very much and want to stay here for the rest of the time. The people from whom you asked the land are in need of me as I had promised them that I would come from Tirumala Tirupathi and stay in this place. So please hand over me to them.\\" The saint agreed to Lord's wishes and very next morning went to GSB people to hand over the idol with one condition. His condition was,\\"Any offerings given to Lord almighty would be taken to Tirupathi occasionally and Lord would be taken to Tirupathi once a year.\\" They agreed to hermits condition and installed the idol as per Lord's instructions. This installation was on the day 25 April 1537. Slowly and steadily the temple got built up with its Garbha Griha (sanctum sanctorum). The whole temple got renovated in 1699-1700\\\\. Then Parivar Devas like Lord Mukyaprana, Lord Gaurda, Lord Lakshmi and Lord Ganapathi were installed after two years of renovation. The number of devotees entering this gradually increased due to the divine environment of this place. The temple was again renovated in the year 2017. Rites and rituals Since this temple is related to Tirumala it follows the same rituals as in Tirupathi Temple. In the morning at 6:00 (in some cases it is 5:30 am during Ashwija month) the temple doors are opened with Dwara Pooja and Suprabhatam. Dwara Pooja is performed for the door keepers Jaya-Vijaya (in Vishnu Loka they represent DwaraPaalakaas). Suprabhatam is a special slokha recited to wake up the Lord from his sleeps. Then after the end of Suprabhata Nirmala Visarjana (removal of old flowers and decoration of new ones to deities) is performed with Ganji Naivedyam (serving of rice and rice item foods, including Navaneetham mixture of butter, til and sugar) at about 6:30 am. At 10:00 am Panchaamrutha abhishekha is performed for the Saligrama. This abhishekha is a typical one as performed in Tirupathi. In Tirumala this is performed on Lord Venkateshwara's stone statue and to honour the same here it is performed on the Saligrama. At noon Naivedyam is performed wherein several items are served for the Lord in a huge plate and utensil made out of copper. Once the Naivedya is over little bit of rice is served in small utensils and is kept in front of Parivar Devas while one is offered to Sree Veeramaruthi Temple. After this Maha Puja is performed at 1:00 pm, this is called Raajopchaara Puja. The temple doors are closed after this for Vishrama Seva. In the evening at about 6:00, temple doors are again opened with lighting of oil lamps. A special shlokha is sung called as \\"Deevtige Salaam Shlokham.\\" Cassettes of bhajans are played on loudspeakers at this divine time of sunset. At 6:30 people from all over the town come to temple to sing the hymns of Lord Almighties, and this goes on until 8:00 pm. At 8:00 again Naivedyam is offered with Mangalaarthi. Once Mangalaaarthi finishes, night Utsava is offered. This is usually an outing to the town except on Amavasya and Ekadashi. Once Utsava returns to temple there are five rounds inside; the first one is Vaadya Sutthu (instrumental), second and third is Rigveda and Yajurveda Sutthu, fourth is Sangeetha Sutthu (Yakshagana's Thaala Maddhale) and last one is Sarva Vaadya Sutthu. After the utsav ends with Vasantha Puja (Lord is given Uyaala Seva with recitals of shlokhas) deities are put to sleep which is known as Ekaantha Seva (11:30pm or on festive days depends on time taken). Income and economy The income for this temple mainly comes from the Kaanikas (money) given as offering to the Lord by devotees. Also the temple owns houses which are currently offered on rent and few lands which are given on lease, so finances are higher through these resources. Srinivasa Kalyana Mantapa, which is one of the halls built by the temple are given for rent for cultural programs, weddings, Brahmopadesham and the rents collected also adds to the income. Devotees offer funds towards the temple and some of them give yearly donations while some devotees register for longtime funds.

He was later assigned as aide-de-camp to Major General John C. Fremont, whose army was operating in the Shenandoah Valley. Dunca was shot and killed by a Georgian (Pvt. John Long of Co.

When the picket searched Dunca's personal effects, it was discovered that he was carrying a dispatch outlining Gen. Fremont's order of march for the day. He was buried at Perkey‚Äôs Farm, Cross Keys, Virginia, and his remains were later transferred to the Staunton National Cemetery (Section B, Grave 292). Dunca was not the only non-Hungarian to serve in the Union army. There were several officers in the Union Army who, although not natives of Hungary, may be classified as Hungarians, for they had been identified with the Hungarians' cause, spoke the Hungarian language and attached themselves in America to the Hungarians. Among them were Constantin Blandovski, a Pole who had served in the Honv√©d Army and few others.

It crashed before the trials got under way and, although it flew well later, only one was built. Design and development In layout and general appearance the Type F was similar to the earlier Type D and its contemporary, the Type E. Like them, the wings of the Type F had a strongly curved leading edge and a straight but swept-back trailing edge. They were wire braced above and below with the upper wires attached to a four-strut pyramidal pylon above the cockpit and below to the undercarriage structure, which was very similar to that of the Type E. Lateral control was by wing warping; the outer 40% of each wing was relatively flexible and could be twisted by wires running from the cockpit via the pylon to kingposts at 60% span. The Type F did not have the chord extensions seen on the outer parts of the Type E's wings. The Type F had a deep rectangular cross-section fuselage, narrowing to the rear, with fairings above and below for streamlining. The 70 hp (52 kW) Gnome rotary engine was completely enclosed in a snub-nosed cowling. The two crew sat side by side, as the military specification required, in an open cockpit at mid- wing. The observer, sitting on the left had a downward view through a windowed hatch. Elsewhere the aircraft was fabric-covered. The tailplane had a circular leading edge curving though a little more than 180¬∞ and carried split elevators with scalloped trailing edges. There was no fixed fin, only a rudder of irregular six-sided (five of them concave) shape. It had a tailskid formed from a pair of cane hoops. In August 1912 it was taken, untested, from the factory at Barking (it was the last Handley Page aircraft built there) to the military trials at Larkhill. It flew there for the first time on 21 August, coping with the windy conditions quite well though showing the side-to-side wallowing that had also been experienced with the Type E before its wing warping lateral control was replaced by ailerons. The next day the engine failed soon after takeoff and a wing and the undercarriage were seriously damaged in the resulting crosswind landing. The Type F was withdrawn from the trials and returned to the new factory at Cricklewood for repairs. It was in the air again in early November, flown with enthusiasm with a variety of passengers by Wilfred Parke on most days. The Type F was lost on 15 December 1912 when engine failure led to the death of Parke and his passenger, Alfred Arkell Hardwick. In the retrospective type redesignation of 1924, the Type F became the H.P.6.

Plot  Middle-aged Angela is left and divorced by her husband of many years (nicknamed Roundhead) after he discloses that he has a Mexican lover \\"Mona the Poser\\". Angela's adult daughter tells her that she was the only person who didn't know about the affair, which has been going on long-term. Alone, with only family dog Axal for company, Angela mourns her marriage and learns how to live without her family. Sometimes very depressed and ringing the local helpline, other times resolute and upbeat, Angela goes on holiday solo, rediscovers sex (and sex shops!), visits her doctor for random illnesses she never has, mocks \\"Roundhead the embellisher\\" for pretending his penis is a large when it is not even a medium and celebrates Christmas and birthdays by herself. Finally she takes off on an outward bound holiday which is naturally somewhat ill-advised but begins a relationship with the doctor whom she has seen every week or so since her divorce and who has joined her on the outward-bound excursion. The play looks at themes such as late in life divorce, middle-aged loneliness, how a person functions once children have left the nest, life experiences and how to cope when the world you have built comes crashing down.

Food Biotechnology in the United States: Science, Regulation, and Issues Congressional Research Service: The Library of Congress 2001 Background and history Judaism There is no consensus in the views of Jewish religious leaders, scholars and commentators on whether Jews can eat GM food products or engage in research in the area of GM food technology.Omobowale EB, Singer PA, Daar AS. (2009) The three main monotheistic religions and gm food technology: an overview of perspectives. BMC Int Health Hum Rights. 2009 Aug 22;9:18. One perspective emphasizes that humanity was created in God's image and this means that humanity can \\"partner with God in the perfection of everything in the world,\\" and therefore Jewish law accepts genetic engineering to save and prolong human life as well as increase the quality or quantity of the world's food supply. Other perspectives hold that GM food technology is a violation of Kil'ayim, the mixed breeding of crops or livestock, and that because God made \\"distinctions in the natural world\\", Jews must honor them. From the perspective of kosher laws, food made with genes from pigs or other non-kosher animals would likely be nonkosher.Steven M. Druker, Executive Director, Alliance for Bio-Integrity (1997) Are Genetically Engineered Foods in Accord with Jewish Law? Published on Ag Biotech InfoNet Islam Islam too forbids eating of pork, and Islamic scholars have also raised concern about the theoretical production of foods with genes from pigs.Islam and GMOs And there are varying perspectives. A seminar of Islamic scholars in Kuwait on genetics and genetic engineering in October 1998 concluded that although there are fears about the possibility of the harmful effects of GM food technology and GM food products on human beings and the environment, there are no laws within Islam which stop the genetic modification of food crops and animals. And in 2003, the Indonesian Ulemas Council (MUI) approved the importation and consumption of genetically modified food products by Indonesian Muslims. Others have written that while there are Quranic verses forbidding humanity from defacing God's creation, these \\"cannot be invoked as a total and radical ban on genetic engineering ... If carried too far, it would conflict with many forms of curative surgery that also entail some change in God's creation\\". Voices in opposition to GMOs argue that there is no need for genetic modification of food crops because God created everything perfectly and man does not have any right to manipulate anything that God has created. Christianity Roman Catholic Church Views of Rome on genetic engineering In 1999, after two years of discussions, the Vatican's Pontifical Academy for Life stated that modifying the genes of plants and animals is theologically acceptable. The Guardian reported that \\"Bishop Elio Sgreccia, vice- president of the pontifical academy, said: 'We are increasingly encouraged that the advantages of genetic engineering of plants and animals are greater than the risks. The risks should be carefully followed through openness, analysis and controls, but without a sense of alarm.' Referring to genetically modified products such as corn and soya, Sgreccia added: 'We give it a prudent 'yes' We cannot agree with the position of some groups that say it is against the will of God to meddle with the genetic make-up of plants and animals.'\\"Antony Barnett for the Guardian.

The Catholic Church is Not against the Use of Biotechnology in Agriculture But Simply Advocates Prudence and Regulation In 2000 as part of the Great Jubilee Pope John Paul II gave an address concerning agriculture, at which he said: The \\"famous words of Genesis entrust the earth to man's use, not abuse. They do not make man the absolute arbiter of the earth's governance, but the Creator's \\"co-worker\\": a stupendous mission, but one which is also marked by precise boundaries that can never be transgressed with impunity. This is a principle to be remembered in agricultural production itself, whenever there is a question of its advance through the application of biotechnologies, which cannot be evaluated solely on the basis of immediate economic interests. They must be submitted beforehand to rigorous scientific and ethical examination, to prevent them from becoming disastrous for human health and the future of the earth.\\"John Pail II. 11 November 2000 Address to the Jubilee of the Agricultural World.Eric Lyman (2000) Pope Expresses Opposition to GMOs, Cites Need for 'the Respect of Nature' Daily Report for Executives 221:A-6.

In 2008, Fr. Sean McDonagh, an Irish Columban priest and \\"well-known commentator on environmental issues\\", questioned whether hosts from transgenic wheat could ever be approved by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith because of the Church's strict rules regarding sacramental bread.

From Biopolitics to Noopolitics. Architecture & Mind in the Age of Communication and Information, 2010. He was collaborator, along with Elena Bajo and others, on Exhibition 211 in New York, 2009. Main themes A major theme in Neidich's practice can widely be summarised as neuroaesthetics (not to be confused with mainstream neuroesthetics), an area of critical and constructive thought, which can loosely be seen as the confluent impact of the brain on a cultured environment and, importantly, vice versa, upon which he began lecturing in 1996 at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. His website artbrain.org, which includes The Journal of Neuro-Aesthetic Theory, was published online in 1997. Cognitive capitalism (cognitive-cultural economy), 'critical' neuroscience, neuroplasticity, post-Workerism, immaterial labor, and epigenesis are recurring themes since 1996, while earlier themes, between 1985 and 1996, were interested in culturally based work about race, politics, historical reenactment, fictive documentary, staging, photographic practice, the archive, and anachronistic technology. On these topics he has published several books including: Neuromacht, 2017, Psychopathologies of Cognitive Capitalism: Part One, Two, and Three, The Noologist's Handbook and Other Art Experiments, 2013,\\"The Inner Perspective of the Noologist's Mind\\", by Suzana Milevska, in Warren Neidich, The Noologist's Handbook and Other Art Experiments, Ed.

Architecture & Mind in the Age of Communication and Information), 2010, and Blow Up: Photography, Cinema and the Brain, 2003. Neidich's work has examined the co-evolution of the history of art, brain, and mind, which provides a critical foundation to his understanding of neuroaesthetics as an ontologic process. The key to neuroaesthetics is the investigation of apparatuses in which a network of heterogeneous discourses is administered. As the world and technology change, so to the apparatuses which organize it, and the cognitive strategies with which one can understand it. This is especially true of the information age, which distributes such apparatuses non-linearly and profusely. Neidich's work is inspired by Michael Snow, Stan Brakhage, Jean-Luc Godard and the Apparatus Theory of Stephen Heath. Studies and teaching Warren Neidich has studied in diverse fields since 1970 including Photography, Psychology, Biology, (BA Magna Cum Laude Washington University, St. Louis), Neurobiology (as research fellow at California Institute of Technology, under the laboratory of Roger Wolcott Sperry who later won the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine) and Architecture, he is also a Board Certified Ophthalmologist from Tulane Medical Center. Neidich has collaborated with Goldsmiths College on several occasions since 2003, when he was visiting artist and lecturer. In 2005 he organized the first symposium on Neuroaesthetics, and in 2014, with Mark Fisher, he organized a symposium titled 'The Psychopathologies of Cognitive Capitalism: The Cognitive Turn Organized'. At Delft School of Design, Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands (where he was a PhD candidate under Professor Dr. Arie Graafland), in 2008 he co-organized \\"Architecture in Mind: From Biopolitics to Noo politics.\\" Art practice and theories Early works (1985‚Äì1996) Resistance is Futile/Resistance is Fertile at Kunsthaus Graz, Austria, 2006. From 1985 to 1997 Neidich worked on a number of projects investigating the relationship between power and representation, focusing on reenactment, staging, fictive documentary and performance. Major works from this time include the American Civil War studies The Battle of Chickamauga and Amputation without Anaesthesia exhibited at The Photographic Resource Center, Boston in 1991 and \\"American History Reinvented\\" (1986‚Äì1991) at Burden Gallery, Aperture Foundation, New York City, in 1989. Neidich's appropriation of historical moments by means of photography has been discussed by John Welchman, Christopher Phillips, Graham Clarke, and David Joselit. The series of altered photographs \\"Unknown Artist\\", which recast the early 20th- century art coterie as a social rather than an individual phenomenon, were installed at Berlin's Paris Bar in 1994 in collaboration with Martin Kippenberger and Michel Wertle. In 1994, Neidich's photography-based sculptural installation Collective Memory and Collective Amnesia (1991‚Äì94) used the culturally-constructed story of Anne Frank to reflect upon pop culture's vulgarization of history. Neidich's slide show projection \\"Beyond the Vanishing Point: Media Myth in America\\" was shown at N.Y. Kunsthalle, NYC in 1995. It traced a journey across America fifty years after Jack Kerouac, culminating in a surrealist photographic expos√© of the media encampment that grew outside the courthouse during the O.J. Simpson trial in Los Angeles (1995‚Äì97). The book Camp O.J., published by D.A.P. exposed the condition of infotainment. The introduction of Neuroaesthetics (1996‚Äì2002) In 1996 Neidich, began to explore the phenomenological conditions surrounding the cultural and historical aspects of his work. These research projects took the form of texts and lectures entitled \\"Neuroaesthetics\\", first delivered at the School of Visual Arts in New York, 1995‚Äì1996 when Neidich was visiting lecturer in the Department of Photography and Related Media under Charles Traub. In 1997 With the help of Nathalie Angles, current director of Residency Unlimited, he launched the platform artbrain.org, consisting of The Journal of Neuroaesthetics and Netspace Gallery. Neuroaesthetics, (differing from the scientific approach with the same name often spelled neuroesthetics), believes that artists in all their modes such as poetry, cinema, installation art and architecture, using their own spaces, apparatuses, materials, sense of time, and performative gestures, can elaborate truths about the noumenal and phenomenal world on part with those generated by the sciences. These truths compete effectively in the marketplace of ideas. The post-structuralist brain/mind/body/world complex, in which cultural mutations are transposed into parallel changes in the mind, brain and body, expressed in works such as \\"Brainwash\\" (1997), Neidich's first application of his hybrid dialectics, developed greater tenacity in 1999 when Neidich curated \\"Conceptual Art as Neurobiological Praxis\\" at Thread Waxing Space in New York which \\"rather than being a show about the collaboration between art and science or a reductive methodology of how the brain works, the exhibition attempted to promote the idea of a becoming brain\\" and included artists: Uta Barth, Sam Durant, Charline von Heyl, Jason Rhoades, Liam Gillick, Douglas Gordon, Thomas Ruff, Simon Grennan and Christopher Sperandio, and others. Neidich's video-works from this period include Apparatus, Memorial Day (1998), Kiss, and Law of Loci(1998‚Äì99). The exhibitions \\"The Mutated Observer Part 1\\" (2001), and \\"The Mutated Observer Part 2\\" (2002) at the California Museum of Photography showcased a number of handmade apparatuses, so-called \\"Hybrid Dialectics\\", in vitrines adjacent to those of the museum's collection. Recent work (2006‚Äì2017) Neidich's essay The Neurobiopolitics of Global Consciousness, published in the Sarai Reader 'Turbulence' in 2006, clearly connected the ideas of neural plasticity, epigenesis and Empire. Topics such as Neuro biopolitics were extended to include the political impact of immaterial labor and the Information Age on the production of architecture and built space, specifically in relation to the ways in which intense sensory and perceptual effect are now used to organize cultural attention. These ideas later evolved into a series of performative drawings staged in his studio at IASPIS in Stockholm (2008) and at The Drawing Center, New York (2009). The same year Neidich also organized the conference \\"The Power of Art\\" at The Drawing Center, New York. In 2008 Onomatopee published Neidich's book Lost Between the Extensivity-Intensivity Exchange for which he outlined that the \\"inauguration of the 21st century could be described as a time of cultural torpor resulting from free floating anxiety, ambivalence, and wavering\\", going on to say, \\"the condition, suggested by the title, that of being lost in the ‚Äòin-between zone‚Äô of extensive and intensive labor and two evolving partially incommensurable world views, the local (tribal) and global (cosmopolitan) or the nation-state and the Earthling, merged\\" > \\"What has become obvious to me is that in our moment of cognitive capitalism > in which the brain and mind are the new factories of the twenty-first > century, forms of activism invented during industrial capitalism like > refusal to work, absenteeism, and labor strikes are no longer up to the > task\\" ‚Äì Warren Neidich 2017 In Pizzagate (2017) Neidich returned to his earlier work on apparatus entitled 'Hybrid Dialectics' (1997‚Äì2003). In the work he delineates the new apparatuses of the knowledge economy like clickbait and memes as they produce new forms of subjectivity. Drive-By-Art In May 2020, in response to the impact of the Covid19 epidemic, Neidich curated the exhibition Drive-By-Art (Public Art in This Moment of Social Distancing) which took place at various locations, first in the Hamptons and then later in Los Angeles. The exhibitions featured work by 174 artists spread over multiple locations in \\"an attempt to bring back a sense of solidarity to the artistic and cultural community\\".https://www.drive- by-art.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Press-Release-LA-Drive-By-Art.pdfThe exhibition was featured in numerous publications including Artforum, Time, The Chicago Tribune and The New York Times. Saas-Fee Summer Institute of Art The Saas-Fee Summer Institute of Art (SFSIA) is a nomadic academy that originated in Saas-Fee, Switzerland in 2015, and moved to Berlin in 2016 where it could engage with the local active art scene. SFSIA maintains the moniker today simply as a nod to its origins. It was founded by fine artist and theorist Warren Neidich, and is co-directed by art critic and poet Barry Schwabsky. The school has included many notable collaborators in workshops or as speakers. SFSIA was born as a parallel program to the activities at the neighboring European Graduate School (EGS), sharing the evening public program, however with no formal connection. Schwabsky, in conversation with Jennifer Teets for Art & Education, has described his desire for the school to respond to a \\"crisis\\" across the sector wherein art academies are \\"controlled by administrators‚Äînot by faculty‚Äîan ever-expanding layer of bureaucrats who are removed from the real needs of students and the realities of teaching and research.\\" Each year SFSIA has approached a new theme, the founding being 'Art and the Politics of Estrangement' (2015), followed by 'Art and the Politics of Individuation: Affect and the Multiple Body in Cognitive Capitalism' (2016) and 'Art & the Politics of Collectivity' (2017). The 2018 program circulates around the theme of 'Art and Politics in the Age of Cognitive Capitalism' and will take place in Los Angeles and Berlin.

It was established on 15 June 1935, originally as the Young Lushai Association (YLA), which was later replaced with the \\"Young Mizo Association\\" in 1947. It was initiated by the Welsh Christian missionaries who understood the need of cultural conservation of the Mizo tribe, who were under pressure of political and social modernisations. It was registered as SR No. 4 of 1977 under Indian Societies Registration Act (XXI of 1860) on 14 May 1977 to the Government of Mizoram. The association is administered by a central committee (Central YMA), headquartered at Aizawl, and under which there are 5 sub-headquarters, 47 groups and 772 branches, which covers all of Mizoram and some parts of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura. Lalbiakzuala was elected on 17 October 2013 at the 68th General Conference as the President for 2013-2015 office, replacing T. Sangkunga. History By 1935 Christianity had taken over most of the traditional Mizo lifestyle, formal education system had been introduced, British rule was about to be revoked and local administration was to be subjected to Indian politics. The basic tribal administrative system Zawlbuk was dissolving. The traditional social security, custom and training ground for young men was coming to an end, thereby necessitating a substitute of the tribal institution urgently. As serendipity would have it, a thunderstorm on the Monday evening of 3 June 1935, right after worship service, drove the Welsh missionaries and the Mizo church leaders to the nearby residence of Miss Kattie Hughes (known to Mizos as Pi Zaii), at Aijal (now Aizawl), wherein they made an impromptu proposal over a cup of tea for establishing an association that would unite all the Mizo people. As a Christian gathering, the initial proposed name was Young Mizo Christian Association, to rhyme with Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), which on scrutiny they noticed had a restrictive and religious fundamentalist connotation. Then Rev David Edward (Zorema Pa) came up with \\"Young Lushai Association\\" akin to their familiar Young Wales Association in Wales. The name was unanimously accepted. It was also agreed that the association would be formally inaugurated on the coming 15 June. Though how many people and who were present on that night could not be ascertained, the following people were present: :#Rev David Edward :#Upa D. ·π¨hianga :#Rev L. Evans :#Upa Chawngzika :#Miss Kattie Hughes :#Pu Muka :#Rev Chhuahkhama :#Pu Vankhuma :#Pu L. Kailuia :#Pu L.H. Liana :#Upa Ch. Pasena YLA was unveiled on 5 June 1935 at the grand public meeting at Nepali School, Sikulpuikawn, with a candle lighting ceremony and election of the officials. Branches were soon created in every village, and all Mizo of age were soon registered members. The advent of Indian Independence incited new political and ethnic identity revivals in Mizoram (Lushai Hills, as it was called). For democratic administrative system, a political party was need. As the only and most endorsed organisation, YLA itself was suggested in 1945 to be the first political party. But the central committee objected to it, and this prompted the creation of an entirely political party, the Mizo Union. Then the terminology \\"Mizo\\" began to have new revolutionary meaning, it had much more inclusive and panoramic implications than \\"Lushai\\", which in any case was the Welshs' misnomer for \\"Lusei\\", a major clan of the Mizo tribe. Consequently, the central YLA committee resolved to change YLA to \\"Young Mizo Association\\" (YMA) on 7 October 1947. Aims and objectives *Good use of leisure (Hun √¢wl hman ·π≠hat) *Development of the Mizo society (Zofate hmasawnna ngaihtuah) *Revere Christian ethics (Kristian nun dan ·π≠ha ngaihs√¢n) The Ten Commitments Young Mizo Association imposes its members of #Self-discipline and righteousness #Good management of family #Just and truthfulness #Tolerance #Politeness #Chivalry and usefulness #Social commitment #Respect for religion #Preservation of culture #Abstinence from liquor and drugs Emblem and colour The emblem, as described in the constitution of Young Mizo Association, is a flamed torch with which the abbreviation YMA is written, which is in turn held by a hand inside a circle.

It borders Horseshoe Bay, a shallow bay that is part of the extreme northwest corner of Lake Huron adjacent to the Straits of Mackinac. The wilderness area is overseen by the United States Forest Service as part of the Hiawatha National Forest. Description When the water level of Lake Huron receded after the most recent ice age, many rolling areas of former lakeshore and lake bottomland became riparian wetlands along the lake's edge. The Horseshoe Bay Wilderness is one of these wetlands. It is forested, and characterized by trees that can tolerate humid and damp conditions, such as the paper birch and the Northern whitecedar. The shore of Horseshoe Bay, and the slow-moving tributaries that drain from the wetland into the bay, offer good ground for fish spawning, and the adjacent area of Lake Huron is rich in fish of all kinds. Fish-eating waterfowl, such as the great blue heron, are often seen here. Native Americans used Horseshoe Bay wetlands to catch fish. They harvested local plant life, such as birch bark and cedar roots, to build the canoes they used to catch the fish. After the Horseshoe Bay wetland had been thoroughly logged by timber companies, the land reverted to the public sector. Congress designated a parcel of national forest land along Horseshoe Bay's shoreline as a wilderness area in 1987. The Forest Service has built a trail from the Foley Creek parking lot/campground, adjacent to the wilderness, into the wilderness itself. The trail is often damp, and mosquitoes are common; it terminates at the Horseshoe Bay shoreline. The Horseshoe Bay Wilderness is served by County Highway H-63 and is adjacent to exit 352 on Interstate 75. The nearest major municipality is St. Ignace, which is to the south.

Jouko Santeri Kuha (born 30 September 1939 in Ranua) is a Finnish former long-distance runner, who specialized in the 3000 metres steeplechase. In 1968 he broke the World record with a result of 8:24.2.  Career  Kuha's international breakthrough was at the Finland-Sweden athletics international in 1965 when he beat Bengt Persson with the Finnish record of 8:37.6. In the same year he was ranked ninth at the annual ranking of Track and Field News. At the 1966 European Championships in Budapest Kuha ran a new Finnish record of 8:36.2 in the heats, but did not qualify for the final. Kuha realized that in order to reach the world's top he would be forced to leave Finland's winter conditions and conduct his training in warmer climates. He was the first Finnish runner to train in foreign countries, thus becoming a trendsetter for later Finnish runners who had success in the 1970s. In 1967 Kuha improved his Finnish record with a time of 8:29.8 in Stockholm, that season's second best time in the world after Gaston Roelants. In the same year he won the 3000 metres steeplechase at the Universiades in Tokyo. He ranked fifth in Track and Field News' annual world ranking in 1967. He prepared to spend the summer of 1968 training in the village of Penedo in Itatiaia, Brazil. That year, he set a world record on 17 July in Stockholm. His 1000 metres lap time was only 2:51.0, 1500 metres 4:17.2, and 2000 metres 5:43.2. However, Kuha was known for his fast final laps and again he sprinted to a world record time of 8:24.2, over 2 seconds faster than the previous record by Gaston Roelants. Kuha knew that as a sea-level inhabitant he would not succeed at the high altitude of Mexico City and therefore he did not travel to the 1968 Summer Olympics. He ranked tenth in Track and Field News' annual world ranking in 1968. Kuha's top season ended after Achilles tendon surgery in 1969. He still continued his career at the national level and competed at the Finnish Championships in Athletics at the age of 40 in 1980.  Trivia  Kuha's world record was threatened to be disqualified, because competition organizers provided bib numbers with the BP logo, which was against amateur athletic's rules in that era. Kuha did not earn much money during his career. One week after setting the world record, he competed in Joensuu before well over 6000 spectators. Kuha had agreed to a fee the previous spring of 600 Finnish markkas, which corresponds to 824 Euros in 2008 currency. During his career 1958‚Äì95 Kuha ran the 3000 metres steeplechase 170 times. At the age of 41 (1981) he ran with a time of 9:00.61 and at about two months prior to his 50th birthday in 1989, 9:37.79.

It is a popular destination, receiving more than 500,000 visitors annually.  Geography  The Kahler Asten is located in the northwestern part of the Rothaargebirge in the Hochsauerland region, a little southwest of Winterberg between the villages of Altastenberg, Neuastenberg and Lennepl√§tze.  Climate  Climatic diagram - Kahler AstenGeoklima 2.1  Height  Erroneously, the Kahle Asten is often said to be the highest mountain in North Rhine-Westphalia or even sometimes in the whole of northwest Germany, because it is shown on the WDR weather map. In fact the highest peak is the 843.1-metre-high Langenberg on the state border with Hesse;Schluka (2006), p 56. and the nearby summit of the Hegekopf (842.9 m) in Hesse, where the Rothaar Mountains merge into the Upland near Willingen, is even higher. The height of the Kahle Asten on the latest topographical maps is given as 841.9 m, but its height is also recorded on a marker stone at the spot as 842 m. The Kahle Asten is therefore only the third highest mountain in the region, but the most well known by far.  Watershed  View from the Kahle Asten Part of the Rhine-Weser watershed runs over the Kahler Asten, and the Lenne also has its source near the summit. The enclosed spring, which only wells up from time to time, is located at a height of 820 m and is thus the highest river source in northwest Germany. The Lenne flows west into the Ruhr and on into the Rhine. Another stream, the Odeborn, emerges on the southeast slope of the mountain, whilst the Sonneborn rises on the northeast side and flows southeast. These two streams reach the Weser via the Eder and Fulda rivers.  Weather station  There is a permanent German Weather Service weather station on the Kahler Asten which is part of the weather bureau at Essen. It has contributed significantly to the public's awareness of the mountain.  Hochheide  The summit of the Kahler Asten is part of a mountain heath. Because many rare and threatened species live there, it has been placed under conservation protection as part of the Kahler Asten nature reserve and Special Area of Conservation (48.69 ha). Hardly any trees grow on the heath, because the vegetation is kept short by sheep grazing. In places, however, natural reforestation has already taken a strong hold because the grazing is insufficient. Through manual intervention using chain saws and strimmers, attempts are being made to stop this reforestation. The vegetation consists mainly of common heather (Calluna vulgaris), mat-grass and subshrubs. Breeding birds on the heath include the meadow pipit and tree pipit. The black grouse used to breed here, but the population died out decades ago.  Observation tower and hotel-restaurant  Restaurant and observation tower on the Kahle Asten The Asten tower in winter There is an observation tower on the summit of the Kahler Asten immediately next to the hotel-restaurant called the Astenturm (Asten tower). From the platform of the tower, which is , there is a superb all-round view over the Rothaargebirge and other parts of the Sauerland. In very clear weather, even the Brocken mountain in the Harz (Saxony-Anhalt), 163 km away, can be seen without the aid of binoculars. Plans for a monument on the Kahler Asten go back to the Vorm√§rz period in the first half of the 19th century. As early as 1843 King Frederick William IV of Prussia visited the Kahler Asten. At the time it was planned to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the Treaty of Verdun by building an observation tower as a monument. This treaty sealed the division of the Carolingian Empire into three kingdoms: West Francia, East Francia and Lotharingia and was seen as the beginning of the separate development of the French and German nations. During the 1848 year of revolutions the Asten tower was the target of a demonstration for the aims of the March revolution and of German unity. Plans for a monument were not taken any further, however, until 1881. The foundation stone was laid on 22 June 1884 by the district administrator, Federath, in the presence of numerous honoured guests. In the same year the construction of a tower began. The 25-meter-high skeleton fell victim to an autumn storm, however. Rumours of faulty construction could not be proven in the subsequent legal action. By 1889 the district administrator was able to persuade private donors and the Westphalian provincial association to provide the means to rebuild the tower. It was opened in 1895. Since 1900 the tower has been an official monument of the Province of Westphalia. Since 1918 the tower has also been a weather station.Schluka (2006), p. 57. The first renovations were needed in 1923 as a result of weather-induced metal fatigue. At the same time, the restaurant was built. New modification plans were started in 1930 and implemented in 1937. During the Second World War the tower was almost completely destroyed by a direct hit from artillery. The repair of war damage was not completed until 1955. In 1967 the damaged slate sheathing had to be replaced by copper. In 1995 an exhibition room was added. In 2004 ownership of the tower passed to Westphalia-Lippe Property Management, a subsidiary of the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Council (Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe). A thorough renovation and refurbishment was then carried out by December 2005. After its restoration the hotel-restaurant opened its doors again in December 2005 and the Astenturm itself was re-opened on 20 March 2006. It now has a self-service area, a restaurant area and 17 double rooms with 34 beds.  Exhibition on the mountain  Since October 2008 visitors can learn more about the mountain at its summit through an exhibition called the Kahler Asten - the roof of Westphalia. The central themes of the exhibition are the nature reserve with its mountain heath, the weather station and the history of the Asten tower. In addition clips of amateur film from past decades are shown.  Winter sport  The Kahler Asten and the surrounding area, with its sister mountains, out to about 40 kilometres is one of the most well-known winter sport regions in the German Central Uplands due to its good snow conditions. The Kahler Asten itself is part of the ski lift complex known as the Skiliftkarussell Winterberg.

Nicholson served as a Conservative and Unionist member of the House of Commons of Canada. He was born in Crapaud, Prince Edward Island and became a lumber merchant. Nicholson attended public and grammar schools at Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. In 1884, he joined the Canadian Pacific Railway for construction work, remaining in that job until 1901. Nicholson was established in northern Ontario by the end of the 19th century. In business, he was part of the lumber firm Austin and Nicholson and became president and secretary-treasurer of the McNaught Lumber company. Nicholson was also a director of the Excelsior Life Insurance company. He was first elected to Parliament as a supporter of Sir Robert Borden's wartime Union Government in Algoma East riding during the 1917 general election. After serving one term, he was a Conservative candidate in the 1921 election but was defeated by John Carruthers of the Liberals. Nicholson returned to the House of Commons when he defeated Carruthers in the 1925 election. After another term in Parliament, Nicholson again lost his Algoma East seat to Beniah Bowman of the United Farmers of Ontario in the 1926 election. Nicholson won the seat back again in the 1930 federal election by defeating Bowman who by that time became a Liberal candidate. Nicholson was at his old Chapleau residence when he sustained a stroke. He was admitted to Toronto General Hospital where he died the following day, on 1 January 1935, before the end of his term in the 17th Canadian Parliament.

It is located in the highlands of the Chiriqu√≠ Province of Western Panama at 1200 meters above sea level. It is several kilometers west of the modern town of Volc√°n. This places the site in the Gran Chiriqu√≠ culture area (encompassing Western Panama and much of Southern Costa Rica, parts of the even broader Intermediate Area or Isthmo- Colombian Area). The site was originally named for several small stone barrels found in the area, although these have also been found elsewhere in the R√≠o Chiriqu√≠ Viejo valley and in Costa Rica. This area has a cool, spring-like climate with a pronounced rainy season between May and November, and a dry but windy season the rest of the year. The region lies on the western flanks of Volc√°n Bar√∫, a dormant volcano and the highest mountain in Panama. Like El Ca√±o in Central Panama or Panam√° Viejo in Panama City, Barriles is one of the few archaeological sites in Panama regularly accessible to the public. The northwestern portion of the site is accessible to the public through the Landau finca (which is a private property), who have a variety of artifacts on display in their yard, in the walls of a fake excavation block, and in a small private museum. Not all of the artifacts on display were found on-site. The family offers guided tours of the collections and their gardens in both Spanish and English. Donations are greatly appreciated. The site is believed to have once been a socioceremonial center with a substantial residential population between 500-1000 individuals.(Palumbo 2009) It contains a small mound which was once associated with a row of 14 statues. Ten of these depicted solitary individuals, while four included one individual- often chubbier, taller, wearing a conical hat and ornaments- riding atop the shoulders of a naked man, though some of these individuals also wore conical hats.(Vidal Friatts 1993) Many scholars have interpreted these double individual statues as evidence for the existence of higher and lower status social groups within Barriles. A large metate (grinding stone) whose border was adorned by tiny stone heads has also been interpreted as evidence for violence or human sacrifice in the past.(Graham 1996) Many of the statues and the metate are on currently display in the Museo Antropol√≥gico Reina Torres de Ara√∫z in Panama City. Chronology Barriles was largely occupied during the Aguas Buenas Period (A.D. 300-900) (see (Haberland 1955>(Hoopes 1996)), known locally as the Bugaba Period. Nine radiocarbon dates have been taken from Barriles, six of them clustering between A.D. 500-800 (or the Late Bugaba Phase). Pottery from this period was generally unpainted and occasionally included engraved, incised and appliqu√© decorations. Stone artifacts, including small chips created from the manufacture of stone tools (i.e. blades, axes, and metates), were generally made from andesite, basalt, rhyolite, and chert. Organic materials, like plant fibers and animal bones, have not preserved well in the acidic soils. The Aguas Buenas Period was preceded by the Tropical Forest Archaic (4600-2300 B.C.), which is known from rockshelter sites found outside of the valley.(Ranere 1980) The Concepci√≥n Phase (roughly 300 BC to AD 400) was associated with the earliest ceramic using populations in the area,(Shelton 1984) and evidence suggests that populations were low and spatially dispersed, though more sites are known from lower elevations. The Aguas Buenas Period was associated with the development of settlement system containing large villages and small farmsteads. The subsequent Chiriqu√≠ Phases (AD 900-1500) witnessed the dissolution of the previous villages, and populations returned to ephemeral and spatially dispersed patterns.(Palumbo 2009) This suggests that major population reorganization during the sequence may have been associated with the political and ceremonial rise and decline of Barriles. A hypothetical AD 600 eruption of nearby Volc√°n Baru was thought to have devastated other archaeological settlements upstream from Barriles, prompting a movement into, and subsequent colonization of, the Caribbean watershed.(Linares 1977)(Linares 1980) Recent geological and archaeological work has seriously questioned the veracity of the AD 600 eruption, and evidence now points toward a much later eruption event, possibly around AD 1400.(Behling 2000)(Clement and Horn 2001)(Holmberg 2009)(Sherrod et al. 2007) Recent archaeological work in the Caribbean watershed has also raised the possibility of earlier and denser populations than previously believed.(Griggs 2005)(Wake 2006)(Wake et al. 2004) History of research Barriles was the subject of early archaeological investigations by Dr. Matthew Stirling (the late 1940s),(Stirling 1950) who did not publish extensively on his findings. Stirling was the archaeologist who recovered fragments of the Barriles statues and the large metate. Alain Ichon and Wolfgang Haberland (1950s and 1960s) were interested in studying the ceramics from Barriles, and collected samples from a few small excavations. In the early 1970s, in the region (and other areas in Western Panama) became the focus of the multi-year Adaptive Radiations project led by the Panamanian archaeologist Dr. Olga Linares.(Linares and Ranere, eds. 1980) The project involved several influential figures in modern Central American archaeology, including Dr. Richard Cooke, Dr. Anthony Ranere, and Dr. Payson Sheets. This project surveyed a portion of the R√≠o Chiriqu√≠ Viejo valley and identified dozens of sites. They concluded that the R√≠o Chiriqu√≠ Viejo was once home to substantial and complexly populations supported by maize agriculture. According to them, this was not as easily possible in the neighboring Caribbean lowlands, which did not exhibit the same complex social organization as the mountains. The accuracy and implications of last point has become the subject of considerable debate. Some collections of ceramics and lithics from this project are housed in Temple University. The site was then briefly revisited by Dr. Catherine Shelton in the 1980s, but the majority of her work dealt with sites at lower elevations. The Argentinian scholar Dr. Vidal Fraitts studied the Barriles statues during the 1990s, but did not conduct new fieldwork at the site. The first decade of the 21st century has witnessed renewed interest in the site. A German-Panamanian team of archaeologists excavated the remains of a structure in 2001, which suggested to them that Barriles was probably a village rather than an empty ceremonial center or cemetery.(Beilke-Voigt 2002) This large excavation block has been left open for tourists to visit today. Dr. Karen Holmberg (Brown University) sampled volcanic stata from this excavation,(Holmberg 2009) though much of her work was ultimately conducted near the modern towns of Boquete and Caldera on the other side of the volcano. Dr. Scott Palumbo (College of Lake County) recently conducted the most extensive work at the site by sampling different domestic sectors with hundreds of small excavations.(Palumbo 2009) His work suggested that Barriles contained a far denser residential population compared to other sites in the region, and that the activities which drew people to the village were likely ceremonial feasts, perhaps associated with funerary rituals. Differences between social ranks, however, was subtle and not nearly as clear as the distinctions supposedly advertised in the double individual statues. Myths and Misconceptions Because Barriles has received relatively little archaeological attention compared to flashier sites in Mesoamerica or Peru, it has become the subject of considerable rumor and speculation. One of the more popular rumors is that Barriles was settled by two populations, one of African descent and another of Asian descent (not completely unlike modern Panama). Proponents of this theory point to the supposed ethnic characteristics they claim to see on the Barriles statues. There are three reasons to doubt this possibility. The first is the ceramic styles and patterns of domestic organization studied at Barriles have identifiable and direct antecedents in the previous Concepci√≥n Phase, rather than representing an intrusive complex of artifacts introduced from elsewhere. The second reason to doubt this theory is that the statues themselves appear quite stylized, suggesting that certain physical features (like perfectly squared shoulders) may have been part of the ancient artistic canon of the sculptors, rather than an accurate copy of actual physical characteristics. The final reason is that some of the statues' faces have been interpreted as reflecting possibly mutilated individuals(Vidal Friatts 1994) Pointing to poorly demonstrated trans-oceanic contacts is an example of a hyper-diffusionist theory. Such theories often do not give proper credit to descendant indigenous groups for their ancient cultural achievements, a practice which may be interpreted as implicitly racist and colonial. Another common myth is that the Barriles population was conquered by Mayan groups from Mesoamerica (Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, parts of Honduras and El Salvador). Part of this theory is based on the presence of painted, polychrome ceramics from the end of the sequence. These exact ceramics are commonly associated with the later Chiriqu√≠ (or Boruca) Period and have been extensively described by neighboring Costa Rican archaeologists. There is no evidence for Maya contact or occupation that has been accepted by professional archaeologists. Anthropological significance According to some, Barriles is believed to have been the seat of a small regional polity of settlements linked by ceremonial ties, warfare, and the production or exchange of polished stone axes, used for forest clearing and woodworking activities. The possible connection of political or religious organization to different degrees or forms of social inequality has been the subject of a recent investigation.(Palumbo 2009) Changes in social organization, especially those associated with the early development and persistence of political hierarchies or social inequalities, are of theoretical interest to many anthropological archaeologists who seek to understand these important shifts in human history. This is one of the reasons why Barriles has a theoretical importance that transcends Central American archaeology. Barriles also plays an important role in discussions of a Macro-Chibchan identity, based on genetic, linguistic and archaeological studies from elsewhere in Central America. The individuals wearing conical hats in the statues may be possibly associated with a shamanistic religious tradition.(Hoopes 2005) However, studies of Macro- Chibchan identity have been largely based on qualities between trade items which are hypothesized to have bound different Chibchan-speaking groups into a similar religious tradition, items which are entirely absent at Barriles. This observation, however, is based largely on collections of ancient domestic trash, not the systematic excavation of tombs where valued items may have been consumed as grave goods.

Background He was the second, but oldest surviving son of Sir Randal Beresford, 2nd Baronet and his wife Catherine Annesley, daughter of Francis Annesley, 1st Viscount Valentia and his second wife Jane Stanhope. In 1681, he succeeded his father as baronet. Career Commanding a Protestant regiment, Beresford was attained by King James II of England in May 1689. However he was acquitted after the Glorious Revolution. He entered the Irish House of Commons in 1692, sitting for Londonderry County until 1699. Family and death In February 1687, he married Nichola Sophia Hamilton, youngest daughter of Hugh Hamilton, 1st Viscount of Glenawly, who spent most of his career in the Swedish army, and his second wife Susanna Balfour, and had by her four daughters and a son. His wife grew up with John Power, 2rd Earl of Tyrone and according to a family legend they both agreed in their childhood, that whoever should die at first, should try to return and report to the other about the afterlife. In October 1693, Nichola wore one morning a black ribbon and after a request by her husband, declared that her friend had died. Shortly thereafter a letter from the earl's steward arrived, confirming her assertion. She also predicted Beresford the birth of his son and when in 1713, a clergyman presented her documents, which changed her age to forty- seven, she announced her oncoming death. Nichola told a female friend, that in the night after the earl's death, his ghost had manifested and had given her information about her future life. As a proof, that it had been no dream, a black mark then appeared at her wrist, which she later covered with a ribbon. Following this explanation Nichola expired in the presence of her friend. Beresford himself died in 1701 and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Marcus, later raised to the Peerage of Ireland by the title Earl of Tyrone. Nichola remarried General Richard Gorges of Kilbrew, County Meath, and had a further six children. Despite the romantic family legend, her death in 1713 was probably in childbirth with her youngest daughter Lucy, who married firstly William St Lawrence, 14th Baron Howth, by whom she had several children, and secondly Nicholas Weldon.

Established as a wartime Emergency Hospital Service facility, it became a District General Hospital. Since 2005 it has been the site of the Scottish Regional Treatment Centre. History The hospital was designed as one of seven Emergency Hospital Service facilities for military casualties and established in the grounds of Stracathro House in 1939, early in the Second World War. The single-storey wards could accommodate up to 1,000 patients and the mansion house provided accommodation for staff. The first patients were victims of an air raid on Montrose in 1940. These were followed by civilian casualties from English cities, including London, Birmingham and Coventry, and later by soldiers from all theatres of the war. Long trains would deliver the wounded to Brechin station. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948 and later developed as a rural general hospital, serving a local population of about 110,000. In 1998, almost overnight, emergency general surgery was moved to Ninewells Hospital. This threatened the future of the hospital, and led to speculation that it might close. The speculation increased when the Tayside Acute Services Review, carried out in 2001, recommended a completely new hospital in Angus and the closure of the coronary care unit later that year led to a paramedic-led thrombolysis service in the community. In 2005, the Scottish Regional Treatment Centre was developed at Stracathro. This was a joint venture between the NHS and the private sector and included ¬£15 million funding from the Scottish Executive. The SRTC caters for NHS patients from Grampian, Tayside and Fife Health Boards. Amicus Health, a subsidiary of General Healthcare Group, the UK's largest private hospital group, was awarded a contract to deliver 8,000 episodes of elective surgery in orthopaedics, urology, general surgery and gastroenterology at Stracathro Hospital from 2006. The Susan Carnegie Centre, which houses three inpatient mental health units and a mental health day unit, opened in December 2011.

It is administered by Intellectual Property Policy Unit of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.  Scope of copyright  Copyright law grants the owner of the copyright exclusive rights to certain restricted acts, which include the following. * copying the work * publishing, issuing or selling copies to the public * performing, playing or showing the work in public * broadcasting the work * making any work derived or adapted from the copyright work.  Copyright works  Copyright automatically applies (no registration required) to original works in the following categories. * Literary works (novels, poems, song lyrics, computer programmes, compilations of data) * Dramatic works (scripts for films or plays) * Artistic works (paintings, plans, maps, photographs, sculptures, models, buildings) * Musical works (scores and arrangements) * Sound recordings (of musical, literary or dramatic works) * Films * Broadcasts (radio, TV, cable) * Typographical arrangement of published editions (this exists independent of copyright in the published work, if any). Copyright does not apply to certain government works, such as Acts of Parliament, Regulations, Parliamentary debates, Court judgements and reports of Select Committees, Royal Commissions, Commissions of Inquiry, etc.  Copyright term  The copyright term is largely consistent with other countries, although it has not increased from 50 to 70 years as in Europe and the United States, and varies with the category of the work. * Literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works; 50 years from the death of the author * Artistic works industrially applied; 16 years from when the work is applied * Artistic craftsmanship industrially applied; 25 years from when the work is applied * Sound recordings and films; 50 years from when it is available to the public * Broadcasts and cable; 50 years from broadcast * Typographical arrangements; 25 years from first publishing. * Computer-generated works; 50 years after being made. * Crown copyright: 100 years  Exclusions and fair dealing  The Act allows for certain permitted acts to be exempted from copyright restrictions. * Fair dealing; for purpose of criticism, review, news reporting, research, private study. * certain educational purposes * time shifting of TV programmes for viewing at a later time * format shifting of music * back up of computer programmes * making copies in Braille.  Moral rights  The copyright act also provides moral rights for the author. These attach to the author, and are not transferred by contract as economic rights can be. Moral rights give the author the right; * to be identified as the author (right of attribution) * to object to derogatory treatment of the work (right of integrity) * to not have work falsely attributed to them.  New technologies amendments  In 2001, the MED initiated a major review of copyright law, in light of new technologies, such as media in digital form and communications via the internet. Law changes were enacted in 2008, most notably the Copyright (New Technologies) Amendment Act. These changes were influenced by media corporations and aligned organisations (RIANZ, APRA, Artists Alliance, NZSA, AIPA, NZIPP, etc.) but opposed by New Zealand artists, technology specialists, ISPs, businesses, media commentators, librarians and members of the public. The nature of the law changes attracted attention internationally. The New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key, stated that the stronger copyright laws, including the controversial section 92a, were required for New Zealand to be able to negotiate a free trade agreement with America. In February 2010, a Bill repealing s92a was introduced to parliament, replacing it with a three notice regime for copyright infringement via file sharing. The bill also provides for the Copyright Tribunal to hear complaints and award penalties of up to $15,000. The notice regime took effect on 1 September 2011.

Cole (from Frederick, Maryland). There are also references to it being designated as Cole's 1st Volunteer Maryland Cavalry. The unit, a battalion, originally consisted of four companies, A, B, C & D and was initially enlisted between August 10 and November 27, 1861. Organization and History Company A was made-up of men mostly from Frederick, Maryland and the surrounding area and was initially commanded by Cole; B was recruited from the western part of Maryland (Hagerstown, Clear Spring, Cumberland, etc.) and was commanded by Capt. William Firey; C was recruited primarily from Emmitsburg, Maryland and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and was commanded by Capt. John Horner; and D was made-up of men mostly from Baltimore City and Howard County, Maryland, and was commanded by Capt. Pearce K. Curll. Company B served, through March 1863, independent of the battalion, mostly in West Virginia, western Maryland, and the northern part of the Shenandoah Valley. The company was present in action as South Branch Bridge, West Virginia (October 26, 1861) and at the Battle of Kernstown (March 22, 1862), and spent much of 1862 in the area of Romney, West Virginia, on duty as a scouting force. They were in action again at Grass Lick, West Virginia, on April 23, 1862, and at Wardensville, West Virginia, on May 7, 1862. The company regularly served along with Colonel Andrew Thomas McReynolds‚Äô Cavalry [the 1st New York \\"Lincoln\\" Cavalry]. It joined General Jacob Dolson Cox‚Äôs Brigade in pursuit of J.E.B. Stuart, during his October 1862 raid into Pennsylvania. For the balance of the year, through early 1863, the company operated along the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and around Martinsburg, West Virginia. Companies A, C, and D of the battalion served initially as an unattached unit of the Dept. of West Virginia, to January, 1862, and were later in the service of Frederick W. Lander's Division. The list of engagements for these three companies is extensive and includes, Hancock, Md. (January 5‚Äì6, 1862), Bloomery Gap (February 14, 1862), the advance on Winchester (March 2‚Äì12), Martinsburg, West Virginia (March 3, 1862), Bunker Hill (this was just Co.

(April 1), and Charles Town, West Virginia (May 28). On paper, the companies were consolidated into a Battalion on August 1, 1862, and designated as Cole's Battalion, Potomac Home Brigade Cavalry, Capt. Henry Cole receiving the rank of major. At that time, with Cole's promotion, Lt. George W.F. Vernon was raised to command of Company A, with the rank of captain. Despite the consolidation, Company B continued to operate independently of the battalion through March 1863. Meanwhile, Cole's Battalion continued to see regular and active service, participating in action at the Battle of Mile Hill, Leesburg, Va., September 2, 1862; Edwards' Ferry, Md., September 4; Monocacy Creek September 4; Reconnaissance to Lovettsville September 4; Maryland Heights and siege of Harper's Ferry, West Virginia September 12‚Äì14 (when the battalion led the way in cutting through enemy lines and evading capture). During the escape from Harpers Ferry, Cole's Battalion encountered and captured Confederate Gen. James Longstreet's ammunition train at Sharpsburg, Maryland, on September 15. The battalion participated in harassing Gen. J.E.B. Stuart in his raid into Pennsylvania and engaged portions of the Confederate cavalry force at Hyattstown, Md. on October 12. After that, the battalion saw action at Charles Town, November 14; Berryville, December 1; Charles Town, December 2; Winchester, December 5; Halltown, December 20. After Company B rejoined the battalion on March 21, 1863, at Kearneysville, West Virginia, the battalion, for the first time a complete force, participated later that spring at Charles Town, May 16; Berryville, June 13; Martinsburg, June 14; Winchester, June 15 (Co.

The list of actions continues with Catoctin Mountain, September 14; Loudoun Valley, Va., September 25; Loudoun Valley and Summit Point, October 7; Charles Town, October 7 (Co. B); Snickersville, Leesburg, Rector's Cross Roads and Bloomfield, September 14; Upperville, September 25; Berryville, October 18; near Annandale, October 22; expedition from Charles Town to New Market, November 15‚Äì18; Mt. Jackson, November 16; Ashby's Gap, November; Upperville, December 10; Edinburg, December 17; New Market, December 18; Harrisonburg and Staunton, December 21. In 1864, action against John S. Mosby's Rangers continued, the battalion engaging them at Rectortown, January 1, 1864. In the dark morning hours and freezing cold temperatures of January 10, 1864, Mosby attempted to make an attack upon the camp of Cole's Battalion at the Battle of Loudoun Heights and was soundly defeated in the effort. Following this action, the battalion was engaged at Romney, Moorefield, and Mechanicsville Gap, February 4. On February 13, 1864, many members of the battalion reenlisted prior to going into action again at Upperville/Blackley's Grove on February 20. The battalion was increased to a full regiment with the action of eight new companies, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, and M. Organized at Baltimore and Frederick from February 9 to April 23, 1864, elements of the new regiment participated in Gen. Franz Sigel's expedition from Martinsburg, W.

Released by Modern Records, it was his first single and the most successful of his three chart entries. \\"Blues After Hours\\" went to the number one spot on the Billboard magazine's Race Records charts. According to Crayton, \\"Blues After Hours\\" was inspired by T-Bone Walker and developed while he was playing at the New Orleans Swing Club in San Francisco. During his first recording session for Jules Bihari, Crayton began to play the song and Bihari decided to record it. Crayton protested, saying that the song was unfinished. Bihari countered: \\"Play anything.\\" \\"So I started playing and ideas just came. I was making T-Bone's stuff into what little I knew. That turned out to be one of the biggest records I ever had.\\" Backing Crayton on guitar are: Buddy Floyd on tenor saxophone, David Lee Johnson on piano, Bill Davis on bass, Candy Johnson on drums, plus additional unidentified musicians. Billy Vera calls \\"Blues After Hours\\" \\"a barely disguised takeoff on 'After Hours'\\", a 1940 instrumental by Erskine Hawkins and His Orchestra (Bluebird 10879), although Crayton's song features electric guitar, whereas the earlier song does not.
