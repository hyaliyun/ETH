The Panic of 1857, an economic depression, resulted after the company's New York City offices ceased operations due to bad investments, especially in agriculture-related businesses. During the Crimean War (1853-1856), much of Europe's farm labor was engaged in the military, resulting in Europe becoming dependent on American crops for food. At the conclusion of the war, European farm production resumed and American agricultural exports declined, causing a drop in value of American foodstuffs. Because of the telegraph, word of the office closure spread quickly and many investors, already shaky over declining markets, caused a financial panic. The markets would not recover until two years later. Due to the economic decline from failure of the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company, the railroad industry and many businesses experienced declining demand for their products. Railroad workers were laid off and many businesses were shut down. Embezzlement by employees and officers of the company is sometimes mentioned as another contributing cause of the office's closure.

Pioneers in the South American hardcore scene.  History  Formed by the two brothers Ra√∫l and Ignacio Jim√©nez, Mitchel Aedo and Andr√©s Urzua, Asunto is a process creation that starts to show his results at the beginning of 1995 and 1996. The main idea was to show another alternative to everything that was known at that time, giving and showing a new way to be and live against the capitalism, trying to give a coherent and drug-free message, with a vegan straight edge attitude. Talking about Asunto is not only to talk about a hardcore straight edge band; it's also to talk about the beginning and the history of straight edge in Chile. In 1997, they recorded their first demo-tape totally auto produced, and it's distributed at their shows. That same year they were invited to play in Buenos Aires (Argentina), to play in the South American Animal Liberation Fest, where they played with other South American bands. While in Chile, little by little, it became to birth and built a hardcore straight edge scene. In February 1998, they recorded their first album called No Te Dejes Derrotar with a fusion of old and new school hardcore sounds. After this, they continued playing weekly in a strong growth scene. In the month of July, they played at Mendoza (Argentina). In 1999, Asunto recorded their new EP called Renacer at the HYT studios with the engineer Carlos Torres, and was masterized in France by Sebastian Lhoro and David Mancilla (Stormcore, Overcome Records). The album Renacer, with a new school metalcore sound, was a classic element at that time to the Latin-American hardcore, and transformed as an inspiration to a hundreds of bands around the world. That same year Asunto played at Concepcion (south of Chile), and also in Buenos Aires (Argentina) again. Parallel that same year Ra√∫l, Ignacio and Mitchel formed the band called XCUESTION DE RESPETOX, with Gonzalo Jim√©nez, Gonzalo Ter√°n and Paulo Cornejo. In 2000, Asunto started to play regularly at live shows and also started to edit compilatory material. At that time they came through a lot of changes in their initial band members and that's when Andr√©s (bass) leaves the band by personal choice and Paulo of XCUESTION DE RESPETOX took his place in Asunto. In January 2001, Renacer was edited in CD format by 78 Life Records from Brazil. The album contained three unpublished songs: Tristeza 2000, Perseverancia and Mi Convicci√≥n. In the beginning of 2002, Mitchel leaves Asunto, and Ra√∫l Santana took his place. With this new formation they recorded a new album called Confrontaci√≥n which was their consolidation in the metalcore sound scene. Because of some external issues the album was edited in the beginning of the year 2003 by Survival Records from Chile. Not so much time after that Mitchel came back to Asunto as a band member. In the summer of 2003, Asunto played in S√£o Paulo at The South American Hardcore Fest (Verdurada), with some auxiliary band members because some of their original could not travel to Brazil. Ra√∫l Santana leaves the band by personal issues and Frank Millard took his place in the band. In 2004, they played at hundreds of shows around the country. On December 13 the album Cuando Las Sutilezas Mueren was edited by En Tus Venas Records. This last album was the consolidation of Asunto in the international scene and also a renew sound for Chilean bands, fusing melodic death metal and hardcore. In 2005, Frank leaves Asunto, and that's when Rodrigo Godoy took his place. In the middle of this year Asunto made a European Tour in fourteen countries, playing at twenty-five shows. Also took his final place in the Chilean musical scene, taking out of the underground the hardcore scene and promoting metalcore sound and the vegan straight edge movement. That year they made massive shows for over thousands people, playing with bands from other musical scenes. In 2006, the compilatory album El Fuego Sigue Ardiendo was edited in M√©xico by Decision Personal Records. Thanks to the support that the record gave to them Asunto played in countries all over South America like M√©xico, Colombia and Per√∫ to name a few. That same year they started to make and record new songs. In 2007, Mitchel leaves the band and Frank came back to Asunto. With these current members they had a new tour in M√©xico. Their album Afirmaci√≥n De Vida was edited at the same time by En Tus Venas Records (Chile), Decision Personal Records (M√©xico), Por Tu Capricho Mueren Records (M√©xico), Sin Fronteras Records (Colombia), and Dignify Records (Argentina). Asunto received the award to The Animalist Band of the Year by the two Chilean organizations: Actitud Animal and Federaci√≥n Chilena de Instituciones de Protecci√≥n Animal (Chilean Federation of Animal Protection Institutions). In the present 2008, Asunto is waiting the edition of their new album Afirmaci√≥n De Vida by labels from USA, Europe, Brazil, and Hong Kong. The band has also started the making process of their new material for their new album that will come alive at the end of this year. With five albums, thousands of shows of experience, international tours and a hundred per cent to give in every show, the band is still on top, being loyal to his audience year after year, captivating new followers at every show.

For the 16th Century engineer, see Adam de Craponne. Craponne is a commune in the Metropolis of Lyon in the Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes region in eastern France.  History  The name of the commune derives from crappe, which means quagmire in Old French. From 1800 to 1960, Craponne was the capital of the launderers of Lyon. The museum of the Craponne Laundry (opened in 2004) traces the history of launderers, washerwomen and ironers, from washing in the river Yzeron to the modern industrial laundry. The commune of Craponne was founded on 15 February 1836 when it separated from the mother-commune of Gr√©zieu-la-Varenne. The first mayor, Fran√ßois Boirivent, was appointed on 8 May 1837 and a town hall and a school were opened. According to the first census in 1833, which was made especially to prepare for the separation, Craponne had only 874 inhabitants. On the first map established during this separation, the buildings are shown as sparse, with less than 150 houses or farms built on the 464 hectares of the town. Fifty years later, in 1886, the population of Craponne had doubled to nearly 1900 inhabitants. This increase was due to the boom in laundry, the proximity of the commune to Lyon, and the opening in 1886 of the railway linking Lyon St-Just to Vaugneray which crossed Craponne. Craponne was a member of the intercommunal structure surrounding the city of Lyon, known as Greater Lyon (Grand Lyon). This structure was replaced on 1 January 2015, and so Craponne is now part of the new territorial collectivity of the Lyon Metropolis.  Places and Monuments  Two pillars from the Roman Aqueduct of Yzeron, sometimes called the Craponne Aqueduct, remain standing and these are listed as an historical monument. The aqueduct was one of the four ancient aqueducts of Lyon, serving the ancient Roman city of Lugdunum. It owes its name to the fact that it draws water from the watershed of the Yzeron river, which is a tributary of the Rh√¥ne.

Description =Background= By 1943, it was becoming obvious to the German army that conventional anti-tank gun design had reached its practical limits. Traditional high-velocity guns that relied on kinetic energy to defeat heavily armored targets were becoming so bulky in order to deal with the new generation of tanks that they were becoming too heavy for front line use, and too expensive to produce. =Rheinmetall= Rheinmetall Borsig proposed a new medium velocity gun with a smoothbore barrel that relied on hollow charge ammunition to defeat tanks. The design used the High-Low Pressure principle where the high pressures generated by the propellant did not act directly on the projectile but instead seeped into the main chamber at a controlled rate. This allowed a very simple light-weight barrel with a conventional heavy breech. A simple light-weight carriage was designed for the weapon. The resulting 8 cm PAW 600 (8H63) gun fired a warhead based on the 8.1 cm mortar hollow charge bomb that could penetrate 140mm of armor plate to a maximum effective range of 750 meters. Some 260 pieces were produced between December 1944 and the end of the war. =Krupp= Meanwhile, Krupp was developing a 10 cm design known as the 10 cm PAW 1000 or 10H64, although by the end of the war they had produced only prototypes. Its shaped charge shell weighed 6.6 kg and with an effective range of 1,000 meters was able to penetrate 200 mm steel at 60¬∞ (note that this is most likely the degree system, which means that the armor is at 60¬∞ from the vertical to the flight path. The effect of angling like this is rather small, whereas 60¬∞ angling by the other definition (60¬∞ angle to the flight path) has about a doubling effect on the effective armor thickness). =Steel quality= The steel quality used for such measurements in World War II is also not necessarily identical to RHA (Rolled homogenous armor), as it is used to measure the armor penetration capability of post- World War II munitions. A ratio of 2 between caliber and penetration was good by World War II standards and is explained by the late design and lack of penetration degrading spin (the 10H64 had a smoothbore barrel and fin stabilized shells). 200mm penetration would have been enough to defeat all existing tanks of World War II unless the angle of impact prevented proper fusing. =Caliber and gun carriage= The exact caliber is somewhat uncertain. Officially, it was 10 cm, but in the German designation system this typically meant 10.5 cm (105mm). The basis for the caliber and ammunition would likely have been the 10 cm Nebelwerfer 35, a mortar of 105mm caliber used in small numbers by mountain troops. The gun carriage for the prototypes was that of the 5 cm Pak 38 or the Sonderlafette V1. Both were only waist-high and would have easily been sited and camouflaged well within their maximum effective range. Conclusion The PAW was a very special development that enabled low-cost guns on old carriages to defeat the most modern tanks of World War II. Its maximum effective range was surpassed by classic anti-tank guns due to its rather low muzzle velocity, but the non-spinning shaped-charge shells offered effective anti-tank capability at ranges that exceeded the envelope of portable weapons. Nomenclature changes In 1944-45, the Germans changed their system of artillery designations from the old \\"year\\" system. Each weapon was to have a number showing its caliber group, a letter denoting the ammunition group, and the last two digits were from the weapon drawing number. In this case, 10 denoted 100 mm caliber using the H group of ammunition. References * Gander, Terry and Chamberlain, Peter.

He graduated from Bakersfield College in 1967 with an Associate's degree, then graduated with a Bachelor's degree in English from Whittier College two years later. After graduating with a Master's degree in English from the University of California, Riverside in 1973, Collings received his Ph.D. in English literature from UCR in 1977, specializing in Milton and The Renaissance. Before he began teaching creative writing and literature at Pepperdine University, Collings taught at UCR, San Bernardino Valley Community College, and UCLA. He taught at Pepperdine from 1979 until 2010, when he retired. He now lives in Idaho with his wife, Judi. His son, Michaelbrent Collings, is a fantasy and horror writer. Collings was introduced to Stephen King's work by a student, David A. Engebretson, in 1983, and published his first book on him, The Many Facets of Stephen King, in 1985; reading King led to his also studying and publishing on Koontz and Robert McCammon. The World Horror Convention awarded him their Grand Master Award in 2016. Selected bibliography =Articles and papers= *\\"C. S.

Life He was baptized 27 August 1634 in Danzig, then a semi-autonomous city (granted by the Danzig law) within Polish Prussia (Prusy Kr√≥lewskie) and a member of the Hanseatic League. His parents were English and Scottish, probably merchants or refugees. The young David first studied in Danzig under Willem Hondius, and later in Amsterdam under Crispijn van de Passe II. He moved to London in the late 1650s. There he produced various engravings, among them the title-page for the folio Book of Common Prayer (1662). In addition, he also did a number of miniature portraits as plumbago drawings. He married in 1663, and in 1665 they moved from London to Nuffield, Oxfordshire, to avoid the Great Plague epidemic. In 1669, Loggan was appointed 'public sculptor' to the University of Oxford. Then he proceeded to draw and engrave all the Oxford colleges in bird's-eye views. His folio Oxonia illustrata was published in 1675. In 1675 Loggan was naturalised as an English citizen. That year he once again settled in London, living in Leicester Fields, where he let rooms to aristocratic patrons and acted as their agent in the acquisition of works of art. From 1676 he was involved in preparing the new folio Cantabrigia illustrata, which was eventually published in 1690. In that year he was made engraver to Cambridge University.

Resourceful and clever, Livens‚Äô successful creations were characterised by being very practical and easy to produce in large numbers. In an obituary, Sir Harold Hartley said \\"Livens combined great energy and enterprise with a flair for seeing simple solutions and inventive genius.\\" Livens is best known for inventing the Livens Projector, a simple mortar-like weapon that could throw large drums filled with inflammable or toxic chemicals. In World War I, the Livens Projector became the standard means of delivering gas attacks and it remained in the arsenal of the British army until the early years of the Second World War.The Use Of Gas In The Field, 1940  Early life  Livens' parents were Frederick Howard Livens (1854‚Äì1948) and Priscilla Abbott. They married on 9 October 1886 at the Upton Congregational Church. Frederick Howard Livens was Chief Engineer and later Chairman of Ruston and Hornsby in Lincoln. Frederick and Priscilla had three children, William Howard and two younger daughters. In 1903, Livens was sent to Oundle School, a famous public school located in the ancient market town of Oundle in Northamptonshire, England. While there, he enrolled in the Officer Training Corps (OTC) wherein he served with the rank of sergeant.Application for commission On leaving school in 1908, Livens went to Christ's College at the University of Cambridge from 1908 to October 1911. There he enrolled in the college OTC and served with the rank of private. He was captain of the Cambridge rifle team, he was a crack shot and made a record score in a competition with a team from Oxford University; he was also an excellent shot with a pistol.Obituary, by Dr Edward Hindle. The Times newspaper, 5 February 1964 p.15 column C. Livens trained as civil engineer, and was for a while an assistant editor for Country Life magazine. But, when the First World War started, he joined the British Army.  World War I  Photograph showing Livens with the components of Livens Projector Troops loading Livens Projectors Simplified diagram showing typical layout of Livens Projector embedded in the ground at an angle of 45¬∞, with gas drum loaded ready for firing. The thin electric leads run from the fuse in the base of the tube, up the inside of the tube and from the barrel mouth to an electric generator. When the generator plunger is depressed the electric current sparks the fuse in the base of the tube, which ignites the propellant charge and the expanding gas pressure launches the bomb out of the tube. =Entry into service= On 4 August 1914, on graduating from the Officer Training Corps, Livens applied for a commission in the Royal Engineers. He was enrolled as a Second Lieutenant on 30 September 1914 and he was given a clerical post in the Motorcycle signalling section at Chatham. Livens' experience of the OTC and his enthusiasm for target shooting prepared him well for at least some aspects of Army life: =Weapons designs= Beginnings Army life did not suppress Livens' creativity and he turned his mind to the problem of making better weapons. On his own initiative, he fitted out makeshift laboratories at his Chatham barracks bedroom and in the officers' garage. For a firing range he used vacant land near one of the old forts which overlooked the Thames estuary. Here he worked on developing flame throwers and small mortars to throw oil and gas.Awards to Inventors, 1922, p. 5 Livens' inventive work was prompted by thoughts of revenge for perceived German atrocities. According to Simon Jones' book World War I Gas Warfare Tactics and Equipment, on learning of the sinking of the luxury liner RMS Lusitania in May 1915 with loss of 1,100 lives including, apparently, his wife, he vowed to kill an equal number of Germans. It was to this end that he began experimenting with gas and flame projectors of various types and continued in his work even after hearing that his wife had not, after all, been on board the Lusitania. This account cannot be literally true because Livens did not get married until 1916. Charles Foulkes, who became Livens' commanding officer and who later wrote Gas! The Story of the Special Brigade, mentions \\"a strong personal feeling\\" connected with the sinking of the Lusitania without being more specific. According to Who's Who in World War One by John Bourne, it was the first use of poison gas by the Germans at the Second Battle of Ypres on 22 April 1915 that prompted Livens' vengeful ambitions. This alternative account is consistent with Livens' later statement that he began his experimental work at the end of April 1915. Special Gas Companies Late in August 1915, Livens left Chatham to join one of the newly formed Royal Engineer Special Gas Companies where he was one of very few officers to have a background in engineering rather than chemistry. At the time, gas warfare was very primitive: heavy cylinders of poison gas were manhandled to the front trenches and their contents simply vented out through metal pipes relying on a breeze to carry the toxic cloud over the enemy trenches. But the wind could be fickle and change in its direction: the first British gas attack at Loos was a disaster. Livens developed the use of long rubber hoses to carry the gas to an optimum location for release and of a manifold that reduced the number of parapet pipes by connecting four cylinders to a single pipe, these improvements helped make the system more reliable. Major-General Foulkes described him as a \\"go getter\\", but also as unfamiliar with military protocol; Foulkes later recalled Livens' part in the preparation of a gas attack on the Hohenzollern Redoubt: Livens Large Gallery Flame Projector Livens was soon put in charge of Z company, a special unit that was given the responsibility of developing a British version of the German flamethrower that had recently been deployed on the Western Front.Foulkes 1934, p. 95. Four of Livens' massive fixed flame projector - the \\"Livens Large Gallery Flame Projector\\" - were to be used on 1 July 1916 at the start of the Battle of the Somme.Work of Trench Warfare Section 5 on flame projectors, sprayers, etc. from June 1915 to March 1916 - MUN 5/385. The Catalogue, The National Archives Constructed in underground chambers two were knocked out by German artillery before the offensive. The other two were effective in demoralising the German defenders. Impressive as it was, the limited range and the immobility of the weapon severely limited its usefulness except in specific circumstances such as those seen in its use at the Somme, and the project was only used once more in 1917.Channel 4 Time Team special 'The Somme's Secret Weapon' The remains of one of these projectors have been discovered and excavated in 2010.Secret terror weapon of the Somme battle 'discovered' - Telegraph Livens projector One day, during an attack on the Somme, Z company encountered a party of Germans who were well dug in. Grenades did not succeed in shifting them, so Livens threw in two five gallon oil drums; the burning oil was so effective that Livens' comrade, Harry Strange, wondered whether it would be better to use containers to carry flame to the enemy rather than relying on a complex flame thrower.Awards to Inventors, 1922, p.20 Reflecting on the incident, Livens and Strange considered how a really large shell filled with fuel might be thrown.Awards to Inventors, 1922, p.30 Although the key idea of throwing a large container of oil was due to Strange, it was Livens who went on to develop a large, but simple, mortar that could throw a three-gallon drum of oil which would burst when it landed... Livens' new weapon was used for the first time on the morning of 23 July 1916: twenty oil projectors were fired just before an attack in the battle of the Somme at Pozi√®res ‚Äì the effect was limited. Next, thirty projectors were fired at the eastern corner of High Wood on 18 August with more encouraging results and another attack on 3 September was highly successful. Following these attacks, Livens came to the attention of General Gough who was impressed by his ideas and \\"wangled\\" everything that he needed.Awards to Inventors, 1922, pp. 51‚Äì62 The new weapon was developed into the Livens Projector which consisted of a simple tube closed by a hemisphere at one end. It was half buried in the ground at an angle of 45 degrees and pointing in the required direction. It was then loaded with a single shot with an amount of propellant calculated to effect the desired range. Preparing a battery of projectors for an attack required a lot of preparation, this was not a serious problem in the conditions of static trench warfare and the weapon was so simple and inexpensive that hundreds ‚Äì and on occasions thousands ‚Äì of projectors could be fired simultaneously catching the enemy by surprise. Z Company rapidly developed the Livens Projector, increasing its range from the original , first to and they eventually produced an electrically triggered version with a range of . The Livens Projector was modified to fire canisters of poison gas rather than oil. This system was tried in secret, at Thiepval in September 1916 and Beaumont-Hamel in November. The Livens Projector was able to deliver a high concentration of gas a considerable distance and each canister delivered as much gas as several chemical warfare artillery shells. The Livens Projector was used in a series of gas attacks during October 1916 and a number of officers took a close interest in the results. Livens had witnessed some projector firings from the vantage of an aircraft and in his report he estimated that \\"...if the projectors were used on a large scale the cost of killing Germans could be reduced to sixteen shillings [that is ¬£0.80] each.\\"Obituary, by Major-General Foulkes. The Times newspaper, 11 February 1964 p.15 column A. This report was sent to the Ministry of Munitions and Livens was returned to England soon afterwards to help develop a standard projector and drum. The Livens Projector became a preferred means by which the British Army delivered a chemical attack and its production was given a high priority, the total for the Allies of the Great War eventually exceeded 150,000 units. Livens, \\"who was always full of ideas\\" gave up the command of Z company and became a liaison officer between Foulkes' Special Brigade and the Ministry of Munitions in which role he remained for the last two years of the war. Other weapons Livens continued to improve his projector and to design other weapons for trench warfare, some of which were useful, others not. For example, he experimented with attempts to cut barbed wire using large quantities of explosives. A witness to one trial described orange boxes filled with explosives and fired from a hole in the ground in the manner of a shell fougasse. This system failed because the explosives tended to detonate ineffectually in mid-air ‚Äì a sight that was described as being: \\"A most impressive picture of the Day of Judgement\\". A variation of the Livens Projector prototype was also tested with a view to cutting wire; Major-General Foulkes later recalled: \\"After the shoot, as the spectators approached the target area to observe the effect that had been produced Livens noticed that one drum containing 100lb of ammonal had failed to explode, and he called out \\"Back everybody\\" as he led a hasty retreat. I think he considered this the highlight of his military career‚Äîthe occasion when he barked out an order to an Army Commander (Gough) and was promptly obeyed!\\" Livens' wire-cutting ideas, were characteristically simple but ultimately unsuccessful; but he was never put off if a weapon failed to come up to expectation. Risks, decorations, demobilisation Livens' work was dangerous and he showed no lack of physical courage. On one occasion, while testing a service gas mask against Hydrogen sulfide (H2S); the gas penetrated almost immediately and Livens fell unconscious though he recovered quickly. During the war, Livens was awarded the Military Cross on 14 January 1916 and the Distinguished Service Order on 1 January 1918. Livens was demobilised from the army on 11 April 1919.  Between the wars  After the First World War, Livens, being of independent means, no longer had any incentive to produce new inventions and his life was relatively uneventful. Just before the end of the First World War, Livens wrote a patent for an improved version of his projector and in mid-June 1919, Livens and his father jointly wrote a patent for an improved projectile ‚Äì the principal enhancement being the construction of strong but light-weight casing by using drawn manufacturing techniques. In 1920, Livens applied to the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors in respect of his wartime work on flamethrowers and the Livens Projector. He had to wait for a hearing, which was complicated by the fact that his old comrade Harry Strange also made a claim in connection with the invention. The hearing was delayed until 27 May 1922 by which time Livens had agreed that Strange should have a share of the \\"plunder\\" from any award that might be obtained.Awards to Inventors, 1922, p.3 The hearing was detailed and a number of witnesses were called including the recently retired General Gough and Charles Howard Foulkes who was then a colonel.Awards to Inventors, 1922, pp. 63‚Äì88 Livens was awarded ¬£500 for his work on flamethrowers and ¬£4,500 for the Livens projector and its ammunition.Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors - Livens - T 173/330.

A car is surrounded in flames and a huge cloud of smoke. c1940. At the outbreak of war, Livens was offered the RAF rank of Air Commodore. However, he did not enlist, preferring to make his contribution to the war effort as a civilian - in which role he was free to disagree with his seniors. In 1940, as a German invasion of Britain threatened, the British developed a number of innovative flame warfare weapons. Livens joined the team of developers working at the newly formed Petroleum Warfare Department under the directorship of Sir Donald Banks. Banks described Livens \\"Colonel Livens was the typical inventor. His equipment as one remembers it was an old club blazer with numerous pockets out of which explosives of all kinds, fuses, wire and gadgets would emerge and hey presto! the most surprising detonation would occur in disconcerting places.\\" The Petroleum Warfare Department experimented with several proposed systems, including a number suggested by Livens. These included a system resembling his projector to send \\"flaming comets\\" onto the landing beaches, but the suggestion with the most promise was the flame fougasse and it was widely adopted. A flame fougasse comprised a 40 gallon light steel drum filled with petroleum mixture and a small, electrically detonated explosive as a propellant charge. The barrel was dug into the roadside with a substantial overburden and camouflaged. When the Ammonal-based propellant charge was detonated, it caused the barrel to rupture and shoot a flame wide and long.Barrel Flame Traps, 1942. Tens of thousands of flame fougasse barrels were deployed. Almost all were removed before the end of the war, although, incredibly, a few were missed and their remains have lasted to the present day. The flame fougasse has remained in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient ever since.  Personal life  Livens married Elizabeth Price some time during 1916, and they had three daughters. Livens' wife died on 18 July 1945 after a long illness.Deaths. The Times newspaper, 24 July 1945 p.1 column B. On 22 July 1947, Livens later married Arron Perry at St Paul's Church, Winchmore Hill in north London.Marriages. The Times newspaper, 23 July 1947, page 1 column A. In 1924, Livens invented a small dishwasher suitable for use in a domestic setting. It had all the features of a modern dishwasher, including a front door for loading, a wire rack to hold crockery and a rotating sprayer. According to family tradition, Livens built a prototype for the benefit of the family. When it was tried out by their maidservant, she was later found in tears with water flooding across the floor; at that point the experiment was abandoned. In his leisure time, Livens enjoyed sailing small boats and was a member of the Royal Thames Yacht Club. Livens became interested in Spiritualism. He attended a number of s√©ances, including on 15 November 1932 witnessing a s√©ance with the famous medium Rudi Schneider, although in this case it was a null result ‚Äî nothing happened. Livens was an honorary vice-president of the Spiritualist Association of Great Britain and later he was a great friend of Lord Dowding who had similar interests. Livens was briefly interested in photography, and he patented inventions relating to photography in the 1950s, Livens. Livens died at a London hospital on 1 February 1964. His remains were cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on Saturday 8 February with the request that donations to Cancer Research should be made in place of flowers.Deaths, The Times newspaper, 5 February 1964 p.1 column A.

Sinatra (born 1946) is a board-certified cardiologist specializing in integrative medicine. He is also a certified bioenergetic psychotherapist.Sinatra ST. Heartbreak and Heart Disease (Keats Publishing 1996, 1999). He has published journal articles on cholesterol and coenzyme Q10. He has appeared on national radio and television broadcasts, including The Dr. Oz Show, The Doctors, CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúSunday Morning News,‚Äù XM Radio‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Doctor Dr. Mehmet Oz,‚Äù and PBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúBody & Soul.\\" He is also the author of the monthly newsletter Heart, Health & Nutrition and founder of Heart MD Institute. Training and practice Sinatra graduated from New York‚Äôs Albany Medical College with an MD in 1972, and earned his certification in internal medicine from the American Board of Internal Medicine in 1975. He is board-certified by the American College of Cardiology and has been a fellow of the American College of Cardiology since 1977. He has certifications from the Massachusetts Society for Bioenergetic Analysis (1992) and the Certification Board for Nutrition Specialists (2000). He has certification from the American Board of Anti-Aging Medicine (1998), which is not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Medical Association. American physicians cannot be officially board-certified in anti- aging medicine. He is a fellow of the American College of Nutrition. Having studied coenzyme Q10 in the prevention and treatment of heart disease, Sinatra has written on the subject. His experience with CoQ10 led him to develop a new branch of cardiology in the United States: \\"metabolic cardiology.\\" Metabolic cardiology involves preventing and treating cardiovascular disease at the cellular level with nutraceuticals which improve ATP production in heart cells.Sinatra ST. \\"Metabolic Cardiology: the missing link in cardiovascular disease.\\" Altern Ther Health Med. 2009 Mar/Apr;15(2):48-50.Sinatra ST. \\"Metabolic cardiology: an integrative strategy in the treatment of congestive heart failure.\\" Altern Ther Health Med. 2009 May/Jun;15(3):44-52. Sinatra lectures about metabolic cardiology and energy medicine, focusing on the use of electroceuticals such as grounding or \\"earthing\\" to improve the body's capacity to heal at the cellular level. Medical philosophy In his books, newsletter, and interviews, Sinatra advocates treatment approaches that combine conventional medical therapies with nutritional and mind-body therapies that he thinks enhance the body‚Äôs natural bioenergetics and heal the heart. He promotes his ideas of five specific pillars of cardiac health: #an anti-inflammatory diet rich in fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, fish, nuts, and healthy oils, similar to the Mediterranean diet [Sinatra has also developed an anti-inflammatory, low-glycemic nutrition plan called the Pan- Asian / Modified Mediterranean (PAMM) Diet]; #nutritional supplementation that includes a high-potency multi-nutrient, fish oil, magnesium, vitamin C, and coenzyme Q10; #regular exercise; #detoxification; and #stress reduction.Stephen Sinatra‚Äôs Heart, Health & Nutrition, February 2008 Sinatra believes in the impact one‚Äôs emotions have on overall health and the need to resolve so called emotional blockages as well as physical ones. He has stated that ‚Äúwhenever you confront a person with an illness, you have to involve everything, including the spiritual.‚Ä¶ Every illness has a psychological and a physical component.‚Äù He points to such interconnectedness in the relationship between unexpressed negative emotions‚Äîanger and sadness, for example‚Äîand the development of high blood pressure and heart disease.Sinatra, ST. Heartbreak & Heart Disease: A Mind/Body Prescription for Healing the Heart. Keats Publishing: New Canaan, CT. 1996 Sinatra also believes that heart disease manifests differently in women than in men, and that such differences ultimately affect diagnosis and treatment of heart disease in women. Sinatra presented his ideas about \\"metabolic cardiology\\" at the American College for Advancement in Medicine‚Äôs 2005 Conference on Scientific Integrative Medicine. His proposed treatments include giving patients supplemental doses of substances that occur naturally in the body which he believes enhance metabolic reactions in cells. Sinatra believes coenzyme Q10, D-ribose, and L-carnitine is important in this proposed process because of the roles they play in the production and use of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body‚Äôs basic cellular fuel. In this context, he has called coenzyme Q10 a ‚Äúwonder nutrient,‚Äù especially for women, as he believes it helps the heart pump more effectively. His ACAM presentation also suggested that low levels of coenzyQ10 may result in the development of heart disease. Sinatra has often been critical of what he sees as, an over-emphasis on cholesterol as an independent risk factor for heart disease and of what he considers the over-prescription of statin drugs.Stephen Sinatra‚Äôs Heart, Health & Nutrition, February 2008. Most statin drugs, which block an enzyme pathway necessary for the body to produce cholesterol, also block the enzyme pathway by which the body naturally produces coenzyme Q10. Sinatra acknowledges that these drugs accomplish their goal of reducing cholesterol, but maintains that they also deprive the heart and other muscles of a vital nutrient and thereby set the stage for potential heart failure. Sinatra is also critical of refined sugar, which he has called ‚Äúpublic enemy number one when it comes to heart disease, not cholesterol.‚Äù He believes the surges of insulin that occur when too much sugar is consumed create a ‚Äúyo-yo effect‚Äù that, over time, damages the inner lining of the blood vessels. He also believes that sugar is linked to the proliferation of cancer cells.Stephen Sinatra‚Äôs Heart, Health & Nutrition, November 2006. \\"Grounding\\" Sinatra advocates a controversial alternative health practice called \\"grounding\\" or \\"earthing.\\" According to the theory of grounding, the earth's surface is negatively charged and contact with the earth allows electrons to neutralize free radicals in the human body. One study, published in a fringe journal, attempted to show a reduction in blood viscosity and blood pressure, a key factor in cardiovascular disease, but has been highly questioned due to improper methods and questionable results. Advocates say this can be accomplished by lying or walking barefoot on grass, sand or earth, or by lying on a special pad connected to the earth by grounding wires or a rod, or plugged into a wall outlet with a \\"modern earth ground system\\". None of these \\"treatments\\" have proven to be legitimate. Commercial interests Sinatra formulates and sells nutritional supplements under the brand name \\"Advanced BioSolutions.\\" Books and publications Sinatra is the author of the monthly newsletter Heart, Health & Nutrition (ISSN 1554-2467), and has written or contributed to the following books: * The Great Cholesterol Myth (Fair Winds Press, 2012) * Earthing - the most important health discovery ever?

The Crawfords =Captain/Major/Lt. Colonel/Colonel Owen Crawford (died May 4, 1970)= : Played by Joel Gretsch. A captain who climbs the military ladder eventually to become a colonel in the United States Air Force, Owen happens across the crash site in Roswell, New Mexico on July 9, 1947. His ruthless qualities emerge, and he stops at nothing to learn the secrets of the visitors from outer space, even sacrificing his family. Owen tries to have an affair with Sally Clarke, until he is stopped by Jacob who makes Owen see his fears. Tom destroys Owen's career in revenge. On May 4, 1970, Owen dies from a stroke after learning of the death of his son, Sam. In \\"John\\", Owen's granddaughter, Mary, sees a vision of him and she demands to know what Jacob Clarke did to scare him. Owen shows her by doing the same thing that Jacob showed him. =Anne Crawford (died October 28, 1962)= : Played by Tina Holmes. Anne is a warm-hearted woman who easily falls for Owen's charms. She eventually discovers that she was blissfully ignorant of the fact that he married her so he could advance up the ranks of the Air Force's alien project, then in the hands of her father, Col. Campbell. As a result, Anne's mental stability spirals, and meets a shocking fate: she is shot by her own husband, who makes it look like she was having an affair with Major Bowen. =Eric Crawford (c. 1949-2002)= : Played by Andy Powers as Adult Eric, Nolan Funk as Teenage Eric, and Cody Shaer as Young Eric. Not quite as ruthless as his father Owen, Eric is a confused, angry man who felt unloved by his parents, especially Owen. For this reason he becomes extremely jealous of his brother Sam. Eric inherits the extraterrestrial project from his father, after he blackmails the General into giving in to him using Owen's records. He gets close to Becky Clarke so he can find out the reason for Tom Clarke's change of opinion about the aliens, but gradually finds himself falling in love with Becky. He asks her to run away with him, but she decides to stay with her family instead, turning Eric even more bitter. Eric loses the project after the aliens take all the proof away until an incident with a space mission puts him back on the job. Eric's past and his obsession with the project and with discovering what proof Tom Clarke is hiding leave him estranged with his wife Julie, and his relationship with his daughter Mary gradually turns to ice, with tragic results: he is killed under orders from his daughter. =Sam Crawford (July 28, 1951 - April 18, 1970)= : Played by Ryan Merriman as Adult Sam, Branden Nadon as Young Sam, and Trevor Pawson as Younger Sam. The kind and understanding Sam grows up to be a young journalist. He is always dismissive of his father and brother's projects. That is until he happens across a newspaper article about an ancient Inuit ruin, whose symbols resemble those on the piece of metal Owen keeps in his personal safe. Sam embarks on a journey to Alaska to find the truth, with fatal consequences. =Julie Crawford= : Played by Emily Holmes. Julie thought that the Eric she married was the perfect man, but the life she envisions crumbles. Her relationship with her daughter, Mary, however, is very strong, although she doesn't realize how much Mary has inherited from her grandfather. =Mary Crawford (born April 27, 1970)= : Played by Heather Donahue as Adult Mary, and Anysha Berthot as Young Mary. Owen's monstrous legacy is carried onto his granddaughter, Mary. Although her relationship with her mother is strong, she feels estranged by her father, Eric. An outstanding student in biochemistry, Mary jumps on board Eric's project, making several major breakthroughs in association with fellow scientist and secret lover Dr. Chet Wakeman. Mary coldbloodedly experiments on several of the 'taken', and relentlessly hunts down the current generation of the Keys and the Clarkes - especially Allie. She is eventually arrested for her crimes. The Clarkes =Sally Clarke (died October 19, 1980)= : Played by Catherine Dent. Sally is a lonely woman, since her husband Fred is always out of town. When she meets John, her life is turned upside down, and they form a special bond, even though they know each other briefly. She becomes pregnant with Jacob, a human-alien hybrid. Years later after Jacob's birth, Owen Crawford comes to search for Jacob. He uses Sally to get closer to Jacob. She falls for Crawford's charm but discovers his real intentions later on. =Fred Clarke= : Played by Alf Humphreys. Fred is Sally's husband. Fred was constantly away on business, and his relationships with his wife and children were strained considerably. He had died by 1958. =Tom Clarke= : : Played by Ryan Hurst as Adult Tom, and Kevin Schmidt as Young Tom. The son of Sally and Fred, Tom was always skeptical of his mother's belief in aliens from outer space, and makes it his life-long quest to debunk alien theories wherever they spread. After Owen Crawford destroys Sally's life, Tom swore to ruin his. He doesn't stop with Owen; he is a constant obstacle to Eric Crawford's research. He changes his alien-sceptic views when he realizes his brother Jacob is half-alien and devotes his life to uncovering and spreading the truth about the alien sightings as a best-seller writer. He tries to protect his niece Lisa from the Crawfords. Tom is the only major character to survive the entire length of the series. =Becky Clarke= : Played by Chad Morgan as Adult Becky, and Shauna Kain as Young Becky. Traditionally fiercely protective of her younger brother Jacob, Becky breaks it when she finds herself falling in love with Eric Crawford and becomes his lover, but in the end she decides to not leave her husband and children for him. Her relationship with her family is strained ever since. =Jacob Clarke (February 1948 - March 17, 1981)= : Played by Anton Yelchin as Young Jacob, and Chad Donella as Adult Jacob. Young Jacob is an alien-human hybrid, growing up he was always different from all the other children. Shy and anti-social, he was bullied. That all changes when he demonstrates his vast psychic powers. Jacob, or Jack, as he is known by friends and relatives, is wise beyond his years, and has a powerful telepathic insight he inherited from his alien father, John. When necessary, Jacob can overload adversaries with memories of both their greatest fears and futures, driving them temporarily insane. These abilities come at a cost; overusing them exhausts him greatly, risking death. Eventually, his powers debilitate his health and take his life. =Carol Clarke= : Played by Sadie Lawrence. Carol is a kind woman who married Jacob, not realizing that part of him is from another world. After Jacob dies, she remarries to Danny Holding. =Lisa Clarke (born 1972)= : Played by Emily Bergl as Adult Lisa, Alexandra Purvis as Lisa, age 13, and Taylor-Anne Reid as Lisa, age 8. Despite being the daughter of a half-alien, she doesn't inherit any of his more unusual qualities. However, she is protected from the Crawfords by the aliens, and they save her from death, when she gives birth to Allison (Allie). Lisa meets Charlie Keys on board the spaceship when he gets abducted. They conceive Allie on the spaceship, having no memories of their meeting outside of the spaceship. Later, Lisa finds that she has a psychic link with her daughter. As a teenager, Lisa likes to wear a H√ºsker D√º t-shirt from the Metal Circus era. Her comment to Nina about seeing H√ºsker D√º \\"last year\\" in Sacramento indicates she would have been to the 27 Feb 1985 show. The Keys =Captain Russell Keys (died October 24, 1962)= : Played by Steve Burton. :Braving the deadly skies above France as a B-17 bomber Captain in August 1944, Russell and his crew are abducted by aliens disguised as German doctors. After dispatching the aliens, Russell is never the same when he comes home. The aliens are interested in him and his descendants because most people who come into contact with their technology get sick and eventually die (such as the rest of his B-17 crew), but his physiology is more tolerant to it. Upon discovering that his comrades had died, he leaves his family to become a drifter, hoping the aliens never find him. Alas, he is proved wrong, and is taken several times and experimented on, and both he and his son Jesse eventually discover the implants in their brains. Russell tries to defend Jesse from the aliens, but his continuing failures and resulting frustration, combined with Jesse's advice, drive him to approach Owen Crawford and offer up his implant, despite knowing its removal would kill him, in exchange for Jesse's protection. Owen agrees, and Russell is taken to a secret surgery headed by Air Force doctors led by Doctor Kreutz. Russell, noticing Owen isn't present, realizes he has been betrayed, but is physically overpowered, forced into unconsciousness, and operated on. The negative effects of the implant drive all present insane and cause them to kill each other; one soldier shoots several oxygen tanks, which explode and destroy the entire building, killing all including Russell. Jesse suffers immense emotional guilt of his father's death, and when the abductions centered on him, the aliens summoned an image of Russell to force an emotional response as part of their experiment. =Kate Keys= : Played by Julie Benz. :After anxiously waiting for Russell's return from Europe, Kate is saddened to find he comes home a changed man. She is constantly concerned about his state of mind, and is worried that he can't tell her what's been haunting him for so long. After Russell flees, she divorces him and remarries to Sheriff Bill Walker. =Jesse Keys (1946 ‚Äì September 1992)= : Played by Desmond Harrington as Adult Jesse, James Kirk as Teen Jesse, and Conner Widdows as Young Jesse. : The son of Russell and Kate, Jesse always admired his father for his heroism during the Second World War. Jesse finds himself taken by visitors from outer space, and each abduction sends him into a spiral of depression, anxiety, and rage. He is particularly traumatized by his experiences in Vietnam, when the aliens save him from a burning Buddhist temple, but let 27 of his comrades die. He becomes a heroin addict after the war, but is rehabilitated by a nurse named Amelia. Jesse tries to protect his son, Charlie, from being abducted, but to no avail. Ultimately, his experiences result in him being committed to a mental hospital until his death. =Amelia Keys= : Played by Julie Ann Emery. :Amelia meets Jesse in the hospital where she works. She takes care of him and helps him overcome his addiction to drugs. However, she is concerned by Jesse's increasingly erratic behavior, especially towards their son, Charlie. Amelia finally believes Jesse when Eric Crawford's agents come after him, and she leads Charlie to live in obscurity. =Charlie Keys (born 1971)= : Played by Adam Kaufman as Adult Charlie, and Devin Douglas Drewitz as Teen Charlie. :Like his father Jesse, Charlie is tormented by his abductions by the aliens. Despite that, he has an intriguing experience with Lisa Clarke while abducted, and the two share a special bond. Charlie was a school teacher, but his desire to expose the aliens' activities render him jobless, and is forced to run from the government. He meets Lisa in real life when he's studying Dr. Penzler's abductees group. After he and Lisa go through hypnotherapy, he discovers that Allie is his daughter and tries to keep her safe. =Allison \\"Allie\\" Keys (born June 8, 1993)= : Played by Dakota Fanning as Allie, and Elle Fanning as Allie, age 3. : Although her mother (Lisa Clarke) didn't inherit Jacob's alien abilities, Allie did. Allie is somewhat wise beyond her years and has the ability to not only read minds, but can also manipulate time and space, warp reality, and has healed her father Charlie. Allie is the centerpiece of the aliens' experiments, but not even she knows what lies in store for her. She is also taken by Mary Crawford and then by the army, who use her as a bait to lure the aliens into a trap. But she deceives them all and escapes with her parents. In the end, however, she has to leave with the aliens to save everyone. But she leaves behind a promise to return. Other characters Alien Visitor 'John : Played by Eric Close. When 'John's' alien spacecraft crashes in the New Mexico desert near Roswell, killing his companions, he assumes the form of a human. He falls in love with Sally Clarke, and gives her a child, Jacob. John leaves shortly afterward, but the two have a special bond. Sally Clarke gives him one of her star earrings. Jacob helps his mother see him again on her deathbed. He returns later to help his great-granddaughter, Allie. He teaches her to block her signal and he tells her that, unless she calls them, they wouldn't be able to find her, just before he leaves to protect them. General Beers : Played by James McDaniel. A high-ranking officer in the US Army, General Beers shuts down Mary Crawford and Dr. Wakeman's FBI alien project. He moves operations to North Dakota, in a bid to lure the aliens into a trap, using Allie as bait. His plan seems to succeed when the UFO crashes, but it turns out it was Allie who deceived them. Lieutenant/Captain/Major Howard Bowen (died October 28, 1962) : Played by Jason Gray-Stanford. One of Col. Owen Crawford's two closest lackeys. He is killed by Owen during his scheme to deal with his wife, Anne. Col. Thomas Campbell : Played by Michael Moriarty. An Army Air Corps Colonel in the intelligence division and Capt. Owen Crawford's superior. He takes control of everything related to the Roswell crash and leaves Crawford out of it. Crawford then seduces and marries his daughter Anne and blackmails Campbell into assigning him as head of the project. After losing the project to Crawford, he became a heavy drinker and died of cirrhosis of the liver prior to October 1962. Dewey Clayton : Played by Timothy Webber. A local hunting guide in North Dakota that Charlie and Lisa hire to find Allie after the US Army shuts down the road that leads to the area they have Allie in. He is shocked to find out about the aliens. Doctor \\"Doc\\" Schilling : Played by Jay Brazeau. He is only seen for a short time during the series. Gladys and Mavis Erenberg (died December 25, 1958) : Played by Carol Infield Sender and Helen Infield Sender. Gladys and Mavis are the famed Erenberg twins, and they're psychically linked to each other. They are taken to New Mexico as guinea pigs in Owen Crawford and Dr. Kreutz's alien program. They demonstrate their abilities when one of the twins visualizes a bunch of flowers, while the other draws a mentally accurate depiction. Crawford and Kreutz hope the Erenburg twins could fly the alien ship that crashed near Roswell. But those who enter the base don't come out alive: colonel Crawford intentionally makes them stay in the ship, thus exposing them to enough energy to kill them - a property of the alien technology that was already known. Lieutenant/Captain/Major/Lieutenant Colonel Marty Erickson : Played by John Hawkes. The second of Col. Owen Crawford's two closest lackeys. He suspected Col. Crawford killed his wife and Captain Bowen, but only told Eric several years later after the Colonel's death. Eric got him arrested as accomplice of the crime. Dr. Ellen Greenspan : Played by Brenda James. A doctor in Jacob's school that saves him when Bowen and Erickson came after him. Dr. Helms : Played by Andrew Johnston. Danny Holding : Played by Byron Lucas. A musician neighbor of Carol Clarke who often babysits Lisa and eventually becomes Carol's second husband.

He is killed in an explosion along with the mad victims of the experiment on Russell Keys. ;Lester (died April 18, 1970) : Played by Frederick Koehler. Up in the frozen forests of Alaska, dwells Lester. He is an alien-human hybrid, but unlike Jacob Clarke, he was born horribly deformed more alien outside than inside. Lester has the appearance of a mutated human-alien, he has the bone-chilling psychic ability to kill whoever looks him in the eye. Absolutely terrified of himself, he hides in a small shack in the woods. He builds an Inuit-inspired tomb for his dead twin brother (who was also deformed), hoping to revive him with magic. Lester and his twin brother are failed experiments of the aliens, and therefore of no importance. ;Patricia : Played by Janet Wright. ;Dr. Harriet Penzler (died 2002) : Played by Gabrielle Rose. A psychological counselor, Dr. Penzler is engrossed by hearing the experiences of the 'taken', and has opened a therapy group so abductees can talk about their experiences.

The site was declared one of the country's four Natural Monuments on 13 October 1998.Yagul at INAH The site is also known locally as Pueblo Viejo (Old Village) and was occupied at the time of the Spanish Conquest. After the Conquest the population was relocated to the nearby modern town of Tlacolula where their descendants still live.Winter 1998, p.119.Adams 1996, p.333. Yagul was first occupied around 500-100 BC. Around 500-700 AD, residential, civic and ceremonial structures were built at the site. However, most of the visible remains date to 1250-1521 AD, when the site functioned as the capital of a Postclassic city-state.Winter 1998, pp.72, 75. The site was excavated in the 1950s and 60s by archaeologists Ignacio Bernal and John Paddock.Winter 1998, p.6. Vestiges of human habitation in the area, namely cliff paintings at Caballito Blanco, date to at least 3000 BC. After the abandonment of Monte Alb√°n about 800 AD, the region's inhabitants established themselves in various small centers such as Lambityeco, Mitla and Yagul. Etymology Yagul comes from the Zapotec language, it is formed from ya (tree) and gul (old), hence \\"old tree\\". Location Yagul is located just off Highway 190 between the city of Oaxaca and Mitla, about 36 km from the former. The site is situated on a volcanic outcrop surrounded by fertile alluvial land, in the Tlacolula arm of the Valley of Oaxaca.Joyce 2010, pp.271-272. The Salado river flows to the south. Site history Occupation at Yagul dates as far back as the Middle to Late Preclassic. Elaborate Preclassic period burials have been excavated at Yagul, accompanied by ceramic effigy vessels that indicate the increasing influence of Monte Alb√°n upon the local elite.Joyce 2010, p.147. In the Late Postclassic, immediately prior to the Spanish Conquest, Yagul had a population of more than 6000 people.Joyce 2010, p.271. Site description The Palace of the Six Patios Yagul is one of the most studied archaeological sites in the Valley of Oaxaca. This important prehispanic centers name literally means \\"Old Stick\\" or \\"Old Tree\\", The site is set around a hill, and can be divided into three principal areas; the fortress, the ceremonial center and the residential areas.INAH 1973, p.38. The construction stone at Yagul is mainly river cobbles formed from volcanic rock such as basalt. About 30 tombs have been found at Yagul, sometimes located in pairs. A few of these bear hieroglyphic inscriptions.INAH 1973, pp.38, 40. =Fortress= Situated atop the cliffs to the northeast of the site and protected by natural and artificial walls, it has an excellent vantage point over the whole Tlacolula Valley.Winter 1998, p.120. It has several lookout points, including one reached by a narrow bridge. =Residential area= Unexcavated residential areas lie on terraces to the south, east and west of the hill. Classic Period residences are to the northwest of the excavated ceremonial centre and lower class Postclassic residences are presumed to lie around the site core. =Ceremonial center= One of three tombs found within a chamber. The ceremonial center was excavated in 1974 by Bernal and Gamio.Joyce 2010, p.272. It composes the vast majority of what has been excavated, and what can be seen today. The ceremonial center consists of a number of large patios bordered by monumental architecture, and also includes a ballcourt and an elite residential complex. Some of the structures in this area are: * Ballcourt. The restored ballcourt has an east‚Äìwest orientation and is the largest in the Valley of Oaxaca. A carved serpent's head, now in the Regional Museum in Oaxaca, was found fixed to the top of the south wall.INAH 1973, pp.38-39. The ballcourt was built in the Classic Period between 500 and 700 AD, and then widened between 700 and 900 AD. It has a total length of 47 meters and a central field length of 30 meters, and is 6 meters wide.Kowalewski et al. 1991, p.29 * Palace of the Six Patios. This is a labyrinthine structure formed of an intricate complex of passageways and many rooms. It is formed of three elite complexes, each with two patios surrounded by rooms. In each pair of patios, the northern was probably a residence and the southern was possibly the administrative area. A tomb entrance is found in each patio. The same layout is found at the nearby site of Mitla although the two sites were probably independent. The walls are faced with dressed stones and stucco over a rough stone and clay core, the floors were of red stucco.INAH 1973, p.39. Patio F is somewhat different from the others in the complex in that it opened out onto the ballcourt and lower patio complexes and appears to have had a more public function. It had a low bench situated within a room that would have been visible to the areas below and may have been intended for the reception of visitors. The palace complex also included a temple.Joyce 2010, p.273. * Patio 1 is a large open area immediately southeast of the Palace of the Six Patios. It has rooms on all sides except the south side. Immediately to the south of Patio 1 is a temple. * Patio 4 lies to the southeast of the ballcourt and is part of a temple-patio-altar complex formed from four mounds around a central altar. It was in use from at least the Classic Period through to the Postclassic. A sculpture of a frog-effigy lies at the base of the eastern mound. * Tomb 30. This Postclassic tomb lies underneath Patio 4. It is formed of three chambers with decorated panels, the principal chamber has a facade decorated with two human heads carved in stone. The door to the tomb is a stone slab with hieroglyphic inscriptions on both sides. * Council Chamber. This is a long, narrow chamber with an east‚Äìwest orientation, lying to the south of a narrow \\"street\\". It was once decorated with stone mosaics and was entered via steps from Patio 1, which lies immediately to the south. The entrance is divided into 3 sections by two 2-meter wide pillars. Due to its non-residential nature and its lack of a shrine or temple, this room is presumed to have been administrative in function.INAH 1973, p.40. * Decorated Street. This narrow \\"street\\" runs in an east‚Äìwest direction between the Palace of the Six Patios to the north and the Council Chamber to the south. Its southern wall is over 40 meters long and was decorated with geometric stone mosaics similar to those at Mitla. * Building U. This building was built on an artificial platform in the northern part of the site, a tomb lies under its floor. It is reached by a stairway to the south and has a good view across most of the site. The site is in the care of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History) and is open to the public.

The municipal seat, and largest settlement, is the city of Esc√°rcega. History and geography The municipality of Esc√°rcega borders to the north with the municipality of Champot√≥n, to the east with the municipality of Calakmul, to the south with the municipality of Candelaria, and to the west with the municipality of Carmen. It covers 4,569.64 km¬≤, accounting for 8.0% of the state's total surface area. The municipality was created on 1 January 1991. It took its name from its municipal seat, which was in turn named for Tlaxcalan railwayman Francisco Esc√°rcega, who built the Ferrocarril del Sureste that runs from Coatzacoalcos, Ver., to Campeche, Camp. Demographics As of 2010, the municipality had a total population of 54,184. As of 2010, the city of Esc√°rcega had a population of 29,477. Other than the city of Esc√°rcega, the municipality had 539 localities, the largest of which (with 2010 populations in parentheses) were: Divisi√≥n del Norte (3,259), classified as urban, and La Libertad (1,462), Matamoros (1,453), Haro (1,092), Don Samuel (1,081), and Altamira de Zin√°paro (1,040), classified as rural.  Transportation  Esc√°rcega territory is a major hub of both roads and railways with these being the main driver of development in the region. Before their existence Esc√°rcega was virtually depopulated. = Roads = The main roads connecting the municipality of Esc√°rcega are Federal Highway 186 and Federal Highway 254. The Federal Highway 186 is the primary means of transportation and economic activity in the territory. The Federal Highway 254 is a small road that connects to 186. = Railways = The introduction of the railroad in the mid-1930s was the real engine of development in the state of Campeche where the present day municipality of Esc√°rcega lies. The railway connected the Yucat√°n Peninsula with the rest of the country for the first time in the Mexico's history. The railway passes through the municipality of Esc√°rcega southwest to northeast with the main station in the municipalities seat, Esc√°rcega. To the north it connects with the city of Campeche and then M√©rida, and southward with Tenosique, Tabasco. The total length of railways in the municipality is 6769 km. = Airports = There are three airports within the municipality that serve the public which are located in Esc√°rcega, Don Samuel, and Pancho Villa.

The film focuses on a boy, Martin, who is outcast from the other children at his school. The film was made with pre-school children in Munich, and is partially based on true stories which Herzog heard from the children themselves. The use of a raven as a central plot element was inspired by the story of the raven from Herzog's earlier film The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner. Plot summary Martin is a young boy who sits in a corner while the children play at school. The other children dislike his shabby appearance, and refuse to play with him. With some effort, Martin convinces a classmate, Nicole, to come to his house and play with his talking raven. Martin explains that his mother is sick with cancer and cannot cook for him, and consequently he eats only popcorn. Martin's father beats him. Nicole becomes Martin's only friend, and he is so thankful that he gives his raven to her as a gift. Nicole then collects money from the other children to buy Martin a pair of guinea pigs.

Its designer was C. Amherst Villiers and Campbell's regular mechanic Leo Villa supervised its construction. This was Campbell's first car to use the Napier Lion aero engine. His intention was to surpass his previous Sunbeam Blue Bird's achievement of the 150 mph barrier and to reach 200 mph.  1927  Blue Bird in 1927 When first built, the car used a Napier Lion engine of around 500 bhp. It was of conventional form with a front-mounted vertical radiator and the driver behind the engine. The three banks of the W-12 engine were hidden behind bulges in the narrow bonnet, with exhaust stub pipes protruding. Bluebird's first record attempt was on 4 February 1927 at Pendine Sands. A peak speed of was achieved, tantalisingly close to the magic , but the two-way average recorded for the record was lower, at . 1928 The 1927 record was short-lived, as Segrave's Sunbeam 1000 hp achieved both the 180 mph and 200 mph targets a month later. This prompted Campbell to rebuild the car as \\"Blue Bird III\\" for 1928. He persuaded the Air Ministry to allow him a Schneider Trophy-tuned \\"Sprint\\" engine, as fitted to the Supermarine S.5 seaplane, of . Improved aerodynamics were innovatively tested in Vickers' wind-tunnel by R.K. Pierson, their Chief Designer. Blue Bird‚Äôs body shape was substantially changed, with the famous coachbuilders Mulliner producing the bodywork. The results were unorthodox. A vertical tail fin was added for stability, a first for Blue Bird and land speed record cars. Open spats behind the wheels also reduced drag. The biggest change was to the radiators, which were moved to the rear of the car and mounted externally. These surface radiators were made by Fairey Aviation and contained of tube. Removing the nose radiator allowed a low, rounded nose with better streamlining. However, one French newspaper compared its looks to a whale. Following Segrave to Daytona Beach, on 19 February 1928 Campbell took the record at , breaking the 200 mph barrier for his first time. Once again though he only held the record for a couple of months, losing it by a whisker to Ray Keech and the White Triplex. 1929 Campbell sought a more predictable venue than a tidal beach, so he set off to survey possible sites by air. Africa showed promise, first at a site 600 miles from Timbuctu and so impractically inaccessible. A dry lake bed in South Africa, the Verneukpan, was still from Cape Town, but did have some chance of access. Blue Bird was rebuilt for a third time. The chassis, engine and drivetrain remained the same, but the bodywork was replaced with one built in Dumfries by Arrol-Aster. This body was lower, requiring a hump around the cockpit where Campbell now sat astride the gearbox. The surface radiators were replaced by a conventional circular nose opening, covered by a distinctive \\"birdcage\\" grille.\\"Seek New Auto Speeds Marks with Streamline Car\\" Popular Mechanics, May 192 Unfortunately, after a period of five years of no rainfall, it poured down almost as soon as they arrived. Campbell returned to Cape Town, where on his 44th birthday he learnt that Henry Segrave at Daytona Beach had set a new record in Golden Arrow at . Blue Bird was unable to match this at the African altitude and climate, but he made the best use of the long course and set the world 5 mile and 10 mile records at . After Segrave had raised the record in Golden Arrow by a whole though, Campbell knew that Blue Bird was beaten and began work on a new car, the Campbell-Napier-Railton Blue Bird.

The color is selected with an electrically switched light modulator comprising a microscopic cavity that is switched on and off using driver integrated circuits similar to those used to address liquid crystal displays (LCD). An IMOD-based reflective flat panel display includes hundreds of thousands of individual IMOD elements each a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based device. In one state, an IMOD subpixel absorbs incident light and appears black to the viewer. In a second state, it reflects light at a specific wavelength, using a diffraction grating effect. When not being addressed, an IMOD display consumes very little power. Unlike conventional back-lit liquid crystal displays, it is clearly visible in bright ambient light such as sunlight. IMOD prototypes as of mid-2010 could emit 15 frames per second (fps), and in November 2011 Qualcomm demonstrated another prototype reaching 30 fps, suitable for video playback. The smartwatch Qualcomm Toq features this display with 40 fps. Mirasol screens were only able to produce 60 Hz video but it quickly drained the battery. Devices that used the screen have colors that look washed out, so the technology never saw mainstream support. Working principle The basic elements of an IMOD-based display are microscopic devices that act essentially as mirrors that can be switched on or off individually. Each of these elements reflects only one exact wavelength of light, such as a specific hue of red, green or blue, when turned on, and absorbs light (appears black) when off. Elements are organised into a rectangular array in order to produce a display screen. An array of elements that all reflect the same color when turned on produces a monochromatic display, for example black and red (in this example using IMOD elements that reflect red light when \\"on\\"). As each element reflects only a certain amount of light, grouping several elements of the same color together as subpixels allows different brightness levels for a pixel based on how many elements are reflective at a particular time. Multiple color displays are created by using subpixels, each designed to reflect a specific different color. Multiple elements of each color are generally used to both give more combinations of displayable color (by mixing the reflected colors) and to balance the overall brightness of the pixel. Because elements only use power in order to switch between on and off states (no power is needed to reflect or absorb light hitting the display once the element is either reflecting or absorbing), IMOD-based displays potentially use much less power than displays that generate light and/or need constant power to keep pixels in a particular state. Being a reflective display, they require an external light source (such as daylight or a lamp) to be readable, just like paper or other electronic paper technologies. =Details= A pixel in an IMOD-based display consists of one or more subpixels that are individual microscopic interferometric cavities similar in operation to Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot interferometers (etalons), and the scales in butterfly wings. While a simple etalon consists of two half-silvered mirrors, an IMOD comprises a reflective membrane which can move in relation to a semi-transparent thin film stack. With an air gap defined within this cavity, the IMOD behaves like an optically resonant structure whose reflected color is determined by the size of the airgap. Application of a voltage to the IMOD creates electrostatic forces which bring the membrane into contact with the thin film stack. When this happens the behavior of the IMOD changes to that of an induced absorber. The consequence is that almost all incident light is absorbed and no colors are reflected. It is this binary operation that is the basis for the IMOD's application in reflective flat panel displays. Since the display utilizes light from ambient sources, the display's brightness increases in high ambient environments (i.e. sunlight). In contrast, a back- lit LCD suffers from incident light. For a practical RGB color model (RGB) display, a single RGB pixel is built from several subpixels, because the brightness of a monochromatic pixel is not adjusted. A monochromatic array of subpixels represents different brightness levels for each color, and for each pixel, there are three such arrays: red, green and blue.Waldrop 2007 Development The IMOD technology was invented by Mark W. Miles, a MEMS researcher and founder of Etalon, Inc., and (co-founder) of Iridigm Display Corporation. Qualcomm took over the development of this technology after its acquisition of Iridigm in 2004, and subsequently formed Qualcomm MEMS Technologies (QMT). Qualcomm has allowed commercialization of the technology under the trademark name \\"mirasol\\". This energy-efficient, biomimetic technology sees application and use in portable electronics such as e-book readers and mobile phones. It has some commercial use Future IMOD panels manufacturers include, Qualcomm in conjunction with Foxlink, having established a joint-venture with Sollink (È´òÂº∑ÂÖâÈõª) in 2009 with a future facility dedicated to manufacturing IMOD panels. Production for this began in Jan 2011, with the fabricated panels intended for devices such as e-readers. As of 2015, the IMOD Mirasol display laboratory in Longtan, Taiwan, formerly run by Qualcomm, is now apparently run by Apple.

It is noted for the philosophical inscription by the Epicurean, Diogenes of Oenoanda. The ruins of the city lie west of the modern village ƒ∞ncealiler in the Fethiye district of Muƒüla Province, Turkey, which partly overlies the ancient site. History The early history of the settlement is obscure, in spite of an exploratory survey carried out, with permission of the Turkish authorities, by the British Institute at Ankara (BIAA) in 1974‚Äì76.Alan Hall, \\"The Oenoanda Survey: 1974-76\\", Anatolian Studies 26 (1976:191-197). It seems that Oinoanda became a colony of Termessos about 200-190 BC and was also called Termessos Minor Rousset D., De Lycie en Cabalide, fouilles de Xanthos X, Droz, Gen√®ve 2010(or Termessos i pros Oinoanda). Oenoanda was the most southerly of the Kibyran Tetrapoleis in the Hellenistic Period, which was dissolved by L. Licinius Murena in 84 BC, whereupon Oenoanda became part of the koinon of Lycia,Strabo, xiii.4.17. as its inscriptions abundantly demonstrate. Diogenes carved a summary of the philosophy of Epicurus onto a portico wall, which originally extended about 80 meters. The inscription sets out Epicurus' teachings on physics, epistemology, and ethics. It was originally about 25,000 words long and filled 260 square meters of wall space. The inscription has been assigned on epigraphic grounds to the Hadrianic period, 117‚Äì138AD. The stoa was dismantled in the second half of the third century AD to make room for a defensive wall; previously the site had been undefended.Hall 1976:196. The site was first noted by Hoskyns and Forbes, in 1841, and published in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, xii (1843). The extensive philosophical inscriptions of Diogenes of Oenoanda were identified later from scattered fragments, apparently from the stoa. It cannot be assumed that Diogenes erected himself.C.W.

It was a single-engined two-seat biplane floatplane, and was a larger development of the successful W.12. It served with the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial German Navy) during 1918. Development and design Hansa- Brandenburg W.19 prototype Operational experience with the W.12 showed that, while it was an extremely successful design - showing excellent performance and manoeuvrability - there was a requirement for a floatplane fighter with greater endurance. To meet this requirement, Ernst Heinkel, chief designer of the Hansa und Brandenburgische Flugzeug-Werke, designed the W.19.Gray and Thetford 1962, p.72 The W.19 was of similar layout to the W.12, but considerably larger (i.e. with a 2.6 m/8.5 ft greater wingspan and a 1 m/3.3 ft greater length). It was a single-engined tractor biplane, with two bay wings. The aircraft was fitted with a similar inverted tailplane to the W.12 in order to give unobstructed fields of fire to the observer, who was seated in a rear cockpit, immediately behind the pilot. In order to compensate for the increased size and weight over the W.12, the W.19 was fitted with a more powerful Maybach Mb.IV engine. Production aircraft were armed with one or two synchronised 7.92 mm (.312 in) LMG 08/15 machine guns firing forward and a single 7.92 mm (.312) LMG 08/15 machine gun for the observer. One aircraft was fitted with a 20 mm Becker cannon for tests.Green and Swanborough 1994, p.85. Operational history The W.19 entered service with the German Navy in January 1918, operating from bases at Borkum and Zeebrugge for operations over the North Sea. It was used in support of the smaller W.19 or W.29 fighters, often scouting ahead for targets while the smaller aircraft waited on the sea. Combats often occurred between the various Hansa-Brandenburg fighters and large British flying boats such as Felixstowe F.2s and Curtiss Americas. The W.19 continued in service until the Armistice, 55 being produced. While it had been planned to supplement it with the W.33 monoplane, only a few had been delivered by the time the war ended.

Her main output was released on the Okeh and Victor labels. Biography She recorded with the harmonica player Bobby Leecan and guitarist Robert Cooksey, playing country blues; she also did several recordings with New Orleans jazz ensembles which included Sidney Bechet, Clarence Williams, Louis Armstrong, Bubber Miley, and Tom Morris. In 1924, she recorded \\"Absent Minded Blues\\", which was written by Tom Delaney, and another of his compositions, \\"Nobody Knows the Way I Feel This Mornin'\\". She was accompanied by Williams on these recordings. She and Clarence Williams also played with the Jazz Rippers, Buddy Christian's ensemble, although Williams was not credited and Johnson was listed under the name Margaret Carter. Her songs were often humorous and sexually suggestive in tone. In September 1927, she released one of her final recordings, \\"Second-Handed Blues\\" / \\"Good Woman Blues\\", on Victor Records. After the late 1920s she ceased to record as a vocalist. Most of Johnson's 1920s sides were reissued on CD by Document Records.

It is quite a normal type of rap album for its day with a couple of short skits included which was really the done thing for rap albums of the late 90s. The only thing that is significantly different with this album is that it is in Danish as opposed to the usual English.

The skits on this album are all under a minute in length. There are a couple of sounds included that would be familiar to English speaking audiences. The track called \\"Golden Kaj\\" reproduces a little bit of the James Bond \\"Goldeneye\\" theme, although it is quite clearly not Tina Turner's vocals. The track entitled \\"Det lille hus p√• landet\\" (The little house in the country), has a similar feel to Will Smith's rap version of \\"Just the Two of Us\\", even though it is quite clearly not the same song. The skit entitled Hall√∏j p√• Hotellet, shares its name with the Danish title for the British sitcom Fawlty Towers. The word Hall√∏j means something between \\"fun\\" and \\"trouble\\" in English.

Forming from a persistent area of convection on February 7, Ivan initially tracked southeastward, before looping to the west- southwest. Encountering favourable conditions, it strengthened to attain peak winds on February 17 before striking northeastern Madagascar. It degenerated into a remnant low pressure area as it crossed the island, and briefly re- organized into a weak tropical depression before dissipating on February 22. Ivan caused heavy damage in Madagascar, leaving severe flooding and wind damage. In √éle Sainte-Marie, the worst hit area, 90% of the infrastructure was destroyed, and 70% of the structures were destroyed. On mainland Madagascar, over of cultivated crops were destroyed, leaving hundreds of families without food. In addition, severe flooding and high winds in Toamasina left the entire city without electricity or drinkable water. In all, over 330,000 people were left homeless, and the storm caused 93 deaths. Meteorological history On February 5,an area of convection persisted about 555 km (900 mi) north of R√©union in the southwest Indian Ocean. The system maintained a broad low-level circulation with associated deep convection, and it slowly developed banding features. By early on February 7, the circulation had become better defined as it remained in an area of weak wind shear and strong diffluence. At 0600 UTC, M√©t√©o-France (MFR) classified it as Tropical Depression Eleven about 880 km (550 mi) north-northeast of Mauritius. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 18S. The depression tracked east-southeastward, under the influence of a mid-level ridge. A cutoff low to the south of the system enhanced upper- level conditions, and it quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Ivan. The storm rapidly organized and developed an eye feature. Its intensification rate slowed as an upper-level trough began restricting outflow, and the motion of Ivan became nearly stationary as it entered an area of weak steering currents. With its overall environment remaining favourable, the JTWC upgraded Ivan to tropical cyclone status - winds greater than 119 km/h (74 mph) - early on February 9. However, the MFR retained Ivan as a strong tropical storm. Late on February 9, the storm temporarily weakened when wind shear increased, though the next day it re-intensified as convection increased; a banding eye formed in the center of the convection, prompting the JTWC to re-upgrade Ivan to tropical cyclone status late on February 10. On February 11, the MFR upgraded Ivan to tropical cyclone status 1025 km (640 mi) northeast of Mauritus. By February 14, it had sped up and entered a more favourable environment, becoming a severe tropical storm.ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Seychelles/2008021406-FMEE On February 15, Ivan was re-upgraded to a tropical cyclone as favourable conditions persisted. Ivan was further upgraded to an Intense Tropical Cyclone on February 16 as it moved closer to Madagascar. Ivan made landfall north of Fanoarivo, Madagascar on February 17.ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Seychelles/2008021706-FMEE Once overland, rapid weakening occurred due to the rugged terrain of the island.ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Seychelles/2008021712-FMEE Ivan was forecast to regenerate over the Mozambique Channel into a tropical depression once it left Madagascar.ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Seychelles/2008021812-FMEE Ivan traversed Madagascar, heading southwest. Its remnants emerged back over water on February 21, and M√©t√©o-France resumed advisories on \\"filling depression Ex- Ivan\\".ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Seychelles/2008022101-FMEE Ivan, severely disrupted by Madagascar, did not strengthen any further; the last advisory was issued on February 22.ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Seychelles/2008022212-FMEE Impact Cyclone Ivan intensifying on February 15 Cyclone Ivan moved ashore on Madagascar near the city of Toamasina on February 17, producing winds of 125 mph (200 km/h). According to local news agencies, Sainte Marie island off the coast of Madagascar was the highest affected area, with 9 people killed and 90% of the island's infrastructure destroyed, including a hotel which collapsed. On the island, all flights were suspended or canceled during the storm, and most areas were left without electric power. Also, 75 percent of the structures on the island were completely destroyed. On mainland Madagascar, of rice crops were destroyed, and of other cultivated crops were destroyed. Because of this, many families had little or no food to eat. In Analanjirofo, the worst hit region on the mainland Madagascar, 80,000 people were left homeless, and most of the schools, houses and other structures were lost as a result of the flooding and high wind. Another major aspect of the damage there was the Antaratasy bridge, a connector between the region of Atsinanana and cities to the north, which was completely destroyed, isolating several people from their families. Its collapse, in addition to the extensive damage to communications, made it difficult or impossible to contact people who may have been affected by Ivan. In the city of Toamasina, all water and electricity were cut off as a result of the storm. High winds downed trees and power lines, and rising flood waters were the focus of concern. In the region of Alaotra Mangoro Region, almost 23,000 people were in need of assistance, and flooding caused extensive damage. In the Analamanga Region, 18,000 people were reported to be left without shelter, and in the Atsinanana Region, up to 13,000 people were left homeless. In total, 190,000 people were homeless as a result of the cyclone and a total of 93 fatalities occurred. Aftermath Following the cyclone, the U.S. Agency for International Development airlifted relief commodities and supplies to Madagascar. The U.S. Agency for International Development also provided 320 rolls of plastic sheeting valued at $213,100 (2008 USD), which provided shelter assistance to 3,000 affected families, and they provided an additional $100,000 (2008 USD) to CARE and the U.N. World Food Program to re-establish ground access to affected areas, and deliver emergency supplies and food aid. This brought the total U.S. Government's assistance to Madagascar following the cyclone to more than $300,000. Almost 140 volunteers were provided by Malagasy Red Cross in seven districts in the eastern part of the country to help in relief aid. The Malagasy Red Cross received extra supplies from the French Red Cross which mobilized its intervention platform in the Indian Ocean to provide logistical support. Twelve tonnes of material was provided from the main center on La Reunion Island, including tarpaulins, tool kits, generators, water tablets and other emergency supplies. Also, the Malagasy president made a donation of 8 millions of ariary to local branches of the Malagasy Red Cross along with 20 tonnes of rice. As a result of this, the Red Cross was able to distribute emergency items to 1,207 families; each family received 16 kilograms (35 pounds) of rice, 500 grams (17 ounces) of salt, 1.5 litres (50 fluid ounces) of oil, two bars of soap, candles and a lighter.

Career Tapani Rinne, one of the best-known and respected contemporary jazz musicians and composers in Finland, studied music at the prestigious Sibelius Academy between 1981 and 1986. As an alumnus of the famed Edward Vesala's Sound & Fury workshops, he continued to experiment with jazz and became one of leading figures in Finland's contemporary jazz scene. Close collaboration eventually lead Edvard Vesala and Rinne to start a new group called RinneRadio and to release the eponymous debut in 1988. RinneRadio's reputation as something radically new was cemented with following albums Dance and Visions (1990), Joik (1992), Unik (1994) and Rok (1996) when Rinne took over Vesala's role as the composer and pushed the ever-evolving group into fervent exploration of new soundscapes beyond jazz, drum & bass, ambient and even techno - well before these kinds of mash-ups became trendy a few years later. Unik brought the group the Emma award for best jazz album of the year in 1994, equivalent to the Grammy in Finland. In 1992 Rinne had also received a personal accolade in the form of Yrj√∂ award for the best jazz musician of the year, given by the Jazz Federation of Finland. RinneRadio released their 14th album, On, in 2007. In 2008 RinneRadio released a compilation album titled \\"20\\" to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the band. The album was compiled by asking radio and club DJ's to list tracks for their dream RinneRadio album.http://www.rinneradio.com/disco/d_20.htm In 2009 it was time for a new material in the form of album Pole Stars. Despite the fact that RinneRadio was and still is a major part of Rinne's artistic legacy, he has sought new collaborations outside RinneRadio. In 1991 he joined Jimi Tenor, another saxophone experimentalist and produced an album called Suburban Sax. Rinne also worked closely with the Sami yoik singer Wimme on his four albums, produced the accordionist Kimmo Pohjonen's albums Kielo and Kluster and composed music for numerous television series, documentaries, films, dance pieces, and circus shows. In 1999 he embarked on a new journey, his first solo album, which was based on the music he composed for the Swedish television series Insider. The minimalistic, almost glacial music was a distinct departure from RinneRadio's beat driven sound. He continued solo excursions in 2002 with Nectic, and in 2005 with the Silent Night, which featured new interpretations of traditional Christmas carols. In 2002, Rinne formed SlowHill with the well-known Finnish DJ Slow (DJ), a former member of the band Pepe Delux√©. Their band fused jazz sounds with electronic beats and got their first album Finndisc released on Blue Note Records. In 2005 SlowHill released their second album Fennika on Plastinka Records. Rinne also composed the score with Slow (DJ) for the Finnish movie Koti-ik√§v√§, which was nominated for the Finnish equivalent of the Oscar, the Jussi Award. Summer 2010 saw the release of the third SlowHill album, called Muzak via Universal Music Finland. In 2011 he collaborated with the percussionist Teho Majam√§ki and they released together an instrumental album Inside the Temple, which was recorded in entirely in temples in India's Maharashtra.http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=39832 Discography =Albums (as composer/producer)= *Tapani Rinne: Silent Night (2005), Nectic (2002), Insider (1999) *Tapani Rinne & Teho Majam√§ki: Inside the Temple (2011) *RinneRadio: Pole Stars (2009), 20 (2008), On (2007), \\\\+ (2006), Pan (2004), Lumix (2003), Nao (2001), B (1999), G (1998), pfft (1997), Rok (1996), Unik (1994), Joik (1992), Dance And Vision (1990), RinneRadio (1988) *Wimme: Mun (2009), Cugu (2000), Gierran (1997), Wimme (1995) *SlowHill: Muzak (2010), Fennika (2005), Finndisc (2002) *Jimi Tenor and Tapani Rinne: Suburban Sax (1991) =As sideman= With Edward Vesala *Lumi (ECM, 1986) References External links *Official website of Tapani Rinne *RinneRadio‚Äôs official website *RinneRadio‚Äôs page on MySpace *RinneRadio review on All About Jazz *Rinne & Majam√§ki review on All About Jazz 1962 births Living people Finnish jazz musicians Finnish electronic musicians Experimental musicians ","title":"Tapani Rinne"},{"id":"16027687","text":"Vasko Bo≈æinovski () (born 11 March 1975) is a retired footballer from the Republic of Macedonia who played most of his career as a central defender for Makedonija Gjorƒçe Petrov.

It was also released as a promo single in US. The single became a chart hit in France and Belgium. However, some have labeled it the worst song Dylan ever wrote. A 2013 reader's poll conducted by Rolling Stone ranked \\"Man Gave Names to All the Animals\\" the 4th worst Bob Dylan song, behind the hit single from Slow Train Coming \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\" in second place. \\"Man Gave Names to All the Animals\\" has been covered by multiple artists, including Townes Van Zandt, who covered the song on his 1993 album Roadsongs. The lyrics were turned into a children's book published by Harcourt in 1999, with illustrations by Scott Menchin. The Singing Kettle covered this song in the second episode of their third BBC TV series. The Wiggles covered it on their \\"Furry Tales\\" CD in 2013. Lyrics and music The music to \\"Man Gave Names to All the Animals\\" is reggae-inspired. The lyrics were inspired by the biblical Book of Genesis, verses 2:19‚Äì20 in which Adam named the animals and birds. The lyrics have an appeal to children, rhyming the name of the animal with one of its characteristics. So after describing an animal's \\"muddy trail\\" and \\"curly tail,\\" Dylan sings that \\"he wasn't too small and he wasn't too big\\" and so that animal was named a pig. Similarly, the cow got its name because Adam \\"saw milk comin' out but he didn't know how\\" and the bear got its name because it has a \\"great big furry back and furry hair.\\" In the last verse, the lyrics take a more sinister turn. :Saw an animal as smooth as glass :Slithering his way through the grass :Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake The verse ends there, with the music hanging and the lyrics avoiding naming the snake. In concert, Dylan sometimes elaborated on the meaning of the snake to him at the time. For example, in a concert in Pittsburgh in May 1980 Dylan confirmed that the animal in the final verse is the same snake that appeared to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. In Dylan's description that day, Lucifer had put his spirit into that snake, and Jesus later died not only for forgiveness of sins but also to destroy the devil's work. Despite the obvious biblical source for the song, Dylan avoids any explicit mention of Adam and Eve, which to author Oliver Trager seems to pin the blame for the fall of man solely on the snake. Music critic Michael Gray finds it interesting that Dylan avoids blaming Eve for man's fall, appreciating that he stops \\"the song short on a beautifully hungover note at the arrival on the scene of the serpent. According to backup singer Regina Havis Brown, originally Dylan wasn't sure if he wanted to include \\"Man Gave Names to All the Animals\\" on Slow Train Coming. But when Dylan heard Brown's three-year-old son laughing at the identification of the animals, he said that \\"I'm going to put that on the record.\\" Live performances Dylan regularly played \\"Man Gave Names to All the Animals\\" in concert between 1979 and 1981, and he played it in concert again during his 1987 European tour in light of the song's popularity there. In concert he often played with the lyrics switching animals and messing up the rhymes. For example, the line \\"he wasn't too small and he wasn't too big\\" might be followed by identifying the animal as a giraffe rather than a pig. Dylan's backup singers would often hiss to replace the missing line identifying the snake. Reception Rolling Stone described \\"Man Gave Names to All the Animals\\" as being \\"clever\\" but \\"not very profound\\" and that although it \\"went over pretty well live\\" it is \\"simplistic\\" and easy to see \\"why it has detractors.\\" Author John Nogowski calls it \\"an embarrassment,\\" \\"silly\\", and \\"just awful.\\" But music critic Michael Gray praises it as one of the standout tracks on Slow Train Coming, citing its humor, its quality as a children's song, and the self-mocking contrast to the more fundamentalist tone of the songs Dylan wrote during this period.

Early life Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, his father disappeared and his mother Chrystal was left to bring him up alone. Needing to work, she gave him to the couple who had brought her up as an orphan. They were \\"dirt farmers\\" in Michigan and were in their 60s when they took her son. Dunning joined the U.S. Navy in San Diego at the age of 16, his foster parents having died. He served in the Asian and Pacific fleets and spent time in the merchant navy before settling in Shanghai, where he married a Chinese woman. There he became a lieutenant of police in the British sector of the city (at that time divided between the United States, France, Britain and Japan). When the Japanese invaded China and Shanghai, he remained in his post as a non-combatant until 1941, when the United States entered the war. He was then interned in the Lunghua prison camp where he became the representative of the prison population. He spent four years as a prisoner of war. After the Japanese surrender, he received the sword of the camp commandant. He worked for the U.S. intelligence agency OSS. He met his second wife, Elizaveta Maximovna Smoleff, in another prison camp. They were married in the Russian Orthodox church in Shanghai in 1946. Return to the United States In 1949, with the victory of the Communists under Mao Zedong, the family, now with one child, were obliged to leave China and arrived in the United States with nothing. After a succession of jobs, Dunning's second child was born in Connersville, Indiana and the family finally moved to St. Petersburg, Florida. There Dunning became a boat builder and entrepreneur but fell afoul of the Internal Revenue Service and left the United States forever in 1959. Writing career The family settled in Heidelberg, Germany and Dunning became a journalist for a local English language news sheet, and then an author. In 1966 he moved to Paris, and then to Luxembourg in 1972. Dunning became an established author in the true crime genre and used many European cases in his articles for American true crime magazines. His friend Colin Wilson in England persuaded him to publish his stories in book collections. Dunning held strong views on crimes against children and frequently advocated the death penalty for such criminals in the forewords of his books. His total sales exceeded 15 million and his works were translated into many languages. His taking of Luxembourg nationality made him, by far, Luxembourg's most prolific author. Death John Dunning died in Luxembourg in March 1990, leaving his wife, two daughters and two grandchildren. A third grandchild was born in 1991.

Setting The Horner Site is located in the foothills of the Absaroka Range, on a terrace of land overlooking the confluence of Sage Creek and the Shoshone River, east of the town of Cody. The terrace is relatively flat, and has historically seen some cultivation.

In 1948, he notified Glen Jepsen, an archaeologist at Princeton University, of his finds. Jepsen, who had been performing investigations elsewhere in the Bighorn Basin, organized the first excavations on the site, in August 1949.Frisson and Todd, pp. 20-21 Over the next three years, a number of excavations took place at the site, garnering national press interest, and visits by a great many scientists studying the early history of man in North America.

He was a Doctor of Philosophy (B. Litt.) at the Paris Institute of Political Studies. Sautet was a former Trotskyist who however edited two books on the German philosopher and philologist Friedrich Nietzsche. Marc Sautet emphasised that Nietzsche was a precursor of his time. Sautet branched out from his normal academic career as a lecturer by giving philosophy consultation services to businessmen in the bourgeois district of Le Marais in Paris around 1990 to 1991. He opened up his \\"cabinet de philosophie\\" charging consultation fees of some 200 Francs an hour, an amount similar to a professional psychoanalyst of the time. This was not a successful enterprise for Sautet, however it did lead him to setting up informal philosophising for the ordinary citizen in Parisian cafes starting in 1992 (the Caf√© Philosophique). He called this movement \\"caf√© for Socrates,\\" which became the title of one of his books (1995). Sautet seemed to have been a quite likeable person that influenced others considerably. He wished his philosophy cafes to be for all people (parleurs de la taverne)) and to encourage freedom of expression regardless of academic background. He did not want power, money, nor religion to influence the discussions. He wished to revive the Socratic method at the meetings. He claimed, I help my clients to structure their thoughts. I am there to nourish their doubts and pose the right questions, not to supply the answers.Cafe philoSteeped in Thought: The Philosophy caf√© Movement Sautet considered his work, after Freud, as the practice of a sort of medicine (philotherapy). He desired to cure the European civilization of moral deterioration. He followed with passion international events, especially in Europe. Sautet wanted to bring people's everyday problems and ideas to birth.Raabe, p. 37  Philosophy cafe  Sautet, who has sometimes been labeled the \\"modern Socrates,\\" wished to recreate the agora - the Athens marketplace where Athenian philosophers and the general public met for social gatherings and talks.David Rohde, New Paris Import: Pondering the Big Questions at Cafes, New York Times; Nov 17, 1996; pg. CY11 The rules of his Caf√© Philosophique, also referred to as \\"caf√©s-philos\\", were that the speaker was to talk to everyone at all times, not to any individual. The speaker was not to be an expert on any subject and one person (probably the moderator) was to pick the topic of discussion.

Coventry City is an English football club based in Coventry in the Midlands. The club was founded in 1883 as Singers F.C. by Willie Stanley, an employee of cycle firm Singer Motors. In 1898, the name was changed to Coventry City. The club first joined the Football League after World War I and in 1938, the club missed out on promotion to the First Division by one point. Since the 1960s, the club has been nicknamed 'the Sky Blues' owing to the colour of their kit introduced by manager Jimmy Hill. Arriving in 1961, Hill and club chairman Derrick Robins led a revival of the club's fortunes which culminated in promotion to Division One in 1967. During their promotion season, the club went 25 games undefeated and reportedly attracted a crowd of over 50,000 spectators for a match with Wolverhampton Wanderers. City remained in the top tier of English football for over 30 years, winning the 1987 FA Cup under John Sillett, and in 1992, they became founding members of the Premier League. At the end of the 2000‚Äì01 season, they were relegated to the FL Championship. Since then, the club has been relegated twice more, experienced a change of ownership and, between 2013 and 2014, was temporarily forced to groundshare with Northampton Town.http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/history/highfield- road-100-years.htmhttps://www.ccfc.co.uk/club/club-history/  1883‚Äì1898: Singers F.C.  The earliest known organised football club in Coventry was Stoke F.C., founded in the suburb of the same name in 1869. The team did not play regularly and games were played under a variety of football rules, with some being closer to rugby union than Association football. By the late 1870s rugby had become dominant in the area, fuelled by the sport's popularity in local public schools such as Bablake and Rugby. Association football was reintroduced with the arrival of the bicycle industry in the city, and an influx of workers from Birmingham and the Black Country. In the 1880s each of the factories set up a football team. It was at one of these factories, that of the Singer Cycle Company, that Coventry City F.C. was born. The club was founded in 1883 by William Stanley, an employee of the factory, and initially known as Singers F.C. Stanley convened a meeting at the Lord Aylesford Inn in Hillfields, with colleagues from the factory in Canterbury Street including \\"Little Harry\\" Banks, George Bowers, Harry Hathaway, \\"Cock\\" Heath, Frank Moseley, Andrew Poole, and \\"Shiner\\" Turner. The club's first headquarters was the White Lion in Gosford Green and they began playing matches at pitch in Stoke called Dowells Field. The Singers Cycle Company founder, George Singer, became the first president of the club. Singers played around forty games in their first four years, which were basic in nature, lacking a regular playing staff and sometimes missing equipment such as goal nets. They joined the Birmingham County Football Association and the played opponents from across the Midlands including Hinckley, Langley Green and Small Heath. Admission to the games was free at that time, and players covered their own expenses. In 1887 Singers appointed J.G. Morgan as club secretary, and he oversaw a transformation of the club into a serious operation. Morgan was the first official at the club who did not play, and fulfilled a role similar to a modern manager. Singers relocated from their original pitch at Dowells Field to an enclosed ground called Stoke Road, located just to the south of the future Highfield Road location. The ground had a small stand and entrances close to the White Lion and Binley Oak pubs, where an admission fee of two pence was charged. The club played an organised fixture list for the first time in the 1887‚Äì88 season and also entered the Birmingham Junior Cup, reaching the semi-final. The following five seasons have been described by club historians as a \\"golden age\\", as the club's performances and attendances, as well as the quality of their opponents, improved steadily. Capitalising on the renewed interest in football within the city, Rudge F.C., attached to the rival Rudge Cycle Company, began to achieve their own success. Singers and Rudge developed a fierce rivalry, fuelled by competition between the two bicycle companies. Games between the two clubs attracted crowds as high as 4,000 by the end of the 1880s. Singers began the 1890‚Äì91 season with a new centre forward, Frank Mobley, regarded as one of the club's best players of the nineteenth century. Singers won their first trophy at the end of the season, defeating the Willenhall Pickwick 1‚Äì0 in the final of the Birmingham Junior Cup. They following season was even more successful with only four defeats and twenty-six wins from their thirty-four games, as well as a cup treble: the team lifted the Wednesbury and Walsall Cups as well as successfully defending the Birmingham Junior Cup. After returning to Coventry from the final of the last, another victory over Willenhall at Perry Barr stadium, many fans turned out to welcome them home. Local businessman David Cooke, who would later become the club's chairman, produced a \\"Three Cups Tobacco\\" to celebrate the event. The future seemed bright for the club, but financial problems at the cycle factory forced a number of top players to depart in the summer of 1892. Mobley, the previous season's hero, was among the departees, leaving for Small Heath where he went on to enjoy a successful First Division career. Despite a slump in form as a result of losing their best players, Singers continued to develop administratively through the 1890s. The club became professional in 1892 but the status was largely symbolic as many players remained amateur and the professionals only received expenses and match fees. It was still a \\"shop club\\" which meant that only Singers factory employees were permitted to play. They entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1892 and began to play a full league fixture list from 1894, competing in the Birmingham and District League with games against the strong reserve sides of established Midlands clubs including Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion. There was a perennial proposal through the decade to change the club's name, given the growing support from Coventry residents not connected with the cycle factory. Club president George Singer, who was also mayor of Coventry in the early 1890s, favoured calling the club after the city but there was insufficient support within the club administration. The proposal finally gained the necessary support in 1898 as another slump in the factory's fortunes highlighted the desirability of distancing the football team from the company. Despite a last-minute objection from Coventry Rugby Club, who felt that the name was too similar to their own, the name change to Coventry City Football Club was approved by the Football Association (FA) on 12 August 1898.  1898‚Äì1919: Non-league years as Coventry City  The club's first season as Coventry City was not a very successful one, with the opening game lost 5‚Äì0 to Wellington Town and no victory recorded until six games into the campaign. This was the last season at Stoke Road, as the land was earmarked for a housing development to accommodate Coventry's rising population. Building work began on Highfield Road in early 1899 but the cost of building the new stadium put the club into a perilous financial situation. The club decided not to pay its players for the last few games of the season, which led to a strike. Despite a 1‚Äì0 win over Shrewsbury Town in the opening game, the first season at Highfield Road was disastrous and the club finished bottom of the Birmingham Junior League. The financial problems and disputes with players continued and the 1900‚Äì01 season proved even worse than the previous, with 102 goals conceded and a 14‚Äì0 defeat to Aston Villa reserves representing the biggest defeat in the club's history. The following season was also a poor one, including a 10‚Äì2 FA Cup defeat to Worcester-based Berwick Rangers. A better season followed in 1902‚Äì03 with a seventh-place finish, but it was a brief reprieve and in 1905 the club had to re-apply for its membership of the Birmingham Junior League for a third time in five years. The club restructured itself in the summer of 1905, in a bid to reverse the long run of poor performance. The board was replaced by a \\"syndicate\\", headed by Frank Lee, with Joe Beaman taking over training duties. New players were added, including goalkeeper‚Äìcaptain Harry Whitehouse and Jimmy McIntyre, an inside-left who would later become the club's manager. The following two seasons were much more successful. The change of management was not completely flawless, as the club's previous board made a complaint to the FA. The resulting investigation found shortcomings in the management of the club, and the syndicate was fined ¬£10. Acting on the FA's advice, they registered the club as a limited company in 1907. Shares worth five shillings were sold, yielding a capital return of ¬£2,000. Lee became secretary of the new entity, while Thomas Owen was named as chairman. Following the addition of several more new players the 1907‚Äì08 season was Coventry's best so far, as they reached the first-round proper of the FA Cup for the first time. They won six qualifying matches in the cup run, including a 7‚Äì1 win over Bishop Auckland. In the first round they played Crystal Palace of the Southern League, losing 4‚Äì2 in front of 10,000 supporters. In the league City finished in fourth place, scoring 97 goals, with an 11‚Äì2 win over West Bromwich Albion reserves the highlight. The stars of the side was Albert Lewis, who was described by the Coventry Evening Telegraph as the club's best player of the Birmingham Junior League era, and Billy Smith, scorer of forty goals. After the season finished Coventry applied to join the Southern League, which at the time was regarded as the third-best division in the country with clubs of a similar stature to those of the Football League's second division. Crystal Palace, who had been impressed by City's performance and supporters in the FA Cup game, were vocal in support for the application and it was duly accepted on 27 May 1908. Coventry City struggled in their first season of Southern League football, partly because their election was confirmed too late for them to sign new players suitable for the new level of football and because star-player Lewis left the club. They finished second-bottom of the league and escaped relegation only because of an expansion from twenty to twenty-two teams. In the middle of the season the club adopted a nickname for the first time, becoming the \\"Bantams\\" in a reference to their light-weight status as newcomers to the Southern League. David Cooke joined the board in mid-1909 and provided funds for City to invest in new playing staff. After another poor start to the season their fortunes changed with the signing of Patsy Hendren, a player who became better known as a cricketer, going on to play the sport for England. Coventry were challenging for the Southern League title at Christmas and went on to reach the FA Cup quarter final, beating top-flight teams Preston and Nottingham Forest before losing to Everton. They reached the third round in 1910‚Äì11 and also achieved their only title in the Birmingham Senior Cup with a 1‚Äì0 win over Stourbridge. The 1911‚Äì12 season was relatively successful, with a sixth-place finish, but City were beaten heavily in the FA Cup by Manchester United, making their first appearance at Highfield Road. The club then entered suffered a slump in fortune. They finished thirteenth in 1912‚Äì13 and financial pressure led to the cutting of the professional staff form 24 to 18. The following season they finished bottom of the league and were relegated to division two of the Southern League. The quality of teams was much lower and Coventry had some big victories in the 1914‚Äì15 season but the finances of the club were once more in grave danger. The club tried unsuccessfully to join the Football League's second division and came close to extinction in the summer of 1915. They were saved in part by the decision to abandon the upcoming FA Cup and Southern League seasons because of World War I. Although no football was played for the next few years City still had liabilities and in 1917 had to be rescued by David Cooke, who paid off the debts and began replenishing the club's staff. Seeking to make the step up to the Football League after the war, the club played regular friendly matches against local clubs such as Aston Villa during 1918 and then negotiated a place for itself in the 1918‚Äì19 Football League Midland Section, a temporary wartime division operating while the main league was suspended. The rules allowed guest players and City made use of two internationals based in Coventry during the war ‚Äì England's Jesse Pennington and Scotland's George Chaplin. The division was somewhat amateurish due to the absence of many players but Coventry acquitted themselves well, winning games against top-flight Nottingham Forest, Sheffield Wednesday, and Huddersfield Town. In early 1919 they made a speculative application for league status and were successful, topping the ballot and gaining entry to the second division when full-time football restarted in 1919‚Äì20.  1919‚Äì1931: Early Football League  Recognising the need to strengthen the playing squad and the administration of the club, the club made a number of investments in preparation for league football. Among the new signings were George Chaplin, who joined permanently had played in the wartime team, and inside-forward Alec Mercer of Bury. Highfield Road was upgraded, with a new capacity of 40,000. Despite these improvements, the club's first twelve years in the Football League were mostly disastrous, both on and off the field. Beginning with a 5‚Äì0 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur, City lost their first ten games in 1919‚Äì20 and failed to record a win until Christmas Day. William Clayton, manager since 1917, resigned a few months into the season. The club's form improved somewhat under new boss Harry Pollitt but, with one game remaining, City still remained in danger of finishing in the bottom two and having to seek re-election. In the season's final game, City came from behind to beat Bury 2‚Äì1 in front of a then-record 22,000 crowd. The win ensured the club's safety and meant Lincoln City lost their league place. The match became infamous, as it transpired some years later that Coventry and Bury had colluded to rig the game. The FA set up an enquiry in 1923 which concluded \\"The Commission is satisfied that an arrangement was made between Bury and Coventry allowing the latter to win\\". Both clubs received a heavy fine, along with life bans from football for several officials including David Cooke and later, in 1925, Harry Pollitt. Pollitt had left City in the 1920 close season and was replaced by Albert Evans. Evans signed some exciting new players such as Jerry Best and Jimmy Dougall but 1920‚Äì21 followed a similar pattern to the last. They spent most of it in last place and were saved only through a run of six wins and two draws in their final nine games. In 1921‚Äì22 they switched in the latter part of the season to a new-look kit which ditched the traditional blue and white for red- and-green halves, but remained poor on the field, escaping relegation by one point. Eighteenth- and nineteenth-place finishes followed in the subsequent two seasons and in 1924‚Äì25, facing their sixth relegation battle in a row, Coventry finally succumbed and were relegated to the Third Division North. It looked for a while as if they would stage another dramatic escape, climbing out of the relegation zone in March, but the form was not sustained and they slipped back to last place. Evans left the club in November 1924 and at the end of the season James Kerr was named as his replacement. The club reverted to their traditional blue-and-white colours at the beginning of 1925‚Äì26 but this did not inspire a reversal in the ongoing slump. Coventry spent one season in Division Three North and their poor form led to a decline in attendance to less than 1,000, the lowest in the league era. They finished in sixteenth place and were eliminated from the FA Cup in an embarrassing defeat to Midland League side Worksop. Stoke City and Stockport County were relegated into Division Three North that season and Coventry, being a Midlands team, were asked to move to Division Three South to keep the numbers even. This switch meant that some years later they were could claim the distinction of being the only club to appear in every division of the Football League ‚Äì First, Second, Third, Third‚ÄìSouth, Third‚ÄìNorth, and Fourth. The move of leagues had little effect on their performance as they continued to struggle for the next two seasons. In 1927‚Äì28 heavy defeats of 9‚Äì1 and 7‚Äì0, to Millwall and Watford respectively, followed by a first-round FA Cup exit to Bournemouth caused Kerr to resign. Lamenting the uninterrupted poor form since World War I, Evening Telegraph's columnist Derek Henderson, who wrote under the pseudonym \\"Nemo\\", wrote that \\"successive managements have either lacked the ambition or the ability to provide us with anything other than a third-rate team\\". Some fans began to call for the club to be wound up, allowing for a phoenix club to rise in its place. Coventry ended the season close to the bottom of the league, and in danger of having to seek re-election. In their final game at Northampton, they lost to a dubious goal and the fans began rioting. Ultimately they finished twentieth and narrowly avoided having to seek re-election, but morale was at an all-time low. The last manager of the 1920s was former-player Jimmy McIntyre, who took over the reins for the start of the 1928‚Äì29 season. McIntyre made several new signings and City finally began to enjoy greater success on the field. At Christmas they were in contention for the title, although they failed to maintain the same form in the latter half of the season and finished tenth. The next year they were again in contention, but were unable to overhaul runaway league leaders Plymouth, despite inflicting the Devon side's first defeat of the season around Christmas. The on-field performances had improved, but there were problems behind the scenes. Walter Brandish became the club's chairman in 1928 and began a bitter battle for control with rival W. Carpenter. McIntyre also fell out with the board, accusing them of meddling in team management. Meanwhile, the lack of success but heavy outgoings in the 1920s, coupled with some poor transfer decisions by McIntyre, had left the club heavily in debt. The effects of this were felt in 1930‚Äì31 with a disappointing league season and an early cup exit. McIntyre resigned, citing irreconcilable differences with the board, and Harry Storer was installed in his place.  1931‚Äì1946: The \\"Old Five\\" era  In contrast with the non-stop struggles of the 1920s, the 1930s went on to become one of Coventry's most successful decades. The city itself was growing in economic strength, in contrast to the Great Depression taking place elsewhere. The on-field success was attributed to new manager Harry Storer, who was managing his first club following a notable playing career in which he made two international appearances for England and also played first-class cricket. Before the start of the 1931‚Äì32 season he signed Clarrie Bourton and Jock Lauderdale, both of whom would go on to have storied careers with the club. Bourton, in particular, was an instant success and other clubs became interested in signing him a few months into the season. Reversing the previous trend of selling star players to help with the club's debt, the board resisted the temptation to sell him and he remained with the club. 1931‚Äì32 was also the season in which future star George Mason made his debut for the club, as Storer began building the side which would take the club to a new level. Coventry scored a total of 108 goals that season, scoring five or more in many games, which led to the nickname \\"The Old Five\\" for the team of that era. Bourton's individual tally of 49 goals was the Football League record for 1931‚Äì32, and his overall total of 50 remains the club record. The club would have to wait a few more seasons for promotion, but there was a renewed optimism. 1932‚Äì33 was another solid season, with Coventry finishing in sixth place and Bourton scoring 40 league goals. Then, in 1933‚Äì34, the club had its first genuine chance of promotion since dropping down to the third tier. They finished in second place, and scored over 100 goals for a third season in a row, setting a new league record. Coventry also recorded their largest ever league victory in April 1934, with a 9‚Äì0 against Bristol City. This tally included four goals from Clarrie Bourton. In 1934‚Äì35 City won their opening four games, and were top of the league table until after Christmas. The season finished less well, with the final seven games including only one win, as City finished third, but more players were added who would go on to make a long-term impact. This included Leslie Jones, whose swift impact on the team made him a summer target for Tottenham Hotspur. Coventry rejected a ¬£6,000 bid for him in the summer. In 1935‚Äì36 the club were finally, after several seasons of near-misses, promoted back to the Second Division, winning the Division Three South championship with another 100-goal season. With three games remaining the battle for promotion was between Coventry and Luton Town, with the two teams having to play each other home and away. Both games ended in dramatic draws, the Highfield Road encounter being played in front of a gate of 42,975 with many more refused entry. The final game against Torquay United was another thriller as George McNestry's second- half penalty was saved, and the team fell behind with fifteen minutes remaining in the game. With Luton drawing their final game, it seemed like promotion would be missed once again. The situation was rescued as Coventry equalised with another penalty, this time taken by Ernie Curtis, and they went on to win the game through a Clarrie Bourton goal with three minutes remaining. After the final whistle 10,000 fans invaded the pitch in celebration. The club made a solid start to life back in the second division, with an eighth-place finish in 1936‚Äì37. This was accompanied by off-field improvements such as the construction of a new main stand and the purchase of the freehold to Highfield Road, made possible by a loan of ¬£20,000 from local motor-industry entrepreneur John Siddeley. The season marked the first time Coventry met with local-rivals Aston Villa in league football, and supporters were rewarded with a win and a draw as well as a higher-placed finish than the Birmingham club. In 1937‚Äì38 they performed even better, being undefeated for the first fifteen games and finishing fourth, one point behind promoted Manchester United. They again finished fourth in 1938‚Äì39. But difficulties had started to emerge, particularly in the attack, which failed to replicate the free-scoring of the division three era. Several top players, including Bourton, were sold, as City sought to pay off its debts and balance the books, which led to some fan dissatisfaction. There was little transfer activity in the summer of 1939, due to the deteriorating political situation in Europe and the 1939‚Äì40 league season was aborted after only a few games with the start of World War II. Many fans at the time believed that the war had robbed the team of a probable promotion to the first division, although there was some evidence that the team was already beginning to decline by 1939. Coventry continued playing some friendly games until November 1940, when the Coventry Blitz damaged the stadium and brought all football in the city to a halt. Friendly matches resumed again in 1942, as parts of Highfield Road had been rebuilt, and the team joined the Midland Regional League. The only player connected with the club to be killed during the war was Arthur Bacon, who had played for City until 1935, but the successful team of the 1930s would nonetheless not reform. Harry Storer left to manage Birmingham City in 1945, while players such as William Morgan, Jack Astley, and George Taylor retired from the game.  1946‚Äì1958: Post-war slump  After the conclusion of World War II, league football resumed in 1946. Harry Storer was replaced as manager by Dick Bayliss, who had been his assistant, and some pre-war players, such as George Mason and Harry Barratt and goalkeeper Alf Wood, remained with the club. Another returnee was George Lowrie, who had been signed in 1939 and would go on to become the club's leading centre-forward. City finished eighth in 1946‚Äì47 and established a reputation for being difficult to beat. They suffered a major setback when Bayliss, who was returning from a scouting mission to Scotland, became stranded in a snowstorm in Yorkshire. He became seriously ill and died in April 1947. He was replaced by Billy Frith, who guided the club to another mid-table finish in 1947‚Äì48. The following season started disastrously, with City losing ten of their opening sixteen games and Frith was dismissed in November 1948. Storer was persuaded to leave Birmingham and return to Coventry, and had an instant effect with the team winning the first five games of his second spell and going on to escape relegation. This feat, following his earlier success with the club, enhanced his popularity with the club's supporters. The 1949‚Äì50 season started very badly for Coventry, with just one win in the first twelve games and conceding large numbers of goals. The signing of defender Martin McDonnell led to a temporary improvement, but another poor run in the new year left the club facing relegation. Once again, the club had to spend their way out of dange; the signing of Bryn Allen and Ken Chisholm inspired a successful last eight games and a mid-table finish. By contrast, the following season started very well and the club were top of Division Two table at Christmas. They made several expensive signings, including full-back Terry Springthorpe and striker Tommy Briggs, but these players had no impact at the club and a run of poor performance in the new year ended their promotion hopes. Despite a reasonable start to the 1951‚Äì52 season, this poor form resumed from September as an ageing City team ‚Äì the average was 31 years ‚Äì faced almost certain relegation by February. Despite several signings, the club were relegated back to Division Three South with a final-day defeat at Leeds United. The return to third-tier football led to a dramatic decline in attendance at Highfield Road, with average gates dropping from 22,000 to 13,000. This placed a strain on the club's finances, and they were forced to sell winger Norman Lockhart to Aston Villa for ¬£15,500. They finished in a reasonable sixth-place in their first season in the division but poor form returned in the 1953‚Äì54 campaign. With the club lying in the bottom half of the table, manager Harry Storer left in early November. According to the club he had resigned, but Storer himself described his departure as a sacking. The team was run by the board for a two months, after which Jack Fairbrother took over as manager. In April 1954 a new board was elected following a contentious annual general meeting. The new board was led by Erle Shanks and also featured Derrick Robins, who would later go on to become a highly influential figure in the club. Fairbrother signed some new players in the close season and the 1954‚Äì55 season started brightly with six wins in seven games, but they then failed to win in the following five. Fairbrother then left the club on 27 October, officially for health reasons ‚Äì his wife had been killed in an accident earlier in the year and he had been under considerable stress. But newspaper reports at the time suggested that he may have been ousted by the board as a result of the club's recent downturn in form. In January 1955 the club announced that Jesse Carver was to be the new manager, a role he began in June of that year with George Raynor as his assistant. Carver had achieved success with several clubs in Italy, including Juventus, Torino, and Roma, and began life at Coventry with the goal of taking the club to Division One. There was huge anticipation and optimism amongst the supporters that summer and a crowd of almost 25,000 attended the opening game against Bournemourth. The first part of the season was mixed, with good results at home offset by a poor away record. Carver signed forward Ken McPherson and, following a five wins in a row, the club were challenging for promotion by the end of the year. On 30 December, however, the board made a shock announcement that Carver was to leave the club. They cited health reasons for his departure, and chairman Shanks insisted at the press conference that he was not leaving to pursue opportunities overseas. But, within days, Carver announced that he was to become the new Lazio manager and it was later revealed that he had been unhappy in the Midlands and seeking a move back to Italy since September. Raynor took over as manager until the end of the season. In January 1956 Coventry played a controversial match against the four-time Argentinian champions San Lorenzo de Almagro. San Lorenzo were touring Europe, including games in Spain, France, and Italy, as well as the UK, but were not used to the winter conditions and the routine deterioration of English pitches through the season at the time. They arrived in Coventry having lost all their games in the UK thus far, to Brentford, Rangers, Sheffield Wednesday, and Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves), the last featuring altercations with the referee. Trouble flared up again at Highfield Road, as Coventry were awarded a controversial penalty before half-time. San Lorenzo's Jos√© Sanfilippo, a future Argentina international, reacted by kicking the referee, Arthur Ellis, and then refusing to leave the field when sent off. Ellis then called the game off. There was better news for Coventry later in the season as goalkeeper Reg Matthews was called up to the England national team and George Curtis, who would go on to become a Coventry legend as player and manager, made his debut at the age of 17. After the conclusion of the season, City appointed Harry Warren as the replacement permanent manager for Carver, the club's sixth in just five years. Warren's first season in charge was not a success, as once again a promising start was followed by a slump. Warren favoured a more physical style of play, rather than the continental system used by his predecessor. Raynor, who felt that he should have been given the managerial position full-time, left the club in November 1956 and then they lost star goalkeeper Reg Matthews, who was bought by Chelsea for ¬£22,000, a record fee for a goalkeeper at the time. Poor form and injury meant the club finished in 16th place, with gates down from 20,000 at the start of the season to just 5,000 by the end. 1957‚Äì58 proved even worse: Warren was dismissed in September following a poor start, to be replaced by Billy Frith, returning for a second spell in charge, but form did not improve and City finished 19th. The league was to be reorganised at the end of the season, an idea originally proposed by Coventry themselves, with the two regional third divisions replaced by a single nationwide third and a new fourth division. City were placed in the latter following their bottom- half finish, consigning them to their lowest tier of football since joining the Football League.  1958‚Äì1967: Rise to the top  Despite an early-season blip, which saw Coventry occupy their lowest-ever league position of 91st after three games, the club's stay in Division Four limited to just one season. Finances were extremely tight but Frith made some shrewd low-cost signings, including Irish international Reg Ryan, Alan Daley, and Accrington's George Stewart. When the club's goalkeeper, Jim Sanders, broke his leg in September Frith persuaded 44-year-old Alf Wood, who played his first game in 1938 and had returned to the club as a trainer, to take his place. Wood played ten games, of which the team lost only one, before being replaced with the signing of Arthur Lightening. Frith's tactics paid off, and City were promoted in second place, behind Port Vale. Coventry's good form continued in the 1959‚Äì60 season, and they were a contender for a second-successive promotion until Easter. But a run of three defeats in the final matches meant that they missed out. Once more in a perilous financial situation, Coventry started 1960‚Äì61 poorly with only four wins in the first sixteen games. They rallied in the middle part of the season, but another poor run consigned them to a poor finish. The most significant aspect of the season was that Walter Brandish was replaced by Derrick Robins as club chairman; it was under Robins' chairmanship that the club's fortunes were transformed. The 1961‚Äì62 season marked the beginning of what would later be called the \\"Sky Blue revolution\\", as Jimmy Hill replaced Frith as manager in December. The first months of the season were amongst the worst in the club's history, as the club lacked a consistent centre-forward. The nadir came with a second-round FA Cup defeat to King's Lynn, an amateur side from the Southern League; Frith and his team were dismissed four days later, although it later transpired that Robins' decision to appoint Hill had been made before the King's Lynn game. Hill immediately began changing things within the club, introducing Monday training to allow for more rest at the end of the week before Saturday matches, training in the afternoon, and allowing players to speak to the media. Despite initial optimism over Hill's arrival, performances on the field remained poor through the rest of the season and City finished in 14th place. For the supporters it seemed like yet another false dawn under a new manager, and attendances dropped to just 6,000. But Hill, with strong support from Robins, was already planning for the following season. Coventry began 1962‚Äì63 with a raft of changes instigated by Hill. This included a change of strip, to a sky-blue colour, with City becoming the first club in England to wear shirts and shorts with a matching colour. The change of colour came with an associated nickname change, the \\"Bantams\\" moniker being dropped in favour of the \\"Sky Blues\\", and Hill wrote the \\"Sky Blue Song\\", sung to the melody of the \\"Eton Boating Song\\", which was still being sung at matches by Coventry supporters fifty years later. They made a number of new signings such as Peterborough's Terry Bly and John Sillett from Chelsea, made possible by a ¬£30,000 injection of funds by Robins. The club did not achieve promotion that season, with a fourth-place finish, but had their most successful run in the FA Cup for many years, beating Bournemouth, Millwall, Lincoln, Portsmouth, and Sunderland en route to a quarter-final defeat by Manchester United. The fifth round match again Sunderland was one of the most-attended games ever at Highfield Road; the official figure was just over 40,000 but, with many fans entering the stadium through three gates which were broken down, it is likely to have been closer to 50,000. In April, Hill bought a new striker, George Hudson, as a direct replacement for Terry Bly. The decision was highly controversial with supporters and the press, as Bly had already scored twenty-seven goals in his debut season and was already a crowd favourite at Highfield Road. But Hill believed Hudson to be a better long-term fit for the team he wished to build, playing up front alongside Ken Hale and Bly was effectively frozen out. Hudson was an instant success, scoring a hat-trick on his debut, while Bly was sold to Notts County later in the year and the remainder of his career was largely unsuccessful. The next season, 1963‚Äì64, Coventry finally achieved promotion back to Division Two. The star of the team was Hudson, who scored twenty-one goals before Christmas, and City were nine points clear at the top of the table by January. They then suffered a reversal of fortune, going eleven games without victory, and by February the lead was down to just one point. Hill made some changes, including the emergency signing of George Kirby as a controversial replacement for the temporarily-out-of-form Hudson. City appeared to have missed out on promotion when they lost 2‚Äì0 at Peterborough in April, but they were saved by some poor results for their rivals and a winner by the returning Hudson in a final-day victory over Colchester, giving them the championship. The club's first two seasons back in the second tier resembled the pre-war seasons of 1936‚Äì37 and 1937‚Äì38: in 1964‚Äì65 they started very well, briefly going top of the table after five games, but eventually finishing with a solid mid-table finish. Then, in 1964‚Äì65, followed a genuine promotion challenge as Coventry missed out by a point. Hill courted controversy once more by selling George Hudson during the season to Northampton for ¬£29,000. New signings during this time included goalkeeper Bill Glazier and striker Ian Gibson, while local player and future manager, Bobby Gould, began to appear regularly in the side. Having narrowly missed out the previous season, Coventry were promoted to Division One in 1966‚Äì67. After a solid start, they suffered a loss of form and were in tenth place in November. Hill angered supporters yet again by dropping their favourite striker, in this case Ian Gibson. After a defeat at Carlisle, Gibson and Hill had an altercation in the dressing room and Gibson was dropped and transfer- listed on his own request. As the club continued to slide, Hill and Gibson eventually made up and the forward was returned to the side for a 3‚Äì2 win over Cardiff, in which he scored twice. The team then achieved a run of twenty-five straight games without defeat, with Gibson playing a vital role in the revival. Promotion was confirmed in April when rivals Blackburn drew at home to Bolton, but Division Two title was still at stake as Coventry played their penultimate game of the season against Wolves, who were also already promoted. The match, played on 29 April 1967, attracted the largest crowd in Highfield Road's history with an official gate of 51,455 and probably many thousands more who were not counted. Dubbed the \\"Midlands Match of the Century\\" by Hill, the game was dominated by Wolves for the first hour, and the visitors led 1‚Äì0 at half time. It was Coventry's day, however, as Ian Gibson created two goals and scored one to record a 3‚Äì1 victory. This was followed up with a City win and a Wolves defeat on the final day, giving Coventry the championship.  1967‚Äì1975: Early top-flight years and European football  Excitement grew amongst the supporters through the summer of 1967, ahead of the team's first- ever season in the top flight. But two days before the first game, the board made announced that Jimmy Hill was resigning from the club to work for London Weekend Television. He had been planning the move for most of the summer, but the news was a complete surprise to the public, and Hill had continued to talk of his plans for the First Division in interviews. The Evening Telegraph's Derek Henderson (\\"Nemo\\"), who broke the story, ascribed Hill's departure to his constant desire to pursue new challenges. In his 1968 book about the club's history, Henderson wrote \\"like a mountaineer who climbs his mountain just because it is there, [Hill] has to go on and seek another mountain to conquer\\". Hill remained in charge for the first few games of the 1967‚Äì68 season, standing down on 12 October when the club appointed Noel Cantwell as his successor. Hill went on to have a successful career in broadcasting, which included the hosting of the BBC's Match of the Day programme from 1973 to 1989. Coventry struggled in their first season in Division One, hindered by a broken leg to George Curtis in the second game, and by January they were at the bottom of the table, with just 16 points from 25 games. They began to recover from February with league wins over West Browmich Albion, Chelsea, and Sheffield Wednesday, although they were eliminated from the FA Cup by Tranmere. On 6 March 1968 a large fire broke out in the main stand, destroying half the seats as well as melting the Second Division championship trophy. Despite this, the home game against Manchester United went ahead ten days later, with more than 47,000 supporters present as Coventry beat the previous season's champions and soon-to-be-crowned European cup winners 2‚Äì0. Coventry entered the last game of the season knowing that they would be safe from relegation if they matched the result of Sheffield United. They drew 0‚Äì0 with Southampton while United were defeated against Chelsea, securing the first of ten last-day escapes in their top-flight years. The 1968‚Äì69 season proceeded almost identically to the previous, with the club managing only fourteen points in twenty-five games by February. They fought back again, and finished their games outside the relegation zone, but cup-finalists Leicester had five games remaining and would send Coventry down if they achieved seven points. They only managed five, and City were safe again. Despite the media and bookmakers predicting another season of struggle, Coventry recorded their most successful league season ever in 1969‚Äì70, securing a sixth-place finish. The Sky Blues took eight points from a possible ten in the first five games, and recorded a record total of ten away wins in the campaign, including a 3‚Äì1 win at second-placed Derby, which Brian Clough described as \\"brilliant\\". The top- six finish earned Coventry a place in the European Fairs Cup for the 1970‚Äì71 season, and supporters optimistically thought the club had a genuine chance of winning the competition. The European campaign started well, with an easy win over two legs against Trakia Plovdiv, but a 6‚Äì1 defeat in Germany against Bayern Munich effectively ended the campaign after two rounds. City salvaged some pride in the second leg, as 26,000 supporters watched them beat the Germans 2‚Äì1 at Highfield Road. Their league form also slumped, as they finished in tenth place with just 37 goals scored, and they were beaten in the FA Cup by Third Division club Rochdale. One bright spot on the season was the home game against reigning-champions Everton, which Coventry won 3‚Äì1. The game featured a \\"donkey kick\\" goal, in which Willie Carr flicked a free-kick backwards with both feet to Ernie Hunt, who scored. The goal won the BBC Goal of the Season award, but the technique was outlawed at the end of the season. City's form dipped further in 1971‚Äì72, as they finished 18th and were beaten in the FA Cup in a home game against Hull City. Noel Cantwell was sacked in March 1972, following a run of eleven winless games. He had achieved some success with the club but lamented \\"the ghost of Jimmy Hill\\", which he said followed him on the job. Three months after Cantwell's departure, Joe Mercer and Gordon Milne were appointed as joint managers of the club. City had offered the job to Brian Clough, who said that he had been very tempted to take it, but he instead opted to remain at Derby. They started out the 1972‚Äì73 season with the existing squad, seeking to play in what Mercer called \\"the attractive way\\". But after failing to win any of the first six games, they began a series of transfers to reshape the team. Notable incoming players included Colin Stein and Tommy Hutchison, both of whom would go on to become highly popular with the supporters, while Jeff Blockley was sold to Arsenal for a club-record ¬£200,000. The changes worked, as City went eight games unbeaten, including a 2‚Äì0 win at Arsenal featuring a much-lauded Hutchison goal. They also progressed to the FA Cup quarter final for the third time, but a poor performance at Wolverhampton Wanderers ended that run. League form also suffered and the club finished 19th. The following season started brightly, and wins at home to Liverpool, Manchester City and Derby put City in the top five after ten games. They progressed to the quarter-final of the League Cup and the fifth round of the FA Cup, but suffered narrow defeats in both. The league ended disappointingly again with a 16th-place finish. The club were plunged into financial difficulties in 1974. They purchased Larry Lloyd from Tottenham for ¬£240,000, with Mick McGuire and Jimmy Holmes due to be sold in the other direction for ¬£200,000, but the latter deal fell through after the former was already completed and Coventry faced a huge deficit. Derrick Robins left the club in April 1975 due a relocation to South Africa, ending a fifteen-year career at the helm which had transformed the club's history. Joe Mercer left his management position to become a club director at the same time, leaving Milne in sole charge of the team. On the field it was an indifferent season, with patchy league form and an early exit from both cups.  1975‚Äì1983: Return of Jimmy Hill  Robins' replacement as chairman was Sir Jack Scamp, a local industrial relations expert who had previously chaired Rugby Town F.C.. Scamp remained in the role for two years before being replaced by Phil Mead. More significant, however, was the return of Jimmy Hill to the club as managing director, which was announced at the end of the 1974‚Äì75 season. It was not initially clear what Hill's role would be, and his Coventry City duties were combined the job with his ongoing television and consultancy work, but his arrival was greeted with less optimism than when he had first joined the club in 1961. The 1975‚Äì76 season saw a similar pattern to the previous, but supporters were shocked when star midfielder Dennis Mortimer, who had been with the club since the age of fifteen, was sold to arch-rivals Aston Villa for ¬£175,000. The fans, who had assumed Mortimer would be the player around whom the team was built, were outraged at the apparent lack of ambition at Coventry, and the sale proved to be poor value as Mortimer went on to have a stellar career and captaincy at Villa, culminating in victory in the 1982 European Cup Final. After a few seasons without serious danger of relegation, and despite the arrival of influential players Terry Yorath and Ian Wallace, City struggled in 1976‚Äì77. A run of poor form after the new year left them in serious trouble, and they were in the bottom three going into the final game at home to Bristol City. Sunderland, Bristol and Coventry were level on points, and all battling to avoid one relegation spot, but with Coventry on the lowest goal difference. With five minutes left in the game at Highfield Road the score was 2‚Äì2, which would leave Bristol City certain of safety but Coventry facing the drop if Sunderland avoided defeat. At that point, however, news came through that Sunderland had lost their game at Everton, which meant that a draw would be sufficient for both Coventry and Bristol to avoid the drop. Both teams' managers informed the players of the situation, and they played out the final minutes without any attempt to score further goals. Sunderland lodged a complaint and the Football League conducted an enquiry into the situation, but Coventry were eventually exonerated. The 1977‚Äì78 season was a complete contrast, with a change in tactics by Gordon Milne, switching to an attacking 4‚Äì2‚Äì4 formation. The tactic meant City conceded more goals than previously, but with Yorath and Barry Powell as anchors in midfield, Hutchison and new signing Ray Graydon on the wings, and Wallace and Mick Ferguson as strikers, the attack were more than able to compensate. Coventry finished seventh, narrowly missing out on qualifying for Europe for a second time. A run of injuries led to a less successful campaign the following season, with a tenth-place finish. The club acquired new players Gary Gillespie and Steve Hunt for relatively low prices, both of whom would go on to enjoy success at the club. Despite their recent financial problems, Coventry attempted to make the first-ever ¬£1 million pound signing, of Trevor Francis, but the Birmingham striker elected to move to Nottingham Forest instead. A bid for Ipswich defender Kevin Beattie fell through over concerns about the player's fitness. The club's form suffered further in the 1979‚Äì80 season as they fell to fifteenth place in the league table, and exited the FA Cup in the fourth round to Third Division Blackburn. Phil Mead retired at the end of the season and Jimmy Hill, who had also acquired significant shareholdings in the club, was elevated to the chairmanship. During the close- season Coventry sold Ian Wallace to Nottingham Forest for a fee of ¬£1.25 million, using the proceeds to fund a new sports centre at the club training ground in Ryton-on-Dunsmore. They also negotiated a sponsorhip deal with Talbot, and attempted to rename the club to \\"Coventry Talbot\\". This proposal was rejected by the FA. The highlight of the 1980‚Äì81 season was a League Cup run which started with a win over Manchester United in the opening round, City winning both legs 1‚Äì0. By February the club had reached the semi-final of the competition, and were also enjoying league and FA Cup success, but the final months of the season were a disaster. They lost to West Ham United in the League Cup, through a late goal, to Tottenham in the FA Cup fifth round four days later, and then league form deserted them as they lost seven out of the next eight games. Only a late-season rally prevented City being sucked into the relegation fight. The poor form led Coventry to relieve Milne of his managerial duties, although he remained at the club in the role of general manager. Dave Sexton, who had previously managed Chelsea, Manchester United and Queen's Park Rangers was appointed as Milne's replacement. In the summer of 1981 Highfield Road was converted into an all-seat stadium, the second in the United Kingdom after Aberdeen's Pittodrie Stadium. Explaining the development, Hill cited the rise of hooliganism, saying \\"you can't be a hooligan sitting down\\". The capacity was reduced to just 20,500, a figure well below average attendances in the late 1960s. In the second game after the development visiting Leeds supporters ripped up seats to use as weapons against the police. The club also introduced an unusual kit for the new season, featuring a large \\"T\\" representing sponsors Talbot. Meanwhile, the club were selling key players including fan-favourite Tommy Hutchison, who departed for Manchester City, while failing to invest in replacements. The 1981‚Äì82 season started dismally, causing attendances to drop below 10,000. A late-season run of thirteen games with only one defeat and progress to the FA Cup quarter finals, inspired by former England captain Gerry Francis, left supporters feeling more optimistic by the end of the season. But this was short-lived, as further players were sold the following season including Garry Thompson, who was sold to West Bromwich for just ¬£225,000. The squad was left with just fourteen players in early 1983 and, with morale low, the club slipped from fifth place into another yet relegation fight. They escaped by one point but the relationship between Hill and the supporters was beyond repair and he left the club in May 1983. Dave Sexton was also dismissed and the terrace on the Kop re-introduced, ending Hill's all-seat experiment.  1983‚Äì1987: Rebuilding the team and FA Cup win  At the end of the 1982‚Äì83 season almost half of the squad were out of contract and, given the gloomy atmosphere at the club, most did not want to sign new contracts. Mark Hateley, Danny Thomas and Gary Gillespie were among the high-profile names to leave. The new manager was Bobby Gould, who summed up the bleak situation at the club by saying \\"I have been thrown into the lions' den\\". A native of Coventry as well as a former player, Gould was very knowledgeable about the league's lower divisions, from which he began rebuilding the team by recruiting inexpensive players. The new recruits included members of the future cup-winning side, Dave Bennett, Michael Gynn and Trevor Peake, as well as Micky Adams, Sam Allardyce and Stuart Pearce, the last of whom joined from non-league Wealdstone a few months into the season. Brian \\"Harry\\" Roberts, one of the few players from the previous season to remain with the club, became captain. The inexperience of the side and the poor finances at the club, which were made worse by the withdrawal of Talbot's sponsorship deal, meant that once more the bookmakers had Coventry amongst the favourites for relegation. Despite supporter and pundit expectations, Coventry performed quite well in the first half of 1983‚Äì84, rising to fourth in the table by December through a run which included a 4‚Äì0 win over champions Liverpool. But once again their form deserted them after the new year, and after a run even worse than the previous season's were saved only through a last-day win against Norwich, Birmingham being relegated instead as they failed to beat Southampton. Bobby Gould made several more signings in the summer and autumn of 1985, with the nucleus of the future cup-winning side beginning to take shape. Steve Ogrizovic, who would go on to break the club's appearance record, joined from Shrewsbury, Brian Kilcline moved from Notts County, and England-international Cyrille Regis switched from West Bromwich Albion. But the season started poorly, developing into another relegation fight, and Gould was sacked after two lacklustre defeats at Christmas, being replaced by his assistant Don Mackay. Their form improved, but they remained in deep relegation trouble. After a number of game cancellations in April due to a bout of flu, Coventry had three games to play after most other teams had completed their fixtures. Relegation rivals Norwich were eight points ahead, which left City requiring wins in all three games. In the first, they narrowly beat already-relegated Stoke, surviving when a late penalty hit the bar, and in the second they beat Luton with a winner six minutes before the end. The final game was at Highfield Road against Everton, who were already guaranteed the league championship. Coventry put on one of their best performances of the season, winning 4‚Äì1 to complete an unlikely escape and send Norwich down. In 1985‚Äì86 they faced their third successive relegation battle which went down to the final game. Home form was particularly poor, as City did not win any games at Highfield Road between 6 October and 22 February. Don Mackay resigned or was sacked in April, after a run of eight games without a win, replaced by George Curtis and the youth-team coach John Sillett for the final three games. Coventry won two of them and escaped relegation again. In 1986‚Äì87 Coventry won the only major trophy in their history as they beat Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley to win the FA Cup. The season began with low expectations, following the previous season's relegation battle, and they lost the opening game 1‚Äì0 at West Ham. But this was followed up with a win over Arsenal and they didn't lose another game until 4 October. They remained in the top half of the table for the remainder of the year, with Cyrille Regis and Dave Bennett showing improved from in attack and the defence conceding few goals. They scored a notable victory against top-of-the-table Nottingham Forest in November. and on 27 December they played a thrilling game against Tottenham which finished 4‚Äì3, Regis scoring the winner in the final minute. The FA Cup run began with a third-round tie against Third Division side Bolton Wanderers, managed at the time by future Coventry manager Phil Neal. City won 3‚Äì0 in frozen conditions, Greg Downs, Regis and Bennett the scorers. Coventry's fourth round match was against Manchester United at Old Trafford. Returning from the team's brief trip to Spain to escape the cold George Curtis told the press \\"Our name is on the cup\\", but United were the firm favourites. The game was once again played on a frozen pitch and Coventry won the game 1‚Äì0 through a Keith Houchen goal. Recently appointed United manager Alex Ferguson cited City's better play for his team's defeat, saying \\"their players were prepared to risk life and limb ‚Äì ours weren't\\". Another away match followed in the fifth round on 21 February, this time Second Division at Stoke City, who had suffered only one defeat since November. The home side played better in the first half but Coventry withstood the pressure and once again took the game 1‚Äì0, Michael Gynn scoring on the rebound after David Phillips had failed to convert a Nick Pickering cross in the 72nd minute. The quarter-final was at Hillsborough against Sheffield Wednesday and scores were level after a first-half Regis goal was cancelled out by a 67th- minute equaliser by Gary Megson. But Coventry scored twice in the final stages to progress to their first ever semi-final, against Leeds United. The semi- final was also played at Hillsborough, this time as a neutral venue, and 27,000 Coventry supporters travelled to Sheffield for the game. Leeds were in the Second Division at the time and City started as favourites, but the Yorkshire side started better, forcing goalkeeper Steve Ogrizovic to make two early saves and taking the lead after fourteen minutes. Coventry played better after going behind, with Regis going close to scoring on three occasions, and eventually equalised after 69 minutes through a Gynn goal. Houchen's goal ten minutes later gave them a 2‚Äì1 lead but Leeds equalised with seven minutes remaining. Dave Bennett scored nine minutes into extra time and City held on for the win. The club's league form suffered somewhat during the cup run ‚Äì despite challenging for a top-six finish at the turn of the year, they eventually finished tenth. In the FA Cup final, they beat an impressive side 3‚Äì2 in the final after extra time, the score having been 2‚Äì2 after 90 minutes. It is generally considered as one of finest finals of all time in terms of footballing technique, fair play and sheer excitement. This also finally made archaic the famous Monty Python 'World Forum' sketch, in which Coventry City's last FA Cup win is a trick question asked in a game show, as they hadn't won the Cup to that point. Coventry City's youth team also won the FA Youth Cup in 1987 (beating Charlton Athletic 2‚Äì1) to secure a remarkable 'double'. Aside from Coventry, only Arsenal, Liverpool and Everton have ever won both the FA Cup and FA Youth Cup in the same season. Key players in Coventry City's FA Cup winning team included goalkeeper Steve Ogrizovic, defender and captain Brian Kilcline, midfielders Dave Bennett and Lloyd McGrath, and strikers Cyrille Regis and Keith Houchen, who scored the famous diving header. Their manager at the time was John Sillett.  1987‚Äì1995: Post-cup-win years and launch of the Premier League  The city of Coventry enjoyed the glory of the Cup win during the summer of 1987, with supporters fixing sky-blue ribbons to their cars and extensive merchandise sales. Spending some of the profits made from their success, John Sillett bought David Speedie for ¬£780,000, a club-record at the time, announcing that the club would \\"no longer be shopping at Woolworth's, from now on we're shopping at Harrods\\". The club were unable to participate in the European Cup Winners' Cup as English clubs were still banned from European competition following the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster. The 1987‚Äì88 season began with another trip to Wembley, as Coventry played league-champions Everton in the FA Charity Shield. 40,000 Coventry supporters attended the game, which City lost 1‚Äì0. The first league game was a repeat of the FA Cup final, as Coventry played Tottenham, Speedie scoring in a 2‚Äì1 win. The season was a disappointment, however, with their defence of the FA Cup ending in a fourth-round home defeat to Watford and another tenth-place league finish. The following season City suffered one of the biggest upsets in FA Cup history, as they lost 2‚Äì1 to non-league Sutton United in the third round. They fared better in the league and were third in the table following a win over league- leaders Arsenal in late February. They eventually finished seventh, which was their highest finish since 1978, but the side was ageing by this time and many supporters felt that the club were not achieving their potential. Coventry replaced a number of players during the 1989 close-season, buying defender Peter Billing and acquiring Liverpool's Kevin MacDonald on a free transfer, with David Phillips and Steve Sedgley leaving the club. John Sillett felt that there was a bubble in the transfer market at the time and declined to spend large amounts of money on players despite having funds available. Despite a strong start, which saw the side top of the table after four games, City struggled to score goals and finished twelfth in the table. They suffered another embarrassing FA Cup defeat, this time to Third Division Northampton, but fared better in the League Cup, reaching the semi-final with a 5‚Äì0 win over Sunderland before losing to eventual winners Nottingham Forest in the semi-final. Despite the poor finish to the previous season, Sillett believed the club could challenge for the league title in 1990‚Äì91, despite not making any major signings. The season started badly, however, and Sillett left the club in November - it was unclear if he was sacked or merely brought forward an already planned end-of-season departure. He was replaced by Terry Butcher, who arrived from Rangers as player-manager, for a ¬£400,000 fee. Without prior experience in management Butcher struggled, and the club finished a disappointing 16th with a 5‚Äì4 fourth round League Cup defeat of holders Nottingham Forest the only significant success. In the early 1990s, clubs in the First Division made the decision to set up the breakaway Premier League, with the goal of increasing revenue from television broadcasts and removing the ability of lower-league clubs to contribute to decisions affecting the top flight. The 1991‚Äì92 season was thus the last in the old First Division before the launch of the Premier League, and it was another disappointing one for Coventry. Their first few games included home defeats to Manchester City and Wimbledon but also a surprise away win at Arsenal, with newly signed Zimbabwean Peter Ndlovu scoring his first goal for the club. They were in fourth place after nine games, but a slump followed and by Christmas City were descending towards the bottom of the table. Butcher, whose retirement as a player had led to a contract dispute, was dismissed in January after an FA Cup defeat to Cambridge. Don Howe took over but the club continued to play poorly and were pulled into a relegation fight. On the final day of the season City lost 2‚Äì0 at Aston Villa, ex-City-hero Cyrille Regis scoring the opener, but they were saved from relegation as rivals Luton were also defeated. The Premier League was launched in summer 1992 as the First Division clubs, including Coventry City following their last-day relegation escape, resigned en masse from the Football League. The club decided in summer 1992 to bring back Bobby Gould, who had enjoyed some success at Wimbledon and West Bromwich since his dismissal by Coventry, for a second stint as manager. The intention was for him to work jointly with Don Howe but the latter decided to step down due to a combination of ill health, a difficult commute and a lack of popularity with supporters. City therefore appointed Phil Neal as Gould's assistant. Coventry made a bright start to the season, occupying second place in the table after six of the first eight games were won. This was followed by a run of disappointing draws, which was halted with the arrival of Micky Quinn from Newcastle. Scoring ten goals in six games, Quinn inspired City to a 5‚Äì1 win over Liverpool in December, followed by a 3‚Äì0 result against Aston Villa. The fans warmed to Quinn instantly, using the chant \\"He's fat, he's round, he scores at every ground\\" in reference to his alleged overweight status. The season finished disappointingly with just one win from the last eleven games, slumping from a possible European place to finish 15th but the club were never in relegation danger. Bryan Richardson took over as chairman of the club in summer 1993 and the club made another strong start to 1993‚Äì94, opening with a Quinn hat-trick in a 3‚Äì0 win at Arsenal and being unbeaten after eight games. Trouble followed however, as a 5‚Äì1 defeat at Queen's Park Rangers was followed by Gould's resignation, the manager claiming that Richardson was forcing him into selling star striker Peter Ndlovu. Phil Neal took over and was initially allowed to strengthen the team rather than sell. The club played some positive football and possessed two top-class players in Ndlovu and Phil Babb, but remained unable to play consistently through a whole season and finished 11th. A strong end to the season meant that 1994‚Äì95 began with optimism, enhanced by Neal's purchase of Dion Dublin and American winger Cobi Jones. December injuries to Dublin and David Busst led to a poor run of results, culminating in FA Cup defeat to Norwich and supporters quickly turned against Phil Neal. Neal's reputation had also fallen with the release of \\"The Impossible Job\\", a documentary about former England manager Graham Taylor and Neal, his assistant, which portrayed the latter as a \\"yes man\\" with no independent opinions. He was sacked and replaced by Ron Atkinson, with Gordon Strachan named assistant manager.  1995‚Äì2001: Final years in the top flight  The arrival of Atkinson and Strachan, and Richardson's promise of considerable sums of money to spend on players, brought a sense of optimism to Highfield Road in the summer of 1995. Atkinson made several big-name signings in summer 1995 and during the season, including Brazilian Isa√≠as, John Salako, Nii Lamptey and Noel Whelan, who arrived for a then-club-record ¬£2 million. They also rejected offers of several million pounds each for Dublin and Ndlovu. After making a reasonable start, the team suffered their worst run in the top flight, playing fourteen league games without a win and by early December City were bottom of the table. They revived somewhat after Whelan's signing in December, but more poor results followed and by Easter, City appeared certain to be relegated. They avoided the drop by winning three of their final six games and benefiting on the final day as Manchester City played out a 2‚Äì2 draw without attempting to win, under the false belief that this would keep them up. Coventry continued to spend money on players during the summer of 1996, breaking their transfer record again with the purchase of Gary McAllister from Leeds for ¬£3 million. They suffered a poor start to the campaign though, and with Atkinson failing to bring success he was moved to the Director of Football role, handing over to his designated-successor, Strachan. They had a brief revival but as the season drew to a close they were fighting another relegation battle. For the third season in a row Strachan appeared for the team himself, despite being officially retired and inspired the team to a crucial win over Chelsea. They played Tottenham at White Hart Lane in the final game knowing that only a win and favourable results elsewhere would save them. In a match delayed by 15 minutes due to traffic, they held on for a 2‚Äì1 win and were safe again, their tenth and final last-day escape of the top- flight era. The 1997‚Äì98 season, Strachan's first full campaign in charge, was much more successful. A solid 11th-place finish in the league was accompanied by the club's best FA Cup run since 1987, ending only with a quarter-final replay defeat on penalties at Sheffield United. Notable wins during the season included a 3‚Äì2 win against champions Manchester United, featuring a Darren Huckerby goal that won goal of the month, an FA Cup win at Liverpool and the club's first ever win away to Aston Villa in the FA Cup fifth round. Dion Dublin's 18 league goals earned him a share of the Premier League Golden Boot for the season and he played for England during the season but failed to make the squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Off the pitch, Bryan Richardson revealed ambitious plans for the club's future including \\"Arena 2000\\", the initial proposals for the Ricoh Arena. The plans at that time envisaged a 40,000-seat stadium, to be opened in 2001, which was also designated as one of the host venues in the unsuccessful England 2006 FIFA World Cup bid. The next season proved a disappointment after the optimism of the previous campaign. City achieved an opening-day victory over a Chelsea team of international stars, but this was followed by four defeats in the next five games. A run of six games with only one defeat in the spring took the club clear of the relegation fight, but a poor run-in saw them finish in 15th. Another cup run seemed on the cards after a 7‚Äì0 win over Macclesfield and a 3‚Äì0 defeat at local rivals Leicester in the third and fourth rounds, but it was ended by a poor performance in a 2‚Äì1 fifth round defeat at Everton. Adding to supporters' frustration, several top players left during the season and the subsequent summer. This included Dublin, who was sold to Aston Villa for ¬£5.75 million in an acrimonious deal, as well as Huckerby and George Boateng. The 1999‚Äì2000 campaign was one of contrasts. Boosted by the arrival of Robbie Keane for ¬£6 million, as well as Moroccans Moustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo, Coventry achieved 12 wins from their 19 home games. This included a 3‚Äì2 Boxing Day defeat of Arsenal, described by the Coventry Telegraph as one of the \\"most memorable wins of the Premier League era\\". But away from home, City failed to win a single game all season, losing the last five, which meant ultimately they could only finish 14th. McAllister, labelled by club historian Jim Brown as \\"the fulcrum of all the team's moves\\" during the season, left the club in the summer. Keane also departed to Inter Milan for ¬£13 million and, with neither player adequately replaced, the team struggled throughout the 2000‚Äì01 season. They won two of their first three games, ending the run of winless away games in the process, but they then won only two further games before Christmas. Strachan tried numerous different team structures, but the poor run continued. Veteran striker John Hartson arrived on loan in February, and his leadership and goals caused some improvement in results. But it was not enough, and City's 34-year tenure in the top flight ended on 5 May 2001 with a 3‚Äì2 defeat to arch-rivals Aston Villa.  2001‚Äì2006: Life outside the Premiership  Five games into the 2001‚Äì02 season manager Gordon Strachan was sacked, shortly after an embarrassing 1‚Äì0 defeat at home to Grimsby Town. He was replaced by 38-year-old team regular Roland Nilsson, who took on the role of player-manager. Nilsson was dismissed at the end of the season after failing to get Coventry into the play-offs. This was particularly disappointing for Coventry fans, as the club had been one of the favourites to win the title at the start of the season. He was replaced by 37-year-old Gary McAllister, also a player-manager, who had been on the club's books from 1996 to 2000 before being transferred to Liverpool. Midway through the 2002‚Äì03 season, McAllister's men still stood a good chance of making the Division One play-offs. But they won only one league game after the turn of 2003 and finished 20th in the final table ‚Äì just two places above the relegation zone. Their form in 2003‚Äì04 was slightly better but McAllister left halfway through the season to spend time with his seriously ill wife, Denise. Assistant manager Eric Black took charge and kept the club well clear of the drop zone and facilitated some excellent results. Before the final match of the season, he was replaced by former Sunderland manager Peter Reid. This decision proved a very unpopular one with the majority of the club's fans, as Black (who was popular and had been doing a good job with relatively limited resources) had been seen to have been ousted for a 'big name' whose management style was perceived as 'old school' and not fitting with the modern game. As a protest against the decision and gesture of support for Black, thousands of fans arranged to turn up to the final game of the season against Crystal Palace in black clothing. Reid caused further anger when he worked in Portugal for the BBC during the summer of 2004, when many felt he should have been scouting and trying to improve the stretched playing squad. On 13 January 2005, the club touched off a controversy when it announced that the traditional badge would be replaced with an updated, more modern version. Fan reaction was swift and negative, and under pressure from supporters' groups the club cancelled plans to change the crest. Peter Reid lasted just eight months before the club's dismal league form led to his departure and in January 2005 he left the club looking in real danger of relegation to League One. The club's board replaced Reid with former Leicester City manager Micky Adams. Adams helped the Sky Blues stay clear of the Championship drop zone in their final season at Highfield Road before relocating to a new 32,600-seat stadium at Foleshill (later named the Ricoh Arena as part of a sponsorship deal). As an ex-Coventry player from 1983 to 1987, Adams was a popular choice with fans as he had a genuine fondness for the club and preferred a more technical and Continental approach to playing than his predecessor. In the 2005‚Äì06 season, Coventry City finished a respectable 8th in the Championship (missing out on the Premiership play-offs by only two league places), which represented good progress from the previous season's narrow escape from relegation. Micky Adams was expected to challenge for a play-off position in the 2006‚Äì07 season but was relieved of his duties in January 2007 after a string of poor results and an embarrassing FA Cup exit at the hands of lower league Bristol City, bringing to an end his two-year reign.  2006‚Äì2011: Operation Premiership and the Ranson/SISU era  During the 2005/06 campaign, as fans grew increasingly discontent at the lack of progress in the club, the club's senior management were replaced. The incoming management team: Paul Fletcher, Managing Director; Ken Sharp, Marketing Director and Mal Brannigan, Finance Director; had contributed to the new sense of enthusiasm felt at the club. They launched 'Operation Premiership', a 3-year plan to get Coventry back in the top league. To help achieve that they brought in new investment and created initiatives such as 'True Sky Blue' (aka Private Seat Licence), which gives fans the chance to buy a seat for life. In turn, more money has been invested in the squad, allowing Adams to invest in 11 players before the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season. The 2006/07 season started with the most optimism for years, with genuine belief the club could mount a serious challenge to get back to the Premiership based on the turn in fortunes of the club with the new stadium, innovative board, good manager and squad, as well as the previous season's improved form. This, however, lessened after only 4 points and 2 goals from the first 4 games and the sale of star player, Gary McSheffrey to local rivals Birmingham City for a maximum of ¬£4million, with ¬£2.3 million upfront and the rest based on Birmingham and international appearances. The season went further downhill when they were embarrassingly knocked out of the League Cup in the first round 3‚Äì1 by Football League Two side, Hereford United. They were then drawn against Bristol City in the 3rd round of the FA Cup, 20 years after their majestic triumph in the competition. A large following of just under 3,000 Sky Blues travelled to the Ashton Gate stadium in the hope of some respite from their appalling league form. Many sections of the media pinpointed this as a 'must- win' fixture for Adams. His future looked bleak as Coventry were 3‚Äì1 down in the first half only to claw back one goal before half-time and then stage a stirring comeback to draw 3‚Äì3 with Stern John grabbing the equaliser. In the build-up to the replay however Coventry produced arguably their worst defensive performance for years and succumbed to a 4‚Äì2 home defeat against a distinctly average Crystal Palace side on 13 January. Coventry went on to lose the replay 2‚Äì0 in spite of a spirited 2nd-half comeback. With fans calling for the head of under-pressure manager Micky Adams, his position became untenable and he was dismissed the next day. Assistant Manager Adrian Heath was named caretaker manager and threw his hat into the ring for the full-time position despite a demoralising 3‚Äì2 defeat away at Plymouth Argyle in his first game in charge. Heath made way for new manager Iain Dowie who signed a three-year contract and declared his ambition to guide Coventry back into the Premiership. He led Coventry to a 4‚Äì1 demolition of Barnsley and secured 17th place (lower mid-table) in the Championship after a 2‚Äì1 away win over Burnley in the season's final game. Whilst still distinctly 'work in progress', Dowie's team selections looked defensively better-organised than his predecessor's, with more attention paid to solid midfield possession, a more fluid counter-attacking strategy and some shrewd new signings. They began the 2007‚Äì2008 season with impressive away wins at Barnsley and Cardiff, and reached the third round of the League Cup without conceding a goal, meeting Manchester United in that round, causing a shock by defeating the reigning Premiership champions 2‚Äì0 at Old Trafford to advance to the 4th round. Both goals were scored by Maltese international striker Michael Mifsud (who also hit the woodwork to deny him a hat-trick) in front a 74,000-strong crowd, including some 11,000 Sky Blues supporters. They eventually succumbed in this competition after a 2‚Äì1 loss to the Premiership's West Ham United in a game the Sky Blues completely dominated (West Ham's goals came from a cruel deflection and a highly fortunate goal deep into injury time), thus missing out on a lucrative place in the quarter-finals.The planned crest update Following a highly successful start to the season, Dowie was named \\"Manager of the Month\\" for August 2007, having secured top position after the first four league games and two successive League Cup wins. However, by February 2008 the team had slumped to a lowly 19th position in the league table. On 6 October 2007, Paul Fletcher tendered his resignation in the wake of numerous takeover bids being priced out of the market, leaving both Operation Premiership and the long-term financial future of the club up in the air. Then, on 10 October 2007, Geoffrey Robinson resigned as Chairman of Coventry City Football club, stating that he wished to devote his time to pursuing his Parliamentary career. Joe Elliott promptly took over as Chairman on the same day, with rumours rife that the club was close to being called-in by administrators whilst burdened with estimated debts of ¬£38 million. In response to takeover talks, the club confirmed that two consortia, one led by former Chairman Geoffrey Robinson and the other led by former footballer Ray Ranson, had offered takeover bids for the club. Nonetheless, the club filed for administration with a 14 December 2007 deadline to avoid administration by closing a takeover deal. On 14 December 2007, Ray Ranson and the SISU group successfully completed the takeover of the football club with half an hour to spare before going into administration. They required 90% of shares, which was acquired in January to take full control. As of 11 February 2008, Ian Dowie, Tim Flowers and Bob Dowie were sacked with immediate effect, with one win (4‚Äì0 against Barnsley) in their last 6 league matches ‚Äì leaving them 19th in the Championship and 4 points from relegation. John Harbin and Frankie Bunn were placed in temporary charge of first team affairs in a joint caretaker role. After a 5‚Äì0 humiliation at the hands of West Brom, they were replaced on 19 February 2008, with former Fulham and Real Sociedad manager Chris Coleman. Coventry's Championship status was not secured until the final game of the season, where despite losing 4‚Äì1 away at Charlton Athletic Coventry finished in 21st place due to Leicester City failing to beat Stoke City. 2011‚Äì2017: Stadium row and two relegations In 2011‚Äì12, after five consecutive seasons in the bottom eight of the table, Coventry finally succumbed to relegation from the Championship, falling to the third tier for the first time since 1964. Faced with large losses, SISU had responded by selling many of the club's top stars such as Danny Fox and Scott Dann, while failing to agree new terms with out-of-contract players including Marlon King and goalkeeper Keiren Westwood. Failure to replace them, as well as the team's tendency to concede last-minute goals and suffer vital losses to other teams facing relegation, ultimately led to their finish in the bottom three. A consortium led by supporter Gary Hoffman attempted to buy the club but despite the club's losses and their unpopularity with supporters SISU refused to sell, perhaps because they hoped to acquire ownership of the stadium in future. In April 2012, SISU defaulted on the rent owed to ACL, setting in motion a multi-year battle between the club and the stadium's owners. The club claimed that the annual rent of ¬£1.2million was too high for them, and would not be sustainable given their imminent drop to League One. The 2012‚Äì13 season was a turbulent one for Coventry. After drawing their first three games in League One, having held the lead in each, the club sacked Thorn in late August, appointing Shaw and Carsley as interim managers. A run of five defeats followed, leaving the club second from bottom in late September. Mark Robins was appointed as the new permanent manager and results began to improve; between mid-November and the end of the year, City won six of their eight league games, drawing the other two. This earned Robins the manager of the month award for December and a play-off place seemed possible. But fans were left disappointed in February when Robins departed the club, just five months into his three-year contract, to join Championship Huddersfield Town. Former player Steven Pressley was named as his replacement, the third manager of the season. Off the field, the rent row between Coventry City and ACL intensified and the club's holding company went into administration in March. This resulted in ten points being deducted by the Football League, effectively ending their play-off hopes. They eventually finished in 15th position. With the stadium row remaining unresolved, the club announced that it would play its home games for 2013‚Äì14 at Sixfields Stadium in Northampton, 34 miles from Coventry, whilst planning for a new stadium in the Coventry area. Many supporters began a boycott of home games following this decision, with some travelling to Northampton during the games to protest against the club's owners at a site which they dubbed \\"Jimmy's Hill\\". The club began the season still in administration, after failing to come to an agreement with ACL over a company voluntary arrangement. This triggered another 10-point deduction, but the Football League allowed the club to continue playing by agreeing to transfer its golden share to the administrator's preferred bidder, Otium Entertainment Group, a company majority owned by SISU. In August 2013, SISU applied for a judicial review into Coventry City Council's loan of ¬£14 million to ACL; this concluded in June 2014 with a decision that the deal did not amount to amounted to unlawful state aid. SISU vowed to appeal. On the field, the club had a reasonable season ‚Äì in late March the club were mid-table, and but for the ten-point penalty they would have been challenging for a play-off place at that time. Their form dipped late in the season and eventually avoided relegation only in the penultimate game. Callum Wilson was voted the player of the season by his fellow players, in recognition of his 22 goals in 41 games during the season. It proved to be his last for the club as he departed for Bournemouth in July 2014. City began 2014‚Äì15 playing home games at Sixfields Stadium once more, but in mid-August they announced that they had reached an agreement with ACL to return to the Ricoh Arena for the next two seasons, with the option to then continue playing there for another two. More than 27,000 supporters attended their first game back, a 1‚Äì0 victory over Gillingham. They won again against Yeovil the following week, elevating them to fifth position in the table, but then dropped down almost to the relegation zone, after losing six and drawing one of their next seven games. While acknowledging the importance of playing in Coventry, Pressley bemoaned the state of the Ricoh pitch, saying that \\"from a football perspective it was a disaster\\". Attendances at the stadium began to fall, eventually reaching the lowest level for home games in Coventry in more than 50 years. Pressley was sacked in February 2015, following a draw at Sheffield United which put the club into the relegation zone, and was replaced by Tony Mowbray. In the final game against Crawley, both sides were in relegation danger although City only needed a draw to survive. After falling behind in the second half, they eventually won the game to assure their League One status. The other significant development during the season was the purchase of the Ricoh Arena by Wasps RFC, a Premiership rugby union club previously based in High Wycombe. Wasps bought the holdings of both the city council and the Higgs charity, for ¬£2.77 million each. The latter purchase proved controversial as Higgs turned down a rival ¬£2.8 million offer from Coventry City, despite the club holding the right of first refusal to purchase the Higgs stake. 2015‚Äì16 was a season of contrasts. City had an excellent first four months of the campaign, and were top of the division in late November following a 4‚Äì1 over previous leaders Gillingham. Their form dipped after Christmas, however, and a run of seven defeats in nine games from mid- January to mid-March meant that ultimately they missed the play-offs by five points. Significant transfers included the departure of star midfielder James Maddison to Norwich, and the arrival of former England international Joe Cole from Aston Villa, initially on loan and later on a full-time deal, although he departed for American club Tampa Bay Rowdies at the end of the season. Coventry started the 2016‚Äì17 season badly, failing to win any league games in August or September, and causing Mowbray to resign as manager. Mark Venus took over as caretaker, and the team enjoyed a successful spell, winning four of Venus's first six games. Their form deserted them, however, and they failed to win a single league game between 1 November 2016 and 18 February 2017, losing twelve and drawing two during that period. Russell Slade was appointed as permanent manager during this time, but he was not able to reverse the slump and his failure to win in his first nine league games equals a record set by Cantwell in 1967‚Äì68. In early March, with City bottom of the table and 13 points below safety, Slade was sacked and replaced by Robins, returning for a second spell. Their form improved slightly in the final eight games, with four wins and one draw, but it was not enough and Coventry were relegated to the fourth tier for the first time since 1959. There was some consolation for the supporters in April as Coventry won the 2017 EFL Trophy Final at Wembley with a 2‚Äì1 win over Oxford, earning their first major trophy since the 1987 FA Cup. Throughout this period, SISU were involved in legal battles regarding the council's involvement in the Ricoh Arena. They applied for permission to appeal against the 2014 judicial-review decision, a process which eventually concluded at the supreme court in late 2016 with a ruling prohibiting allowing a full appeal. They then applied for a fresh judicial review, this time into the council's role in the sale of the stadium to Wasps by ACL. SISU alleged that the deal undervalued the stadium by ¬£30 million. This application was refused by the High Court in July 2017, Once again, SISU sought permission to appeal this decision at the Court of Appeal. This appeal was allowed and was held in June 2018, but the court eventually ruled against them later that year, affirming the decision to deny the second judicial review. They asked the supreme court to intervene, but this was refused in April 2019. 2018‚Äìpresent: Exiled again and ascent back to the Championship Coventry won their first two games back in the league's bottom division, going briefly to the top of the table in mid-August 2017. Their form was somewhat erratic through the autumn, but they remained in the top half of the table and a run of four wins in six games around Christmas put them into third place. Another run of poor form followed, leaving them outside the play-off zone by mid- February, but with 3 defeats in their final 14 games they were able to secure a sixth place and a play-off berth.https://www.11v11.com/league-tables/league- two/5-may-2018/ After defeating Notts County 5‚Äì2 on aggregate over two legs, City faced Exeter City in the the play-off final at Wembley. Coventry took a 3‚Äì0 lead with second-half goals from Jordan Willis, Jordan Shipley and Jack Grimmer, eventually winning the game 3‚Äì1. This resulted in their first promotion for 51 years since being guided into the First Division by Hill in 1967.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/05/28/coventry-beat-exeter- league-two-play-off-final-win-first-promotion/ They had a solid season back in League One for 2018‚Äì19 finishing in eighth position. A run of five consecutive victories in October saw them briefly in the play-off positions, but this was followed by seven games without a win, five of which were lost, and ultimately they missed the top six by eight points. Having exhausted all domestic avenues for seeking a judicial review into the sale of the Ricoh Arena to Wasps, SISU in May 2019 decided to launch a complaint about the issue to the European Commission (EC). This filing alleged that the deal broke the European Union state aid laws, on the grounds that Coventry City Council had undervalued the stadium when they sold their share. At the same time, the club's 2015 agreement with Wasps to play home games at the stadium was coming to an end, and it was seeking to make a fresh deal with the rugby club. Wasps had previously said that they would not agree to a deal while legal action involving them and SISU was outstanding. SISU signed an agreement to this effect in April 2019 and the EC complaint was not regarded by legal experts as technically legal action, but this nonetheless derailed the negotiations. In early June, with talks unresolved and faced with the threat of expulsion from the league over its lack of a confirmed home for 2018‚Äì19, the club announced that it would once again leave Coventry to commence a ground share with Birmingham City at their St Andrew's stadium. The EFL permitted City to make this move, but insisted they \\"ensure progress is made in regard to finding a solution to getting the club back playing in Coventry at the earliest opportunity\\". Coventry started the 2019‚Äì20 season brightly, with wins in their first five fixtures at St Andrew's and draws in the four away matches sending them top of League One in mid-September. They then suffered a dip in form, earning only two wins from their next eleven league games, culminating in their third defeat of the season at Shrewsbury, which dropped them out of the play-off zone. That defeat proved their last of the season, as they won eleven of their next fourteen games, drawing the others. City moved back into second place in mid-February with a win at Southend. A draw with leaders Rotherham followed two games later, and when Coventry beat Sunderland on 1 March 2020, they ascended to the top. In mid-February, the 2019‚Äì20 League One season was suspended due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. On 9 June, League One and League Two clubs voted to cancel the remainder of the season, with only the play-offs to be completed. Final league positions for the season were determined using a points-per-game system. With 67 points from 34 games, a points-per-game ratio of 1.97, Coventry were promoted to the Championship as League One champions, ahead of Rotherham's 1.77 points per game.

His solo act, labeled 'dance-ish' by Ebina, features his unique self-taught style which combines acting, storytelling, and a number of different dance styles, including freestyle, hip-hop, mime, martial arts, jazz, and ethnic dance. He frequently interacts with characters on a video screen behind him, who have all been created and played by himself. Early life and career Kenichi was born 1974, Ebina earned his Associates of Arts in General Studies from the University of Bridgeport in 1998 and a Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communications in 2000 from the same University. Kenichi has a wife and daughter in Japan. Apollo Amateur Night In 2006 and 2007, he won the Apollo Amateur Night two times and became grand champion for the season. In 2001, his dance troupe BiTriP won first place at the Apollo Amateur Night. He remains the only two- time grand champion. He is also featured in Angelina Ballerina: The Next Steps, where he talks about his dance performance involving a story about a mannequin brought to life. America's Got Talent He performed at the Chicago auditions, doing a Matrix-style \\"dance-ish\\" performance that wowed the judges, gaining \\"yes\\" votes from all four judges. He was automatically sent through to the live rounds at Radio City Music Hall without needing to perform during Vegas week. On August 6, 2013, in the quarterfinals, he performed a dance/martial arts routine at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, in which he interacted with a video that was playing on a large screen behind him. Kenichi also portrayed every character shown on the video behind him. On the August 7 results show, he was voted through to the semi-finals. On September 3, Kenichi performed an elaborate dance/mime routine with a projected version of himself and was voted into the top 12. On September 10, he performed an interpretive dance about love, death and the afterlife and was voted into the finals. In the finals, his first performance was a remix of his original audition wowing the judges once more and the second performance was him interacting with 8 characters projected on a screen behind him. All characters were portrayed by Kenichi as well. After performing two dance routines during the finals on September 17, he was announced the winner of the eighth season of America's Got Talent on September 18, 2013. He was also the first dance and first foreign act to win the competition. On the Season 9 Quarterfinal results show on August 13, 2014, Kenichi returned as a guest, performing a routine based on his audition performance, while interacting with versions of himself with superimposed faces of Heidi and Howie. The performance was also a demonstration of the app he is working on (apparently titled \\"Dance-ish Me\\") to be released in September, although no other specifics were mentioned. Kenichi participated in America's Got Talent: The Champions in 2019. He did not receive enough votes to advance to the finals.

It describes itself as \\"an advocate for student free-press rights [that] provides information, advice and legal assistance at no charge to students and the educators who work with them.\\" The SPLC was founded in 1974. The Kennedy Memorial Foundation and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press created the center at the recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry into High School Journalism. The center became a separate corporation in 1979. It is the only legal assistance agency in the United States with the primary mission of educating high school and college journalists about the rights and responsibilities embodied in the First Amendment and supporting the freedom of expression of student news media to address issues and express themselves free from censorship. The SPLC is a non-partisan 501(c)(3) corporation. It is headquartered in the University of California Building in Washington, D.C. It was previously headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, where it shared a suite of offices with the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Services The SPLC: *Provides free legal help and information as well as low-cost educational materials for student journalists on a wide variety of media law topics, including laws regarding defamation, freedom of information, copyrights, invasion of privacy, reporter's privilege, obscenity, censorship, and the First Amendment. *Files amici curiae in cases where student media rights could be effected.   Operates an Attorney Referral Network of approximately 250 volunteer media law attorneys across the country who may be available to provide free legal representation to local students when necessary. *Maintains a free Freedom of Information Law Letter Generator that creates a public records request tailored to the law of each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, for use by student journalists and others seeking access to public records. *Staffs a legal representation hotline. *Maintains a full-service news operation covering issues relevant to student journalism. The Center's journalists write online news stories about ongoing censorship and open- records controversies, and produce the in-depth SPLC Report magazine in print and online. *Presents annual awards to recognize student journalists, educators, and administrators that have shown courage in standing up for student press freedom. Advocacy The SPLC has advocated for the passage of \\"New Voices\\" legislation at the state level to protect student journalists' rights. The organization has promoted and funded Student Press Freedom Day on college campuses.  Newspaper Theft  The organization tracks the theft of free newspapers on college campuses. The group considers the disappearance of the student newspapers as censorship by theft. Governance and staff The SPLC is run by an executive director and a board of directors composed primarily of attorneys, professional journalists and journalism educators. The current executive director, Hadar Harris, was named to the position in September 2017.http://www.splc.org/article/2017/09/new-executive-director The previous executive director was Frank LoMonte, who served from January 2008 until September 2017. He was preceded by Mark Goodman, who served from 1985 to 2007. Funding The SPLC is supported by contributions from student journalists, journalism educators, and other individuals, as well as by donations from foundations and corporations. On January 23, 2007, the SPLC successfully completed a three-year $3.75 million endowment campaign, spurred by a challenge grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.

The state park has campgrounds, boat ramps and hiking trails as well as exceptional examples of structures created by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Facilities are managed for the Bureau of Reclamation by the Wyoming Division of State Parks and Historic Sites. History The park began with the construction of the Guernsey Dam, started in 1925 and completed in 1927. Between 1934 and 1939, workers with the Civilian Conservation Corps created recreational facilities on the land surrounding the dam's reservoir. Park management fell to the state of Wyoming in 1957. Lake Guernsey State Park (also known as Guernsey State Park Historic District, Lake Guernsey Park, Guernsey Lake Park, or Guernsey State Park) was declared a National Historic Landmark District in 1997 for its design history and construction. The park's design was the result of the first collaboration between the National Park Service and the Bureau of Reclamation, and its infrastructure was built by Civilian Conservation Corps crews. The historic district contains 60 contributing resources: 14 buildings, three sites and 43 structures, as well as 46 non-contributing resources. Features The Guernsey State Park Museum offers information about the CCC and the natural and cultural history of the area. The park contains a separate National Historic Landmark, the Oregon Trail Ruts. Register Cliff, another feature of the Oregon Trail listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is located two miles southeast of the park. Activities and amenities The park has seven campgrounds and three boat ramps. Fish species include walleye, yellow perch and channel catfish.

Some fiction may be historically based, or will refer to less action-oriented aspects, such as intelligence analysis or counterintelligence. Adaptations of real events The film Charlie Wilson's War, released in December 2007, gives a popular account of the efforts of U.S. Congressman Charles Wilson to secure funding for the CIA's Operation Cyclone, giving covert assistance to Afghan rebels during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. This film positively portrays the CIA, while finishing with a muted scolding of Congress for funding the war but not funding subsequent peacetime reconstruction. This lack of funding for reconstruction, or what are called Operations Other Than War (OOTWA) in military parlance and counter-insurgency doctrine, are mooted as an antecedent to the present War on Terrorism. According to Declan Walsh, writing in The Guardian, the support of the mujahideen by the U.S. and Pakistan backfired on the U.S. in the form of the 9/11 attacks, and is now backfiring on Pakistan. The film has its critics. The Good Shepherd, directed by Robert De Niro and released in 2006, narrates the CIA's tumultuous early history as viewed through the prism of one man's life. While the lead character is a composite of several real people, the most important is the long-term chief of the CIA Counterintelligence Staff, James Jesus Angleton. Angleton is also the basis of William F. Buckley, Jr.'s novel Spytime: The Undoing of James Jesus Angleton The same story is told in the 2007 TNT miniseries The Company. Hypothetical but modeled on real organizations The character Jack Ryan in Tom Clancy's books is a CIA analyst. Ryan is never a case officer in the usual sense of the term, as opposed to characters such as John Clark and Domingo Chavez. Ryan starts as a contract consultant, becomes an analyst, and rises in responsibility. There are operations officers that play a major role in Clancy's novels, such as Clark and Chavez, to say nothing of the creative and intelligent Mary Pat Foley. Graham Greene's The Quiet American, which has been issued in two editions and made into a film, is based on an amoral CIA agent operating in Southeast Asia. Films and television * In Three Days of the Condor, a low- level CIA employee codenamed Condor (Robert Redford) works in a small brownstone office reading books, magazines, etc., looking for enemy codes. He slips out to buy some food, and upon soon returning, finds that all his co- workers have been murdered. * In The Hunt for Red October, Alec Baldwin plays CIA analyst Jack Ryan. The character is also played by Harrison Ford in the films Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger, while Ben Affleck portrays Jack Ryan in The Sum of All Fears, Chris Pine is Ryan in the original story Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, while the actor is John Krasinski in the 2018 TV series Jack Ryan. * The Good Shepherd, narrates the CIA's tumultuous early history as viewed through the prism of one man's life.

His single mother works constantly, but can barely support her adopted kids. They have moved again, into an apartment so tiny that Erec sleeps with the washing machine. And worse, there is a strange force in Erec that makes him to do odd things. No matter how hard he fights it, his urge to obey grows until it is impossible to resist. Usually, it makes him do good things, like putting pillows at the bottom of stairs moments before his sister crashes down. But what if, someday, he is made to do something terrible? Then one morning, Erec's mother is missing. His power commands him to find her, taking him on an adventure that will change him forever. He meets Bethany, a kindred spirit who also lost both parents in a mysterious past. Together, they discover the magical worlds of Alypium, Ashona, and Aorth, where the knowledge of magic is kept. Things in Alypium are amiss: their King Piter is hypnotized, and his castle lies on its side. When Erec tries on his mother's glasses, he finds he can see her wherever she is. She is a prisoner of King Pluto of Aorth, one of the triplets that rule over the Kingdom of the Keepers. Erec can not understand why Pluto would want her ... but secrets start to tumble out. Erec learns he was born in Alypium, and he may not be safe there. He is upset she has hidden so much from him, and loses trust in her. His only hope to rescue his mother is to find ingredients for a formula to blast her free. While searching for them, he enters contests to choose the next three rulers of Alypium. The contests, including the \\"Pro and Contest\\", where they are reprimanded by movie characters, and the \\"Under Mine\\", are challenging enough, but somebody is attacking the winners, making kids afraid to compete. Erec's magical power helps him save friends from such things as swamp gas, attack fleas, and a minotaur. Balthazar Ugry, not only evil, but with a terrible smell, seems to be the culprit. Just looking at him makes Erec tremble. What's more, Erec discovers someone is planning to take over Alypium, as well as the other magical lands‚ÄîAorth and Ashona. Could this be Ugry as well? When the blasting formula is ready, Erec crosses King Pluto's deadly dungeons to save his mother, but he makes a mistake. He doubts her advice, and almost loses his life to the deadly destroyers and shadow demons. Amazed he survived, he puts on the glasses to find he freed his mother. With renewed confidence in each other, they plan a strategy. If he becomes the next king, he can save Alypium from Ugry, and his family could come out of hiding. Odds stacked against them, Erec and Bethany advance to the final contest, but something is not quite right. He must retrieve an eye from a ferocious dragon. King Pluto wants the eye, but Erec learns he must keep it. He escapes to the castle, where he is thrown into the clutches of his most deadly enemy. = Land of the monsters = Ever since Erec Rex returned home, his siblings Danny and Sammy have been acting strange. They follow him, staring like lost puppies. The shock of Erec and their mother missing must have been too much for them. Erec returns to Alypium to tackle the twelve trials necessary to become king. When Danny and Sammy follow him there against his mother's wishes, Erec finds out they are impostors. The real Danny and Sammy have been kidnapped. Erec follows clues that lead him into the Green House, where President Inkle lives. He starts to believe the strange Hermit hanging around the castle might have something to do with the twin's disappearance. Erec wonders what harrowing escapade his first trial will be, and learns he has to . . . open a nestful of dragons eggs. Not only are the eggs difficult to open, but feeding the dragon hatchlings stings his fingers. On top of searching for Danny and Sammy, Erec is attempting to learn magic from his magic tutor Mr. Peebles. To make matters worse, the annoying Balor and Damon Stain, through a loophole in the magical law, are competing against him. Balor, Damon, and Rock Rayson are also working with Erec's enemy, Baskania, and if Erec doesn't win his quests, the future of the Kingdom of the Keepers won't look good. While Erec opens the dragon eggs, Damon Stain keeps interfering with him so Bethany and Jack try to fight him off resulting in one of the baby dragons getting hurt. After all the eggs hatch, it seems as if Balor won. After being defeated, Erec tries to feed them, hurting his fingers in the process, and the dragon mother comes back. After communicating with each other using Erec's dragon eye, the dragon mother thanks them and gives Erec a scroll, the scroll of Alithea which holds all of the answers in the universe. Erec's next trial is to \\"defeat the monsters in otherness\\", but he is not sure how to begin. He hears that two children are being held prisoner of terrible monsters called vogum in \\"Otherness\\", the wild magical worlds outside of Alypium, and he realizes they might be Danny and Sammy. A \\"snail mail\\" love letter, written on a real snail shell from a secret admirer, turns into a correspondence that helps Erec wind his way through the perils of Otherness to find the twins. Erec discovers the \\"monsters\\" are actually quite nice. In fact, Tina, his secret admirer, is a hydra herself. Baskania has massed an angry horde to \\"kill the hydras and save the children\\", planning to kill the hydra and valkyries for his dark purposes. Erec stands before Tina and her people, arms outstretched, pleading with the mob that the hydras are good, but Baskania twists his words. In a last attempt, Erec holds up the Scroll of Alithea. Shots ring out, and Erec waits for the sting of arrow and bullets, but then there is silence.He didn't get hit because Aosqueth, the dragon, blocks a death spell from Baskania. He then takes Aosqueths eye, giving him two eyes. The mob has dropped its arms, but Baskania vanishes. All seems lost, but Erec, using his dragon eye, finds Baskania just as he brought back one of his ancestors from the dead. With the help of this ancestor, and now the dragon eye he will take from Erec, Baskania will rule the world. With the help of an ancestor of his own, and using what he has learned, Erec saves the day, though in the process discovers two dangerous secrets. Baskania is madder still, and more determined to kill Erec and take his dragon eye. = The Search for Truth = In book 3 of the Erec Rex series, Erec is faced with even more daunting tasks, choices, and dangers. Baskania is somehow getting information out of his friend, Oscar Felix. He cannot trust his friend. When Erec goes to collect his quest, Baskania is there. He pulls the quest out of Al's Well, but it is torn. All it says is \\"get behind\\". Erec goes in search for the Well of Delphi so he may talk to the fates in person. He does so but the fates are not much help, and just laugh and giggle like fangirls. Oscar suddenly shows up and demands to know how his father died. The fate tell him \\"Rosco killed him\\". But they are not alone. Balor Stain shows up just as Erec asks the fates who his father is. The fates become confused and think he means who is Balor's father. Balor turns out to be a clone of Baskania. The latest contest for Erec is to \\"get bee-hind and set it free\\". A Bee Hind is a mystical hind (deer) that attracts bees, not to mention the Substance. Erec must take this bee-hind from its home and let it roam free to spread the Substance all over the world. But the Bee-Hind is protecting a man, who had been a lackey of Baskania until he outsmarted him (he apparently did \\"something bad\\" to Ugry under Baskania's orders), and his son. If Erec removes the Bee-Hind, his new friends will be killed by a manticore. Erec eventually sets the Bee-Hind free, but instead of running away, he stays behind. He tells Bethany to go home, but she will not, even when he tries to trick her into leaving. Erec later saves the day by luring the manticore into a hole in the Substance, killing it. Erec's next task is to retrieve the five Awen from their mystical hiding places and unite them, a herculean undertaking that has laid waste to all those who have attempted it. Erec collects the Awen with the help of his friends, but the Twyth Boar is a trickier matter. The man who owned it once upon a time was now dead. Erec goes back in time to retrieve it, and discovers something truly shocking - he is one of the royal triplets. Erec goes back to his time and confronts King Piter, his father. Piter reveals that if Erec found out, the castle would collapse, which it promptly does. Erec goes to connect the Awen to the Twyth Boar. He gains perfect knowledge of all things, but gets rid of it to help fix the Substance. But the Boar comes back to him, though the intelligence does not. Erec and Bethany later discover that Baskania has kidnapped her brother. She goes to save him, but Baskania appears and captures her and demands to know her secret. Bethany, put under a spell, tells him that the Final Magic is found in the smallest child of the first king of Alympium's greatest seer, which happened to be Bethany. Erec saves Bethany in the end, but she was shot with an old spell. She is put in a deep sleep. After a day or so, a thought strikes Erec. He kisses her and she wakes up. = Fairy of the Fury = In the Three Furies, Erec Rex is faced with more challenges than before. His best friend, and secret crush, Bethany, has been captured by Baskania, and he could not get to her in time to save her. She had been writing him letters, but he had been so concentrated on his mixed feelings about her since he kissed her to save her in the last book, and had not answered her. Thanatos Argus Baskania is the Shadow Prince who is after the Great Secret, which will direct him to the Final Magic. Erec has cloudy thoughts that appear in times of crisis, that help him stop bad things from happening. Once before he had a cloudy thought and pretty much turned into a fire breathing dragon. His most recent cloudy though brought him to the realization that Bethany was in danger. And he was correct. She has been taken by Baskania. Erec must return to the Kingdom of the Keepers to rescue Bethany, but he won't be going alone. His family will endure this adventure with him. Erec must visit with the Fates to see if they can help him figure out a way to save Bethany. Of course, like any adventure to save a damsel in distress, the task ahead will not be an easy one. There will be only one way to save Bethany, the steps that Erec must take will be extremely challenging. These steps will guide him down his path to becoming the King of Alypium. He must go to the Nightmare Realm where no one has ever returned from. Despite the dangers, Erec continues forward with these quests, determined to rescue Bethany. By using his mother's Seeing Glasses, he is able to contact Bethany. Her condition is not good, since she is chained to a chair with small metal cones around her head, which pull out her memories and play them on a screen so Baskania can sort through them to try to find the secret to the Final Magic. Bethany tries to persuade Erec not to rescue her, since she is being held in Baskania's most protected fortress, knowing he very well might not come out alive. Erec begins to worry, but continues to plan on helping her escape. After plenty of ordeals and challenges along the way, Erec finally makes his way into the fortress to help Bethany, but not without being caught by Baskania first. Baskania in turn multiplies Bethany so that there are a hundred Bethanys in the room, and he continues to kill them with magic until he hits the right one. Using his own magic, Erec manages to multiply himself and Baskania into different copies. Using his dragon eyes, and a comment to the real Bethany about how he told her he loved her, Erec manages to get Bethany and his friends out of the fortress. But that is not all. After completing his fifth quest, Erec gets his next quest, which tells him to give himself up to the three Furies. In other words, he has to give his soul to them and die, so that they can take revenge on the world. He has a hard time leaving his family, and Bethany, but he manages to sneak away to Tartarus to speak to the three Furies. Initially, he was hoping to find some way out of Tartarus alive, but after speaking with the Furies, he believes it to be impossible. The Furies do escape Tartarus into the real world, but whether or not Erec makes it out too is undisclosed unless you read the book. = The Secret of Ashona = Erec Rex has had many difficult tasks in the past but none like the task he has to face right now. Erec has lost most of his soul and has to retrieve it from the three Furies. If Erec doesn't get his soul back soon, he will turn evil. Meanwhile, his brother, Trevor, is in trouble and Erec needs to save him as well. Erec has also received his seventh task which is just as dangerous as the last. Bethany, on the other hand, is stuck at home with Erec's family and Jam. Erec is also trying to release the souls kept by the Furies free. To do this, however, he has to give himself up to his worst enemy: Baskania. This couldn't be a worse time for Erec to be facing what he is.

EMC acquired Documentum for $1.7 billion in December, 2003. The Documentum platform was part of EMC's Enterprise Content Division (ECD) business unit, one of EMC's four operating divisions. On January 23, 2017, OpenText, a Canadian technology firm based in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada that specializes in enterprise content management, acquired Documentum from Dell EMC for $1.62 billion USD.  History  = Getting started = Howard Shao and John Newton founded Documentum in June 1990. They had worked together at Ingres, one of the leading relational database vendors at the time, and sought to solve unstructured information management problems using relational database technologies. (Unstructured information refers to information that does not have a formal data structure ‚Äì documents, images, audio, video, etc.) With initial backing from Xerox, they developed a customized system for Boeing to organize, store, maintain, and selectively publish the thousands of pages of information for the Boeing 777 training manuals. They developed another customized system for Syntex, a pharmaceutical vendor, to automate the process of assembling New Drug Application (NDA) documents when seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Documentum introduced its Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) in 1993, a client-server product for electronic document management. This product managed access to unstructured information stored within a shared repository, running on a central server. End users connected to the repository through PC, Macintosh, and Unix Motif desktop client applications. Documentum EDMS provided check-in/check-out access controls as well as workflow capabilities for sequencing document review and approval processes, and included a full-text search engine for retrieving documents from the repository. EDMS was adopted by several large enterprises, such as pharmaceutical, oil and gas, financial services, and manufacturing companies. =Company growth= In 1993, Jeffrey Miller, a Silicon Valley marketing executive, joined Documentum as president and CEO with a mandate to transform the company from a technology-driven start-up into an established software firm. Under Miller's leadership, the company raised its first round of venture funding from Brentwood, Merrill Picker Anderson, Sequoia Capital, Norwest Corporation, and Xerox Venture. Documentum was floated on NASDAQ February 5, 1996, listing with the DCTM symbol. = Web versions = In 1998, Documentum launched its Web Application Environment, a set of Internet extensions for EDMS, offering Web access to the documents stored within an EDMS repository. In 2000, Documentum released Documentum 4i, its first Web-native platform. The company redesigned the repository to ensure that it could manage a very large number of discrete objects ‚Äîranging from self-contained documents to granular information snippets. Beyond just managing documents for print or electronic distribution, Documentum 4i could integrate with external Web applications and be used to distribute content to portals, web application servers, and websites. A number of third party applications are based on Documentum. = Content management platform = In 2002, Documentum launched Documentum 5 as a unified enterprise content management (ECM) platform for storing a virtually unlimited range of content types within a shared repository. The platform provided integrated business process management (BPM) capabilities as well as tools for managing content across a distributed organization. =Key acquisitions= Through a series of acquisitions over the last several years, the company added further capabilities. * Bulldog, announced in December 2001, added extensive digital asset management capabilities to the repository for the management of digitized multimedia content. * Boxcar, announced in January 2002, added technologies for syndicating content to remote repositories. * eRoom, announced in October 2002, provided a collaborative workspace for distributed business teams, including those from disparate organizations, to share content over the Internet. * TrueArc, also announced in October 2002, added records management capabilities and augmented Documentum's offerings for compliance solutions. * askOnce, announced in March 2004, provided enterprise content integration and federated search technologies for accessing and retrieving information stored in disparate repositories. * Acartus, announced in October 2005, provided capabilities for archiving business reports, billing statements, insurance policies, and other kinds of fixed content. * Captiva Software, also announced in October 2005, added image capture and scanning technologies to convert paper-based documents into digital formats. * Authentica, announced in March 2006, added digital rights management technologies, to secure digital assets outside the boundaries of the shared repository. * ProActivity, announced in June 2006, added business process analysis and business activity monitoring features to enhance the business process management capabilities of Documentum. * X-Hive, announced in July 2007, added XML database capabilities for managing and repurposing XML-tagged content components within an enterprise environment. * Document Sciences, announced December 2007, added Enterprise Output Management capabilities. * C6, announced in November 2011, EMC signed exclusive licensing agreement with C6 to deliver the D2 web client.  Products  = Documentum Server (formerly known as Documentum Content Server)= The core platform manages content in a repository consisting of three parts: a content server, a relational database, and a place to store files. Items in the repository are stored as objects. The file associated with an object is usually stored in a file system; the object's associated metadata (file name, storage location, creation date, etc.) are stored as a record in a relational database. = Documentum Clients = Configurable clients such as Documentum D2 and Documentum xCP provide tools that aim to eliminate the need for custom code.  Documentum xCP  This is a development platform for automating business processes. The platform consists of a web-based client, and a platform for user interface development and server-side components, such as fully automatic or semi-automatic business processes.  Webtop  The browser-based interface provides access to the repository and content management services.  Documentum D2  This configurable, content- centric client provides access of ECM applications.  My Documentum  This provides content management services and information access within the infrastructure.  Releases  The culmination of these acquisitions was Documentum 5.3, released in April 2005, followed by Documentum 6, launched in July 2007. Documentum 6.5 was released in July 2008 and 6.7 was released in April 2011. Documentum 7.0 came out in November 2012, with 7.1 following a year after and 7.2 in January 2015 and followed by Documentum 7.3, released in November 2016 . The current version is Documentum 16.4, released in February 2018.  API  Documentum functionality is made available through application programming interfaces (API) including web services, WebDAV, FTP, Java, Documentum Foundation Classes, Documentum Query Language (DQL), Web Development Kit API (WDK), SMB/CIFS and CMIS. Most of the customization in the basic product is done using the DFC (Documentum Foundation Classes), a comprehensive but rather dated (as of 2015) collection of Java APIs. Customization can be done via configuration, particularly through the extension products D2 and xCP. These additions aim to provide faster ways of building applications based on document types and metadata, and business processes, respectively.  Functions  Documentum provides management capabilities for all types of content. The core of Documentum is a repository in which the content is stored securely under compliance rules and a unified environment, although content may reside on multiple servers and physical storage devices within a networked environment. Documentum provides services such as document management, collaboration, search, content classification, input management, Business Process Management (BPM), customer communication management, and Web content management.

It enters from the New York state line in Danbury overlapped with U.S. Route 6 and ends at the Massachusetts state line in Granby overlapped with Route 10. US 202 is overlapped with other routes for most of its length. Route description US 202 enters Connecticut in the town of Danbury duplexed with US 6. The duplex joins another duplex, I-84 and US 7 at I-84 Exit 4 to form a 3 mile four-way concurrency. US 7 and 202 split from I-84 and US 6 at Exit 7. They remain duplexed on a freeway for a short stretch before 202 exits the freeway at the first exit (Exit 11) at the Brookfield town line to follow Federal Road, a two-lane road that was an old alignment of US 7. The two roads reunite at the end of the US 7 freeway about later just before the New Milford town line. Between the junctions of US 7 at Exit 12 and US 7 at the Brookfield-New Milford border, signage for US 202 briefly changes directions to become a north-south route through the center of Brookfield. US 202 returns to being signed in its dominant east-west directions again after overlapping with US 7 in New Milford. The 2 roads split again in the center of New Milford as US 202 turns east to cross the Housatonic River. It then turns northeast to pass through Washington and Morris (briefly), before entering Litchfield. Route 202 passes through the historic downtown district, where it intersects Route 63 and has a connection with Route 118 which heads toward the western suburbs of Hartford. It then enters Torrington, where it meets the Route 8 expressway at Exit 44. Leaving Torrington, US 202 passes through New Hartford before entering Canton. Just after crossing the Farmington River in western Canton, US 202 starts a duplex with US 44 through Canton and the southwest corner of Simsbury into Avon. In the center of Avon, as US 44 leaves the duplex to the east, US 202 is joined from the east by Route 10, as both turn northward. US 202 (duplexed with Route 10) then reenters Simsbury, and then enters Granby. After a brief triplex with Route 189 in the center of town, the US 202/Route 10 duplex crosses the Massachusetts state line into the town of Southwick. At this point, US 202 officially changes from a signed east-west to a signed north-south route, although signage north of Avon shows both 202 and 10 (the latter correctly so) as signed north-south. History US 202 was designated in 1935. It originally went along its modern alignment, continuing east on Lake Avenue and West Street to downtown Danbury, then went south along modern CT 53 and CT 302 into Newtown (this section was signed as CT 34 from 1932 to 1934.) 202 then overlapped with US 6 into Farmington, with CT 10 joining them to the Massachusetts state line. Modern US 202 in Litchfield County was originally part of CT 25 (New Milford to Torrington) and CT 4 (Torrington to Canton.) The portion between Danbury and New Milford was then just US 7. In 1963, CT 4 was shifted southward with CT 25 extended along modern US 202 to Canton. In 1974, US 202 was moved to its modern alignment. CT 25 was truncated to US 7 in Brookfield and the former alignment between Danbury and Newtown became CT 302 and a northern extension of CT 53.

The district is chiefly significant for its association with the conservationists Olaus Murie, his wife Margaret (Mardy) Murie and scientist Adolph Murie and his wife Louise. Olaus and Adolph Murie were influential in the establishment of an ecological approach to wildlife management, while Mardy Murie was influential because of her huge conservation victories such as passing the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 and being awarded with the highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, for her lifetime works in conservation. Olaus Murie was president of the Wilderness Society, and was an advocate for the preservation of wild lands in America. The Murie Residence, home of Olaus and Mardy, and itself listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, adjoins the former STS Dude Ranch. Both the Murie Residence and the STS Ranch provided accommodation for meetings of the Wilderness Society in 1953, and provided a base for writers and activists in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. The Muries Olaus Murie was responsible for landmark studies on caribou and their relationship to the environment in Alaska during the 1920s. He was joined by his younger brother Adolph in 1922, and met his future wife, Margaret \\"Mardy\\" Thomas in Fairbanks in 1924. Adolph later married Mardy's half sister Louise. Olaus undertook a study of the elk population in Jackson Hole in 1927, controversially concluding that the artificially-managed elk herd exceeded the carrying capacity of the range because of the managed feeding. The study was a landmark in the development of a holistic view of ecosystems and their inhabitants. From 1937 to 1940, Adolph studied coyotes in Yellowstone National Park, publishing a report that contradicted the existing policies on predator control, leading to reversal of National Park Service policies that encouraged the elimination of coyotes in the park. Adolph continued his studies of predators, publishing The Wolves of Mount McKinley in 1944, which resulted in a similar reversal of Park Service wolf control policies in Alaska. Olaus and Mardy Murie moved to Jackson in 1927, living in a now-vanished house that they called \\"Pumpkin House.\\" Adolph and Louise moved to Jackson in 1939. At the time of the park's expansion with the creation of Jackson Hole National Monument, Olaus was at the time on the board of directors of the Wilderness Society. Olaus was also on the board of Jackson Hole Preserve, Inc., which administered the properties purchased by the Snake River Land Company for eventual incorporation into an expanded Grand Teton National Park. When the Preserve acted on a proposal to create a fenced wildlife park in Jackson Hole, Murie resigned, prompting the National Park Service to disassociate itself from the venture, which proved short-lived. In 1945, Olaus Murie left government employment and became president of the Wilderness Society, at the same time moving to the STS property. The ranch was the venue for the 1948 Wilderness Society Council. The ranch also hosted a number of prominent visitors, including grizzly bear biologists John and Frank Craighead during their early careers, and U.S. Supreme Court justice William O. Douglas. Olaus' publications written at the ranch include The Elk of North America and A Field Guide to Animal Tracks. Adolph wrote The Grizzlies of North America, The Wolves of Mount McKinley and A Naturalist in Alaska. Mardy Murie wrote Two in the Far North and with her husband Olaus wrote Wapiti Wilderness, essays on Jackson Hole and life at the ranch. The Wilderness Act was passed a year after Olaus Murie's death which preserved 10 million acres of land in Alaska and today has preserved 100 million acres of land in Alaska as well as impacting other parts of the United States. After the death of Olaus in 1963, Mardy Murie joined the Society's governing council and continued Olaus' work, still living at the ranch. Mardy decided to honor her husband by working to preserve the nature which they both loved. In 1980, sixteen years after her husband Olaus died at 73 years old, Mardy Murie helped pass the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act which saved one hundred million acres in Alaska. Mardy was a very passionate woman who was also very emotional. This helped her unite everybody that she talked to as she tried to conserve nature. She had the ability and the humility to reach across generations, careers, power levels and positions. Mardy lived to be 101 years old and in the course of her life was recognized by four presidents. John Denver wrote a song about her entitled, 'A Song for All Lovers' about Mardy Murie and Olaus Murie waltzing in the Arctic wilderness. STS Ranch The STS was established by Buster and Frances Estes (n√©e Mears) near Menor's Ferry in 1921 as a dude ranch. Buster was a local, while Frances first came to Jackson Hole from Philadelphia to visit the Bar B C Dude Ranch in 1914. Mears and Estes fell in love, marrying over the objections of Mears' family. In 1922 the Estes heard from Holiday Menor that were available just down the river from Menor's Ferry on the west side of the river. The Estes built a cabin and moved in in January, 1923. The dude ranch started small, with a single guest cabin and one tent. By 1927 the STS featured a log cabin, two frame cabins, a barn, a garage, and the five-room main house. The Estes gradually expanded to a capacity of 24 dudes, charging $55 per week, less than the $70 or more charged by the White Grass or Bar B C. The ranch flourished for a while, but was badly affected by the Great Depression. Rates went down, and a portion of the property was leased to the Nelson brothers, who built what is now the Murie residence. Buster and Frances built a new log house in 1940, but closed the ranch during World War II and worked in war production in Salt Lake City. The STS was purchased by the Muries (Adolph and Louise, and Olaus and Mardy) in 1946, with Adolph and Louise living in the original ranch buildings, Olaus and Mardie living in the Nelson house after 1950. The sale to the Muries was contingent on the Muries never operating the place as a dude ranch. Murie Ranch The Murie property amounted to next to the village of Moose. Olaus immediately removed the property's fences. The Nelson house was purchased in 1950 and occupied by Olaus and Mardy. The Muries partially dammed an offshoot of the Snake to use as a swimming hole, the work completed by beavers. Olaus wrote about the ranch and its wildlife in his book Jackson Hole with a Naturalist. Principal structures include: * The Studio: A one-story log building built in 1947 with one room and a front porch, used by Olaus Murie as a painting and drawing studio. * Homestead Cabin/STS Lodge: The original Estes homestead, built in 1925, the Homestead Cabin was the principal building of the STS Ranch. It was expanded gradually, evolving from a square to a T-shaped plan with additions for a lounge, dining room and library. The homestead's doors are notably short, since Buster Estes was short and adapted the doors to his dimensions. * Murie Residence: Formerly the Woodbury Residence, the one story log house was built in 1942 with views of Grand Teton from within. The original house comprises eight rooms, with another room in a 1950s addition. * Chena Cabin: A one-story log building with three rooms. * Estes Cabin: The home of Buster and Frances Estes after they made their homestead cabin into the STS Lodge, the Estes Cabin was moved to the site from an unknown location in Jackson. It was originally built about 1925. After the Muries purchased the ranch, it was occupied by Inger Koedt. * Robin's Nest Cabin: Located next to the Estes Cabin, the single-room cabin was built about 1925. The Estes used it as a bedroom for their daughter, while Inger Koedt used it as a guesthouse. * Moviewood Cabin: The wood frame cabin was built about 1925, and was used as an office and cutting room for a documentary on Mardy Murie entitled Arctic Dance: The Mardy Murie Story. It is now an office for the Murie Foundation. * Alatna Dulex Cabin: The Alatna was built about 1925 as a one-story, two-room log cabin with a communicating door between rooms, each of which has a separate exterior door. * Cabin Belvedere: A one-room 1925 log cabin. * Cabin Polaris: Similar to Belvedere, the cabin was once thought to be Adolph Murie's study, an idea now discredited. * Montana Duplex Cabin: Divided into two equal rooms, the 1925 Montana cabin was used as two guest units, with no interior door. * Wild Lone Cabin: Located at a distance from the main complex, the Wild Lone cabin was built about 1925 as a one-room log cabin. Most of the cabins have an associated outhouse. The complex also includes a number of garages, sheds and utility buildings. A barn and storage shed were removed from the site and taken elsewhere in the 1970s. The properties were declared a National Historic Landmark in 2006.

It is dedicated to enhancing the ability of academic library and information professionals to serve the information needs of the higher education community and to improving learning, teaching, and research. The association serves librarians in all types of academic libraries at the community college, college, and university level and also serves librarians that work in comprehensive and specialized research libraries. The Association of College and Research Libraries is the largest division of the American Library Association. It has a membership of approximately 12,000, accounting for nearly 20% of the total American Library Association membership, and provides a broad range of professional services and programs for a diverse membership. The Association publishes an open access journal, College & Research Libraries.  History  The Association of College and Research Libraries has its roots as the College Library section of the American Library Association, which first met in 1890, attended by 15 librarians representing major colleges located on the east coast of the United States. In 1897 the section was renamed the College and Reference Library Section in recognition of the participation of reference librarians. In 1923, the section established bylaws and began charging dues. In 1938, the section adopted new bylaws which moved the section to the Association of College and Reference Libraries and allowed for more autonomy and for the creation of subsections for college and junior college libraries, teachers college libraries, university libraries, and others. In 1940, Association of College and Research Libraries became the American Library Association's first division. In 1956, when the Library Reference Services Division was established as a separate division of the American Library Association, the Association of College and Research Libraries changed the \\"Reference\\" to \\"Research\\" in its name and became the Association of College and Research Libraries. In 1978, they held their first standalone conference. On January 11, 2016, the ACRL adopted the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education.  Controversy  On April 11, 2019 Jon E. Cawthorne, dean of Detroit's Wayne State University Library System and the university's School of Information Sciences, was elected vice-president/president-elect of ACRL. In the autumn of 2019, Wayne State University provost Keith Whitfield announced that Wayne State University Press, the university's award-winning scholarly publishing arm founded in 1941, would shift from reporting to the provost to reporting to Jon Cawthorne. On February 7, 2020, Cawthorne directed that three long-time senior employees on its five-member management team be terminated. The following week, more than 60 authors and scholars who had worked with the press signed a letter demanding the reinstatement of the three. After two weeks of protests by the press's editorial board, authors, and readers, Wayne State University president M. Roy Wilson reversed the decision, reinstated the three, and shifted the press's reporting line to his own office. Cawthorne's actions at Wayne State University while vice-president/president-elect of ACRL led to questions about whether it marked a shift in the organization's stance toward university presses. ACRL would not respond to repeated offers to comment.  Sections  The Association of College and Research Libraries supports seventeen sections: * African American Studies Librarians Section * Anthropology and Sociology Section * Arts Section * Asian, African, and Middle Eastern Section * College Libraries Section * Community and Junior College Libraries Section * Distance Learning Section * Education and Behavioral Sciences Section * Instruction Section * Law and Political Science Section * Literatures in English Section * Rare Books and Manuscripts Section * Science and Technology Section * Slavic and East European Section * University Libraries Section * Western European Studies Section * Women and Gender Studies Section  Awards  The Association of College and Research Libraries issues awards annually to honor academic and research librarians for significant achievements.

Where it works WTCP does not replace the TCP on the hosts, but is placed on a proxy in between two communicating hosts. In wireless systems, WTCP is placed on a base station or intermediate gateway between a source host and a mobile (wireless) host. The base station is a wireless transmitter and receiver for the mobile host, and acts as a gateway to the internet for the host. The following is a highly simplified example of what happens when the mobile host and source host have a TCP connection with each other: When the mobile host uses its TCP to send a segment, the WTCP at the base station receives it and sends it on through the network, where it eventually reaches the awaiting host. The awaiting host might send an acknowledgment back through the network, to the base station, which transmits it to the mobile host. Despite handling some wireless-related errors, WTCP effectively does exactly what regular TCP does. The two edge hosts aren't even aware that the WTCP exists. Performance enhancements Instead of replacing TCP completely, WTCP works with it to enhance TCP's performance over wireless. It accomplishes this by handling the negative effects of the wireless channel, including high bit error rates that are known to occur in bursts over the wireless medium. It detects wireless-related problems (such as lost or corrupted segments due to multipath fading or high BER) with the use of timeouts and duplicate acknowledgments. WTCP then attempts to mitigate the problem by retransmitting a lost segment only once, until it receives an acknowledgment back from the mobile host that it was received. Any other lost segments will have to wait in the WTCP's buffer until the first one is confirmed to have been received. There are times when packets will sit in WTCP's buffer for many milliseconds. In order to avoid having either TCP end host go into its congestion avoidance mode, (due to TCP looking at a segment's timestamp and determining that it took a long time to arrive, therefore wrongly assuming it's due to congestion) WTCP uniquely hides the time spent by the packets at the WTCP proxy, so that the RTT estimation is not affected. In one study on WTCP's performance in Wireless WANs, WTCP showed an improvement of 20‚Äì200% over comparable TCP algorithms such as New Reno, Vegas, and Snoop.Sinha Prasun et al., WTCP: A Reliable Transport Protocol for Wireless Wide-Area Networks, 1999 References Transport layer protocols ","title":"WTCP"},{"id":"16028464","text":"The Crayon Box is an American children's TV series that was aired in syndication from 1997 to 1998, based on a poem by Shane DeRolf.

His self-published books include Technocracy in America: Rise of the Info-State. Criticism In 2011, The New Republic named him one of the \\"Most Over-Rated Thinkers\\" of the year, calling one of his books a \\"self-congratulatory anthology of clich√©s and platitudes\\". In the same magazine a year later, Evgeny Morozov was strongly critical of Khanna: while reviewing Hybrid Reality, he described Khanna as an \\"intellectual impostor\\" possessed of \\"contempt for democracy and human rights\\", and criticised his admiration of authoritarian governments in China and Singapore.

Family tree of Chinese monarchs (ancient) ‚Üí Family tree of Chinese monarchs (Warring States period) ‚Üí Family tree of Chinese monarchs (early) ‚Üí Family tree of Chinese monarchs (middle) ‚Üí Family tree of Chinese monarchs (late) Yuan dynasty and Northern Yuan The following is the Yuan dynasty family tree. Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire in 1206. The empire became split beginning with the succession war of his grandsons Kublai Khan and Ariq Boke. Kublai Khan, after defeating his younger brother Ariq Boke, founded the Yuan dynasty in China in 1271. The dynasty was overthrown by the Ming dynasty during the reign of Toghun Tem√ºr in 1368, but it survived in the Mongolian Plateau, known as the Northern Yuan dynasty; years of reign over the Northern Yuan dynasty (up to 1388) are given in brackets. The Mongol Great Khans (Khagans) before Kublai Khan were only declared Yuan emperors after the creation of Yuan dynasty in 1271. Ming dynasty and Southern Ming The following is a simplified family tree for the Ming dynasty, which ruled China between 1368 and 1644. Those who became emperor are listed in bold, with their years of reign. In China, Ming emperors are best known by their temple names, which are given second below, after the personal name. (The Jianwen Emperor was not awarded a temple name: his posthumous name, Huidi (ÊÉ†Â∏ù), is used instead.) The names given in bold are era names, the form by which Ming emperors are most commonly known in English, but which technically refer to the timespan of an emperor's reign rather than to the emperor himself. (Xingzong and Ruizong are temple names: they never actually ruled, but Xingzong was posthumously granted an emperor's title and Ruizong was raised posthumously to the status of emperor by his son, the Jiajing Emperor, in the Great Rites Controversy.) The imperial family's original family name was Zhu (Êú±), but the Hongwu Emperor adopted the dynastic name Ming (Êòé) (as were all but one imperial Chinese dynasties), meaning \\"brilliant\\". The numbers here indicate the seniority in birth of an emperor's sons as the Ming Dynasty was the only Chinese dynasty to have the eldest surviving son succeed the throne in continuous fashion (though not for the Yongle, from whom all subsequent Ming emperors descend and Jingtai Emperors ‚Äì both of whom usurped the throne; while the Jiajing ‚Äì see above, and Chongzhen Emperors succeeded sonless brother), not unlike the Salic Law practised in some contemporary European monarchies (except that the eldest son by a non- principal consort was duly considered). After the fall of the dynasty in 1644 and the Chongzhen Emperor's suicide, a series of Ming princes based in the south of China claimed the imperial title, their court being known as the Southern Ming dynasty. These claimants are given with their era names, and the timespans of their purported reigns in brackets. Their purported periods of rule are given in brackets. In 1662, Koxinga regained control of Taiwan from the Dutch colonial regime, and established a state for those who wished restore the Ming dynasty to power. This state lasted until 1683, when it submitted to the Qing dynasty. Legend: * - Ming dynasty emperors * - Southern Ming emperors Later Jin and Qing dynasty The following is a simplified family tree for the Qing dynasty, which was established in 1636, ruled China proper from 1644 to 1912. Those who became emperor of China are listed in bold, with their years of reign. Nurhaci was Khan of Later Jin from 1616 to 1626. Hong Taiji was Khan of Later Jin from 1626 to 1636, and Emperor of the Qing dynasty from 1636 to 1643. During these periods, the two monarchs only dominated Manchuria, but were not emperors of China as a whole; their years of reign over the dynasty are therefore given in brackets. The names given for emperors are era names, the form by which Qing emperors were most commonly known (with the exception of Puyi, who ruled as the Xuantong Emperor, but was generally known by his given name after his deposition). Puyi abdicated as head of state on February 12, 1912, but was permitted to retain his imperial titles until 1924. The imperial family's original Manchu clan name was Aisin Gioro (lit. \\"golden clan\\"). The dynasty was originally titled the Later Jin dynasty, in reference to its origins in the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty (1115‚Äì1234), by Nurhaci in 1616, but in 1636 Hong Taiji opted to replace this title with the Chinese dynastic title Qing (Ê∏Ö), meaning \\"clear\\" or \\"pure\\". * - Qing dynasty emperors * - 1st generation of Iron Cap Princes * ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì - The dashed lines denotes the adoptions References * baike.baidu.com External links * baike.baidu.com Dynasty genealogy Family trees * ","title":"Family tree of Chinese monarchs (late)"},{"id":"16028596","title":"Midnight in Montgomery"},{"id":"16028621","text":"Utricularia bracteata is a medium-sized, probably perennial carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia.

Plot Park Man-soo is an ordinary salaryman who lives his life according to a strict set of rules, and this lack of flexibility makes him hard to like at home and at the office. One day, his wife asks for a divorce because she's bored with their life, and he is fired because his corrupt boss hates him. So on his way home, the frustrated and outraged Man-soo tries to set himself free by breaking all the rules that have restricted him his entire life by deviating from them, just for one day. He swears at passers-by, kicks signboards and pees on the street, and he is soon placed under arrest by Ma Dong-chul, a demoted but zealous cop. Officer Ma takes him to the police station to teach him a lesson, where Man-soo meets Yang Chul-gon, a career criminal with 15 previous convictions, who finds it more comfortable to be behind bars. Chul-gon incites the desperate and timid Man-soo to escape the police station with him, and through a series of mishaps, they happen to steal a gun and police car, with which they also try their hand at punishing \\"law dodgers\\" themselves. With Officer Ma in hot pursuit, Man-soo and Chul-gon find themselves branded as antisocial vigilantes, and the fine for Man-soo's original misdemeanor has now turned into a potential life sentence.

Chardin painted several versions, one of which was given as a gift to Louis XV. The subject of the painting, a middle class French family saying grace before a meal, is one of everyday bourgeois tranquillity‚ÄîChardin's field of expertise‚Äîwith an uncharacteristic touch of sentimentality. History Chardin, who had made his fame painting still life, had at this point in his career started also to include human figures in his works.Rosenberg, p. 12. He painted several versions of Le B√©n√©dicit√©, three of which were exhibited at the Salon, in 1740, 1746 and 1761.Rand and Bianco, p. 128. The original, from 1740, was given as a gift to the King.Hyland, p. 271. The painting fell into oblivion ten years after the death of Louis XV, but was rediscovered in 1845. Another version was kept by the artist throughout his life, and eventually ended up in the Mus√©e du Louvre, through the large bequest of Louis La Caze in 1869. The version from the 1761 Salon - a horizontal composition - is now lost. The painting Chardin is well known for his depictions of humble, everyday life.Gombrich, p. 470 Le B√©n√©dicit√© shows a modest, middle-class interior scene, where a mother is laying the table for a meal. She instructs her children to say their grace before eating. The younger of the children can easily appear a girl to the modern eye, if the drum hanging on the child-sized ladderback chair is overlooked,The drum is as iconic a boy's toy in depictions of children as a doll is a girl's. Boys were in petticoats and dresses until they were \\"breeched\\" at about the age of six. and is indeed identified as such in Gardner.Gardner, p. 640 Rand and Bianco, however, quote the inscription on a contemporary engraving, describing the child as a boy,Rand and Bianco, p. 128 who has not yet been breeched. The quiet, peaceful atmosphere is reinforced by the subdued colour scheme, and the muted lighting.Gardner, p. 640. Chardin put much work into the arrangement of the various elements of his paintings. The composition here is meticulous, and the stability created by the triangular structure of the three figures also adds to the tranquillity of the scene. Hermitage version =Variants= The Louvre holds a variant exhibited at the 1740 Paris Salon. There are other variants in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam (with a small boy added on the left) and the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm. =Hermitage version= The only work of this title by Chardin signed and dated in his own hand dates to 1744. It is signed in the bottom left hand corner. Chardin was presented to Louis XV at the Palace of Versailles on 27 November 1740 by Philibert Orry, the king's superintendent of buildings and controller general of finances ‚Äì Chardin's only meeting with the monarch. This was one of two paintings the artist presented to Louis on that occasion; the Mercure de France reported that the king \\"received [the paintings] very favourably; these two little works are already well known, having been exhibited at the Salon in the Louvre last August. We mentioned them in the October Mercure, under the title The Laborious Mother and Saying Grace.\\" The work is now in the Hermitage Museum, which it entered between 1763 and 1774 under Catherine II of Russia. Reception Chardin is often contrasted to Watteau, whose paintings of aristocratic life differ greatly from those of Chardin's common people. It is not known for certain whether Le B√©n√©dicit√© was painted with Louis XV in mind, or if it was the king who personally picked the painting out from the 1740 exhibition. In either case, the purchase shows the appeal the painting had to its contemporaries. When it was rediscovered in 1845 - on the eve of the revolutions of 1848 - it had taken on a whole new meaning. To the bourgeois establishment, the works of Chardin now represented a salutary contrast to the 'decadent aristocratic flimsy' of Watteau.

When Pakistan came into being the port city of Karachi was chosen as the capital of the federation. An area within Karachi was selected to serve as the home of federal government offices and employees and house other important buildings. = Federal Capital Area = This area was named as Federal Capital Area or F.C.

Biography  Pardal was originally hired by the Spanish to attack English bases in the Caribbean following Captain Henry Morgan's raid on Puerto Bello in 1668. Although it was anticipated that he would take on Morgan himself, Pardal instead attacked the turtle settlement on Little Cayman in 1669. Flying under false colors with a fleet of five ships, Pardal's 200-man force landed on the beach, burned homes and turtle sloops and captured the Jamaican ship Hopewell. Before leaving for Cuba, he reportedly took two sloops and several prisoners with him. While in Cuba, he encountered Dutch pirate Bernard Speirdyke and later captured his ship. Upon his return to Cartagena in 1671, a festival was held in his honor, and he was appointed \\"Admiral of the Corsairs\\" by the governor. During that same year, he sailed with his flagship the San Pedro and a captured French frigate, seizing another sloop and attacking remote villages on the northern Jamaican coastline. According to popular lore, he wrote a poem issuing a challenge to Captain Henry Morgan which was written on sailcloth and hung on a tree at Point Negril: :\\"I come to seek General Morgan with two shippes of twenty guns and, having seen this, I crave he would come out upon ye coast to seeke mee, that hee might see ye valour of ye Spanish.\\" Authorities in Jamaica were alarmed to the extent that Governor Thomas Modyford authorized Captain Morgan to defend Port Royal against Pardal; however, Morgan instead used this an excuse to assemble a fleet to launch the now famous raid on Panama, in spite of the peace agreement between England and Spain following the signing of the Treaty of Madrid. Pardal was eventually killed and his flagship San Pedro y Fama captured off the north coast of Cuba in battle against Captain John Morris, a lieutenant of Captain Morgan. Lawson, Wood.

This act followed the February 28, 2008 power-sharing agreement between current President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga, who became the first prime minister of Kenya since 1964, when the constitution of the newly created Republic abolished the office. The agreement was necessitated by the 2007-08 Kenyan crisis. Details of the act The Cabinet created by the act consists of the president, vice-president, prime minister, two deputy prime ministers, and 42 other appointed ministers. The Prime Minister, while being appointed by the President without the need for prior consultation, has a distinct portfolio and coordinates the reform agenda and supervise ministries. The PM is also accountable to the President and is immune from civil or criminal prosecution. Like in most other parliamentary democracies, the prime minister's government is dependent upon the party majority or power-sharing coalition majority in parliament. It will fall from power if or when: * the 10th Kenyan Parliament is dissolved, or * the coalition members agree in writing, or * one coalition member withdraws from the coalition by resolution of the member's party's decision-making body *The Constitution of Kenya, enacted in August 2010 provided for the extension of the power sharing government to the end of its natural term. The Prime Minister can be dismissed from office by majority vote of the Parliament. In the drafting, the act suggests that the Permanent Secretary in the Prime Minister's office will serve as Secretary to the Cabinet and head of the civil service, which means that this Permanent Secretary will also coordinate the work of other Permanent Secretaries. In the final draft, and consequent bill, the language of the Act did not dictate that the PS in the PM's office would serve as the Secretary to the Cabinet and thus the Head of the Civil Service. The role of the PM and his office as per the Act is to supervise and co-ordinate activities of government. The role of the Head of Civil Service as per the constitution is to implement policy directives given to the office by the Office of the President. The vagueness of these two roles has neither been in addressed in the National Accord Act nor the Constitution of Kenya, thus creating discrepancies that resulted in a brief power struggle between the two partners in the coalition. The National Accord does not state whether the Act itself takes precedence over the Constitution of Kenya or not, thus leading to an impasse in the appointment of the Leader of Government Business that persisted for several months before being resolved. The act also does not spell out the events that would follow if one of the partners from the coalition withdraws. History of enactment Two drafts of the reconciliation act were created: * one by the PNU-led government known as the Establishment of the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister's Act 2008, which would create a non-executive prime minister * one presented by the ODM-majority assembly, known as the National Accord and Reconciliation Act 2008, which would create a grand executive coalition between the ODM and PNU. The ODM draft was passed on March 18, 2008, soon after the National Assembly convened on March 6th.

The goal of the 5\\"/25 design was to produce a heavy AA gun that was light enough to be rapidly trained manually. The gun was also mounted on pre-World War II battleships and aircraft carriers until replaced by the standard dual-purpose 5\\"/38 caliber gun, which was derived from the 5\\"/25 and was similar except for the barrel length. Guns removed from battleships were probably converted for submarine use by late 1943, while a purpose-built variant for submarines was available in mid-1944, and was widely used by them.Campbell 1985 p.137 United States naval gun terminology indicates the gun fired a projectile 5 inches (127 mm) in diameter, and the barrel was 25 calibers long (that is, for a 5\\" bore and a barrel length of 25 calibers, 5\\" x 25 = 125\\", or about 3.2 meters).Fairfield 1921 p.156 History bombardment of Saipan, 15 June 1944 The gun weighed about 2 metric tons and used fixed ammunition (case and projectile handled as a single assembled unit) with a 9.6-pound (4.4 kg) charge of smokeless powder to give a 54-pound (24 kg) projectile a velocity of 2100 feet per second (640 m/s). The ceiling was at the maximum elevation of 85 degrees. Useful life expectancy was 4260 effective full charges (EFC) per barrel. The short barrel of the 5\\"/25 made it much easier to train manually against fast-moving targets. These guns were manually controlled so the short barrel and light weight made it an early favorite as an anti-aircraft gun. Another key feature was power loading, allowing rapid fire at high elevation angles. The 5\\"/38 caliber gun replaced the 5\\"/25 as the anti-aircraft weapon of choice on new construction by the mid-1930s due to its better range, velocity against surface targets, and higher vertical ceiling. 5\\"/25 guns removed from pre-war battleships (especially those rebuilt after Pearl Harbor) had their barrel linings chromed. These guns were remounted for submarine use beginning in late 1943 for extra firepower against small boats and sampans often encountered off the coast of Japan and elsewhere in the Pacific Theater, replacing the earlier 3-inch and 4-inch guns. New production Mark 17 5\\"/25 guns on the Mark 40 mount designed for submarines became available in mid-1944; was the first submarine built with this gun. Some submarines had two of these weapons. The Mark 17 gun in the Mark 40 submarine gun mount used semi-fixed ammunition (case and projectile handled separately) and had a range of at the maximum elevation of 40 degrees.Campbell 1985 p.138 The submarine mounting had manual elevation, train, and loading with no power assist. From late 1944 some submarines were built or refitted with two of these weapons. The first of these was , commissioned on 22 August 1944.

Plot summary Edgar Huntly, a young man who lives with his uncle and sisters (his only remaining family) on a farm outside Philadelphia, is determined to learn who murdered his friend Waldegrave. Walking near the elm tree under which Waldegrave was killed late one night, Huntly sees Clithero, a servant from a neighboring farm, half-dressed, digging in the ground and weeping loudly. Huntly concludes that Clithero may be the murderer. He also concludes that Clithero is sleepwalking. Huntly decides to follow Clithero when he sleep walks. Clithero leads Huntly through rough countryside, but all this following doesn't lead to Huntly learning much about the murder. Eventually, Huntly confronts Clithero when they are both awake and demands that he confess. Clithero does confess, but not to Waldegrave's murder. Instead he tells a complicated story about his life in Ireland, where he believes he was responsible for the death of a woman who was his patron, after which he fled to Pennsylvania. Clithero claims to know nothing about Waldegrave's murder. One night, soon after Huntly goes to sleep in his own bed, he wakes up in a completely dark place made of rock, which he eventually determines is a cave. He is hungry, thirsty, and feels as though he's been beaten. He is attacked by a panther, which he manages to kill and then drinks some of its blood and eats some of its flesh. Looking for his way out of the cave, he finds that some Lenni Lenape, an Indian tribe, are holding a white girl prisoner at the mouth of the cave. Edgar kills the guard and rescues the girl. In their flight, he kills more Indians, who seem to have begun a war. By the end of the novel, Edgar learns (among other things) that he himself has been sleepwalking, that Clithero was indeed not involved in Waldegrave's murder, that Waldegrave was murdered by a Lenni Lenape Indian, perhaps one he himself had killed, and that he and his fianc√©e are both destined to inherit nothing. Themes =Sleepwalking= In the novel, both Clithero and Huntly are sleepwalkers, although at the beginning of the book Huntly does not realize it. Sleepwalking is prevalent in the story, and Brown uses this device to drive the plot of the novel. For example, Huntly first notices Clithero while Clithero is sleepwalking near the Elm tree. This is what leads Huntly to investigate into Clithero's activities further, and why Huntly accuses Clithero of killing Waldegrave. It is while Huntly is following a sleep- walking Clithero that he first comes to the cave, which plays a major role in the plot. The entire second half of the novel revolves around the travelings of Huntly as he tries to return home; this occurs because Huntly wakes up in the bottom of a cave which he entered into by sleep-walking. Waldegrave's papers also mysteriously disappear, but later the reader learns that they were misplaced by Huntly during the night. Because Huntly was sleepwalking while he did this, he has no recollection of the events and the missing papers are therefore a great concern to him. At the end of the novel, Huntly no longer has troubles with sleepwalking. =Morality and Truth= According to Scott Bradfield, \\"Brown's notion of truth is so deeply private, so radically democratic, it never firmly or fully establishes itself anywhere or in any one person. All people stand equal in their judgment of the truth, because no permanent, instantly accessible field of knowledge exists to which they can submit.\\"Bradfield, Scott. Dreaming Revolution: Transgression in the Development of American Romance. Iowa City: U of Iowa P. 1993. This idea can be found in this novel, especially in Clithero and Huntly. In Clithero's tale, for example, he goes to kill his caretaker Mrs. Lorimer, because he killed her brother. In Clithero's mind, he reasons that Mrs. Lorimer would be better off dead then learning about the death of her brother, especially because she herself said that she could not live with the knowledge of his death. Clithero therefore thinks that what he is doing is an act of mercy instead of murder. When Huntly first hears this tale, he is moved by compassion and also twists his reasoning and logic to come to that conclusion. However, at the end of the novel, when Clithero goes out in search for Mrs. Lorimer again, Huntly realizes his mistake. Huntly also has many moral dilemmas in this novel. In the last half of the novel when he is called upon to kill Indians, he says that \\"My aversion to bloodshed was not to be subdued but by the direst necessity.\\"Brown, Charles Brockden. Edgar Huntly, or, memoirs of a Sleep- Walker. New York: Viking Penguin. 1988. Those dire circumstances occur, and soon Huntly has killed three Indians, to which he remarks, \\"Three beings, full of energy and heroism, endowed with minds strenuous and lofty, poured out their lives before me. I was the instrument of their destruction. This scene of carnage and blood was laid by me. To this havock and horror was I led by such rapid footsteps!\\" Huntly mourns the fact that he had to take human life, however, later in the book he learns that one of the Indians he had slain might have been responsible for killing Waldegrave, and this knowledge comforts his conscience. Huntly's justification of killing is similar to Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov's justification in Crime and Punishment. They both see their actions as fulfilling a higher and more noble purpose. In this novel there seems to be no value for human life, especially Indian life. =The Gothic= In his preface, Brown claims that he will not use the same means as previous authors to create the Gothic feel. That is, he will not use \\"puerile superstition and exploded manners; Gothic castles and chimeras.\\" However, as one continues to read through the book they soon find that Brown didn't completely live up to his promise. Brown creates the Gothic feel of the novel in order to create suspense. He does this through scenery and setting, mysterious characters, hidden secrets, and so forth. For example, the cave, which is a key element of the novel, is described as being completely dark. Not only that, but there are various paths within the cave that one can take, making the cave mysterious as well. Another example is the character Arthur Wiatte. His motives are to destroy and tear down. One might say he shows signs of having the Imp of the Perverse, which is when one does evil simply because it is evil. Coincidence also occurs frequently. In one instance, Huntly is trying to open an enigmatic wooden box. While this would be impossible to most people, Huntly is able to open it because he just so happens to be a wooden box maker. Another time, the path in the cave that Huntly takes leads right up to where Clithero is hiding. Many of the characters that were in Clithero's tale also happened to be known by Huntly, for example, Sarsefield. Huntly barely escapes death multiple times. Once, a log bridging a large chasm allows Huntly to escape a panther, and falls just as the panther is crossing over, saving Huntly's life. Another time Huntly manages to somehow escape being shot at repeatedly by jumping into a nearby river. These instances add to the suspense of the novel, as well as its Gothic tone.

Although there is a discography section at the back of the album sleeve notes, this is only a joke and the group only have released this album as well as the \\"Samo Ljubezen\\" single. One notable thing about this album is that although it only features ten songs, each one is different in terms of style and taste. Most of the tracks segue into each other. This album features the song \\"Samo Ljubezen\\" which the group performed at the Eurovision Song Contest 2002.

Their song \\"Samo Ljubezen\\" was number 1 in the Slovenian charts for five weeks. The second track on the album \\"Latina Bambina\\" was played a few times on Slovenian radio and it was intended to be a follow up record to \\"Samo Ljubezen\\", however this was not pursued for some reason. This album is mainly in the Slovenian language but it does feature parts in other languages too. The final track \\"Together Forever\\" has been mistaken on a few occasions as being the English version of \\"Samo Ljubezen\\", however it is not.

SWAT (also known as Los Angeles SWAT) is a 1986 video game released by Mastertronic for the Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. In this game, the player assumed the role of a Los Angeles police officer fighting rioters. In each level, the player would move toward the top of the screen avoiding or shooting the rioters, who would either lob grenades, if at a distance, or beat your character to the pavement with clubs if in melee range. At the end of each level, a procession of gang members (usually with a single shirt color, marching in formation) would stream down from the top of the screen. After killing all of these gang members, a single gang member, the boss, would move randomly around the screen with a woman next to him. This functioned a bit like a sharpshooting competition, as shooting the woman would cause the player to lose points, while successfully shooting only the ganger would cause her to \\"take the arm\\" of your character. As the levels progress, the gangers become more frequent and the player will begin to see cars placed perpendicular to the street, acting as roadblocks. The C64 disk packaged L.A. SWAT with Panther, another Mastertronic game. The A-side of the disk contained the two programs from C64/128, while the B-side contained Atari 8-bit versions.

The Tepehu√°n Indians attempted to break free from Spanish rule. The revolt was crushed by 1620 after a large loss of life on both sides. The Tepehu√°n People The Tepehu√°n Indians lived on the rugged eastern slopes and valleys of the Sierra Madre Occidental, primarily in the future state of Durango. They spoke a Uto-Aztecan language and depended mostly on agriculture for their livelihood. Thus, they differed from their neighbors in the deserts to the east, the Chichimeca who were nomadic and semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers. The Tepehu√°n, Acaxee, and Xixime to their west shared common traits such as The Tepehu√°n suffered a series of devastating epidemics of European-introduced diseases in the years before the revolt. Epidemics were known to have occurred in their region in 1594, 1601-1602, 1606-1607, 1610, and 1616-1617.Schmal, John P. ‚ÄúThe History of Indigenous Durango.‚Äô http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/durango.html; Deeds, Susan M.

The Spanish failed to defeat the Chichimeca militarily and instituted a new policy called \\"peace by purchase\\" in which Catholic missionaries would be a major tool in pacifying hostile and semi-hostile Indians. Indians were to be supplied with food and tools and resettled into towns. Missionaries, rather than the military, would take on most of the responsibility for integrating the Indians into Mexican and Christian society.Philip W. Powell, Soldiers, Indians, and Silver: The Northward Advance of New Spain, 1550-1600, Berkeley: University of California Press 1952. The Acaxee and Xixime were the first to have this new Spanish policy applied to them and the Tepehu√°n would be next.Gradie, Charlotte M., Tepehuan Revolt of 1616. Salt Lake City: U of UT Press, 2000, p. 32 Quautlatas and the Jesuits Spanish settlers began coming to the Tepehuan country in the 1570s to mine silver and raise cattle. The Jesuits began missionary work among the Tepehuan in 1596, establishing missions at Santiago Papasquiaro and Santa Catarina de Tepehuanes and, later, El Zape. The Tepehuanes seemed relatively receptive to the missionaries, although they resisted living near the missions and working in Spanish mines and on haciendas, and often raided Indians friendly with Spanish. Nevertheless, by 1615, a Jesuit could declare that the Tepehuanes ‚Äúshowed great progress and were in the things of our holy faith muy ladino\\" (much like the Spanish).Gradie, p. 148 In 1616, however, a messianic leader named Quautlatas who had been baptized as a Christian, arose among the Tepehu√°n. Quaultlatas traveled throughout the mountains, his symbol a broken cross, preaching that the gods were angry because the Tepehuan had abandoned them and that they must kill or expel all Spaniards, especially the missionaries, from their lands. Quaultlatas‚Äô appeal to his people blended Christian and Indian beliefs. He called himself a bishop and he promised that all those killed by the Spanish would rise again after seven days and that, after the Spanish were killed, the old gods would bless their land with good crops and fat cattle ‚Äì cattle being a Spanish introduction.Gradie, 149 Quautlatas' message was typical of the millenarian movements which emerge in societies under extreme stress. Other examples in the Americas and worldwide, include, the Pueblo Revolt, the Ghost Dance, and the Boxer Rebellion.http://www.essaytown.com/paper/taiping-rebellion-boxer-rebellion- introduction-last-centuries-13703, accessed Feb 10, 2011; Graziano, Frank, The Millennial New World. New York: Oxford U Press, 1999, pp 115-119 In attempting to explain the cause of the Tepehu√°n revolt the Jesuits denied any Spanish responsibility. Rather, they saw the Spanish impact as beneficial. ‚ÄúEver since the Spanish settled here, there has been an abundance of food, clothing, riches, and other material comforts,‚Äù said the priest Andres Perez de Ribas.Perez de Ribas, Andres, tr. Reff, Daniel History of the Triumphs of our Holy Faith amongst the most Barbarous and Fierce Peoples of the New World. Tucson, U of AZ Press, 1999, p. 574 What the Jesuits did not see was the connection in the Indian‚Äôs mind between the arrival of the Spanish and death. The Jesuits celebrated the souls saved by deathbed baptisms, but the Tepehu√°n said that ‚Äúthe fathers had brought them disease and death with baptism, because after they were baptized they fell sick and died.‚Äù The Jesuit practice of consolidating the Indians into fewer and larger settlements facilitated the easy spread of disease.Gradie, p. 26 in Jesuit eyes the opportunity to live in a town was a characteristic of civilization and was to be encouraged ‚Äì or forced ‚Äì upon the Indians.Perez de Ribas and Reff, Daniel , p. 38 Moreover, the Jesuits worked closely with the Spanish encomenderos and miners to provide them with a steady supply of Indian laborers.Gradie, p. 121 As the Spanish perceived that they were providing both earthly and heavenly benefits to the Tepehu√°n, their explanation was that the revolt was the work of the devil. ‚ÄúIt was Satan who intervened here, with a pure scheme and design‚Ä¶This was most clearly demonstrated by the diabolical shamans who had intimate dealings with the Devil and were the main force and instigators of the uprising.‚Äù Quautlatas was identified with the Antichrist and the Jesuit's assertion that the revolt was the work of the devil exonerated the Spaniards from blame.Reff, Daniel T. ‚ÄúThe Predicament of Culture‚Äù and Spanish Missionary Accounts of the Tepehuan and Pueblo Revolts.‚Äù Ethnohistory 42:1 (Winter 1995), pp. 66-67, 81 On their part, the Tepehu√°n fought to return to their traditional ways of life, hoping that worshiping their old gods and practicing their old culture would halt the horrific loss of life due to European diseases and their virtual enslavement by the Spanish priests, miners, and encomenderos. The revolt On November 16, 1616, a wagon train traveling to Mexico City was attacked by the Tepehu√°n just outside Santa Catarina de Tepehuanes, a small village in the eastern foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Thus began what Jesuit historian Andr√©s P√©rez de Ribas called the revolt Before it was finished four years later, more than 200 Spaniards, 10 missionaries, an unknown number of Indians, Black slaves, and mestizos allied with the Spanish, and perhaps 4,000 Tepehu√°n died, many of hunger and disease, with destruction to property valued as much as a million pesos.Gradie, p. 1 The Tepehu√°n attack on the Spaniards, under six war chiefs, most notably Franciso Gogoxito, was well coordinated as nearly simultaneous attacks at missions and Spanish settlements occurred throughout the region. 100 people were killed in a church at El Zape and a similar number died in Santiago Papasquiaro. Only a single Jesuit missionary in Tepehu√°n territory survived the initial attacks. At the first report of the outbreak, and fearing an attack on Durango itself (Guadiana), Governor Gaspar de Alvear arrested 75 local Indian leaders and ordered them executed.Hackett, Charles Wilson in The North Mexican Frontier, ed. by Basil C. Hedrick, J. Charles Kelley, and Carroll L. Riley. Carbondale:S Ill U Press, 1971, pp. 145-146 In December he led an expedition traversing Tepehu√°n country and rescued 400 Spanish and Indian allies. Another expedition consisting of 67 Spanish cavalry and 120 Concho Indian allies set out from Guadalajara in March 1617 and engaged and won several battles with the Tepehu√°n. In the war against the Tepehu√°n, the Spanish abandoned their conciliatory \\"peace by purchase\\" policy and instead waged a war of \\"fire and blood\\" (fuego y sangre). They targeted the six war chiefs and killed the last of them, Gogoxito, in March 1618 during the third major Spanish campaign.Hackett, 152 After Gogoxito's death major hostilities. Quautlatas was also killed during the Spanish campaigns.Jimen√®z Nu√±ez, Alfredo El gran norte de Mexico: una frontera imperial en la Nueva Espana. Madrid: Editorial Tedor, 2006, pp. 124-125 However, the death of the war chiefs and Quautlatas did not end the hostilities. Tepehuan continued to raid Spanish settlements and then retreat to the mountains for safety. One Tepehuan raid on Mapimi left about 100 people dead.Gradie, 153-172 Despite their initial successes, the Tepehu√°n were unable to persuade neighboring Indian groups to join their revolt and the Spanish prevailed. In 1618 the missionaries, Jesuits and Franciscans, were allowed to return to their missions. The Governor, however, declared that the province was ‚Äúdestroyed and devastated, almost depopulated of Spaniards. The‚Ä¶churches were burned. The silver mines and their machinery were also burned.‚Äù It would be half a century before the region returned to its former prosperity. The Tepehu√°n Revolt also caused a revision in Spanish policy toward the Indians. Hereafter, the missions and settlements would be better protected by the Army.Gradie, 173-175 The revolt was officially declared at an end in 1620 but the Jesuits spent years trying to persuade many of the surviving Tepehu√°n to come down from the mountains to live at mission stations. They still faced hostility when they attempted to establish a mission among the Tepehu√°n in 1707 and it was 1745 before a large number of Tepehu√°n baptisms were reported. Slowly, the Tepehu√°n were overwhelmed in numbers by Spanish speakers and absorbed into mestizo society. But three groups survived: the northern Tepehu√°n in Chihuahua and the southeastern and southwestern Tepehu√°n in southern Durango. They still retain some of their old customs.Gradie, 17-183 The northern Tepehu√°n numbered 6,200 in 2005; the southeastern, 10,600, and the southwestern, 8,700.http://www.native-languages.org/tepehuan.htm, accessed Feb 13, 2011 See also *Mexican Indian Wars Notes References Gradie, Charlotte M.

He later went on to coach in the Netherlands, including coaching the Dutch national side. Club career He started his career at hometown club Washington United before transferring to Barnsley sometime prior to 1910. He played in both FA Cup finals that Barnsley reached, in 1910 and 1912. In the first Barnsley lost in the replay to Newcastle United. The second also went to a replay but Barnsley won, defeating West Bromwich Albion by one goal in extra time. The Manchester Guardian praised his play in the first match, and in the replay Glendenning won the ball from a West Brom player and passed it to Harry Tufnell to score in the last minutes of extra time. In March 1913 he transferred to Bolton Wanderers, for whom he played a total of 83 games as club captain. Bolton reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1915, in which they were defeated by Sheffield United captained by George Utley, Glendenning's fellow wing half from Barnsley. In the 1916‚Äì17 season, Glendinning appeared as a wartime guest player with Burnley. After the war he played for Accrington Stanley. Coaching career After the end of his playing career he took up coaching and moved to the Netherlands. He had a short spell, only one game, a 4‚Äì1 victory over Switzerland, as coach of the national side in 1923. He then coached Koninklijke HFC until 1928. He was made the permanent coach of the Netherlands in 1925, holding both coaching positions until the 1928 Summer Olympics1928 Summer Olympics Netherlands men's football squad when he chose to focus on the national team. He remained the manager of the Oranje until 1940, leading them to the World Cup finals in 19341934 FIFA World Cup squads and 1938.1938 FIFA World Cup squads The tournaments would be disappointments, exiting in the first round on both occasions, to Switzerland by a score of 3‚Äì2, in 1934, and then to Czechoslovakia by 3‚Äì0, in 1938. Glendenning managed the Oranje through 87 games, with 36 wins, 36 losses and 15 draws. Up until October 2017, he remained the Dutch national coach with the most victories. By comparison, the only Dutch coach Rinus Michels to win a major trophy, Euro 1988, had 30 victories from 53 games, over an 18-year (1974 to 1992) on again off again association with the national team. Marco van Basten had 35 wins from 48 games before being knocked out at the quarter final stage of Euro 2008. However, as of his 3rd spell in charge, Dick Advocaat has now managed 37 victories from 62 games. Glendenning's last game as a manager was the 4‚Äì2 victory over Belgium played on 21 April 1940; the game was also Abe Lenstra's second international cap. Three weeks later the Dutch national side were in Luxembourg to play their next international match, but the game was never played because of the German invasion of the Netherlands. He died on 19 November of that same year. He is buried in Bolton (England) where the KNVB has maintained and replaced his headstone.

Amago Haruhisa, with 30,000 men, attacked K≈çriyama Castle, which belonged to M≈çri Motonari and was defended by 8,000 men. When the ≈åuchi clan sent an army under the command of Sue Harukata to relieve the siege, the Amago were forced to leave. Background By the end of the 1530s, M≈çri Motonari had cut ties with the Amago clan (also known as Amago) and realigned himself with the ≈åuchi. Taking advantage of the growing weakness of the Takeda clan of Aki, Motonari grew ever more powerful in Aki Province. By 1540, the old lord of the Amago, Tsunehisa had nominally retired and turned over the leadership of the clan to his grandson, Haruhisa (also known as Akihisa.) In that year Amago Haruhisa conceived of a plan to destroy M≈çri Motonari and bring Aki province under the sway of the Amago. When a council of the Amago retainers was called to discuss the planned campaign, almost all spoke in favor of the attack. Amago Hisayuki, however, considered the risks to be too great and spoke out against it, but was derided by Tsunehisa as a coward and publicly humiliated. Hisayuki was given the task of engaging the M≈çri's ally, the Shishido clan in Aki as part of an initial and concurrent operation of the larger Amago campaign into Aki.Rekishi Gunz√¥ Shirizu #49, M√¥ri Senki Gakken, Japan, 1997 The Amago campaign into Aki Province The initial phase of the campaign began in June 1540, which involved an attack by the troops of Amago Hisayuki, his son Masahisa and his nephew Kunihisa on the domain of Motonari's ally, the Shishido clan, a foray that was to prove of little effect except to deny Haruhisa of some of his most capable generals and soldiers for the attack on Koriyama Castle. In August Amago Haruhisa had gathered a force of 30,000 and departed Izumo Province, moving into the vicinity of Motonari's Yoshida-Koriyama Castle and establishing a headquarters nearby. Meanwhile, M≈çri Motonari had evacuated over 5,000 of Yoshida's citizens inside the walls of Koriyama Castle. The castle itself was defended by around 3,000 soldiers, by which time urgent requests for aid were dispatched to the ≈åuchi in Suo Province.Rekishi Gunz√¥ Shirizu, Mori Motonari, Vol 9, Gakken, 1988 Two days after arriving, the Amago launched an attack on Koriyama Castle, which continued for several months. = The ≈åuchi relief of Koriyama = The ≈åuchi relief army, consisting of 10,000 men led by Sue Harukata, finally departed Su≈ç Province in the 11th month, pausing on Miyajima to offer prayers for victory at the Itskushima Shrine before landing in Aki and marching towards Koriyama Castle. They arrived outside Koriyama in December 1540, four months after the siege had begun. A series of skirmishes ensued between the opposing armies into the following month (January 1541), which was largely to the detriment of the Amago. By this time the Amago force that had threatened the Shishido arrived and became heavily engaged in an attack by the M≈çri and ≈åuchi on the Amago's headquarters on Tenjinyama (Â§©Á•ûÂ±±). In the ensuing action Amago Hisayuki was killed by an arrow and the Amago suffered heavy losses. In the wake of this fight, the Amago retainers, noting the army's dwindling supplies and poor morale, elected to retreat. The M√¥ri and √îuchi duly pursued but were hindered by snow.

No Picnic on Mount Kenya () by Felice Benuzzi is a mountaineering classic recounting the 1943 attempt of three escaped Italian prisoners of war to reach the summit of Mount Kenya.Matthew Power. \\"Escape to Mount Kenya\\", National Geographic Adventure Magazine It was first published in 1946 in English and 1947 in Italian. The 1994 film The Ascent is based on this book. Synopsis Detained at P.O.W. Camp 354 near Nanyuki, Kenya, Felice Benuzzi from Trieste, together with two fellow-prisoners Dr. Giovanni ('Giu√†n') Balletto from Genova and Vincenzo ('Enzo') Barsotti from Lido di Camaiore, escaped in January 1943 and climbed Mt Kenya with improvised equipment and meagre rations, two of them reaching a point on the north face of the Petit Gendarme, at about 5000 metres,No Picnic on Mount Kenya (William Kimber, London, 1953), p.172 high up the NW ridge. After an eventful 18-day period on the mountain (24 January ‚Äì 10 February), and to the astonishment of the British camp commandant, the three adventurers broke back into Camp 354. As reward for their exploit, they each received 28 days in solitary confinement, commuted to 7 days by the camp commandant in acknowledgement of their \\"sporting effort\\". From the flyleaf of the 1952 William Kimber edition of the book: :\\"One of the most unusual adventures of the war years has now been written by the man who led it, and who has the ability to tell his story with the accuracy and vividness that compels the readers to live through it with him. Felice Benuzzi was a P.O.W. in a British Camp facing Mount Kenya (5,199 m ‚Äì 17,058 ft). The depressing tedium of camp life and the fascination of the mountain combined to inspire him with a plan. He first put the prospect of escaping to climb it to a fellow prisoner who was a professional mountaineer. The expert told him that the idea was mad, that they would need six months' training on first-class food and porters to carry equipment to a base camp. But Benuzzi was not to be put off. Eventually he got two others to conspire with him, a doctor and a sailor. Surreptitiously they improvised scant equipment and saved what food they could from rations. Their only 'map' of the mountain was a sketch of it on the label of an Oxo tin. :\\"And then they escaped, and went to climb the mountain. The sailor was ill immediately after break-out but decided to carry on. The lower reaches of Kenya are jungle and forest infested with big game. They were unarmed, and their encounters with the animals are some of the most exciting passages in the story. But Benuzzi writes with a simplicity and vigour that take you with him every yard of the way. At the foot of the highest peak the sailor was too ill to go further, and Benuzzi and the doctor went forward to the climax of their adventure. Their way back was as hazardous as the ascent, and the tension never relaxes until they at last break back into the P.O.W. camp from which they had escaped and give themselves up to the British Commandant.\\" Publishing history Benuzzi, of Italian-Austrian parentage, initially wrote his account in both English and Italian from 1943‚Äì1946, while still in P.O.W. camps.Information on dust-cover of English 2nd edition (Kimber, London, 1974) The Italian version, with a marginally more detailed text, was first published in 1947 as Fuga sul Kenya ‚Äì 17 giorni di libert√† [:Escape on Kenya ‚Äì 17 days of liberty] (L'Eroica, Milano). The Italian edition has as an Appendix (headed 'L'ignoto') a fuller version of the English Chapter 4, 'The Unknown', a digression that gives background historical information on the mountain. It also includes three sketches in black & white and four maps by Benuzzi, including a map of the peaks area showing his route up the NW ridge. The Italian version was translated into French and published in 1950 as Kenya, ou la Fugue Africaine [:Kenya, or the African Escape] (Arthaud, Paris; with black & white illustrations, including Benuzzi's sketch of the trio's base-camp in the Hausberg Valley, with the peaks in the background and the ascent-route marked). The 2nd Italian edition (Tamari, Bologna, 1966) has on the front cover, in colour, a reproduction of Benuzzi's watercolour of the mountain seen through the camp fence. 'Fuga' and 'Fugue' may also carry a secondary meaning, referring to the 'music' of the giant heather described in the book. The French edition helped inspire Roland Truffaut's August 1952 expedition to Mt Kenya, described in From Kenya to Kilimanjaro (London, 1957), during which the home-made crampons and other equipment of Benuzzi and Balletto were retrieved from Hausberg Col. These were later donated, with Benuzzi's permission, to the Mus√©e de La Montagne, Chamonix.Roland Truffaut, From Kenya to Kilimanjaro (London 1957), p.60 (Benuzzi's flag and message-bottle left on Lenana had been retrieved by English climbers; they were returned to Benuzzi who donated them to the Museo della Montagna, Torino.Enea Fiorentini, Fuga sul Kenya: Commento, www.eneafiorentini.it/irecelib/irec01.html) The NW face of Mount Kenya seen from the Nanyuki area, 1936: the view that inspired the adventure. The English version was published in February 1952 as No Picnic on Mount Kenya (William Kimber, London), with the subtitle The Story of Three P.O.W.s' Escape to Adventure. \\"No expedition on the mountain was ever a picnic\\" Vivienne de Watteville had written in her book Speak to the Earth (1935) about her 1929 visit to Mount Kenya.De Watteville, Vivienne, Speak to the Earth (London, 1935), p.276 Benuzzi's English title, perhaps suggested by this line of de Watteville's, refers to the expression 'It was no picnic', meaning 'It was hard going', but with an ironic allusion to the climbers' meagre P.O.W. rations. There have been at least eighteen English impressions, some published without the subtitle. The Readers Union edition (1953), and the 'concise' version (ed. S. H. Burton) brought out by Longmans and Green in their 'Heritage of Literature Series' for schools (1960), helped popularise the book. The dust-cover of the English 2nd edition (Kimber, London, 1974) gives a 1970s' photograph of Benuzzi, Balletto and Barsotti and biographical updates; the 3rd English edition (Patrick Stephens Ltd, Wellingborough, 1989, Introduction by Rick Ridgeway), updates the biographical information. In 1999 Lyon Press republished the book with the subtitle A Daring Escape, a Perilous Climb. In 2015 MacLehose Press brought out a new edition, with some twenty of Benuzzi's own watercolours from the expedition (all, for the first time, in colour), two contemporary photos of the Nanyuki POW camp, and a full translation of 'L'ignoto' (see above) from the Italian original. In 1953 No Picnic on Mount Kenya was translated into German under the title Gefangen vom Mount Kenia : gef√§hrliche Flucht in ein Bergsteigerabenteuer, and in 2002 a new German edition was released with the new title Flucht ins Abenteuer : 3 Kriegsgefangene besteigen den Mount Kenya. The book has also been translated into Swedish. About the author Felice Benuzzi was born in Vienna on 16 November 1910 and grew up in Trieste, doing his early mountaineering in the Julian Alps and Dolomites. He studied law at Rome University and represented Italy as an international swimmer in 1933‚Äì35. He married in 1938 and had two daughters, one of whom, Daniela, married American diplomat Alan Ford. Benuzzi entered the Italian Colonial Service in 1938 and served in Italian-occupied Abyssinia, where he was captured by Allied forces when the country was liberated in 1941. He was imprisoned in Kenya (Nanyuki and Gilgil). Repatriated in August 1946, he entered the Italian Diplomatic Service in 1948, serving in Paris, Brisbane, Karachi, Canberra, West Berlin, and (as Head of Delegation) at the United Nations, before his appointment in 1973 as ambassador in Montevideo. Benuzzi retired to Rome (Via Nepi, 13), serving in retirement as Head of the Italian Delegation for the Antarctic. He died in Rome in July 1988.Il Tempo, 11 July 1988 The col between Point Dutton and the Petit Gendarme on Mount Kenya has been named Benuzzi Col in his honour.Allan, Iain, Guide to Mount Kenya and Kilimanjaro (Nairobi, 1991) Adaptations In 1953 an episode of Robert Montgomery Presents was based on an adaptation of this book starring George Chandler.

Doctor of Engineering. Conferred Jusanmi (Âæì‰∏â‰Ωç, Junior Third Rank) and Kunsanto (Âã≤‰∏âÁ≠â, Order of Third Class). Former dean of Architecture Department at Tokyo Imperial UniversityTATSUNO Kingo, the 4th dean Successive Deans SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING, THE UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO. Tatsuno is most widely known for his work as the designer of the Bank of Japan building (1896) and the Marunouchi building of Tokyo Station (1914). Education and early career Tatsuno studied architecture at the Imperial College of Engineering where he was a student of the influential British architect Josiah Conder, called \\"father of Japanese modern architecture\\". After his graduation in 1879, Tatsuno journeyed to London in 1880 attending courses at the University of London. During his stay he worked at the architectural offices of the Gothic Revivalist William Burges. Burges died in 1881 during Tatsuno's stay, but before returning to Japan Tatsuno also took the opportunity to travel extensively in France and Italy.Stewart (2002), p37 On his return to Tokyo, Tatsuno taught first at the Imperial College of Engineering before becoming department head at University of Tokyo. In 1886, he was one of the founders of the forerunner of the , the then called \\"Building Institute\\". The organisation was based upon the Royal Institute of British Architects and the group met regularly, sponsored lectures and produced Japan's first architectural journal.Reynolds (2001), p14 Tatsuno Kingo (ÈáëÂêæ) was called Tatsuno Kengo as a nickname for him because Kengo (Â†ÖÂõ∫) means firmness and his designs and layouts were solid. Later career Although his early work was influenced by his travels in Europe with traces of Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren, the Shibusawa Mansion (1888) was influenced by Serlio, Ruskin and Conder's own Venetian styled works. The site, on one of Tokyo's canalways suited itself to a Venetian character.Stewart (2002), p49 =Bank of Japan= Bank of Japan building (Tokyo)Tatsuno's connection with Shibusawa Eiichi brought him the commission to design the Bank of Japan in 1890 (completed in 1896). It was first building of its type to be designed by a native Japanese person. Tatsuno immediately set off to Europe for a year to do research for the project, studying amongst other buildings, the Banque Nationale in Brussels by Beyaert and Janssens.Stewart (2002), p54 The bank is a three-storey building constructed with reinforced brick faced with stone and has limited use of steel for long spans. Its style displays Neo-Baroque architectural influences. echoing European central bank buildings of the period. The original building was square in plan with the banking hall situated immediately behind the porticoed main front.Stewart (2002), p53 Tatsuno not only designed the Tokyo Head Office of the Bank of Japan, but was also responsible for designing the Bank of Japan's branch offices in Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, Kanazawa, Hakodate and Hiroshima. Almost two thirds of the 140 buildings that Tatsuno was associated with in his career were to be bank buildings. =Tokyo Station= Exterior Tokyo StationOther than the Bank of Japan building, the structure most closely associated with Tatsuno in the later stages of his career is undoubtedly the Marunouchi facing side of Tokyo Station. The broadly Neo-Baroque design completed in 1914 is distinctive for its use of extensive steel framing and red brick with ribbed domes crowning the north and south wings of the structure. Much of the original steel framing was imported from England and the sturdiness of the design enabled the structure to survive both the Great Kant≈ç earthquake in 1923 as well as wartime bombing and fires in 1945. A sympathetic 5-year renovation of the 1914 structure was completed in October 2012, restoring the domed roof structures that had been a feature of Tatsuno's original design. Tatsuno also had a strong influence Japanese colonial architecture - especially in Manchukuo. Connection with construction firms like Okada Engineering, the Association of Japanese Architects (Nihon Kenchiku Gakkai Êó•Êú¨Âª∫ÁØâÂ≠¶‰ºö) or through the new Journal of Manchurian Architecture (Manshu kenchiku zasshi Ê∫ÄÂ∑ûÂª∫ÁØâÈõëË™å),helped insure that a particular architectural style‚Äîthat popularized by Tatsuno, sometimes called the Tatsuno style (Ëæ∞ÈáéÂºè) initially became the standard throughout Japanese Manchuria. This involved a somewhat grand interpretation of the style of historical eclecticism that was popular in contemporary Europe. In 1903 Tatsuno set up his own architectural office, the first Japanese architect in the country to do so. He died as a result of the 1918 flu pandemic in 1919.

The cliff was named by Philetus Norris, the second park superintendent in 1878. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1996. and The cliff was formed from thick rhyolite lava flow that occurred about 180,000 years ago. The vertical columns are cooling fractures that formed as the thick lava flow cooled and crystallized. The Cliffs stand at an elevation of nearly above sea level and go on for about half a mile. The cliffs also extend between 150 and 200 feet above Obsidian Creek. The flow consists of obsidian, a dark volcanic glass. The obsidian is most abundant at the base of the cliff and slowly tapers off to larger concentrations of pumice at the top. Obsidian from this site was first quarried here about 12,000 years ago. Early natives of North America placed a high value on the obsidian that came from this cliff as well as other similar obsidian deposits in the area because numerous tools could be fashioned from obsidian‚Äîmost popularly, knives, spear/arrow tips, and other sharp-edged objects. In fact, obsidian from Obsidian Cliff was so sought after in early America (before the time of Columbus) that it was traded as far away as Ohio and Canada. Many studies have been done on the composition of the obsidian from Obsidian Cliff and how the obsidian from Obsidian Cliff was distributed. This research has provided evidence of the direction and extent of prehistoric trade networks. It is located about south of Mammoth Hot Springs, on the east side of the Mammoth-Norris section of the Grand Loop Road. The Obsidian Cliff Kiosk, just north, is also listed on the National Register.

The car then sped off towards Eli. On the basis of evidence collected in an intensive investigation, police concluded that it was an operation undertaken by members of the Kach militant organization in retaliation for Meir Kahane‚Äôs murder in New York earlier that day. Three Kach activists, among them David Ha'ivri, were arrested on suspicion, but the case never came to trial due to lack of evidence.Pedahzur and Perliger, 2011, pp. 95‚Äì96 According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), al- Lubban ash-Sharqiya had a population of 2,465 in the 2007 census.2007 PCBS Census.

In 2009, two members of Yesh Din wrote in Haaretz about settlers from Eli who had taken control over land in the area, which had seriously damaged the ability of the villagers from Al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya to work their land. According to the writers, this was part of a systematic strategy to remove all Palestinians from Area C, and the authors concluded that \\"an infrastructure of Jewish terror is being created in the West Bank.\\"An infrastructure of Jewish terror Since the very beginning of the settlement enterprise, more than four decades ago, Israel has seized West Bank lands via an orchestrated, systematic and violent system.

The exact date of its construction is not clear, although its architectural style indicates it was built during the Mamluk or early Ottoman eras. Large parts of its western and northern sides were restored and reconstructed in the later Ottoman period as indicated by the size and style of the stones. Factors behind its construction include its important location as a crossroads between central Palestine's major towns and the close proximity of a freshwater well.Abu Khalaf, Marwan.

The Jordanians continued to use the complex for the same purpose following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Presently, the site is open to the public and recent work has been carried out to accommodate more visitors. Because of its proximity to the larger caravansary towns of Nablus and al-Bireh, Khan al- Lubban only consists of a single story, unlike most caravansaries which have two or more. The layout of Khan al-Lubban is square-shaped, with each side measuring roughly 23 meters in length. Most of the original building remains intact, with the entrance way bordered by stables on both sides and leading into a courtyard. The eastern and western rooms served administrative functions while the northern rooms served as visitor lodging.

It was enriched by a bequest from Fernando Col√≥n. The library contains incunabula and rare works on the discovery of America. It contains manuscripts written by Christopher Columbus himself.Biblioteca Colombina, Seville =History of the Biblioteca Colombina= As an adult, Fernando was known as a scholar. He had a generous income from his father's New World demesne, and used a sizable fraction of it to buy books, eventually amassing a personal library of over 15,000 volumes. This library was patronized by educated people in Spain and elsewhere, including the Dutch philosopher Erasmus. Apart from its size, the library was unique in several ways. First, Fernando personally noted each and every book that he or his associates acquired by listing the date of purchase, the location and how much was paid. Secondly, he sought to take advantage of a recent technological development by devoting the bulk of his purchases to printed books instead of manuscripts. As a result, the library acquired a sizable number (currently 1,194 titles) of incunabula (singular: incunabulum) or books printed between the years 1453-1500. Third, he employed full-time librarians who, as the scholar Klaus Wagner noted, were required to live on the premise in order to ensure that their top priority would be the library itself. After his father's death, Fernando inherited Columbus' personal library, and what remains of these volumes contains much valuable information on Columbus, his interests, and his explorations. Provisions were made in his will to ensure that the library would be maintained after his death, specifically that the collection would not be sold and that more books would be purchased. Despite this precaution, the ownership of the library was contested for several decades after Fernando's death until it passed into the hands of the Cathedral in Seville, Spain. During this time of disputed ownership, the size of the library was reduced to about 7,000 titles. However the library, renamed the Biblioteca Colombina, has been well maintained by the Cathedral and today it is accessible for consultation by scholars, students and bibliophiles alike.La Biblioteca Colombina, accessed 04/06/2007 Biblioteca Capitular The Biblioteca Capitular was founded after Seville was conquered in 1248 by Fernando III of Castile. Alfonso donated part of his personal library to the cathedral; this was the start of this library.

The district includes the Golden Rule Store, the first in what became the J. C. Penney department store chain, and Penney's home during the store's early years. The district was declared a National Historic Landmark District in 1978, for Penney's role in creating one of the first national department store chains. and Description and history The J. C. Penney Historic District is located on the southern edge of downtown Kemmerer, encompassing about at the junction of JC Penney Drive and South Main Street. Located along the southeast side of South Main Street at this junction are two commercial buildings, of which the one on the right was the original \\"mother store\\" of the J. C. Penney department store chain. Both are two-story structures, the one on the left sporting a typical Western false front in front of a gabled roof. The Penney store building is built of stone and has a facade of marble and cast iron, with a flat roof. The district originally included a third commercial building which flanked the Penney store on its right; this building has been demolished. Across JC Penney Drive from the two commercial buildings is a small park, in which stands the J. C. Penney House, now a historic house museum. It is a small 1-1/2 story frame house, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It was probably built about 1900, and was home to the Penney family from 1902 to 1909. It remained Penney's property until his death in 1971. James Cash Penney, a native of Missouri, began retailing in 1895 as a clerk in various dry goods retailers. Eventually taken into partnership with one of his employers, he opened the \\"Golden Rule Store\\" in Kemmerer in 1902 at a different location on Pine Street (no longer standing). The store quickly outgrew that space, and in 1904 he moved into the left side of this building, eventually taking it over. By 1907 he had bought out his original business partners, and opened two more stores. This was the start of a business empire that had more than $5 billion in sales in the 1970s. Penney's success was eventually emulated by other firms, notably the mail-order retailers Sears, Roebuck and Montgomery Ward, which also eventually built nationwide retail chains. The retailer continues to operate a store in Kemmerer; it is located a short distance away from the historic district, at JC Penney Drive and Pine Avenue.

Life and career  Campbell was born in Montreal, Quebec to William and Thelma Campbell. His body of work lies mostly in films made for television as well as mini-series, although he has transitioned into episodic television in more recent years as well. He earned a BFA from Montreal's Concordia University. He has been writing and directing movies and television for over twenty years. He started off making documentaries, but got his first break with the controversial feature, \\"Murder One\\" released by Miramax in 1988. Starring Henry Thomas, the film is an uncompromising portrayal of a horrific crime spree gone wrong. This led to another controversial true crime story, Deadly Betrayal: The Bruce Curtis Story, for NBC about the poisonous friendship between two teens. It caused Scott Watkins of the New York Times to write \\"Through the creative and brilliant direction of Graeme Campbell, the viewer is taken on a roller coaster ride through hell. Using flashbacks, tense courtroom drama and frighteningly vivid jail scenes, Campbell and cast tell a riveting story.\\" Campbell's gift with actors is evident in such films as Unforgivable starring John Ritter, \\"directed with a feeling for domestic Gothic by Graeme Campbell\\" according to Lynne Heffley of the LA Times. He has worked with some of the best actors in the business such as George C. Scott, Ellen Page, Rachel McAdams, William Shatner, Mercedes Ruehl, and Elisha Cuthbert among others. Although known in his early career for his handling of dark subject matter, he has directed films in many genres, lately many uplifting ones. He has a passion for music and music stories which has led to Out of Sync a musical comedy for VH-1 and nearly half of the episodes of Instant Star for The N over the last four seasons. \\"There aren't many good dramas for teenagers. No, The O.C. doesn't count, people. Instant Star does.\\" Palm Beach Post. He won a Gemini Award for the episode \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" and has been nominated for two others as well as two Director's Guild of Canada Awards.

It was created as part of the \\"Year of a Million Dreams\\" promotion that ran from October 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008, and closed in 2014.  History of the Suite  Original Concept Art In the early 1960s as construction of New Orleans Square was proceeding, Walt Disney decided he needed a bigger entertaining facility for various VIPs that came to the park. He already had an apartment above the Fire Station on Main Street, U.S.A., but it was too small to host elaborate events. Disney decided to place the suite in New Orleans Square, set back from the hustle and bustle of the park. Disney brought in set designer Dorothea Redmond, famous for creating the sets in Gone with the Wind, to help him with the apartment layout. To furnish and decorate the area, he left his wife Lilly and Walt Disney Studio set decorator Emile Kuri to collaborate as they had on other projects (Club 33, the Firehouse Apartment, etc.). The project was christened The Royal Suite, inspired by its location off New Orleans Square's Royal Street. After Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, many projects at Walt Disney Productions were put on hold or abandoned. At the request of his brother Roy, who felt the family would not enjoy The Royal Suite with Walt gone, the project was quietly set aside. It was fairly close to completion at the time of Disney's death, including infrastructure and plumbing. From July 11, 1987, to August 7, 2007, the space housed the Disney Gallery.  The Dream Suite  On October 1, 2007 the Walt Disney Company announced that the recently closed Disney Gallery would be remodeled and turned into the Disneyland Dream Suite. The remodeled suite would be the realization of Walt's dream to have a larger private apartment built at Disneyland, and would be made available to randomly selected guests of the park. The space underwent a whirlwind remodeling, with Disney Imagineers closely following the original design drawings from Dorothea Redmond. Located above the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, the Disneyland Dream Suite included a living room, open-air patio, two bedrooms and two bathrooms. ‚ÄúOur plan has been to use the renderings that Walt worked on with Dorothea Redmond and to replicate those as exactly as we can,‚Äù said Walt Disney Imagineering Art Director Kim Irvine. ‚ÄúHer illustrations were very specific, with a color and style for each room. ‚ÄúBut to make it special for the guests, we want it to be more than just a beautiful suite. We want it to be filled with things that might have inspired Walt as he dreamed of Disneyland.\\" One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Dream Suite was the private balcony, which overlooked the Rivers of America. From here guests had an unobstructed view of the nighttime spectacular Fantasmic! In addition to that night‚Äôs lodging in the Disneyland Dream Suite, each selected 2008 Disney Dreams Giveaway winner of the Disneyland Dream Suite would also be celebrated as the honorary grand marshal in that day‚Äôs Disneyland parade. The Suite was given out as a prize through various promotions. In \\"A Tale of Two Kitchens\\", the second episode of Season 7 of HGTV's Brother vs. Brother, Jonathan Scott won a night in 21 Royal after beating his brother Drew in that episode's challenge.

A native of Brooklyn, Gruber graduated from Brooklyn College with a degree in psychology, earned his Ph.D. from Cornell University, and went on to a distinguished academic career. He worked with Jean Piaget in Geneva and later co-founded the Institute for Cognitive Studies at Rutgers with Dorothy Dinnerstein. At Columbia University Teachers College, he continued to pursue his interests in the history of science, and particularly the work of Charles Darwin. Gruber's work led to several important discoveries about the creative process and the developmental psychology of creativity. His work on Charles Darwin entitled Darwin on Man: A Psychological Study of Scientific Creativity, became the groundwork of his methodological approach for the case study of evolving systems. This book was awarded Science Book of the Year for 1974 by Phi Beta Kappa. Key aspects of this approach are a radical focus on individuals as situated in a network of enterprise. The method uses a strong existential perspective as regards the \\"creative\\" individual who is said to act at all times with knowledge, purpose and affect. Creativity is purposeful work.

The half-mile stretch is \\"unsurpassed\\" and is the best-preserved set of Oregon Trail ruts anywhere along its former length. The site is maintained as a state historic site, and was declared a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. History The trail was first recorded in 1812, when Robert Stuart and six others came through here heading east from Fort Astoria, Oregon. Traders, trappers, and missionaries used this route before 1841 when the Bartleson‚ÄìBidwell Party became the first wagon train across the trail. The number of emigrants grew from 100 plus in 1842 to over 900 in 1843. With the completion of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1869, use of the trail as an overland route to the Pacific rapidly declined, although sections of it continued to be used locally for many years.

His previous Campbell-Napier-Railton Blue Bird of 1931 was rebuilt significantly. The overall layout and the simple twin deep chassis rails remained, but little else. The bodywork remained similar, with the narrow body, the tombstone radiator grille and the semi-spatted wheels, but the mechanics were new. Most significantly, a larger, heavier and considerably more powerful Rolls-Royce R V12 engine replaced the old Napier Lion, again with supercharger. This required two prominent \\"knuckles\\" atop the bodywork, to cover the V12 engine's camboxes. many period photos 1933 Blue Bird's first run was back at Daytona, setting a record of on 22 February 1933. Campbell now had a car with all the power that he could want, but no way to use all of it. Wheelspin was a problem, losing perhaps from the top speed. 1935 on Daytona Beach in 1935 Modern Lledo toy of the 1935 Blue Bird Visually the car was quite different. The bodywork was now rectangular in cross section and spanned the full width over the wheels. Although actually higher, this increased width gave the impression of a much lower and sleeker car, accentuated by the long stabilising tailfin and the purposeful raised ridges over the engine camboxes. This Blue Bird was clearly a design of the Modernist '30s, not the brute heroism of the '20s. Mechanically the changes to the car had focussed on improving the traction, rather than increasing the already generous power. Double wheels and tyres were fitted to the rear axle, to improve grip. The final drive was also split into separate drives to each side. This reduced the load on each drive, allowed the driver position to be lowered, but required the wheelbase to be shortened asymmetrically on one side by . Airbrakes were fitted, actuated by a large air cylinder. For extra streamlining the radiator air intake could be closed by a movable flap, for a brief period during the record itself. Blue Bird made its first record runs back on Daytona Beach in early 1935. On 7 March 1935 Campbell improved his record to , but the unevenness of the sand caused a loss of grip and he knew the car was capable of more. many period photos The faster car needed a bigger and smoother arena, and this led to the Bonneville Salt Flats of Utah. This time the young Donald Campbell accompanied his father. On 3 September 1935, it reached breaking the 300 mph barrier for the first time by a bare mile-per- hour, crowning Sir Malcolm Campbell's record-breaking career. many period photos Survival today Alabama Motor Speedway Hall of Fame, Talladega, Alabama, USA There is a replica in the Campbell gallery at the Lakeland Motor Museum, England.

Daniel quickly found a way to earn the money to eat, by juggling on street corners. He spent long days practicing and honing his skills and eventually worked his way into becoming a world champion Juggler. Johnny Carson discovered Rosen when he was a teen and made him a regular guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

According to The New York Times, Lancaster's 1961 study of the architecture of Brooklyn Heights \\"proved to be one of the earliest and loudest shots in the historic preservation struggle in New York City. Writings Lancaster's best-known books of architectural and art history are Architectural Follies in America (1960), Ante Bellum Houses of the Bluegrass (1961), Old Brooklyn Heights: New York's First Suburb (1961), The Japanese Influence in America (1963), Prospect Park Handbook (1967), The Architecture of Historic Nantucket (1972), New York Interiors at the Turn of the Century (1976), Nantucket in the Nineteenth Century (1979), The American Bungalow (1985), Antebellum Architecture of Kentucky (1991), The Arts and Crafts of the Animals (1993), The Breadth and Depth of East and West (1995), and Pleasant Hill: Shaker Canaan in Kentucky (2000). A collection of his photographs appears in James D. Birchfield, Clay Lancaster's Kentucky: Architectural Photographs of a Preservation Pioneer (2007). Lancaster was, as well, a writer and illustrator for children. The Periwinkle Steamboat (1961) was later redesigned and re-published as The Flight of the Periwinkle (1987). Michiko, or Mrs. Belmont's Brownstone on Brooklyn Heights was published in 1965. The Toy Room appeared in 1988, Figi in 1989, and The Runaway Prince in 1991. Lancaster's style received high praise. Alan Priest, former curator of Far Eastern Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art noted in his introduction to The Japanese Influence in America that \\"the prose is most agreeable to read and the subject matter so interesting that one is led to read almost as if it were a historical novel.\\" The poet Marianne Moore, introducing Lancaster's Prospect Park Handbook (1967), writes: \\"his pages are art.\\" Biography Lancaster was born in Lexington, Kentucky, and studied at the University of Kentucky. He spent half of 1936 at the Art Students League of New York. Returning to Lexington, he served as stage designer for the university's Guignol Theatre and was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He took his A.B. in Art in 1938. In 1943, Lancaster moved to New York and, as a graduate student there, worked in Columbia University's Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library with Talbot Hamlin, biographer of Benjamin Henry Latrobe. At Columbia, Lancaster received the appointment of Ware Librarian. In the fifties he lectured at Cooper Union, Columbia, and the Traphagen art school in New York. In 1968 he originated a course, \\"Asian Art and its Influence on Europe and America,\\" that was given at New York University. In 1954 and 1955, during the first of two John Simon Guggenheim Fellowships, he carried out the research that underlay The Japanese Influence in America (1963); a second Guggenheim, in 1963 and 1964, supported research on the architecture of Kentucky. In 1966, Parks Commissioner Thomas Hoving appointed Lancaster curator of Brooklyn's Prospect Park, Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape masterpiece, an assignment which led to his preparation of The Prospect Park Handbook (1967). In 1971, Clay Lancaster moved from Brooklyn to Nantucket. Here he restored an 1829 saltbox dwelling and wrote studies of historic Nantucket, of Victorian architecture, and of train terminals and stations. Lancaster returned to live in Kentucky in 1978, purchasing Warwick, a Federal-era residence on the Kentucky River. Here he spent the first winter making mantels for fireplaces in an addition, shelves for the library, and cabinets for the kitchen. During the following spring he gave a course on Kentucky architecture at Transylvania University, and it became a seminar in the College of Architecture at the University of Kentucky in the fall. In 1980 he presented a class on \\"Asian Art and Its Influence on Europe and America\\" at Transylvania. In 1983, as Morgan Professor at the University of Louisville, he repeated the Kentucky architecture course and conducted a seminar on \\"Asian Influences on Western Architecture.\\" During this period he wrote and illustrated The American Bungalow, 1880‚Äì1930. Also he produced a study on the World Parliament of Religions (1987), which was held at the Chicago Columbian Exposition of 1893; the book was published in England in May 1987. Awards and honors Lancaster received a Certificate of Merit from the Municipal Art Society of New York City in 1962 for his book Old Brooklyn Heights. In 1966 he was given a citation from the president of the Borough of Brooklyn for his work on the Prospect Park Centennial Committee. In 1975 he was elected to the Hall of Distinguished Alumni at the University of Kentucky. The Alabama Historical Commission presented him in 1975 with its Award of Merit for Preservation of Alabama's Heritage for his study of Greek Revival architecture in Alabama, published by the Alabama chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1966 (and again by the Commission in 1977). In 1979, for Vestiges of the Venerable City, he received the Lexington-Fayette County Historic Commission Preservation Award and, in the same year, the Kentucky Heritage Commission's Preservation Professional Award. In 1986, the Blue Grass Trust for Historic Preservation presented him its John Wesley Hunt Award. Warwick In addition to the original Moses Jones hall and parlor dwelling, on the grounds of Warwick, Lancaster built several architectural follies of his own design‚Äîan eighteenth-century tea pavilion, a guest-house replicating the first-century A.D. Tower of the Winds, and an Arts and Crafts style art gallery. He also assembled an extensive acreage nearby to serve as a nature preserve, called Shantalaya (\\"abode of peace\\"). Also, in his final years, Lancaster established a charitable organization, The Warwick Foundation, to promote and extend his many interests. The foundation sponsors tours, lectures, scholarships, exhibitions, conferences, and maintains the Warwick compound as a museum. Lancaster died on Christmas Day in 2000. The following spring, his ashes were scattered in the ravine next to his Warwick residence.

He was born in London, of Italian and Scottish parents.Villa, Life with the Speed King Birth and early career Villa was born in London to an Italian father and a Scottish mother. A gifted artist, Villa drew many pictures of an automotive nature, and through his uncle he found employment as a riding mechanic with the Italian racing driver Giulio Foresti who held the British franchise for the Itala automobile. Between 1915 and 1922 Villa and Foresti were lucky to escape serious injury after a number of serious incidents when motor racing, but Villa's luck ran out and he was seriously burnt when a generator exploded during preparations for the French Grand Prix at Strasbourg in which Foresti was to drive a French Ballot. After a period of convalescence in England, Villa found himself on the shelf since Foresti had taken on another mechanic in Villa's absence. Record breaking Not so long after Villa had an offer that would set the path of his career for the rest of his life. The then Captain Malcolm Campbell owned the franchise for Ballot in England and raced one of its models at Brooklands and was considering buying a new model for a Grand Prix campaign so Foresti and Villa were despatched with the car that French star Jules Goux had driven in the Grand Prix Villa had missed. Campbell was so impressed with Villa's manner and ability he offered him a job and though he was very much so Campbell's employee Villa was to be a key part in Malcolm Campbell's nine land and four water world speed record attempts. Not long after Sir Malcolm's death on New Year's Eve 1948, Villa was approached by Sir Malcolm's son Donald Campbell with a proposition: the junior Campbell had heard that the Americans were planning an attempt on his father's world water speed record, and the fiercely patriotic Campbell wanted to push it out of their reach before they even got started. The older and wiser Villa wasn't against such an idea; he did, however, advise that record breaking was not as easy as Campbell thought it was, and once Campbell got started he would be addicted for life. The headstrong young Campbell was not to be dissuaded, and so Villa found himself again playing chief mechanic to a Campbell's many record attempts. However, this time round, far from being just an employee, Villa's relationship with the young Campbell was on a much more even keel; having watched Campbell grow up and having covered for him on numerous occasions so as he did not suffer the wrath of Sir Malcolm, he was held in great affection by Donald, who regularly referred to him as Unc. After a somewhat rocky start to record breaking with Sir Malcolm's old boat Blue Bird K4 and a considerable investment by Campbell and others, they managed to get their first world water speed record as a team on Ullswater in 1955 with a jet-engined hydroplane called Bluebird K7. Campbell proved to be as adept at record breaking as his father and he went on to set no fewer than 7 world water speed records and 1 world land speed record, with Villa being instrumental in every one. It was a successful partnership that was only broken upon Campbell's death in 1967 whilst attempting his eighth world water speed record. Later life and death After Campbell's death Villa spent his time at home in Reigate in Surrey with his wife Joan, where he took up gardening. He received an OBE in June 1976 for services to land and water speed records. Villa was also granted The Freedom of the City of London and he went on to write three books about his record-breaking career, two of them written with Kevin Desmond. Villa died in January 1979 from lung cancer eight months after the death of his wife Joan.

A descendant of Robert William Kalanihiapo Wilcox and Princess Theresa Owana Ka ª≈çhelelani La ªanui, of the House of Keoua (the originating line of the House of Kamehameha), she has been involved in Hawaiian sovereignty issues for many years. She is thought to be the only female steel guitar player in Hawaii trained by Jerry Byrd. Birth, family and early life Owana Ka ªohelelani Mahealani-Rose La ªanui Wilcox Salazar was born in October 1953. Her parents were Helena Kalokuokamaile Wilcox and Henry Mario Salazar. The only girl in a family of five, Owana grew up with an honest sense of place. \\"Our family discussions were vast... about many of our ancestors, about their roles in Hawaii ªs history, about the crown lands, about Robert Wilcox, about Princess Theresa going to Washington, about Princess Elizabeth going to Washington to petition Congress to survey the crown lands.\\" Owana Salazar was raised on the island of Oahu and graduated from Kamehameha Schools, where she sang with the Concert Glee Club, and the University of Hawaii, where she learned Kihoalu (slack key guitar). Salazar studied hula with the Kumu Hula, Ho ªakalei Kamau ªu, Ho ªoulu Richards and Winona Beamer. In addition to studying traditional western music theory, studied voice with Elizabeth Cole, and studied piano, string methods, guitar, Javanese dance and gamelan as well as continuing to study hula. Marriages and issue Owana was married first to Ronald Ka ªimihale Walters. They later divorced. They have a daughter: * Kapumahana Ka ªahumanu Walters (born on 15 October 1979). Miss Hawaii Teen USA in 1997 (as Mahana Walters) Secondly, she married Warren Kaipoho ªohua ªamaua DeGuair, ca. 1980. They have a son: * Noa Kalokuokamaile DeGuair (born on 19 November 1981) Music career At the start of her public career, Salazar performed with Hawaiian headliners such as Don Ho, Ohta-San, Ed Kenney and Charles K.L. Davis. She was introduced to the world of Kihoalu by friend Nelson Hiu. Combining music theory with her repertoire of Hawaiian songs and slack key, Salazar developed her playing skills with help from her professors and other fellow musicians such as George Kuo, Bla Pahinui, Cyril Pahinui, Dennis Kamakahi, George Kahumoku Jr. and Sonny Chillingworth. Other musical influences include Joni Mitchell, Johnny Mathis, Connie Francis, Stevie Wonder, Genoa Keawe, Gabby Pahinui, Lena Machado, and Marvin Gaye. Her first recording in 1986, Owana and Kaipo, In Kona was nominated in the category of Most Promising Artist in the Na Hoku Hanohano Awards, a Hawaiian music industry salute. The following year, her second recording, Owana, was a final ballot nominee for Contemporary Hawaiian Album of the Year and Female Vocalist of the Year.

For most of the 1980s, Salazar sang Hawaiian classics with the Royal Hawaiian Band and performed at venues in Waikiki and Japan. Jerry Byrd accepted Salazar as his student for formal study of Hawaiian steel guitar. Eventually, she received a full scholarship from the Hawaiian Steel Guitar Association. In 1992, she became Byrd's only female graduate and has been called Hawaii's preeminent female steel guitarist. Besides Hawaii, Salazar has also performed in Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia, and the Americas. In January 2000, she became the first woman to tour with the Hawaiian Slack Key Festival along with George Kahumoku, Jr., Keoki Kahumoku and Daniel Ho. =Discography (partial)= * \\"Owana and Ka'ipo IN KONA\\" (1986), Nominated: Most Promising Artist of the Year. *Owana (1987), Nominated: Female Vocalist of the Year; Contemporary Hawaiian Album of the Year. *Wahine Slack n‚Äô Steel (2003), Winner: Contemporary Hawaiian Album of the Year.

Throughout her life, Salazar has promoted Hawaiian history, culture and sovereignty. She served as family liaison to the Mayor's Office of Culture and the Arts for two years, with the goal of planning, commissioning and unveiling a life-size bronze statue of her great-grandfather the Honorable Robert Kalanihiapo Wilcox. His statue was installed at Wilcox Park in downtown Honolulu, on the corner of King and Fort Street. =Claim to the throne of the Hawaiian Kingdom= Salazar is among many that believe the Hawaiian Kingdom still exists and while some genealogists recognize the claims of Princess Abigail KawƒÅnanakoa as a potential heir to the throne, Princess Salazar asserts her claim as a descendant of the House of Ke≈çua Nui. A principle component of Salazar's claim is the 1844 proclamation by Kamehameha III that named Elizabeth Keka ªaniau La ªanui as one of the 15 children of high ali ªi descent sent to the Chief's Children's School that made them eligible to rule in different positions, including monarch. Elizabeth La ªanui died without children and Genealogist Edith McKenzie stated that each person that ruled required approval from the House of Nobles although only two monarchs from those children actually did. Salazar dismisses the Kawananakoa claim due to her line through Princess Theresa Owana Ka ª≈çhelelani La ªanui, the daughter of Prince Gideon Kailipalaki La ªanui and granddaughter of Prince Gideon Peleioholani La ªanui. Owana is descended from the ali ªi line of La ªanui, grandson of Kalokuokamaile, who was the first born son of Ke≈çua Kalanikupuapa ªƒ´kalaninui Ahilapalapa. Ke≈çua's second son was Kamehameha I. King Kamehameha III officially proclaimed that Kalokuokamaile's great granddaughter, High Chiefess Elizabeth Keka ªaniau La ªanui was eligible to rule under the Laws of the Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom. After the passing of Elizabeth in 1928, her niece, Princess Theresa Owana Ka ªohelelani La ªanui became the head of the House of La ªanui and married Robert William Wilcox. The next primogenitor rights was to their son, Prince Robert Keoua Kalanikupuapaikalaninui Wilcox, having his first daughter, Princess Helena Kalokuokamaile who became the head of the royal house in 1944. Her daughter, Princess Owana Ka ªohelelani Salazar succeeded her and became the head of the royal house in 1988. =Reestablishment of the Royal Order of the Crown of Hawai ªi= On February 3, 2017 in F√°tima, Portugal, Owana Ka‚Äò≈çhelelani Salazar reestablished the Royal Order of the Crown of Hawai‚Äòi in a protocol exchange with Dom Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza and Head of the Royal Family of Portugal, and other members of royal families and nobility of Europe and Africa.

Carlton were premiers in 1906 and 1907 but Koochew was able to make his debut early in 1908. Upon his selection, a Carlton member, also a member of the Ancient Order of Druids, returned his membership, claiming that by including Koochew on the team Carlton was dealing a death blow to the White Australia Policy.Holmesby, R. & Main, J.

Unable to force his way back into the league team, Koochew returned to Macedon in 1909. He died in Melbourne Hospital, Carlton in 1932 aged 44.

It was located in Assumption Township approximately 3 miles north of Assumption, Illinois, in Christian County, Illinois and 1.1 miles west of U.S. Route 51. History John Jones owned and operated Motion Raceway from its very beginnings. Operating from 1970 until its demise in 1983, The track was originally a quarter-mile strip but moved to a 1,000-ft configuration when its 3,000-ft total length became insufficient. Motion Raceway hosted both NHRA and IHRA National Events, and drew nationally known names such as Don Garlits and Shirley Muldowney. After the 1983 season, the track was closed, the stands were removed, as was the fuel island. The Hemi-powered in-ground starter for the cars was removed, and filled in. Later, Motion's tower was moved a short distance north to Macon Speedway, in Macon, Illinois. Several rumors circulated over the years as to the reason for the track's demise. Arguably the most popular was that the owner was robbed of the purse money at gunpoint. There were also rumors almost every year since the track's closing, that it would be re-opening the following year, or later in the year. Today For several years (up until 2008), the track itself had been used for grain storage by Moweaqua Farmer's Co-Op. They would lay the grain on the track, and cover it with tarps until it could be moved into the elevator. The town of Moweaqua, in Shelby County, Illinois is approximately 5 miles north of Motion Raceway. Plans had been in place for Motion Raceway to be re-opened. May 3, 2008, was to see racing return to Motion Raceway. Greg Clayton of New Covenant Performance, who was to be in charge of the racing, posted on his website a statement that plans had fallen through. He had secured insurance, but both policy submissions were rejected by the owners of the property. It was also stated that people had entered the property at night, and had caused damage to the property.

Designed by the architect Thomas R. Kimball of Omaha, Nebraska in 1893, it was constructed by the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad* Sheridan Inn (Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office) as part of its development program in Wyoming associated with extension of the railway. Equipped with the first bathtubs and electric lights in that part of Wyoming, the inn was considered the \\"finest hotel\\" between Chicago and San Francisco. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. Buffalo Bill Cody managed the hotel for the railroad from 1894 to 1896. He mostly attracted sportsmen for big game hunting in the Big Horn Mountains to the west, and hosted numerous notable guests. He often auditioned talent for his Wild West Show from the broad front porch during his ownership. Description and history Designed in the style of hotels which Kimball had seen in Scotland, the three-story, wood-frame inn is 145 feet long under a gambrel roof, with broad porches 30 feet wide on two sides. The porches were designed with a gradual slope so that rainwater would run off. The hotel had 64 bedrooms on the second and third floors, each with its own dormer window. The large dining room sat up to 160 guests. The barns and livery stable associated with the Cody Transportation Company were at the rear of the property, but no longer survive. He ran a stage line between the inn and Deadwood, South Dakota. The inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places when it was established in 1966. and After condemnation in 1967, the inn was purchased by Neltje Doubleday Kings, who had recently moved to the area from New York City. She undertook renovations and in 1968, \\"re- opened the Inn‚Äôs saloon, which was followed a year later by the re-opening of the dining room, the Ladies Parlor and the Wyoming Room, an all new addition to the Inn.\\"\\"The History of the Sheridan Inn\\", Sheridan Inn Website, accessed 16 April 2012 The inn could host large social gatherings and became a center of community events. She also added a small gift shop and art gallery to the interior.Zeke Scher, \\"The Lady Who Saved the Inn\\", Denver Post, 14 December 1969, p. 16 She operated the inn for 18 years. She has since worked full-time as an artist, exhibiting her work under the name of Neltje. Since 1990, the inn has been owned and operated by The Sheridan Heritage Center, Inc. The nonprofit organization has restored the entire outside of the building, installed a fire alarm system, and brought the first floor up to ADA standards and city codes. In 2006 it initiated a capital campaign to raise money for needed structural improvements in a \\"Core and shell\\" program, as interior conditions have deteriorated. Many rooms are smaller than current expectations for such space and spaces would need to be reworked.

Her body was discovered on February 15, 2008 in a field near a Reno business park after being raped and murdered. A man named James Biela was convicted of the murder. Background Brianna attended Reno High School in Reno, Nevada, graduating in June 2006. Denison was at home during winter break from Santa Barbara City College, where she was studying psychology. She and her friends had attended events tied to a Summer Winter Action Tours LLC (a travel agency that caters to students), Martin Luther King Jr. weekend in Reno; Denison had reportedly attended this event in the past. Brianna was last seen alive on January 20, 2008 at about 4am Pacific Time at her friend's house near the University of Nevada campus. This residence is on MacKay Court in Reno, where she was staying after attending a party at the Sands Regency on North Arlington Avenue. Her friend K.T. Hunter woke up at around 9:00 am and could not find Denison. A small bloodstain was found on the pillow Denison used to sleep on that night, which led her friend to alert Brianna's parents and then local authorities. Denison had left the house without her shoes, cell phone or purse. Authorities believed she was wearing only sweats and a white tank top. She was later found to have been dressed in only bright orange-colored socks. In the following days, the Reno Police Department conducted a forensic investigation of the MacKay Court residence where Brianna was staying when she was abducted and found touch DNA belonging to an unidentified male on the doorknob. They also discovered that blood on the pillow was Denison's. Investigators began focusing on a kidnapping scenario. = Search = On January 21, 2008, detectives began sweeping the University of Nevada, Reno area in search of Denison. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also joined in the search efforts. Investigators later learned that the male DNA found on the couch where Denison was sleeping the night when she disappeared was linked with at least two previous sexually motivated attacks in the same area, one on November 13 and the second on December 16, 2007. On January 29, 2008, a Reno woman claimed she knew another victim who said she was raped at gunpoint in a garage on the University of Nevada, Reno campus in October 2007 but had not reported the crime. Police began interviewing nearly 100 registered sex offenders who live within a mile of the MacKay Court home. Around 1,700 volunteers helped with the search of a area during the time Denison was missing, including Nevada's then-First Lady Dawn Gibbons (wife of then-Governor Jim Gibbons). On February 15, 2008, Albert Jimenez of Reno was returning from his lunch break at a Subway restaurant. As he was walking by the road, he noticed bright orange-colored fabric standing out among a pile of discarded tree limbs that were lying in a ditch. When he approached closer, he discovered the neon orange socks were attached to feet. What at first he thought was a mannequin turned out to be a deceased woman. Jimenez had heard about Brianna Denison's kidnapping but didn't think the victim resembled photographs he'd seen on billboards. Jimenez didn't have a cell phone with him so he quickly returned to his place of employment, EE Technologies, to call Reno police. When police arrived to the South Reno lot, Jimenez was told that the victim was Denison. On February 16, 2008, an autopsy report confirmed that the body found in a field near a Reno business park was Brianna Denison.  Suspect  On January 29, 2008, Reno police released a description of the unknown perpetrator. The person in question was also linked to at least two attempted sexual assaults in November and December 2007, and a woman claimed to have been raped in a parking garage in October. Previous victims also gave enough detailed information for police to draw up a sketch of the suspect. An item of underwear was found near Denison's body along with the DNA of the perpetrator and the DNA of an unknown female. Police said that the clothing item did not belong to Denison and that it might have been left near her body to taunt the investigators. Police asked that anyone who recognized the clothing item as theirs come forward as they might know the identity of the perpetrator. = Arrest = On Tuesday, November 25, 2008, James Michael Biela, 27, of Sparks, Nevada, was arrested and booked at the Washoe County Jail on charges of murder, first-degree kidnapping, and sexual assault. The arrest occurred while he was dropping his son off at the Stepping Stones Children's Center in Reno. A DNA sample was collected from Biela. He had previously been arrested in 2001 for threatening his former girlfriend's neighbor with a knife. In a press conference held by the Reno Police Department on Wednesday, November 26, 2008, it was confirmed that the DNA collected from Biela matched the DNA found at the crime scene, positively linking him to both the murder of Brianna Denison and a previous sexual assault. At this same press conference, it was also stated that Biela had been turned in by a friend of Biela's girlfriend via Secret Witness on November 1, 2008. Biela's girlfriend had confided to this friend that she had found underwear unknown to her in Biela's truck as they were coming back from Washington state, where Biela had taken a job in March. Widespread news media reports began circulating that included a police sketch of a suspect and a description of a vehicle used in another rape the month before Brianna's abduction. According to Reno Police Department Chief Michael Poehlman, Biela was questioned by detectives after the Secret Witness tip came in. He denied involvement and declined to provide a DNA sample. Biela's girlfriend was also questioned and gave police permission to obtain DNA from her 4 year-old son, whom Biela had fathered. The test indicated that a direct relative of his had left DNA at the home where Brianna Denison was abducted and at the other rape that had taken place the prior month. With this evidence, Reno police obtained an arrest warrant and one for Biela's DNA. Chief Poehlman announced at the press conference that the Washoe County Sheriff's Department crime lab had tested Biela's DNA and found it matched DNA from the Denison case and another rape. Washoe County District Attorney Dick Gammick told reporters at the news conference he would be prosecuting the case with one of his lead criminal deputies, Elliot Sattler, and that his office would be seeking the \\"maximum penalty\\" for Biela, up to and including the death penalty. It was also announced that Biela, on his way to Washington, had sold in Idaho his truck which matched the description of the vehicle used in the previous sexual assault. At the press conference, officials said the vehicle was being returned to Reno to be searched and used as evidence in the case against him. = Trial and sentencing = On Thursday, May 27, 2010, Biela was found guilty of the murder of Brianna Denison. The jury returned a guilty verdict for all counts against Biela which included kidnapping, sexual assault and murder after deliberating for about nine hours. Defense attorneys argued against the death penalty, stating that Biela suffered an abusive childhood due to an alcoholic father, that he had been a productive member of society prior to his crimes and that he was a model prisoner. Jurors did not accept these mitigating factors and handed out the death sentence. On July 30, 2010, Judge Robert Perry sentenced Biela to four additional life sentences for multiple counts of rape and kidnapping associated with attacks on two victims prior to Denison's abduction and murder. Biela has appealed to the Nevada Supreme Court to reverse the denial of his 2012 writ of habeas corpus by the Washoe County second judicial district court.See, Biela v. State, 381 P.3d 594 His appeal has most recently been denied on June 12, 2019, whereby the Nevada Supreme Court \\"considered Biela's arguments and concluding that they do not warrant relief, we ORDER the judgment of the district court AFFIRMED.\\"See, Nevada Supreme Court Case No. 71427.  Aftermath  The sale of handguns, stunguns and pepper spray increased dramatically in the University of Nevada, Reno area after Denison's body was found. Denison's mother founded the Bring Bri Justice Foundation to try to implement changes after Denison's body was found. On February 23, 2008, hundreds of people attended a vigil held in Reno for Denison. = Media attention = The case received prominent national media attention, including coverage by national news services Fox News Channel, CNN, ABC News, MSNBC, and CBS News. It was televised in 2008 on an episode of Dr. Phil and was featured as Case #7 in the 2009 E! Entertainment special, Young Beautiful & Vanished: 15 Unthinkable Crimes.

Nevertheless early geologists and topographers had a fundamental agreement about the location and names of the subranges. The Okanagan Range was seen as bounded by the Pasayten River on the west and continuing east to Chopaka Mountain.

Since 2006, it is the main Chicago mid-western location of the Macy's department stores. The building is located in the Chicago \\"Loop\\" area of the downtown central business district in Cook County, Illinois, U.S.A., and it takes up the entire city block bounded clockwise from the west by North State Street, East Randolph Street, North Wabash Avenue, and East Washington Street. Marshall Field's established numerous important business \\"firsts\\" in this building and in a long series of previous elaborate decorative structures on this site for the last century and a half, and it is regarded as one of the three most influential establishments in the nationwide development of the department store and in the commercial business economic history of the United States. Both the building name and the name of the stores formerly headquartered at this building changed names on September 9, 2006 as a result of the merger of the previous May's Department Stores (Marshall Field's former owner and parent) with the Federated Department Stores which led to the integration of the Marshall Field's stores into the Macy's now nationwide retailing network. The building, which is the third largest store in the world, was both declared a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 2, 1978, and and it was designated a Chicago Landmark on November 1, 2005. The building architecture is known for its multiple atria (several balconied atrium - \\"Great Hall\\") and for having been built in stages over the course of more than two decades. Its ornamentation includes a Louis Comfort Tiffany, (1848‚Äì1933), (later Tiffany & Co. studios of New York City) mosaic vaulted ceiling and a pair of well-known outdoor street-corner clocks at State and Washington, and later at State and Randolph Streets, which serve as symbols of the store since 1897. Business history North State & Washington Streets corner, broken by the aftermath of the 1871 Great Chicago Fire Marshall Field and Company Building location (red square) in Chicago's \\"Loop\\" downtown business district area Although the official corporate name of the retail entity based in this building had been Marshall Field & Company (nicknamed Marshall Field's) from 1881 until 2006, the store has had five different names since its inception in 1852 as P. Palmer & Co. In 1868, after bowing out of involvement in day-to-day operations with his new partners of Field, Palmer & Leiter, Potter Palmer convinced Marshall Field and Levi Leiter to move the Field, Leiter & Co. store to a building Palmer owned on State Street at the corner of Washington Street. After being consumed by the \\"Great Chicago Fire\\" and splitting the wholesale business from the retail operations, the store resumed operations at State and Washington in a rebuilt structure, now leased from the Singer Sewing Machine Company. In 1877 another fire consumed this building, and when a new Singer Building was built to replace it at the same location in 1879, Field then put together the financing to purchase it. The business has remained there ever since, and it has added four subsequent buildings to form the integrated structure that is now called the \\"Marshall Field and Company Building.\\" Chicago's retailing center was State Street in the famous downtown \\"Loop\\" after the \\"Great Chicago Fire\\" of 1871, and this center has been anchored by Marshall Field's and its predecessor companies in this building complex. However, commuter suburbs began to have significant retail districts by the 1920s. In the 1920s, the store created new suburban locations such as Marshall Field and Company Store to remain competitive. After 1950, with the booming post-World War II economic/social climate with increasing suburban residential and commercial development, saw the construction of first \\"strip\\" shopping centers, followed by regional enclosed shopping malls along major thoroughfares and interstate highways such as the \\"Magnificent Mile\\" reduced the role of the \\"Loop\\"'s daily significance to many Chicagoans as downtown retail sales slipped and gradually additional business moved outward following first the streetcar lines and then the automobile. Eventually, there was an influx of stores from other parts of the country as the pace of commercial retailing merged, consolidating, and spreading first regionally then nationwide. Nonetheless, the Marshall Field and Company Building has survived at this location. However, with the merger and conversion to Macy's the emphasis of the store changed and store-branded lines replaced many designer labels, such as Dolce & Gabbana, Prada, Miu Miu and Jimmy Choo, which led to the disassembly of several designer departments of the former Field's (see picture below). On September 9, 2006, at the time of the stores merger and conversion, the name of the building was officially changed to \\"Macy's at State Street\\". Around this time of the conversion of Marshall Field's to Macy's the building was also the location of vociferous and outraged picketing and protesting by opponents of the merger/conversion and the growth in general of massive business mergers and economic consolidation across the country. After buying out his various partners over the early post-Civil War era, Marshall Field founded the Marshall Field & Company corporate entity that survived 152 years and had arranged before his death, to have this building constructed. The sentimental objections to the conversion that both eliminated the existence of the corporate entity bearing his name and renaming the building bearing his name were widely reported in the national media of newspapers, radio and television. A remaining Marshall Field's building nameplate (2006) =Business legend= The store housed a business that established new retailing standards and broke many retailing conventions of the day. The company quickly became successful, and by the 1880s it was one of the three largest retailers in the country. Before Marshall Field's death in 1906, his company became the largest wholesale and retail dry goods enterprise in the world. The Marshall Field & Company offered the first bridal registry, provided the first in-store dining facilities and established the first European buying office. The former store also was the first to provide personal shopping assistants. In the early 1900s, annual sales topped $60 million, and buying branches were located in New York City, London, Paris, Tokyo, Stockholm and Berlin. The building has hosted the first escalators built in a department store and continues to be the second largest store in the world. Marshall Field took over the operations of the store in 1881 and became the first merchant to post the price of the goods in plain sight, which eliminated the common practice of haggling and charging whatever the buyer would pay. On top of that, Field stood behind his product with his famous slogan that symbolized his willingness to refund the full price of all merchandise (a policy inherited from early mentor and partner Potter Palmer) purchased in his store: Building details The 13-story granite building on State Street was constructed in stages between 1902 and 1906 on a partitioned block with sections that were added to the building in 1902, 1906, 1907, and 1914. Daniel H. Burnham, (1846‚Äì1912), designed the two primary sections along State Street (the north building built in 1902 and the south in 1905‚Äì06). For a time, the building was the largest store in the world at of floorspace, with the largest book, china, shoe, and toy departments of all the world's department stores. The current building has several atria: A Louis Comfort Tiffany mosaic vaulted ceiling dome caps a 5-story balconied atrium in the southwest corner; the northwest section has a 13-story skylit atrium, and a newer atrium with a fountain in the center is bridged by double escalator banks. Crafted by a group of 50 artisans over 18 months, the Tiffany ceiling is over and made up of 1.6 million pieces of iridescent glass. It is the first iridescent glass dome and it continues to be the largest glass mosaic of its kind. Only Egypt's 3,000-year-old Temple of Karnak, with its columns rivals the four Ionic-style capped granite columns on the State Street fa√ßade. The building is estimated to be high. Marshall Field and Company Buildings front facade on North State Street, pictured behind adjacent \\"Block 37\\" construction project underway across State Street. The building is known for its two exterior clocks, which weigh about each, on its northwest and southwest corners along State Street at both Randolph and Washington Streets. The southwest clock at the original Washington Street intersection, known as \\"The Great Clock\\", was installed on November 26, 1897. Marshall Field envisioned the clock as a beacon for his store which he viewed as a meeting place. The clock was installed after the southwest corner of the store had become a popular meeting place and people began leaving notes for one another on the Marshall Field's windows. The clock was an attempt to end this practice, and encourage punctuality. Today, the building is located at 111 North State Street, between Washington and Randolph Streets, within the designated \\"Loop\\" Retail Historic District of the Chicago \\"Loop\\", across State Street from the \\"Block 37\\" future construction project, across Randolph Street from the Joffrey Tower, and across Wabash Avenue from The Heritage at Millennium Park. An underground public concourse connects the basement to 25 East Washington Street, which formerly housed the Marshall Field's Men's Store. The building is a major hub for the \\"Chicago Pedway\\". Traditions and popular culture The building has several Christmas traditions: it is known as the former production site of Frango mints and for the Walnut Room Christmas tree. It also hosts an ornate decorated display windows series at the street level. The windows display includes thirteen themed windows along State Street that in recent years have displayed the themes of the unfolding of stories of Snow White, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Paddington Bear, The Night Before Christmas, Harry Potter, and Cinderella. Annually a three-story tall conifer Christmas tree is brought in for the Holidays season. In an effort to quell opposition to the merger/ conversion, Macy's made a formal statement of its intent to continue the traditions of a Christmas tree, a seventh floor \\"Frango\\" viewing kitchen, and animated holiday window displays. On November 3, 1945, American illustrator Norman Rockwell drew a picture of one of the Marshall Field's Building clocks on the cover of the famous \\"Saturday Evening Post\\" magazine, entitled \\"The Clock Mender\\". The Rockwell painting shows a man perched atop a ladder and adjusting one of the Marshall Field's clock to correspond with his own pocket watch. The old Oriental Theatre in the background proves this depicts the matching \\"Great Clock\\" at the northwest corner of the building at State & Randolph Streets. In 1948, Rockwell donated the original painting, \\"The Clock Mender\\", to the store, where it had hung on the seventh floor ever since. After Target Corporation sold Field's to the May Department Stores, which later merged with Federated Department Stores in 2005, the Federated officials discovered a reproduction copy on display. Federated removed the fake copy and asked Target to return the original. The painting has since been donated to the Chicago Historical Society, which had from February 26, 2000 to May 21, 2000 been the second stop of the seven-city national tour of \\"Pictures for the American People\\", the first comprehensive Rockwell career exhibition that had been organized by the High Museum of Art of Atlanta and the Norman Rockwell Museum of Stockbridge, Massachusetts and that had also visited the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., San Diego Museum of Art and Phoenix Art Museum. In John Dos Passos' novel The 42nd Parallel (1930), character Eric Egstrom is employed at this Marshall Field's building. Authors G. K.

The goal was to establish a torpedo-boat base to challenge Italian naval and air supremacy on the Greek Dodecanese islands. The British landings were challenged by Italian land, air and naval forces, which forced the British troops to re-embark amidst some confusion and led to recriminations between the British commanders for underestimating the Italians. Background After the attack on Taranto and the success of Operation Compass, an offensive in Cyrenaica, Libya from December 1940 ‚Äì February 1941, the British conducted operations to neutralize Italian forces in the Dodecanese islands. Admiral Andrew Cunningham, the commander of the Mediterranean Fleet planned to occupy Kastelorizo, the easternmost Greek island in the chain just off the Turkish coast, about from Rhodes to establish a motor torpedo boat base at a time when Axis air attacks on Malta had led to the last flying boat being withdrawn to Alexandria. The operation was intended as a first step towards the control of the Aegean Sea. Despite isolation, Italian naval and air forces in the area were still capable of carrying out hit-and-run attacks on Allied shipping between Egypt and Greece. Battle =24 February= The British planned to land a force of about 200 men of No. 50 Commando, assisted by a 24-man detachment of Royal Marines to establish a beachhead on the island, to be followed 24-hours later by an army unit to consolidate the British position. On 24 February the commandos, transported by the destroyers and and the marines, on the gunboat , sailed from Suda Bay. The second force, a company of Sherwood Foresters on board the armed yacht , escorted by the light cruisers and , awaited developments in Cyprus. =25 February= Before dawn, fifty of the commandos landed from ten whaleboats on Nifti Point, south of the settlement, while the Royal Marines occupied the harbour. The landings were supported by the submarine , which had previously made a reconnaissance of the landing points and acted as a beacon for the incoming ships.HMS Parthian at uboat.net; retrieved 26 August 2018 The Italian garrison on Kastelorizo consisted of 35 soldiers and agents of the Guardia di Finanza in charge of a wireless station. The commandos ambushed an Italian patrol on the truck between Nifti Point and the port, killing two soldiers and wounding one. The British surprised the garrison, seized the radio outpost and inflicted 13 casualties, including twelve prisoners, the rest of the commandos coming ashore during the action. Before being overrun, the Italians had managed to send a message to Rhodes, the main Italian air and naval base in the Dodecanese. (Vice Admiral) Luigi Biancheri, commander of the Italian naval forces in the Aegean Sea reacted swiftly. From 08:00 and 09:30, aircraft of the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) raided the harbour castle and the main hills of the island, where the commandos were dug in. Ladybird was struck by a bomb and three sailors were wounded. Short of fuel, Ladybird re-embarked the Royal Marines and made for Haifa, which cut the radio link of the commandos with Alexandria. After communications breakdowns and other mishaps, the follow-up force from Cyprus was diverted to Alexandria. =26 February= The Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy) counter-attack began after sunset on 26 February, when the torpedo boats Lupo and Lince landed about 240 soldiers north of the port and used their guns to bombard British positions at the docks and the Governor's palace, killing three and wounding seven commandos. The Italian warships evacuated a number of Italian civilians who had gathered at harbour after learning of their presence in the port. =27 February= Biancheri, with Lupo, Lince, MAS 546 and MAS 561, landed troops on the morning of 27 February, the operation having been delayed by high seas. Italian forces already ashore harassed the exhausted and isolated British commandos, who were equipped only for a 24-hour operation. The destroyers Crispi and Sella arrived later in the day with more ground forces; a total of 258 troops and 80 marines were eventually disembarked by Italian ships. As the Italians attacked, the commandos retreated to their encampment at the landing beach near Nifti point, under fire from Lupo. One company remained in the area of the local cemetery. The captain of Hereward was warned by the commandos and joined Decoy, about off the coast. The commander ordered the warships to disrupt the Italian landings but the destroyers did not find the Italian ships. Hereward reported that the Italian surface action threatened the landing of the main British force embarked on Rosaura, which had already been compromised by the air attacks on the harbour. The landing was postponed and rearranged, to be carried out by the destroyers Decoy and , after embarking the Sherwood Foresters company from Rosaura. The ships were ordered to Alexandria to reorganise; Admiral Renouf fell ill and was replaced by Captain Egerton, commander of Bonaventure, which complicated matters. =28 February= More British forces from Alexandria arrived in the early hours of 28 February. A platoon of the Sherwood Foresters found the landing point abandoned by the commandos; along with scattered equipment and ammunition were a dead soldier and two stragglers, who told them of the Italian counter-attack. Major Cooper of the Sherwood Foresters, who had sailed back to Decoy, concluded, after talks with the other commanders, that lack of naval and air support made withdrawal inevitable. The bulk of the landing party, isolated on a small plateau in the east end of Kastelorizo, was re-embarked by 03:00. Italian troops surrounded and eventually captured a number of commandos who had been left behind. While covering the withdrawal, was attacked by Crispi, which had fired twenty shells on British positions at Nifti Point, steaming from the south. The Italian destroyer fired two torpedoes which missed and Jaguar replied with her main armament. Jaguar received a 40 mm hit on her searchlight that made its gunfire ineffective and the British force sailed back to Alexandria. The destroyers , and Jaguar made a sweep between Rhodes and Kastelorizo after a radar contact and detecting wireless traffic in the area but failed to intercept the Italian warships as they returned to base. Aftermath =Analysis= Cunningham described the operation as \\"a rotten business and reflected little credit to everyone\\" and laid blame on Renouf. A Board of Inquiry found that Herewards commander made a misjudgement by rejoining Decoy, instead of engaging the Italian force without delay, which caused the failure of the main landing and the isolation of the commandos. British commanders had also been surprised by the Italian riposte, especially the frequent air attacks which were unopposed. Greene and Massignani, writing in 1998, noted the British capture of Y-I, an Italian cipher book. In 2009, Vincent O'Hara wrote that the operation showed that the Italians dominated the seas around even their outlying bases and that this was not to be the last time that the British underestimated them. The Italians retained control of the Dodecanese Islands until the armistice of September 1943. When Italy changed sides, British forces landed on the islands to support the Italian garrisons in the Dodecanese Campaign (8 September ‚Äì 22 November 1943). British and Italian troops were attacked and defeated by a German operation and the islands came under German control until the end of the war. =Casualties= In 1998, Greene and Massignani wrote that the British suffered three men killed, eleven wounded and 27 missing for an Italian loss of eight men killed, eleven wounded and ten missing.

History The ranch's builder, Tom Sun, was a French-Canadian frontiersman who later became a pioneer cattleman. During the 1870s and 1880s the ranch was typical of many medium-sized ranching operations in cattle country. In 1882, The Cheyenne Daily Leader, remarked that \\"the eastern person of inquiring turn of mind who writes to his friends out west to ask what a ranch is like would find his answer in a description of Tom Sun's.\\" The ranch site was declared a National Historic Landmark on December 19, 1960. and At the time of its nomination as a landmark it was one of the best preserved ranches from the cattle ranging period and was in size. Recent development and renovations The ranch remained in the Sun family for four generations until 1996 when it was sold to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Since that time some of the ranch buildings have been transformed into a visitor center for nearby Martin's Cove, an important Mormon historic site. Structures on the site have been stabilized and repaired, but the setting has been impacted by the development of parking lots and landscape designs not consistent with the original historic setting. However, large portions of the landmark area, particularly sections in public ownership, continue to retain their historic integrity.

It houses the Belleville Theatre Guild, a member of the Eastern Ontario Drama League. History In 1951, a group of friends gathered to read a play for pleasure. They enjoyed it so much they decided they would form a group and perform it. That fall, they met again at a tea room in downtown Belleville to plan a public meeting in the Corby Library for forming a theatre guild in Belleville. \\"The Voice of the People\\", a play by Robertson Davies, was one of the first one act plays performed. It went on to win the Eastern Ontario Drama League Festival and was invited to the Dominion Drama Festival in Saint John, New Brunswick, the next spring. With the onset of television, the theatre struggled to stay alive with little money or location to operate from. Places were used that ranged from the third storey of a downtown building, to a donated room at the back of a building, to a vacant storefront. In 1969, the city of Belleville provided the guild with use of the D.L. Storey Building on Pinnacle Street, which was formerly a Salvation Army Citadel. The guild members were responsible for all operating costs of the building, including utilities, heat, repairs and maintenance, plus any renovations that are required. It was then renamed the Pinnacle Playhouse and it has been the source of its success ever since. By the time the theatre celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001, it had established itself as Belleville's primary (and at times only) hub for live theatre with early members including Jim Alexander, Liz Marshall and Steve Forrester still spearheading consistent high quality in its productions. Today the Belleville Theatre Guild, at Pinnacle Playhouse, puts on five shows annually. Each season culminates with a musical. In addition to their regular season they are a venue for the Belleville Doc Fest, Night Kitchen Too (a musical variety performance), and occasional screenings of silent films. Marianne Ackerman has held public readings of her in-progress works at the venue. Beginning in 2014, BTG began hosting local playwrights with an annual off-season show called the Evening of One-Acts. Playwrights whose short works have debuted here include Peter Paylor, Judie Preece, Maurice Leslie, Wayne Clark, Ian Feltham, Keith Taylor and Adri Boodoosingh. Renovations The Playhouse has undergone many transformations, including the initial upgrade to a 126-seat theatre with a revolving stage (which was removed in later renovations). In 1982 ‚Äì 83 the Belleville Theatre Guild, with donations from subscribers, community groups and local and provincial governments, renovated the Playhouse to increase seating to 154 and to provide essential space both onstage and off. In 2002, the Belleville Theatre Guild initiated its \\"Help Give Us A Lift\\" campaign to raise funds for an elevator addition, additional wing space, a new box office and a barrier-free washroom. A grant was given by the Ontario Trillium Foundation. The Guild's building fund, which had been saved for many years, provided the majority of remaining costs. The balance was raised through donations from businesses and individuals in the community. The most significant of these sponsors have their names engraved in the BTG Walk of Fame (on the sidewalk outside the theatre). Mission The Belleville Theatre Guild provides quality community theatre to Hastings County. It has presented a wide variety of plays, musicals and theatre-related workshops. For three generations, the guild has brought theatre training through outreach programmes, and opportunities to perform to young people and those young at heart. Annex The Guild also has a warehouse space called the Annex, which houses set pieces, props, costumes, a board room, a workroom for set builders and a rehearsal space for upcoming productions.

The four surviving buildings are arrayed in a north-south line along Happy Hollow Road, a former stagecoach route. All are single-story frame structures finished in wooden clapboards. The general store, at the northern end, has flanking shed-roof sections and was built in 1913. To its south is the former manager's residence, built in 1876 and featuring some finely crafted Stick style decoration. To its south are the utilitarian office building and a barn, the former built in 1918 and the latter c. 1876. The property is adorned by mature cottonwoods planted by the company in 1888. The Swan Company was founded in 1883 by Scottish investors with an initial capital investment of $3 million. At its peak in 1887-88, the company had more than 113,000 head of cattle and controlled more and one million acres of rangeland across eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska. In 1904 it converted its business from cattle to sheep, peaking in 1911 with 112,000 head.

This disease is characterized by an excessive production of heavy chains that are short and truncated. These heavy chain disease proteins have various deletions, mainly in their amino-terminal part, which causes the heavy chains to lose the ability to form disulfide bonds with the light chains. The defect in the immunoglobulins presumably arises during somatic hypermutation. Deletion of the N-terminal part of the heavy chain disease protein leads to aggregation and signaling of the B cell receptor, presumably due to the loss of the anti-aggregating properties of the light chain. Classification There are four forms: * alpha chain disease (Seligmann's disease) * gamma chain disease (Franklin's disease) * mu chain disease * delta chain disease =IgA/Œ±HCD= The most common type of heavy chain disease is the IgA type, known as Œ±HCD. The most common type of Œ±HCD is the gastrointestinal form (known as immunoproliferative small intestine disease or IPSID), but it has also been reported in the respiratory tract, and other areas of the body. =IgG/Œ≥HCD= Franklin's disease (gamma heavy chain disease) It is a very rare B-cell lymphoplasma cell proliferative disorder which may be associated with autoimmune diseases and infection is a common characteristic of the disease. It is characterized by lymphadenopathy, fever, anemia, malaise, hepatosplenomegaly, and weakness. The most distinctive symptom is palatal edema, caused by nodal involvement of Waldeyer's ring. Diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an anomalous serum M component that reacts with anti-IgG but not anti-light chain reagents. Bone marrow examination is usually nondiagnostic. Patients usually have a rapid downhill course and die of infection if left untreated or misdiagnosed. Patients with Franklin disease usually have a history of progressive weakness, fatigue, intermittent fever, night sweats and weight loss and may present with lymphadenopathy (62%), splenomegaly (52%) or hepatomegaly (37%). The fever is considered secondary to impaired cellular and humoral immunity, and thus recurrent infections are the common clinical presentation in Franklin disease. Weng et al. described the first case of Penicillium sp. infection in a patient with Franklin disease and emphasized the importance of proper preparation for biopsy, complete hematologic investigation, culture preparation and early antifungal coverage to improve the outcome. The Œ≥HCD can be divided into three categories based on the various clinical and pathological features. These categories are disseminated lymphoproliferative disease, localized proliferative disease and no apparent proliferative disease. * Disseminated lymphoproliferative disease is found in 57-66% of patients diagnosed with Œ≥HCD. Lymphadenopathy and constitutional symptoms are the usual features. * Localized proliferative disease is found in approximately 25% of Œ≥HCD patients. This is characterized by a localization of the mutated heavy chains in extramedullary tissue, or solely in the bone marrow. * No apparent proliferative disease is seen in 9-17% of patients with Œ≥HCD, and there is almost always an underlying autoimmune disorder. =IgM/ŒºHCD= The IgM type of heavy chain disease, ŒºHCD, is often misdiagnosed as chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) because the two diseases are often associated with each other and show similar symptoms.

Joint criminal enterprise (JCE) is a legal doctrine used during war crimes tribunals to allow the prosecution of members of a group for the actions of the group. This doctrine considers each member of an organized group individually responsible for crimes committed by group within the common plan or purpose.John Ciorciari, Joint Criminal Enterprise and the Khmer Rouge Prosecutions It arose through the application of the idea of common purpose and has been applied by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to prosecute political and military leaders for mass war crimes, including genocide, committed during the Yugoslav Wars 1991‚Äì1999. For example, \\"if three people commit a bank robbery and one fatally shoots a person in the process, the law considers all guilty of murder\\".Atrocities in Yugoslavia unraveled much later The concept of \\"collective liability\\" where more than one person can share liability and punishment for the actions of another person is not universally accepted and is considered by some to be a form of human rights abuse, while others believe it is just. Definition The first usages of joint criminal enterprise doctrine are identified in post-World War II cases, in which the doctrine was used under the name common purpose (or joint enterprise), or without specific naming.Jasmina Pjanic (OKO lawyer), Joint Criminal Enterprise New form of individual criminal responsibility. Retrieved 29 December 2009. However, the origins of the doctrine may be influenced by the Common Law of England, which introduced the principle into criminal law in the UK and other Commonwealth nations such as Australia. A similar legal principle can also be found in Texas, USA, where it is known as the Law of Parties. The notion of collective liability and shared punishment for the actions of others as if all perpetrated the same deed may be much older, and was used to justify extermination of religious and cultural groups, such as the Albigensian \\"Heretics\\" and those who harbored them. Critics argue that Joint Criminal Enterprise can lead to excessive legal process and punishments, that it lowers the evidential bar in favour of prosecution, and that it runs counter to the spirit of Blackstone's formulation. Supporters argue that it ensures those contributing to or instigating a criminal act are properly made to account for their involvement. The first reference to joint criminal enterprise and its constituent elements was provided in Tadic case 1999. The Appeals Chamber of the ICTY decided on 21 May 2003 on the following definitions:ICTY Appeals Chamber \\"Decision on Dragoljub Ojdanic's Motion Challenging Jurisdiction - Joint Criminal Enterprise\\", The Prosecutor v. Milutinovic et al. - Case No. IT-99-37-AR72, 21 May 2003 Writing about this finding in the Journal of International Criminal Justice in 2004, Steven Powles (a barrister who has appeared as a defence council in matters before the ICTY and the Special Court for Sierra Leone) states that the Appeals Chamber was obliged to make this declaration because there was no specific mention of \\"joint criminal enterprise\\" in the court's statutes and that \\"this is not ideal [because] criminal law, especially international criminal law, requires clear and certain definitions of the various bases of liability, so as to enable the parties, both the prosecution and, perhaps more importantly, the defence to prepare for and conduct the trial.\\"Steven Powles,Joint Criminal Enterprise Journal of International Criminal Justice 2004 2(2):606-619; Post World War II trials In the aftermath of World War II, the courts established by British and United States in Germany applied this doctrine in the trials against Nazis. The Italian Supreme Court applied a similar doctrine in the trials against fascists. =Concentration camp cases= Former guards of Belsen Concentration Camp load the bodies of dead prisoners onto a lorry for burial (April 1945). Possibly, the most well-known post World War II cases are the Dachau Concentration Camp case, decided by a United States court, and the Belsen case, decided by a British military court, both sitting in Germany. In these cases, the accused held position of authority within the hierarchy of the Nazi concentration camps and based on that were found guilty of the charges that they had acted in pursuance of a common plan to kill or mistreat prisoners. =Essen Lynching case= The Essen lynching case, conducted before a British military court, demonstrates the closest link to the joint criminal enterprise doctrine. In that case three British airmen prisoners of war had been lynched by a mob of Germans in the Essen on 13 December 1944. Seven persons were charged with committing a war crime, included a German captain, who had placed prisoners under the escort of a German soldier. While the escort with the prisoners was leaving, the captain had ordered him not to interfere if German civilians molested the prisoners. This order had been given in a loud voice so that the gathering crowd could hear. When the prisoners of war were marched through one of the main streets of Essen, the crowd grew bigger, started hitting them and throwing stones. When they reached the bridge, the prisoners were thrown over the parapet of the bridge; one of the airmen was killed by the fall and the two others were killed by members of the crowd. Post Yugoslav War trials The use of the JCE as an actual criminal investigation and prosecution theory first appeared at the ICTY through a written proposal to Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte, which was developed and authored by American prosecutor Dermot Groome, at the time the legal officer for the Bosnia case, and American Investigator John Cencich, head of the Milosevic investigation for crimes alleged to have been committed in Croatia. Cencich provides an in-depth look at the actual development of the investigation and prosecution theory of the JCE in his doctoral dissertation at the University of Notre Dame,John Robert Cencich: Crime and War: Piercing the Military Veil Through International Criminal Justice, University of Notre Dame (2008) in the International Criminal Justice Review,John Robert Cencich: International Criminal Investigations of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity: A War Crimes Investigator's Perspective, International Criminal Justice Review (2009) and his book, The Devil's Garden: A War Crimes Investigator's Story.Cencich, John, (2013). The Devil's Garden: A War Crimes Investigator's Story, Washington, DC: Potomac Books. =Indictments to Serb leaders= The ICTY prosecutor indicted Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá on three separate indictments which on appeal they successfully pleaded to the ICTY Appeals Chamber should considered as one indictment. As the prosecution had not used the same language in all three indictments it was left to the Court of Appeal to decide if the alleged criminal enterprises in the three indictments were one of the same and what was common between the allegations. The Appeals count decided that:\\"Reasons for decision on prosecution interlocutory appeal from refusal to order joinder \\", Slobodan Milosevic: ICTY Appeal Chamber Decision on case numbers IT-99-37-AR73, IT-01-50-AR73 and IT-01-51-AR73, 2002-04-18 see footnote 41 and paragraphs 8 and 21 Milo≈°eviƒá died during the trial, but he was still found to have been a part of a joint criminal enterprise in the verdicts against Milan Martiƒá and Milan Babiƒá, who publicly admitted his own (and Milo≈°eviƒá's) guilt. According to the ICTY prosecutors indictment, Milutinoviƒá et al, Nikola ≈†ainoviƒá, Neboj≈°a Pavkoviƒá and Sreten Lukiƒá, along with others, participated in a joint criminal enterprise to modify the ethnic balance in Kosovo in order to ensure continued control by the FRY and Serbian authorities over the province.

On 27 May 2009, the Prosecution filed its notice of appeal in respect of all of the accused except Milan Milutinoviƒá. On the same day, all Defence teams filed their notices of appeal. =Indictments to Croat leaders= Former Yugoslavia during war ICTY found in a first-instance verdict that general Ante Gotovina participated in a joint criminal enterprise with Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman with the goal to do \\"the forcible and permanent removal of the Serb population from the [territory occupied by the forces of the] Republic of Serbian Krajina\\". Nevertheless, ICTY's appeals chamber acquitted Ante Gotovina, Ivan ƒåermak and Mladen Markaƒç of all charges, including the one of participation in the joint criminal enterprise. In April 2001, ICTY chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte stated that she was preparing to indict Croatian president Franjo Tudjman prior to his death in December 1999.Del Ponte urges war crimes arrests, By CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour In May 2013, Jadranko Prliƒá and others were found guilty for taking part in the joint criminal enterprise with Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman for crimes committed in the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia against Muslims.Bosnian Croat leaders convicted of war crimes, Al Jazeera However, on 19 July 2016, the Appeals Chamber concluded that the \\"Trial Chamber made no explicit findings concerning [Tuƒëman's] participation in the joint criminal enterprise and did not find [him] guilty of any crimes.\\" ICTY reverses findings on Tudjman, ≈†u≈°ak participation in the joint criminal enterprise in Herceg Bosna, MiseticLaw In November 2017, the ICTY reaffirmed the first-instance verdict that Tudjman, as well as some other senior Croatian officials, had participated in a joint criminal enterprise with the defendants with the aim of persecuting Bosniaks.Bosnian Croat Disrupts Hague Verdict by ‚ÄòTaking Poison‚Äô,BALKAN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE Rwandan Genocide trials The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) is an international court established in November 1994 by the United Nations Security Council in order to judge people responsible for the Rwandan genocide and other serious violations of the international law in Rwanda, or by Rwandan citizens in nearby states, between 1 January and 31 December 1994. At the Rwanda trials, the Prosecution originally alleged that the genocidal common plan had been drawn up in 1990 but this theory was dismissed in December 2008 when the defendants in the mammoth \\"Military I\\" trial were acquitted of conspiracy to commit genocide. Other Joint Criminal Enterprise is found in some nations and states and may have its roots in the Common Law of England. Joint Criminal Enterprise as a legal concept has been used at the ICTY and - to a lesser extent - at the ICTR, as well as in the Special Court for Sierra Leone. But it is not part of the International Criminal Court's (ICC) Rome Statute. The ICC instead uses the notion of co-perpetratorship, which a number of ICTY judges had tried to introduce at the ICTY instead of JCE.Klaus Bachmann, Aleksandar Fatiƒá: The UN International Criminal Tribunals. Transition without Justice? Routledge 2015 Criticism John Laughland, himself seen as a \\"nuttiest\\", fringe polemicist and Bosnian Genocide denier, Serb and Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá apologist, and \\"PR man to Europe's nastiest regimes\\", criticized the Joint Criminal Enterprise doctrine. He stated that successive rulings of the ICTY Appeals Chamber have allowed this doctrine \\"to get wildly out of hand\\", arguing thus that \\"international tribunals have abolished the very thing which criminal trials are supposed to be about. If you can be convicted of a crime as a primary perpetrator for something which you neither committed nor intended to commit, and if mens rea can be ‚Äòestablished‚Äô by judicial ruling\\" this is \\"introducing into the heart of their systems measures which are the very hallmark of dictatorships.\\" In 2011 a campaign group JENGbA is organized, and seeks to curtail the use of Joint Enterprise while it claims its misuse as a human rights abuse.

The area is located south of United States Route 191 between Daniel and Pinedale, with the only vehicular access provided by a ranch road which crosses the river a short way east of the confluence. The site shows no evidence of the large meetings which took place here in the 19th century. This area is typical of the sites at which the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous took place between 1825 and 1840. The rendezvous was an organized meeting point for fur trappers, their suppliers, and the buyers of their products to meet. The meetings were first organized by William Henry Ashley, and brought a sense of organization and structure to the otherwise dispersed fur trapping and trading business. Meetings were held annually, generally centered at some location on the Green River. Five were known to be held near the confluence with Horse Creek, but all of them were sprawling affairs, due to the large number of animals needing water and forage. Although no traces of the rendezvous themselves survive on the site, there is a commemorative marker on a rise overlooking the Horse Creek site, and there are further markers near US 191 at another rendezvous site.

It is located on the Sydenham River southwest of the community of Strathroy. Napier is almost a ghost town for many of its buildings have been torn down over the years and it has few or no businesses left. Early Settlement The area was first settled about 1829 by an unidentified disbanded military unit. At first settlers had to walk to Kilworth to reach a grist mill, to London to a market and miles to Port Stanley for tools and implements. One early settler was Captain Christopher Beer who previously had spent 14 years in the Royal Navy. In 1830, Beer received of land in what is now the Napier area along the Sydenham. He then returned to England to get his family, brought them back and built a two- storey log house near the present site of the village. The first Anglican services in the area were held in his home. Another well-known early settler was Captain Robert Johnston who arrived with his family in 1832. Their log cabin was built across the road from the present Presbyterian church. Johnston, aged 72, was an old soldier who had served at Waterloo. He was not the average pioneer. He arrived in the wilderness with bagpipes, a piano, 30 complete sets of military arms and a substantial amount of money. Johnston built himself a large brick house with six chimneys. Soon Anglican services were moved to this large home. St. Mary's Church One of the first public buildings constructed by these settlers was Sr. Mary's Anglican Church. The land for the church was donated by Charles Preston. The exact building date is not known but was probably about 1840. St. Mary's still stands, the oldest standing church in Middlesex County. The last regular service was held here in 1920 but yearly services began in 1931 and continue today. A cemetery surrounds the church. When a sea captain, Christoper Beer, died in 1871, aged 80, he was buried in the southeast corner. His stone says \\"Anchored in the harbour of eternal rest.\\" In the northwest corner are buried Joe and Mary Wrinkle. Joe was a fugitive slave from the southern US who worked for Captain Beer. Mary, his wife was white. When asked why she married Wrinkle, she replied, \\"His gracious manners and kindly ways took my fancy. The colour of his skin doesn't matter.\\" Other churches were built later. A frame Methodist church was built in 1860 and the first Presbyterian church was built in c.1864. The Presbyterian church was rebuilt in 1887 and set on a hill in the southwest part of the village where it still stands today. Development of the Village Napier developed into an active village. Robert Johnston built a store and gristmill in 1838, importing two millstones from Scotland. Johnston also had a sawmill built to harvest the many black walnut trees in the area. He then proceeded to build a large woollen mill. The village was known at first as Johnston's Mills. Later it was known as Puffing Town because of the noise made by the steam engine at Johnston's mills. This mill stood on the river behind the general store standing in the village today. People would walk to the mill from as far as Sarnia with bags of wheat on their backs to do their milling. After the township of Metcalfe was created in 1840, the village became known as Metcalfe. When a post office opened on November 6, 1851, the village was named Napier, probably after Sir Charles James Napier (1782‚Äì1853), a British General, or perhaps after his brother, Sir William Francis Patrick Napier (1785‚Äì1860), also a general and historian of the Peninsular War. In 1857, J. G. Sutherland moved into the area, bought the mills from Johnston and built a new woollen mill. The village population at this time was about 150. Sutherland's businesses dominated the community for many years. It was he who built the store known as Napier House in 1872; the post office moved into this building later. Napier was important enough to become the township \\"capital.\\" In 1880, the township council started holding regular meetings in the new Napier Town Hall. Decline of the Village Traditionally, Napier's fall is blamed on the railway. Two branches of both the Great Western Railway, later the CNR, bypassed Napier. The village was also bypassed by the CPR and Michigan Central. Much business was lost as settlers moved to larger communities along the railway. Also, once the walnut trees were depleted, the village became less important because there was less work for the sawmills.\\"Napier's Walnut Forest Gave Boom to Village; Bear Creek Harnessed,\\" Middlesex County Scrapbook Vol. 3, 23. Microfilm at London Room, Central Public Library, London, Ontario. The village did not become a ghost town overnight but faded slowly during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1890, the gristmill burned and was never rebuilt. By 1900, all of Sutherland's mills and many small shopkeepers were gone. The post office closed on June 1, 1915, after which mail was delivered from Strathroy. The store closed in 1970. Napier Today Napier is worth visiting since many heritage landmarks remain. From the south, the first interesting building is a Masonic Temple built in 1955, replacing a previous building. On its lawn is a millstone that came from Sutherland's gristmill. Next door is St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church and across the road is the Napier House, which has been saved from the wrecking ball by a local committee of concerned citizens who raised funds to replace the crumbling foundation and restore the brick facade to its original appearance. Farther north on Mary Street is the old school, later a Women's Institute. North along Napier Road is Melwood Drive. A right turn will lead to St. Mary's Anglican Church on the left side.

He patented an innovation to yo-yos that used a loop instead of a knot around the axle, allowing for new tricks such as the ability to \\"sleep.\\" Early history Pedro Flores was born in Vintar, Ilocos Norte, Philippines and came to the United States in 1915. He attended the High School of Commerce in San Francisco 1919-1920 and subsequently studied law at University of California, Berkeley and the Hastings College of Law in San Francisco. Flores dropped out of school and moved to Santa Barbara, California where he worked at odd-jobs to make a living. While working as a bellboy, Flores read an article about a self-made millionaire who made his money by selling a ball attached to a rubber band. At this point he remembered the yo- yo (previously known as the bandalore), a game which has been played for hundreds of years in the Philippines. Bringing it all together, Flores saw a good market opportunity in the US, and the ability to go into business for himself. Flores Yo-yos Flores Yo-yo (Circ. 1928-1929) Between 1928 and 1932, Flores started and ran the Yo-yo Manufacturing Company in Santa Barbara before selling the company and trademark to Duncan who continued to market and sell Flores yo-yos alongside the Duncan line. Flores initially made yo-yos for neighborhood children by hand, but soon started buying machinery to produce them more quickly. Approximately a year after Flores opened his yo-yo business, his company was selling 300,000 yo-yos annually. Flores has been credited with popularizing the yo-yo in the U.S., but he never claimed to have invented the yo-yo. Yo-yos were introduced to the Philippines in the 1800s. The word \\"y√≥yo\\" was a Tagalog word that means \\"come and go\\" or \\"come back.\\" Flores is sometimes referred to as the original patent holder of the yo-yo. Although he didn't patent the first yo-yo in the U.S., his patent included the Filipino innovation of using a loop instead of a knot around the axle. This is known as an \\"unresponsive yo-yo\\" and allows for additional tricks such as the ability to \\"sleep.\\" The ability to do tricks was one of the main selling points for Flores' yo-yos, and he created some of the first yo-yo trick competitions. Other types of yo-yos (Bandalores) had already been patented prior to the company's existence. Flores stayed involved with yo-yos most of his life. He founded a yo-yo manufacturing company in Santa Barbara, California, in 1928, founded the Flores Corporation in Hollywood (6301 Sunset Blvd.) and cofounded Flores and Stone in Los Angeles (1938 Hyperion Ave. in Silver Lake) c. 1929. In the 1930s, he promoted yo-yo contests along with Duncan. He cofounded the Chico yo-yo company in 1950 and founded the Flores Corporation of America in 1954. Duncan Between 1930 and 1932, Flores sold his interest in his yo-yo manufacturing companies for greater than $750,000, to Donald F. Duncan Sr., which during the depression of the 1930s was a fortune. On this transaction Flores was quoted saying \\"I am more interested in teaching children to use the yo-yos than I am in manufacturing of yo-yos.\\" Taking his own words to heart, he became one of the key promoters in Duncan's early yo-yo campaigns. During 1931-1932, Flores was instrumental in setting up a large number of the promotions in the cities where the early Duncan contests were being held. In relation to his contests run just 2 years earlier with his Yo-yo Manufacturing Company, the new Duncan contests were vastly different. These contests now required a series of tricks similar to modern day contests with ties being broken by the number of loop the loops completed. References Sources *Meisenheimer, Lucky J. (1999).

Sutton, a St. Louis, Missouri blacksmith, farmer and inventor of the Sutton plow.The Kate Moody Collection At the age of 18, Cotter asked Sutton for permission to go west and seek his fortune in the gold mines as some of the Suttons had done.Missouri Historical Society The Sutton Papers - Box 3 Instead, scouts of the Whitney Surveying party offered him a job and Cotter took a position as packer on the California Geological Survey under Josiah Whitney from 1862 to 1864. Hired as a packer, Cotter did not actually know much about packing, but caught on quickly. Clarence King called Cotter \\"our man-of-all-work, to whom science already owes its debts\\". and described him as \\"Stout of limb, stronger yet in heart, of iron endurance, and a quiet unexcited temperament, and better yet, devoted to me, I felt that Cotter was the one comrade I would choose to face death with, for I believed there was in his manhood no room for fear or shirk.\\" and, \\"in all my experience of mountaineering I have never known an act of such real, profound courage as this of Cotter's.\\" In the Exploration of the Sierra Nevada, Francis P. Farquhar describes Cotter as, \\"an indomitable mountain-climber whose Services were of great value in more than one branch of the work\\". Mount Whitney, the highest mountain in the contiguous states was first discovered in July 1864 by Clarence King and Richard Cotter. After Cotter completed the mapping in Yosemite late 1864, he signed up to work on the Western Union Telegraph Expedition to British Columbia and Alaska, with the goal of providing a telegraph link from Asia through Alaska by way of Bering Strait. In 1866 Richard Cotter and J.T. Dyer made a very hazardous and successful exploration of the country between Norton Bay and the mouth of the Koyukuk River on the Yukon. The project was abandoned in July 1866, when completion of the submarine Transatlantic telegraph cable established a link from the United States to Europe. However, the public interest stimulated by the Alaskan project is credited with influencing the purchase of Alaska from the Russian Empire on March 30, 1867, for $7.2 million. Cotter then joined Clarence King on the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel in 1867, resigned after two years and settled in York just outside Helena, Montana. In 1875, he traveled to Washington Territory and kept a short diary.Richard D.

The Hejaz region was ruled as a kingdom under King Hussein bin Ali of the Hashemite family. The battle in Mecca resulted in a Hashemite defeat to the Saudis and the allied Ikhwan fighters.  Background  After the fall of the city of Ta'if to Ibn Saud in September 1924, King Hussein bin Ali fled from Mecca to Jeddah on 6 October 1924 on the advice of Hejazi notables and declared his son Ali bin Hussein the King of Hejaz. From Jeddah, Hussein was transported by the British to Aqaba by boat and later to Cyprus. The abdication only further emboldened Ibn Saud to march upon Mecca, entering the city of 5 December 1924. The abandonment of the city left behind a cache of weapons in the Qishla of Mecca which were recovered by Saudi forces.  Aftermath  Ibn Saud declared that Ali bin Hussein was to leave Hejaz as a pre-requisite for peace and that the invasion of Hejaz was to 'guarantee the liberty of pilgrimage and to settle the destiny of the Holy Land in a manner satisfactory to the Islamic world'. Following the capture of Mecca, Ali and the remaining Hejazi forces were concentrated in the port city of Jeddah which would later be besieged in January 1925 by the Saudi forces. The siege lasted until 16 December 1925 when, with British mediation, Sharif Ali surrendered and left the city for Baghdad. In the same month, Ibn Saud declared himself King of Hejaz in addition to Sultan of Nejd.

(2008). Bonellia viridis Rolando, 1821. In: Read, G.; Fauchald, K. (Ed.) (2016). World Polychaeta database. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=110363 on 2016-05-28 Distribution The species is wide-ranging, found in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Description The pale- to dark- green female, with a 15 cm-long, round or sausage-shaped body, lives on the sea-floor at a depth of 10 to 100 metres, concealed by burrowing in gravel or hiding in rock crevasses or burrows abandoned by other animals. It has two anchoring hooks underneath its body and an extensible feeding proboscis up to 10 times its body-length. It is mainly a detritivore, feeding also on small animals. The male is rarely observed: it has a flat, unpigmented body which grows to only 1‚Äì3 mm, taken up mostly by reproductive organs and devoid of other structures; it lives on or inside the body of a female.  Bonellin as a biocide  The adult Bonellia female produces a vivid green pigment in its skin, known as bonellin. This chemical, concentrated mostly in the proboscis, is highly toxic to other organisms, capable of paralyzing small animals. In the presence of light, bonellin is a very effective biocide, killing bacteria, larva of other organisms, and red blood cells in laboratory tests. It is currently being investigated as a possible model for novel antibiotics. Most larvae, however, come in contact with the bonellin in the skin of an adult female‚Äîits body or its roving, bonellin-rich proboscis‚Äîand are masculinised by this exposure. The chemical causes these larvae to develop into the tiny males, which cling to the female's body or are sucked inside it by the feeding tube, to spend the remainder of their lives inside her genital sac, producing sperm to fertilize her eggs, reliant on her for all other needs.Ludek Berec, Patrick J. Schembri, David S. Boukal (2005). Sex determination in Bonellia viridis (Echiura: Bonelliidae): population dynamics and evolution . Oikos 108 (3), 473‚Äì484 The sex of a green spoonworm is thus determined by external, environmental factors (the presence or absence of bonellin), not by internal, genetic factors (chromosomes), as is the case with most other sexually- differentiated organisms. This environmental sex determination helps green spoonworm populations respond to the availability of burrows.

It is competitive with the chloride process and the sulfate process, which achieve similar net conversions. With the idealized formula FeTiO3, ilmenite contains 55-65% titanium dioxide, the rest being iron oxide. The Becher process, like other beneficiation processes, aims to remove iron. The Becher process exploits the conversion of the ferrous iron (FeO) to ferric iron (Fe2O3).  History  This technology was developed in the early 1960s in Western Australia by a joint initiative between industry and government. The process was named after Robert Gordon Becher, who while working at the Western Australian Government Chemical Laboratories (the precursor to ChemCentre) invented, developed and introduced the technique to the Western Australian Mineral Sands industry. The process was patented in 1961.  Process  The Becher process is suitable for weathered ilmenite that has low concentrations of chromium and magnesium. There are four steps involved in removing the iron portion of the ilmentite: # Oxidation # Redox # Aeration # Leaching =Oxidation= Oxidation involves heating the ilmenite in a rotary kiln with air to convert iron to iron(III) oxide: : 4 FeTiO3 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí 2 Fe2O3*TiO2 \\\\+ 2 TiO2 This step is suitable for a range of ilmenite- containing feedstocks. =Reduction= Reduction is performed in a rotary kiln with pseudobrookite (Fe2O3.TiO2), coal, and sulfur, then heated to a temperature greater than 1200 ¬∞C. The iron oxide in the mineral grains is reduced to metallic iron to produce reduced ilmenite: : Fe2O3*TiO2 \\\\+ 3 CO ‚Üí 2 Fe + TiO2 \\\\+ 3 CO2 The \\"reduced ilmenite\\" is separated from the char prior to the next step. =Aeration= Aeration involves the removal of the metallic iron created in the last step by \\"rusting\\" it out. This conversion is achieved in large tanks that contain 1% ammonium chloride solution with air being pumped through the tank. The tank is being continuously agitated, and the iron will rust and precipitate in the form of a slime. : 4 Fe + 3 O2 ‚Üí 2 Fe2O3 The finer iron oxide is then separated from the larger particles of synthetic rutile. = Acid leach = Once the majority of the iron oxide has been removed the remainder of it is leached away using 0.5M sulfuric acid.

The founders were Saint Th√©r√®se Couderc and diocesan priest Jean-Pierre Etienne Terme. History The French Revolution had left people with a deeply disturbed faith, few religious leaders, and little, if any, education in faith. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, seminaries were being re-opened and mission bands roamed the countryside in an effort to rekindle the faith. Marie-Victoire-Th√©r√®se Couderc, who lived in the small hamlet of Le Mas in Sabli√®res, located in Southern France. In 1825, her father brought her home from school to participate with the rest of the family in a mission given at Sabli√®res. This mission was to be given by an energetic and zealous priest, Etienne Terme, who had recently founded a small group of teaching Sisters, called the Sisters of St. Regis. When Victoire revealed to him that she would like to enter religious life, he offered to take her to the novitiate of the Sisters of St. Regis. Although her father was unhappy with this prospect, he eventually relented, and Victoire entered the Sisters of St. Regis and became Sister Th√©r√®se.\\"Our Story\\", Cenacle Sisters The shrine of Saint John Francis Regis at Lalouvesc attracted large crowds. In 1826, Father Terme was distressed when he saw the disorder that often accompanied the pilgrimages. Since there was no suitable place for the women pilgrims to stay, he took the initiative and opened a hostel to welcome women and girls, entrusting it to some of the Sisters of Saint Regis. In 1828, Th√©r√®se Couderc was named Superior of the small congregation, and when Lalouvesc was made the mother house, she was named the Superior General. =Beginnings of the retreat ministry= At the hostel for women, the Sisters took in all who came to the door, and when they did not have enough beds, they spread straw in the corridors. Not only was the place crowded, but it was noisy and unruly. Mother Th√©r√®se approached Father Terme and told him that they could not live religious life in these circumstances. She managed, with a bit of difficulty it appears, to convince him that from then on, only those women who were willing to make their stay a time of serious prayer would be given lodging. The next step was when Father Terme introduced the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola, and the Sisters began using these to guide the women who came to the house to pray. Father Terme died in 1834 at the peak of his missionary activity. In his will he confided his \\"daughters of the Retreat\\" to the Fathers of the Society of Jesus, who continued the formation of the Sisters in Ignatian spirituality and the use of the Spiritual Exercises. The original inspiration matured and took a definite form. Gradually it became clear that the Congregation was evolving into one which reflected the spirit and mission of the community gathered with Mary the Mother of Jesus in the Upper Room, or Cenacle (Latin: coenaculum). The new institute grew rapidly and soon counted houses in France, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, and Holland.

He was a member of the Wanderers team that won the 1876 FA Cup Final. Career Edwards was born in Shrewsbury, educated at Shifnal Grammar School, and was a qualified solicitor, being admitted in 1871. He played from 1873 to 1880 for Shropshire Wanderers, of which he was a founder and captain, when they reached the semi-final tie of the FA Cup in 1874‚Äì75 and were defeated by the Old Etonians. He was called into the England side as a late replacement for another Shrewsbury-born player, John Wylie. He made his solitary England appearance on 7 March 1874 against Scotland, playing as an inside forward. After \\"a most competitive game\\", Scotland won 2‚Äì1, with Robert Kingsford scoring England's consolation goal. He was also a member of the Wanderers team, making his first appearance on 4 March 1874, scoring in a 4‚Äì0 victory over Westminster School. In 1876, he only made two appearances for Wanderers, both in the Cup Final when he played at centre forward against the Old Etonians. In the first match, played at Kennington Oval on 11 March 1876, Edwards scored the first goal, turning in a cross from Charles Wollaston.Gibbons pp. 46‚Äì47 The Old Etonians equalised through Alexander Bonsor, so the match went to a replay, which the Wanderers won 3‚Äì0, thus winning the trophy for the third time in five years. Edwards had been instrumental in helping to establish the Welsh Football Association, serving as its first treasurer in 1876. A week after the FA Cup Final replay, Edwards played for the Wales national team in their inaugural match, played at Hamilton Crescent, Partick on 25 March 1876.

He also played in representative matches for North Wales and Staffordshire. He captained the Shrewsbury Town team (not the present Shrewsbury Town F.C., formed 1886) from 1876 to 1880, during which time they won both the Birmingham Senior Cup and Shropshire County Cup in the 1877‚Äì78 season, two years before he ceased to play after a series of knee injuries. Edwards was for a time also on the committee of the Birmingham and District Football Association and a founder of the county F.A. for Shropshire in 1877.

It was founded in 1994 by Miyazaki Gakuen, a chartered educational corporation established in 1939. It has School of International Liberal Arts and School of Education. Miyazaki International College (MIC) School of International Liberal Arts, founded in 1994, was established under the MIC credo, \\"Respect and Diligence\\" for the purpose of cultivating truly international individuals. In April 2014, School of Education was established. Miyazaki International College, in addition to Miyazaki Gakuen Junior College, Miyazaki Gakuen High School and Miyazaki Gakuen Junior High School, and the Miyazaki Gakuen Junior College-Affiliated Midori Kindergarten and Kiyotake Midori Kindergarten, is sponsored by the Miyazaki Educational Institution (MEI), a chartered educational corporation established in 1939. School of International Liberal Arts is grounded in the social sciences and humanities, and emphasizing the study of worldwide human problems and issues in a spirit of collaboration, inquiry, and multicultural understanding. At the core of the academic program is a philosophy of active learning. This philosophy asserts that knowledge is not acquired merely through passive reading of texts or listening to lectures, but requires that students be actively engaged in reading, writing, discussing, and problem- solving. Through active learning students develop higher-order thinking skills that enable them to analyze, synthesize, evaluate, and create. Academic activities emphasize an international and comparative perspective and are designed to help students explore and be engaged in the improvement of communities both at home and abroad. Students learn a wide variety of liberal arts subjects in English. During the first three semesters of this sheltered immersion system, most classes are team-taught by a specialist in EFL and a specialist in the content area. Classes meet for six hours per week. Students learn the basic concepts and methods of the subject area and, at the same time, build English skills. Classes in English, Japanese, the Humanities, Social Sciences, and General Science use cooperative learning, small-groups, and active learning techniques to help students get used to studying in English and to build thinking skills. Motivated students with a wide range of English proficiencies succeed in the MIC program, partly because of its small classes and high student/faculty ratio (8.4:1). An Advanced Placement Program is available for students with very high English proficiency. In the third semester, students study Japanese and foreign cultures and prepare for study abroad. Team-teaching continues and developing thinking skills remains an important factor as students' English proficiency increases. In the fourth semester, students spend a whole semester at a university in an English- speaking country. The MIC Study Abroad Program is a required study and cross- cultural experience for all students. This study abroad experience gives students the chance to improve their English fluency, gain confidence in their ability to communicate with people from diverse cultures, and develop independence of thought and action. In the third and fourth years, students focus on a major in courses taught by a highly qualified international faculty, about 80% from outside Japan. Students write a senior thesis of 6500-words or more in English.

Caruso played the comical character of the Native American \\"Red Cloud\\" on the 1965 Get Smart episode \\"Washington 4, Indians 3\\". In 1970, Caruso made a guest appearance on the ABC crime drama The Silent Force in the episode \\"A Family Tradition.\\" In 1974, he appeared in the final episode, entitled \\"The Fire Dancer,\\" of the ABC police drama Nakia. Family, personal life, and death Caruso met his future wife, Tonia at the Alcazar Theater in 1939 in San Francisco, when the play she was in was closing and the play he was in was opening. In stark contrast to his screen image, Caruso was the consummate family man in private life, happily married for 63 years, and enjoying the simple pleasures of gardening and cooking. He was the father of son, Tonio, and daughter, Tina.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0142273/bio Caruso died three days before his 87th birthday in Brentwood in Los Angeles, California. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.

Larger metered taxi companies i.e. Sunlight Radio Cab, RB Premier Taxi Sdn. Bhd., Uptownace (M) Sdn. Bhd., Laluan Emas Sdn. Bhd,. Insan Lemak Sdn. Bhd. and Innovasi Timur Orange Taxi Cab are more likely to charge passengers using meter; although they are still owned and managed by individual taxi drivers. Newer companies such as Swift Limousine & Cab owns and controls their vehicles with ensures all drivers have rigorous background checks. An alternative option is to use secure taxi booking apps like Grab or TaxiMonger. Drivers are certified safe and all will use taxi-meters. The app will also allow you to contact the assigned driver directly and track his whereabouts on a real time map . In a June 2008 survey conducted by Malaysian expatriate magazine The Expat on an estimated 200 foreigners from 30 countries, Malaysia's taxis were found to rank the lowest among the 23 countries in terms of quality, courtesy, availability and expertise. The behaviour of the offending taxi drivers has tarnished the image of Malaysia, particularly among foreign tourist, to the point some have begun resorting to paying for upscale taxis that are more expensive but operate with better service.

As of February 2008, the Alliance represents 16,000 students in Germany alone (additional numbers in Austria and Switzerland not stated at de.Wikipedia.org as of March 1, 2008).  History  = Prior to and during the First World War, 1853--1918 = The process of forging an alliance of Catholic students' corporations began in 1863, when several couleur-wearing ones (Farbentragende katholische Studentenverbindungen) independently prepared an inter-association group under the initial title Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen; the organization suffered schism in its first year. In 1865, a successful a new, non-couleur-wearing alliance under the present name was incorporated at Berlin twelve years to the day after the Katholische Leseverein was incorporated. The initial association consisted of five non- couleur-wearing student corporations (Nichtfarbentragende katholische Studentenvereine): the K.St.V. Askania-Burgundia Berlin, established November 29, 1853 as the Katholische Leseverein, at Humboldt-Universit√§t, Berlin; the K.St.V. Unitas-Breslau, established March 4, 1863, at Universitas Wratislaviensis, Breslau, Lower Silesia (Wroc≈Çaw, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Poland, from 1945); the K.St.V. Arminia Bonn, established November 6, 1863, at Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t, Bonn, North Rhine-Westphalia; the K.St.V. Germania, established March 7, 1864, at Westf√§lische Wilhelms- Universit√§t, M√ºnster, North Rhine-Westphalia; and the K.St.V. Walhalla W√ºrzburg, established 1864, at Julius-Maximilians-Universit√§t, W√ºrzburg, Franconia. In 1865, the Kartellverband commenced its work in the intellectual, religious and cultural areas of the German society of the period. The same year saw the Kartellverband's first major adversity: a multilateral inquiry into the doctrine of Papal infallibility. The Cultural Struggle, a heavy burden on its member corporations, actually served to promote the Kartellverband to the point where, as of 1914, the Kartellverband had fifty- one (51) member Student corporations. = During the Weimar Republic, 1919-- 1932 = After the Peace of Versailles, the Kartellverband's ranks swelled with returning war veterans, resulting in the establishment of numerous additional corporations including the Katholische √ñsterreichere Studentenvereine at Vienna and Graz, Austria. By 1921, an Alumni Board (Philisterausschu√ü, lit., \\"Philistine outshoot\\") was elected after much debate within the Kartellverband, the individual Studentenvereine having established alumni's unions (Philistervereine) from 1913; the principle of federal life governed the Board. From 1930, membership declined as a consequence of the economic crisis that started with the mass stock sell-off at the New York Stock Exchange on October 29, 1929. = During the Nazi Regime, 1932--1945 = The Kartellverband faced a triple whammy that eventually resulted in forcible decorporation on July 6, 1938 under the Verbot der Korporationsverb√§nde: Misjudgment of the totalitarian regime of Adolf Hitler, misinformation and deliberate Nazi deception. In March 1933, the Catholic bishops' resistance to the Nazi power grab weakened, and with it the will of the Studentenvereine to fight; the conclusion of the Reichskonkordat finished both off. Several corporations resisted, but were unable to halt the Kartellverband's collapse. At the start of the Nazi regime, the corporations, that were not prohibited, were held for enlargement of their directors' boards. On September 1, 1933 at Frankfurt am Main, the Kartellverband was merged into the Ring katholischer deutscher Burschenschaften, despite objections from within, over the fact that a \\"color-carrying\\" and a \\"non-coleur-wearing\\" board had been combined; and from without, as the Deutsche Burschenschaft accused the RKDB of name infringement. The merger did not last long. On July 10, 1933, the Studentenvereine in Austria severed ties with the Alliance on account of Austro-German tensions at the time, and incorporated an √ñsterreichischer Cartellverband; the Kartellverband katholischer nichtfarbentragender akademischer Vereinigungen √ñsterreichs incorporated July 22 of the same year. Both Kartellverb√§nde were forcibly decorporated on June 20, 1938 in the wake of the Nazi invasion and annexation of Austria (Anschlu√ü √ñsterreiches). = 1945--present = The Alliance was reincorporated immediately after the end of the Nazi regime. Many Kartellverband alumni were directly involved in the fledgeling government of the Federal Republic of Germany, newly incorporated in 1946, emerging at all Minister positions and the Federal Chancellory (Bundeskanzleramt). At the Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht), the Kartellverband was involved in the establishment of the liberal democratic basic order (Freiheitlich-demokratische Grundordnung), with Gebhard M√ºller as Chief Justice and Ernst-Wolfgang B√∂ckenf√∂rde and Paul Kirchhof as Associate Justices. From 1968, the Kartellverband reorganized from the ground up, the primary innovation being the capacities of the member Students' Unions, in certain cases composed of non-Catholic Christians. The Kartellverband is a member of the Labor-Congress of Catholic Associations (Arbeitsgemeinschaft katholischer Verb√§nde) and the Labor-Congress of Catholic Student Associations (Arbeitsgemeinschaft katholischer Studentenverb√§nde).

At some point in the 19th century, folklore began to describe it as an independent Republic. (Lain√© is mentioned as \\"Lal***,\\" but his name is known elsewhere, cf. ) Noted for its centenarians, one pensioner was reported to have reached the age of 123, although this is unconfirmed.  Geography  1853 view of Goust and the Pont d'Enfer Goust is located on the territory of the commune of Laruns. It occupies one square mile on a plateau at the southern (upper) end of the valley of the Gave d'Ossau in the Western Pyrenees, across the river from Eaux-Chaudes. At an elevation of 995 m/3264 ft, it is accessible only by a narrow mountain footpath across the Pont d'Enfer (\\"Bridge of Hell\\"). The nearest town is Laruns in the valley below. The community is made up of 10-12 households, with a population fluctuating between 50 and 150 residents. The traditional economy was based on animal husbandry, wool, and silk production, augmented more recently by tourism. All baptisms, weddings, and burials are performed at the Catholic Church in Laruns. Due to its isolated situation, the inhabitants of Goust evolved a curious funeral custom: the deceased was placed in a coffin and sent down the mountainside via a specially-constructed chute, to be collected at the bottom for burial in the Laruns cemetery.  History  Artist's rendering of Goust and its ruined \\"City of the Hills\\" (1899) Jean-Fran√ßois Samazeuilh (1858) attributes the claims of Goust's independence to an 1827 description by the former French Minister of the Interior Joseph Lain√©. Samazeuilh says that Lain√© was speaking metaphorically when he labeled Goust a \\"republic,\\" and that other writers took this literally (\\"on a pris au s√©rieux cette fantaisie du spirituel √©crivain\\"). He then provides a long quotation from the Album Pyr√©n√©en which demonstrates the fallacy of this interpretation‚Äîfor example, the residents of Goust pay taxes to the government in Laruns. In the late 19th century however, newspapers from the United States mention Goust and goings on in the ‚ÄúRepublic.‚Äù One of them is the story that in 1896 the authorities proclaimed a ban on publication of any newspaper without executive authorization, which led to an uprising of the citizens.\\"Smallest Republic in the World,\\" Dallas Morning News, August 15, 1896, p 8 See also *Longevity claims  References  =Further reading=  (A reprint of Lain√©) * Despourrins, Cyprien (1844), Itin√©raire de Pau aux Eaux-Bonnes et aux Eaux- Chaudes.

In 2006 he began writing new material and rehearsing with drummer Scott Gursky of Shortstack and guitarist Sohrab Habibion, formerly of Edsel. They rehearsed with a third guitar player, but instead added bassist Greg Simpson. Obits made their live debut on January 12, 2008 at a club on New York's Lower East Side called the Cake Shop. A bootleg recording of the show circulated on the internet, and the band posted two of the songs from this recording on their MySpace profile for listening. The recordings caught the attention of Sub Pop A&R; representative Chris Jacobs, who invited them to perform at the label's twentieth anniversary festival in Seattle that summer. Obits signed to Sub Pop shortly after, but released their debut single \\"One Cross Apiece\\" / \\"Put It in Writing\\" on their own Stint Records imprint. The band's debut album I Blame You was released by Sub Pop on March 24, 2009. Explaining the length of time between the band's formation and recording, Froberg explained that \\"We wanted to take a, not a relaxed approach, but we wanted to take our time. We weren't in a hurry. We didn't know what would be the result. We didn't know if we were going to put records out. We just wanted to make something happen. We're pleased with what's gone on so far. It's been pretty cool. We try to keep things slow-paced.\\" Critical reception to the album was generally positive, with Allmusic reviewer Mark Deming stating that \\"if I Blame You isn't going redefine the way we look at rock & roll, it confirms that the word on these guys wasn't wrong ‚Äî the Obits are a very good band\\", but also noting that \\"the Obits might just have the stuff to save rock & roll, or at least keep it off life support for a while, but as good as I Blame You may be, they're going to have to get their songwriting chops in order before they can really finish the job.\\" Jason Crock of Pitchfork Media compared the album to Froberg's past bands, stating that \\"while there's evidence of growth here, there's not enough change to alienate fans. If they can appreciate a little less mania and a little more melody, I Blame You will be a comfortable fit\\" and calling it \\"probably Froberg's most melodic and diverse record.\\" A second single, \\"I Can't Lose\\" / \\"Military Madness\\", was released April 18, 2009 in conjunction with the Record Store Day event. Obits toured North America's east coast in April and west coast in May of that year. Obits' second album, Moody, Standard and Poor, was released March 29, 2011, and the band toured the United States' Midwest and East Coast, including playing the 2011 South by Southwest festival. Froberg hopes that, unlike his previous bands, Obits will have more longevity: \\"Since we're getting older maybe we can grow old into this music. We'll see.\\" Scott Gursky left Obits in May 2011 and was replaced by Girls Against Boys drummer Alexis Fleisig. The third Obits album, Bed and Bugs, was released on September 10, 2013 On April 1, 2015, the band announced they were splitting up on their Instagram account, later confirming this was not an April Fools' Day joke. Later that year, Habibion and Simpson joined a new band, SAVAK. Froberg designed their debut album's artwork. Musical style Obits' music is a blend of indie rock and garage punk. Mark Deming of Allmusic describes their sound as \\"taut, straightforward rock & roll with sharply interwoven guitar lines, muscular rhythms, and a melodic sense that splits the difference between indie rock and garage-influenced punk\\": > Froberg and Habibion make an impressive tag-team combo on guitars, and their > interwoven six-string patterns crackle with energy as they bounce thick, > bluesy chording off lean, angular lines like a steak meeting a sharp knife. > Bassist Greg Simpson and drummer Gursky are just the right rhythm section > for this band, locking the songs into place with taut efficiency while > leaving room to thoughtfully fill up the spaces when need be. Put 'em > together and they run like a top, laying out music with the clean lines of > the Ventures and the pure mania of Radio Birdman. Jason Crock of Pitchfork Media describes the band's sound as \\"dueling guitars that have refined the echo and twang of surf and rockabilly into a sharp edge, basslines that are less walking than swaggering, drums too respectful and too evil for elaborate fills.\\" Members =Current members= *Rick Froberg ‚Äì guitar, vocals (2006‚Äìpresent) *Greg Simpson ‚Äì bass guitar (2006‚Äìpresent) *Sohrab Habibion ‚Äì guitar, vocals (2006‚Äìpresent) *Alexis Fleisig ‚Äì drums (2011‚Äìpresent) =Former members= *Scott Gursky ‚Äì drums (2006‚Äì2011) Discography =Albums= * I Blame You (2009) * Moody, Standard and Poor (2011) * Bed and Bugs (2013) =Singles= * \\"One Cross Apiece\\" / \\"Put It in Writing\\" (2008) * \\"I Can't Lose\\" / \\"Military Madness\\" (2009) * \\"Let Me Dream If I Want To\\" / \\"The City Is Dead\\" (2012) * \\"Refund\\" / \\"Suez Canal\\" (2012) * \\"Refund (Live)\\" / \\"Talking to the Dog (Live)\\" / \\"New August (Live)\\" (2013, 7\\" vinyl) = Compilations = * L.E.G.I.T.

Sch√∂nberg Ensemble  The Sch√∂nberg Ensemble was founded in 1974 by students and former students of the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. Their original repertoire consisted only of the chamber music of composers of the Second Viennese School. Afterwards, the repertoire was expanded to the entire twentieth (and twenty-first) century. A large number of Dutch and foreign composers wrote works specifically for the Sch√∂nberg Ensemble. Concerts were given with constantly changing combinations of players, as contemporary classical repertoire often requires unusual combinations of instruments. If a larger ensemble was required, the ensemble joined with the Asko Ensemble. The Sch√∂nberg Ensemble was based in the Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ in Amsterdam, where the ensemble gave regular concerts. In addition, they also played regularly at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and several other venues in the Netherlands. The ensemble toured almost all of the countries of Europe, and also Canada, the United States, India, and Japan.  Merger  After performing and recording together many times, the Asko Ensemble and the Sch√∂nberg Ensemble merged on 1 September 2008 to become Asko|Sch√∂nberg, with Reinbert de Leeuw as conductor.

A son of Shinko King, C'est La Guerre was trained in Wanganui by part-owner Kevin Myers, who deserves plenty of the credit for the horse's Derby triumph. Myers trained and placed the horse brilliantly throughout the Derby campaign, having the horse at his absolute peak on Derby day after raising some eyebrows with a route that was unconventional to say the least. As the horse passed the finish line in the Derby, the astute trainer was vindicated as commentator George Simon labelled him a \\"deadset genius\\". C'est La Guerre had his first start at Woodville on 22 October, winning a maiden three-year-old event over 1400m comfortably. In mid- November he appeared again, this time in a premier-quality race during New Zealand Cup Week at Riccarton Park, and again impressively won over 1400m. After the perfect start to his career, things went slightly wrong in his Derby campaign. In his next start at Awapuni he was blocked 250m from home when making what looked like potentially a winning late run, and suffered the same fate in the Group 2 Great Northern Guineas on Boxing Day when finishing 2.9 lengths behind Prince Kaapstad (who two months later was runner-up to C'est La Guerre in the Derby). As a result, he had an 8th and a 7th in his formline that did no justice to the horse's performances. He went back to his winning way at Hastings on 25 January, and then somewhat surprisingly was taken to the country track Wairoa for his next start on 13 February. His win in the $20,000 Wairoa Cup was disturbingly narrow for a Derby contender, but in hindsight the horse was probably well short of the peak he eventually reached on 1 March. With another run over distance (for second against older horses at Otaki) under his belt, he travelled to Ellerslie for the Derby and was rated a $15 chance. That dropped to $10 when there was some substantial rain on the morning of the race, as he had proven himself to be proficient on rain- affected ground earlier in his career. Given a perfect ride by regular rider David Walker, C'est La Guerre exploded to the lead early in the home straight and raced clear of Prince Kaapstad and Fritzy Boy, passing the line with ears pricked four lengths clear of the runner-up. It was a spectacular performance against a field rated among the best Derby fields in recent years. C'est La Guerre's first run since the Derby was in another unusual race, finishing second over 1400m in an $11,000 open handicap at another country track in Blenheim. Ironically, the following day saw two horses who were unplaced in the New Zealand Derby, Nom du Jeu and Red Ruler, quinella the Australian Derby on a wet track. He was then sold to LLoyd Williams, the owner of 2007 Melbourne Cup winner Efficient, and moved to the Melbourne stable of John Sadler. C'est La Guerre's first run in Australia was in the Memsie Stakes at Caulfield, in which he finished seventh behind Weekend Hussler. The run was good enough for some people to suggest he would be a Melbourne Cup contender for 2008. Two subsequent starts produced a disappointing run in the JRA Cup and a fast-finishing fourth in the Yalumba Stakes. In his last run before the Melbourne Cup, he caught the eye with his late finish when running sixth in the Cox Plate. In the 2008 Melbourne Cup, ridden by Brett Prebble he finished strongly down the outside to finish third behind Viewed and Bauer. C'est La Guerre ran eighth in the 2009 Melbourne Cup. Returning in the spring of 2010, he won his second start back in the Craven Plate at Randwick, giving him is first Australian victory. He is set to contest his third Melbourne Cup in 2010.

He is known for his activism against nuclear proliferation of the Middle East Review of and for his endorsement of the Greater Israel cause. Biography Eliezer Liebenstein (later Livneh) was born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in the Russian Empire (now Poland) in 1902, but his family moved to Rostov-on-Don at the outbreak of World War I. In 1920, he immigrated to Palestine and worked as a road builder. He then joined Ahdut HaAvoda and in 1923 he was elected Secretary of the Haifa Workers Council. That year he also joined Kibbutz Ein Harod, of which he would be a member for many years. He was the Haavara emissary to Germany from 1928 to 1930 and again from 1933 to 1935, seeking to encourage immigration to Palestine and transfer of assets. His experiences of the Nazi rise to power made him an opponent of totalitarian regimes of any kind, including that of Joseph Stalin, which was popular among many in the proletarian movement. Between 1937 and 1939 he studied in England. Journalism and literary career After the outbreak of World War II he became a propagandist for the Haganah and Mapai and was the founder (with Galili and Gershon Rivlin) and editor of Maarachot (meaning both \\"systems\\" and \\"military campaigns\\"), a newspaper on military affairs, in 1939. In 1940 he published another newspaper, Ashnav (\\"porthole\\") with Berl Katznelson. Edited by Livneh, it became the voice of the \\"activist\\" faction of Mapai for seven years until it went too far by publishing an obituary listing the names of Dov Gruner, Yehiel Drezner and Eliezer Kashani‚ÄîIrgun members who became Olei Hagardom in April 1947‚Äîalongside Haganah casualties who were killed during the illegal immigration activities. Published a few months after the King David Hotel Bombing and shortly after the disbandment of the Jewish Resistance Movement, the analogy between Irgun and Haganah casualties was unacceptable to the Haganah and resulted in the closing of Ashnav. He founded and edited a more successful journal, Beterem (\\"before\\"), from 1942 to 1960. He was also known for his oratory and was active in both Kol Jerusalem, the Mandate authorities operated radio station, and Kol Israel, Haganah's illegal radio station, in which he was also an editor. In addition to writing several books, he was also an editor of the Encyclopedia Hebraica as an expert on Jerusalem, Zionism, Socialism, and Russian history. Political career A few days before the Provisional State Council's Declaration of Independence of 12 May 1948, he was sent by David Ben-Gurion to Menachem Begin to tell him he and his men would be subject to Ben-Gurion's government, to which Begin consented. After the establishment of the State of Israel, he was elected for Mapai to the first and second Knessets, and was a member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. He supported the dispersion of the population, giving preference to the periphery rather than the center area. He was among the activist members of the party, taking an ardent pro-American stand in the struggle against Mapam, regarding Israel's relation with the United States and the Soviet Union. When MK Yaakov Hazan said that the USSR is his second homeland, Livneh said command positions are not to be put in the hands of people with more than one homeland. In 1952 he was reprimanded by Foreign Minister Abba Eban for meeting with the Pakistani ambassador at the United Nations. Before the elections to the third Knesset, he was reported to have purchased a relatively luxurious apartment in Kiryat Hayovel, Jerusalem, and was scolded by his party for deviating from the modest behavior policy. He was not elected, but remained active in the party secretariat until 13 November 1957. In 1959 he founded the \\"New Government\\" Movement with Shmuel Tamir and Yeshayahu Leibowitz, which sought to undermine Mapai's dominance in Israeli politics, but resigned from the Movement in 1960. Those days also saw the formation of Israel's nuclear policy. Supporters of Israel's nuclear plan, headed by Ben-Gurion along with Shimon Peres and Ernst David Bergmann, acted behind the scenes to promote the program. Against them, Livneh and Leibowitz formed The Committee for Denuclearization of the Middle East. When Israel's nuclear activities were exposed in The New York Times in December 1960, he was joined by several members of the Nuclear Energy Committee, who resigned when Israel's cooperation with France made the Atomic project practical. The committee argued that Israel's security relies not on the attainment of a nuclear bomb but rather on the nuclear proliferation of the entire region. It was also argued that attaining a nuclear bomb would cause an intensified Arab effort to attain one as well, thus resulting in a balance of terror that might jeopardize the Zionist enterprise. The committee acted behind the scenes and led to a quiet discussion on the issue among several of the members of the big parties, including Levi Eshkol, who replaced Ben-Gurion in 1963, and other party leaders such as Haim-Moshe Shapira of the National Religious Party, Pinchas Rosen of the Liberal party, Yaakov Hazan and Mordechai Bentov of Mapam and Ahdut HaAvoda men Yisrael Galili and Yigal Allon. Allon was particularly attentive to the committee and was considered its loyal supporter in the government. The committee ceased its activities after the Six-Day War. According to Avner Cohen, its term of operation was the closest thing in Israeli history to public democratic debate on nuclear policy. Prior to the Six Day War, he wrote in Haaretz: \\"It is more than the Strait of Tiran that is at issue now. What is at issue is the existence or nonexistence of the Jewish people. We must crush the machinations of the new Hitler at the outset, when it is still possible to crush them and survive. ... Neither the world nor the Jews believed in the sincerity of Hitler's declarations. ... Nasser's fundamental strategy is the same as Hitler.\\" After the war, he was one of the founders of the Movement for Greater Israel, in which he was active for the rest of his life. His last book, Israel and the Crisis of Western Civilization promoted a return to original Jewish culture instead of the Western one. His book On the Road to Elon Moreh‚ÄîZionism on the path of Emunim was released posthumously by Gush Emunim publishing.

He was responsible for translating many works of Bengali and Sanskrit literature into Meitei (Meiteilon). He also wrote Meetei poetry. Angom Gopi had also translated Parikshit of the Mahabharata by Gangadas Sen from Bengali. He had also translated Uttara Kanda. In the years that followed Yubaraja Nabananda had translated Virat Parva of Ram Krishnadas from Bengali. This was followed by the translation of Gangadas Sen's Aswamedha Parva from the Mahabharata written in Bengali into Meitei by Longjam Parshuram in the last part of 18th century. Another landmark in translation during this period was the translation of Govinda Mishra Pandit's Srimad Bhagavat Gita, originally in Bengali, by Parshuram. It is said that the Meitei version of the Bible was published at Serampore (West Bengal) in 1824. The language used in these translation works is Old Meitei interlarded with Sanskrit, which is very beautiful and is in verse form. However, the words used by Parshuram to express the spiritual and eternal matters are mostly Sanskrit and Bengali which are very hard to understand by the common people. He was working in the court of King Pamheiba (1709 - 1748 AD).

It is an improvement on the Paul‚ÄìBunnell test. The test is specific for heterophile antibodies produced by the human immune system in response to EBV infection. Commercially available test kits are 70‚Äì92% sensitive and 96‚Äì100% specific, with a lower sensitivity in the first two weeks after clinical symptoms begin. The United States Center for Disease Control deems the monospot test to not be very useful. Medical uses It is indicated as a confirmatory test when a physician suspects EBV, typically in the presence of clinical features such as fever, malaise, pharyngitis, tender lymphadenopathy (especially posterior cervical; often called \\"tender glands\\") and splenomegaly.Davidson's Principles & Practices of Medicine 20th ed In the case of delayed or absent seroconversion, an immunofluorescence test could be used if the diagnosis is in doubt. It has the following characteristics: VCAs (Viral Capsid Antigen) of the IgM class, antibodies to EBV early antigen (anti-EA), absent antibodies to EBV nuclear antigen (anti-EBNA) =Usefulness= One source states that the specificity of the test is high, virtually 100%,Infectious Mononucleosis Workup from Medscape. Author: Burke A Cunha, MD; Chief Editor: Michael Stuart Bronze, MD. Updated: Sep 21, 2011 Another source states that a number of other conditions can cause false positives. Rarely, however, a false positive heterophile antibody test may result from systemic lupus erythematosus, toxoplasmosis, rubella, lymphoma and leukemia. However, the sensitivity is only moderate, so a negative test does not exclude EBV. This lack of sensitivity is especially the case in young children, many of whom will not produce the heterophile antibody at any stage and thus have a false negative test result. =Timing= It will generally not be positive during the 4‚Äì6 week incubation period before the onset of symptoms. The highest amount of heterophile antibodies occurs 2 to 5 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Review Date 3/13/2016 If positive, it will remain so for at least six weeks. Revised 06/15/2016 An elevated heterophile antibody level may persist up to 1 year. Process The test relies on the agglutination of horse erythrocytes by heterophile antibodies in patient serum. Heterophile means it reacts with proteins across species lines.heterophil‚ÄîDefinitions from Dictionary.com Heterophile also can mean that it is an antibody that reacts with antigens other than the antigen that stimulated it (an antibody that crossreacts). A 20% suspension of horse red cells is used in an isotonic 3‚Äì8% sodium citrate formulation. One drop of the patient's serum to be tested is mixed on an opal glass slide with one drop of a particulate suspension of guinea-pig kidney stroma, and a suspension of ox red cell stroma; sera and suspensions are mixed with a wooden applicator 10 times. Ten micro liters of the horse red cell suspension are then added and mixed with each drop of adsorbed serum. The mixture is left undisturbed for one minute (not rocked or shaken). Examine for the presence or absence of red cell agglutination. If stronger with the sera adsorbed with guinea-pig kidney, the test is positive. If stronger with the sera adsorbed with ox red cell stroma, the test is negative. If agglutination is absent in both mixtures, the test is negative. A known 'positive' and 'negative' control serum is tested with each batch of test sera.

Big D (Derek Haskins) is married with two sons and spent time as an exchange student in Russia. He originally from Cookeville, Tennessee.BigDandBubba.com/Cast Big D is a married father of two, and a licensed airplane pilot . Bubba (Sean Powell) grew up in Houma, Louisiana, and like Big D, also started on the radio at age 14. He has spent time working for radio stations around the country, and the island of Guam. Bubba is married with three children and is also a licensed pilot. History Big D and Bubba first teamed up in December 16, 1996 on WXCT (now WTGE) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The show gained enough success to garner the attention of cross-town country rival WYNK-FM. In February 1999, Big D and Bubba signed a deal with AMFM Broadcasting (then owner of WYNK) to do mornings on the station and have the ability to syndicate the show nationally. No country morning show had ever been successful in a nationally syndicated format for an extended period of time. Soon after their debut on WYNK, AMFM Broadcasting was purchased by Clear Channel Communications, a forerunner to iHeartMedia, Inc.. In August 1999, Big D and Bubba hired Patrick Thomas to produce their morning show. He was brought on board in anticipation of future syndication opportunities and is still with the show to this day. Patrick's involvement with the show has evolved over the years, and he oversees day-to-day operation of Silverfish Media, the parent company of Big D & Bubba. On December 6, 1999, Big D and Bubba were first heard on KMML-FM in Amarillo, Texas. This marked the beginning of syndication. The show grew slowly but steadily while fighting the widely held belief that a syndicated country morning show simply would not work. By the summer of 2003, the Big D and Bubba Show was heard on 14 radio stations (more than any other country morning show). In the fall of 2003, Clear Channel Communications relocated Big D and Bubba to Nashville, Tennessee and based their show on radio station WSIX in order to be at the center of the country music format. In September 2005, Big D and Bubba signed a syndication deal with Premiere Radio Networks. On November 22, 2011, Big D & Bubba ended their broadcast on WSIX to concentrate on their syndication. This move set plans in motion for their eventual departure from the corporate radio world, and fulfilling a dream to become their own bosses. In September 2013, Big D and Bubba announced that they were leaving Premiere Networks to form their own production company called Silverfish Media. They signed a partnership deal with Compass Media Networks to distribute the show, sell advertising, and license the show to affiliates. In January 2016, \\"Carsen\\" became the show's first female cast member. She remains with the show today, and is currently the Director of Programming for all of Silverfish Media's properties.

It is one of the largest parties active in the province of Balochistan, Pakistan along with Balochistan National Party. It traces its legacy from the Kalat State National Party of Mir Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, Mir Gul Khan Nasir and Mir Abdul Aziz Kurd, and is currently headed by Abdul Malik Baloch. Founding N.P was established in October 2003 when the non-tribal, essentially middle- class Balochistan National Democratic Party (BNDP) led by Mir Hasil Khan Bizenjo, son of the Baloch nationalist Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, merged with the non-tribal middle-class nationalist party Balochistan National Movement (BNM) led by Dr. Abdul Hayee Baloch. It is considered to be the successor of the Kalat National Party. Abdul Hayee Baloch became the first chairman of the National Party and Mir Hasil Khan Bizenjo became the secretary general of the new party. In 2008, Abdul Malik Baloch was elected as the party president, and was the Chief Minister of Balochistan between 2013 and 2015. Electoral history =Election boycott= The party boycotted the 2008 general elections as a protest against the military operation being conducted in the province at the time.

Chaumet is a jewellery and watchmaking designer founded in 1780 by Marie-√âtienne Nitot. Fourteen artisans ply their trade in the workshop on Place Vend√¥me under the direction of foreman Pascal Bourdariat. As of 2012, it was owned by LVMH. History = Nitot Period (1780‚Äì1815) = Marie-√âtienne Nitot (1750‚Äì1809) settled in Paris in 1780 after having served his apprenticeship at Aubert, then jeweller to Queen Marie-Antoinette. His aristocratic clientele remained loyal to him until the French Revolution in 1789. It was after this that the Nitot jewellery house really took off, becoming the official jeweller of Napoleon I in 1802. With the help of his son Fran√ßois Regnault (1779‚Äì1853), Nitot created the jewellery that would offer the French Empire splendour and power. The jewellery for Napoleon's wedding to Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, and later to Marie Louise de Habsburg-Lorraine, was created by Nitot. He designed and set Napoleon's coronation crown, the hilt of his sword as well as many other pieces for the court. Fran√ßois Regnault Nitot took over his father's jewellery house on his death in 1809 and continued his activity until the fall of the Empire in 1815. Napoleon's exile caused Nitot, a fervent royalist, to withdraw from the jewellery house, selling the business to his foreman, Jean Baptiste Fossin (1786‚Äì1848). =Fossin and Morel Periods (1815‚Äì1885)= Assisted by his son Jules (1808‚Äì1869), Fossin elegantly interpreted romantic jewellery pieces inspired by the arts of the Italian Renaissance and the French 18th century, but also naturalist-themed pieces. The elite of the period were won over and the family of Louis-Philippe, King of France from 1830 to 1848, as well as the Duchesse de Berry, succeeded Napoleon on the list of famous clients of what was to become Chaumet. They included personalities such as Anatole Demidoff, a Russian prince married to Napoleon's niece, Princess Mathilde Bonaparte, as well as many painters, sculptors and writers, both French and foreign. After the French revolution of 1848, the activity of Maison Fossin slowed significantly in France, leading to the establishment of a boutique in London with a workshop entrusted to Jean-Valentin Morel (1794‚Äì1860) assisted by his son Prosper, who was born in 1825. They attracted a prestigious clientele which included Queen Victoria, who granted Jean-Valentin Morel a royal warrant. At the London World's Fair of 1851, Morel resumed the enamelling tradition of the 16th and 17th centuries and produced hardstone goblets with enamelled mountshttp://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bec_0373-6237_2005_num_163_1_463613?_Prescripts_Search_tabs1=standard& =Chaumet Art Deco Period (1885‚Äì1944)= In 1885, Joseph Chaumet (1852‚Äì1928) married Marie, the daughter of Prosper Morel, thus taking control of the House. The Renaissance style was still used, in particular for tiaras, very much in vogue at the time, which Chaumet would make one of its specialities; but Chaumet also drew inspiration from Japanese art, which was gaining popularity in jewellery design at the time. In 1907, the workshops and boutique were set up at 12 place Vend√¥me, which they would never leave. Marcel Chaumet (1886‚Äì1964) succeeded his father Joseph in 1928, at the height of the Art Deco period. The jewellery house participated in the 1925 Exposition des Arts D√©coratifs in Paris, becoming a leader in this trend. Jewellery was more geometric, following the 'boyish style' of the 1920s, becoming more feminine during the 1930s. Colours, materials and fine gems were imperative for jewellery. From the 1920s onwards, the renown of the jewellery house spread to the world of the arts and show business. In 1934, Maison Chaumet sponsored the establishment of the young jeweller Pierre Sterl√©, who was already designing its jewellery. In the same year the House closed, only to re-open at the end of the Second World War http://www.inezstodel.com/index.jsp?USMID=50 The Chaumet Dynasty =Chaumet Period: resurgence of the brand (1944‚Äì1987)= In the wake of the post-war years, Chaumet stood out as a precursor, embodying the taste and creativity of the Parisian woman. Chaumet adapted the 'New Look' of the pioneers Christian Dior and Yves Saint Laurent, attracting the fashionable women of the time. In 1958, the sons of Marcel Chaumet, Jacques and Pierre, were appointed executive directors of the House. They took over the Breguet brand in 1970. Fran√ßois Bodet, a Maison Chaumet executive, renewed the brand and positioned Breguet in the high-end watchmaking segment.http://www.lacotedesmontres.com/No_209.htm&URL;=la-saga-des-montres- breguet-No_209.htm The 1970s were marked by originality and unconventional combinations, such as pairings of diamonds, coral and peridot mounted on yellow gold. The Lien ring, a circle encompassed by a gold loop in the centre, was created in 1977 by Ren√© Morin. In the 1980s, diamonds were added to the base and the ring was produced in white gold with a double circle. In the mid-1990s, the Lien became a cross, before making way in 2002 for a Lien set with diamonds. A 'Premiers Liens' collection was launched in 2007, in yellow, white and pink gold versions. In the 1980s, Ren√© Morin, the artistic director, used his varied influences to promote the resurgence of precious objects. Having joined Chaumet in 1962, Morin famously created a bull's head from a block of lapis lazuli.http://www.sothebys.com/en/catalogues/ecatalogue.html/2008/european- silver-gold-boxes-and-objects-of-vertu- pf8013#/r=/en/ecat.fhtml.PF8013.html+r.m=/en/ecat.lot.PF8013.html/109/+r.o=/en/ecat.notes.PF8013.html/109/ Headed by the brothers Jacques and Pierre Chaumet, the company filed for bankruptcy in 1987 with liabilities of 1.4 billion francs, eight times the annual turnover, in particular due to heavy losses in their diamond purchasing and resale business after the drop in prices worldwide. The two brothers were convicted of illegal banking activities for having opened accounts that promised high interest on the principal. Convicted of 'bankruptcy, fraud, breach of trust and illegal exercise of the banking profession', they were sentenced respectively to five years' imprisonment, of which two were mandatory, and four years, of which six months were mandatory, following the verdict handed down in December 1991. Their sentence was reduced by the Paris Court of Appeal to six months imprisonment, already served while in custody. =LVMH Period (1987-present day)= After their fraudulent bankruptcy, Chaumet was bought in 1987 by Investcorp, a leading Bahrain-based investment bank. The company lost 10 million francs in 1995‚Äì1997, but became profitable again in 1998, with a revenue of 280 million francs, and was bought by LVMH in October 1999.Les √©chos After an unsuccessful attempt to penetrate the American market in the late 1990s, the company opened stores in Asia to fuel growth. Chaumet was now part of the watch and jewellery brands that included TAG Heuer, Zenith, FRED, Hublot, Montres Christian Dior, and De Beers Diamond Jewellers (a joint venture between the LVMH and De Beers groups). In 2006, the brand became established in China, opening 24 boutiques in the country. Chaumet's clientele is mainly Japanese and French, but China represents 25% of sales.http://www.investir.fr/infos-conseils-boursiers/actus-des-marches/infos- marches/le-joaillier-chaumet-veut-doper-ses-ventes-de-montres-356474.php On 9 June 2011, the Responsible Jewellery Council announced the certification of the French jewellers Chaumet. This distinction attests to responsible ethical, social, and environmental practices, as well as respect for human rights. A member of the Responsible Jewellery Council since 2005, Chaumet became the tenth member certified by the RJC.http://www.responsiblejewellery.com/files/news_22_2258488183.pdf In 2010/2011, the company's estimated sales were ‚Ç¨60 million in total sales and ‚Ç¨30 million in watches. In January 2014, it started a \\"more accessible Liens range\\" of watches. Know-how and creation The Place Vend√¥me groups together the House of Chaumet's main activities. In addition to the head office, the townhouse plays home to the design studio and the Fine Jewellery workshop. =Jewellery and fine jewellery= Chaumet controls all the design and production processes of the pieces issuing from its workshops. After being supplied with gold and gems, its fourteen artisans mould, melt, polish and set traditionally the pieces created by the House's designers. The movements of the watches produced by Chaumet are manufactured in Switzerland. In 1969, Jacques Combes joined Chaumet as an apprentice.http://www.lefigaro.fr/lefigaromagazine/2006/05/19/01006-20060519ARTMAG90358-le_travail_en_heritage.php Appointed foreman in 1989, he was made a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters in July 2005.http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Ministere/Les- services-rattaches-au-Ministre/Section-des-distinctions- honorifiques/Nomination-ou-promotion-dans-l-ordre-des-Arts-et-des-Lettres- juillet-2005 On 28 January 2011, Pascal Bourdariat succeeded Jacques Combes, becoming the twelfth master of the House. Six jewellers under the direction of a master craftsman create all of the special orders and fine jewellery collections by hand. The House of Chaumet seeks to preserve its traditional know-how, which guarantees the quality of its work. For example, the workshop has conserved the wooden workbenches, which have remained the same for 200 years. One of the practices unique to Chaumet is working with mock-ups for items of jewellery made of nickel silver. This makes it possible to show the client the shape or size of the item of jewellery before it is produced in the workshop. Chaumet's jewellery-making expertise enables the creation of exceptional pieces of jewellery and limited collections. This is the case with the \\"12 Vend√¥me\\" collection, which was created to mark the 26th Biennale des Antiquaires in September 2012. The collection's name refers to the address of the boutique and the workshop located at 12 place Vend√¥me. The twelve pieces (including four diadems) in this collection are a tribute to the different styles adopted by the house over the generations. A number of the items of jewellery in the \\"12 Vend√¥me\\" collection are transformable: a long necklace may be lengthened by the addition of two braceletsLe Figaro et vous, \\"Le bonheur est dans la haute joaillerie\\", 7 July 2012, p. 32 and an invisible system makes it possible to detach the aigrette from a diadem.S√©rie Limit√©e Les Echos, September 2012, p. 42 =Watchmaking expertise= As a designer of fine jewellery, Chaumet began to produce precious watches from the 19th century onwards. The house has joined forces with Swiss watchmakers, such as Jaeger-LeCoultre and Patek Philippe, to create exceptional timepieces. The pair of bracelet-watches from 1811, commissioned by Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, was created by Nitot. Made of gold, pearls and emeralds, its manufacture combined fine jewellery with a meticulous watchmaking movement.Valeurs Actuelles, from 7 to 13 July 2011, \\"Les riches heures de Chaumet\\", Virginie Jacoberger-Lavou√©, pp. 68‚Äì69 It was at this time that the house succeeded in placing miniature dials at the centre of its bracelets.Point de vue, from 13 to 19 July 2011, \\"L'heure de l'histoire\\", Vincent Meylan, p. 48 One of the most recent creations, the \\"Complication Cr√©ative\\", showcases the bee ‚Äì Chaumet's emblem ‚Äì and the spider. The latter indicates the hours and the bee the minutes. This watch's specific mechanism was created thanks to the house's partnership with top Swiss watchmakers. In 2013, Chaumet's \\"Montres Pr√©cieuses\\" once again combined fine jewellery and watchmaking. The six pieces in this collection use a self-winding mechanical movement and are decorated with diamonds, mother-of- pearl, paintings or engravings. =The arrival of Claire D√©v√©-Rakoff= After working for Chanel and Swarovski and creating her own collection under her own name, Claire D√©v√©-Rakoff became Chaumet's new creative director. Her arrival in 2012 brought a new breath of life to the house: she used the hydrangea as a new symbol. Muses In May 2008, Lou Doillon was chosen by the jewellery House as its muse for the new edition of the 'Liens' ring.http://www.valeursactuelles.com/loisirs/guide-tendances/chaumet-tisse-un- nouveau-lien20080514.html In October of the same year, the actress Sophie Marceau became Chaumet's muse. Lionel Giraud, Jannis Tsipoulanis and Ren√© Habermacher launched the \\"L'Empire des Sentiments\\" advertising campaign, featuring the French actress in the private mansion of Le Rochefoucauld- Doudeauville.http://www.strategies.fr/actualites/marques/103603W/sophie- marceau-goute-aux-heures-chaumet.html Since 2005, Chaumet has been the official partner of the C√©sar Academy. Every year, for the presentation of the nominees in the 'best hope' category, the House hosts an exhibition of photographs. Chaumet has collaborated with the photographers Kate Barry, Emanuele Scorcelletti, St√©phane Sednaoui, Zoe Cassavetes and Jean-Baptiste Mondino. The House's collections =Fine jewellery collections= Liens Items of jewellery with a link motif ‚Äì lien is French for \\"link\\" ‚Äì feature in the Chaumet archives dating from the Belle √âpoque. The first \\"Liens\\" collection appeared in the 1970s with the \\"Lien\\" ring, a band encircled by a golden buckle at its centre, created in 1977. A few years later, diamonds were added to the band and the ring was produced in white gold with a double band. In the middle of the 1990s, the link became a cross, before making way in 2002 for a link pav√© set with diamonds. The \\"Premiers Liens\\" collection launched in 2007 expresses the design in yellow, white and rose gold. Jos√©phine The Jos√©phine collection, launched in 2010, pays tribute to the empress, who was a devotee and collector of Chaumet jewels. This collection takes its inspiration from the diadem, tiara and aigrette, different head jewels worn by Jos√©phine. Bee my love The bee, the emblem of both Napoleon and the House of Chaumet, is the source of inspiration for the Bee my love collection. Over the years, the house has made the bee a symbol of romantic feelings. For this collection, the craftsmen have used a setting designed in the shape of a honeycomb cell symbolising beehives. The wedding rings in the collection may be stacked on top of each other and come in yellow, white and rose gold. Attrape-moi The \\"Attrape-moi...si tu m'aimes\\" (\\"Catch me...if you love me\\") collection launched in 2007 is composed of 18 designs, inspired by the spider and its web. Bees also feature in this collection. Other collections * Anneau * Le Grand Frisson * Class One * Torsade =Watchmaking collections= Class one The class One was created in 1998. It was the first jewellery diving watch. The design of the watch has adopted various forms over the years: the Class One collection for women in 2012 is made up of two unique pieces crafted in diamonds and sapphires or rubies and eight pieces made of black and white diamonds. Dandy The Dandy was launched in 2003 for the most famous men of the age. It was inspired by dandies from the world of art, fashion or literature who appreciated Chaumet watches. Colourful stripes decorate the background of the dial, the plate of the automatic calibre and the back of the casing. The Dandy Arty, in black with blue glints, was launched in 2012. Khesis The Khesis watch, whose name means \\"sun\\" in Navajo,More precise information is a cuff design consisting of rice-grain links, created in 1995. The creative principle of this watch was to offer a jewelled watch with a square face.  The Chaumet museum and collection  Over the decades, the House of Chaumet has designed hundreds of items of jewellery or original editions that have acquired heritage or historical status. From the 1970s, the house has been involved in an initiative to give its pieces their true worth in terms of aesthetic and historical value. This aim came to fruition with the creation of a museum in 1980 under the impetus of B√©atrice de Plinval. The museum's archives contain 200 items of jewellery, 19,800 original invoices, 80,000 drawings, 2,500 diadems and replicas of diadems in nickel silver ‚Äì hundreds of which have been created since 1780. The museum is not open to the public but regularly organises events or exhibitions based on its collections. = List of exhibitions organised by the Chaumet museum =  \\"Paris, two centuries of design\\"  The first exhibition organised by Chaumet was held from 28 March to 28 June 1998 at the Carnavalet Museum in Paris. This exhibition entitled \\"Paris, two centuries of design\\" showcased Chaumet's creations since the age of Marie-√âtienne Nitot. Paintings, photographs and manuscripts echoed the jewellery on display.  \\"Napoleon in Love: Jewellery of the Empire, Eagles and the Heart\\"  In September 2004, the Chaumet museum welcomed the \\"Napoleon in Love: Jewellery of the Empire, Eagles and the Heart\\" exhibition. This exhibition, celebrating the bicentenary of Napoleon's coronation, revealed jewellery belonging to Napoleon, as well as Josephine and Marie- Louise. Some one hundred objects from the museum or on loan were placed on display.  \\"Le Grand Frisson, sentimental jewellery from the Renaissance to the present\\"  The Chaumet museum also played host to the \\"Le Grand Frisson, sentimental jewellery from the Renaissance to the present\\" exhibition from October to November 2008. 150 items of jewellery from the museum and private collections were brought together on the themes of love, friendship and libertinism.  \\"200 years of watchmaking design\\"  In July 2011, the House of Chaumet celebrated the 200th anniversary of the creation of its first pair of watch bracelets belonging to Eug√®ne de Beauharnais. To mark the occasion, the house organised the \\"200 years of watchmaking design\\" exhibition bringing together 30 pieces and 300 drawings.  Journ√©es Particuli√®res, 2011  The Journ√©es Particuli√®res open days organised on 15 and 16 October 2011 were held in the workshop, the large salons and the Chaumet museum. These days were an opportunity to present jewellery from the Chaumet archive collections.  Journ√©es Particuli√®res, 2013  To mark the second edition of the Journ√©es Particuli√®res open days, which took place on 15 and 16 June 2013, Chaumet opened its doors to the general public. The history of the house, its historic headquarters and its iconic collections were presented in its salons. Meetings with the head jeweller and the craftsmen were organised to demonstrate the different steps involved in manufacturing a piece of fine jewellery.

It is part of the DPI Biosecurity and Food Safety Branch within the Department for Primary Industries, which is a part of the Department of Regional NSW. The authority was established in April 2004 with the amalgamation of SafeFood Production NSW and the food inspection activities of the Department of Health (being the former Food Branch and the food inspection staff of the Area Health Services). SafeFood Production NSW was itself the product of a series of amalgamations of industry-specific organisations. NSW is the first Australian state to consolidate such a wide range of food safety and food labelling functions into a single, central government agency. Remit The authority enforces the Food Act 2003 (NSW) and associated regulations within New South Wales in respect of all food for sale. The act brings the bi-national Food Standards Code maintained by Food Standards Australia New Zealand into force within the state. The authority designs and monitors food safety schemes under the Food Regulation 2015 for higher risk industry sectors in the state, licenses food businesses under those schemes, receives notifications for non- retail food businesses, investigates food hygiene and labelling complaints for businesses it monitors, coordinates recalls of food products by companies in the state, coordinates the state's input to national food standards policy and implementation, and advises the NSW Minister for Primary Industries on food standards. Completing the end-to-end remit of the agency, the Food Act also gives the authority a legislative responsibility 'to provide advice, information, community education and assistance in relation to matters connected with food safety or other interests of consumers in food'.Food Act 2003 (NSW) s 108(2)(f) Scope of activities The authority is Australia's first completely integrated or 'through-chain' state food regulation agency, responsible for food safety and food labelling across the food industry, from point of harvest or manufacture through processing, transport, storage and wholesale to point-of-sale and, arguably, point of consumption (see Remit, below). Both policy and enforcement activities are evidence-led. Before the authority was established, responsibility for food regulation in NSW was divided across a number of state agencies, some with scope limited to specific food sectors such as meat, dairy or seafood or to horizontal parts of the food chain such as retail outlets. Various degrees of segmentation remain in other Australian State and territory jurisdictions. Evolution in the food, transport and trade industries was creating greater complexity in market structures, business reach and government regulation. The establishment of the authority was designed to create a more streamlined, consistent and efficient approach to food regulation in NSW and a single point of contact for both the food industry and public. Some overlap of government agency remits regulating the sale of food remain, however, with NSW Fair Trading empowered to enforce the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and, at the federal level, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission enforcing the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cwlth) and National Measurement Institute, Australia enforcing the Trade Measurement Act 1989 (NSW). Furthermore, local government is also empowered to enforce food standards under the Food Act, mostly at the level of retail food outlets. The authority works with local councils to minimise overlap and duplication at the retail level and enhance consistency of enforcement activities and skills across the state. In July 2008, amendments to the Food Act formalised and mandated the (previously optional) food safety enforcement functions of local government. The amendments enabled the authority to appoint, after consultation, each local council to one of three predefined categories setting out each's food safety enforcement powers and responsibilities. Scores on Doors program Example of NSW hygiene score certificate displayed at a retail food outletThe Scores on Doors program publishes the hygiene and food safety inspection result achieved by NSW retail food premises. The program rates participating food business‚Äô point-in-time compliance with NSW food safety legislation at time of unannounced inspection by government officers with an emphasis on the food handling practices linked to foodborne illness. When displayed prominently consumers can use this score to help them decide where to eat or buy food. The score can also be published on websites. Scores on Doors has equivalent programs in other jurisdictions designed to reward well-performing businesses, drive food safety culture and ultimately reduce foodborne illness. The NSW program is open to retail food businesses which process and sell food in NSW that is: ready-to-eat, potentially hazardous (i.e. requires temperature control), and for immediate consumption. Examples include restaurants,take away shops, pub bistros, hotels,cafes, bakeries and clubs. Scores are either Good (3 stars), Very Good (4 stars) or Excellent (5 stars); premises found with critical lapses in food safety standards or currently listed on the Name and Shame registers of on- the-spot fines or court fines are not awarded any display certificate. The program was piloted in 2010, expanded to a trial in participating local government areas in 2011, and in late 2013 was enhanced to encourage further take-up. Participation in the NSW program is voluntary and currently expanding across local governments across the State. Name and shame initiative In July 2008 the NSW government passed laws amending existing provisions which allowed the authority to publish details of successful food business prosecutions on its website . The new laws added, for the first time in Australia, provisions allowing for publication of details of penalty notices‚Äîakin to 'on-the-spot' fines‚Äîissued by enforcement staff for alleged breaches of food safety standards. Known colloquially as 'naming and shaming' food outlets, the initiative was a response to growing public demand for access to food business performance information, freedom of information advocates and the media.

He was the last ruler of Arbanon before its final annexation in the reemerging Byzantine Empire. His holdings included Kruj√´ and probably Ohrid.  Rule  He rose to rule Arbanon through marriage with the daughter of sebastos Gregorios Kamonas and Komnena Nemanjiƒá and then succeeded him to rule Arbanon. The ascension of Golem is regarded as a reversion to the native rule of Albania.: \\"But he was overruled by Demetrios Chomatianos M. In due course the daughter of Kamonas married a local magnate called Golem (or Goulamos), and Kroia and Arbanon reverted to native rule. Golem was connected not only with the Serbian royal family but also by marriage with John Batatzes of Nicaea; and it was through this latter connexion that he was tempted into joining the winning side in Macedonia in 1252, when the armies...\\" Komnena was the daughter of Stefan the First-Crowned and grand-daughter of Alexios III Angelos, the last Byzantine Emperor before the Fourth Crusade. This particular aspect of her origin would become important in later political developments as she was the niece of Irene Laskarina, Empress of Nicaea and thus related to the Nicaean Emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes. The exact date of Golem's rise to power is unknown. In his time, Arbanon had moved from independence under Dhimit√´r Progoni to semi-independence under the high suzerainty of Theodore Komnenos Doukas of the Despotate of Epirus until 1230 when Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria expanded westwards. When he died in 1240, the Despotate of Epirus under the Komneno-Doukai exerted again its influence in central Albania. This was the era of the rise of the Nicaean Empire which sought to take hold of all post-Byzantine states and reform the Byzantine Empire. In this context, the struggle between Michael II Komnenos Doukas and John III Doukas Vatatzes developed. In 1246, the two expanded in the region of Macedonia and the new border between them in the area between Albania and western Macedonia. Golem was in control of Ohrid at the time. He, Theodore Petraliphas and others who were allies of Michael Doukas negotiated with Vatatzes and changed sides. \\"In 1252, Prince Golem of Arbanon submitted to the empire of Nicaea, but this did not last, since, in 1257/58, the Albanians rebelled again and rejoined the party of Michael II, ruler of Epirus.\\": \\"They had barely crossed the frontiers of Albania when Golem, the chieftain of Kroia and Elbassan, who had been helping Michael's army in the region of Kastoria, surrendered himself and his soldiers to Vatatzes. Golem was probably in control of Ohrid and Petraliphas of Kastoria. Both men were in the region of Kastoria with their armies in order to support Michael against Vatatzes but instead of preparing to fight against him, they reached an agreement with Vatatzes who had also camped in western Macedonia. The exact details of the agreement are not known but contemporary historian George Pachymeres writes that Golem (Goulielmos) was \\"honored with Roman dignities\\" by the Nicaean Emperor. In historiography Golem of Kruja is mentioned in two contemporary accounts. As Goulamos in that of George Akropolites and as Goulielmos in that of George Pachymeres. Thus, his name could either be a variant of William, which had entered Albanian as Gulielm or Golem, which had entered Albanian via south Slavic/Bulgarian and signified one's high status. In Albanian historiography, those scholars who have favored the second hypothesis have proposed a possible connection to the Arianiti family, some members of which also used Golem in their names (Moisi Golemi).

It is also the name of a hamlet near the village of Norley. Nature reserve Hatch Mere Nature Reserve covers . It lies within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and is managed by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust. According to the SSSI citation \\"Hatch Mere is an example of a mere with moderate fertility and well developed floating and emergent vegetation. It is an unusual mere because of the surrounding vegetation which consists largely of acidic heath and bog communities.\\" The mere is a good example of a kettle hole, of which there are several in the Delamere area. Some are flooded as here whilst others are dry or contain peat mosses. The mere originated as a detached mass of glacial ice melted in situ towards the end of the last ice age. Notable animal species include the Hairy Dragonfly Brachytron pratense, Variable Damselfly Coenagrion pulchellum and a rare caddisfly, Potomophylax rotundipennis. Rare plants for the area include Tufted Sedge Carex elata and Bog Myrtle Myrica gale. There were several campaigns to maintain public access to the lake after it was bought by the Wildlife Trust in 1998. Initially the Trust fenced off the only access point to the lake suitable for swimmers. A pressure group, the Friends of Hatchmere, was formed, and eventually the Wildlife Trust backed down and agreed to allow swimming in the lake. The Hatchmere campaign was instrumental in the forming of the River and Lake Swimming Association, a group that promotes open water swimming in the United Kingdom. Angling is also permitted on the lake under the membership of Prince Albert Angling Society and anglers have purpose-built platforms where they have to fish from which each requires a key provided by the society. Fish present in the lake include Bream, Tench, Pike, Roach as well as some breeds of Carp. Hatch Mere lake is suffering many of the impacts to water quality brought by modern land use and recreation. Naturally, nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates can settle and be stored in the sediment of a lake. However, disturbance can churn up this sediment and release the stored nutrients which then become suspended within the water. Over the coming winter, work will begin to try and address some of these issues. As a result of these unsafe nutrient levels, disturbance and species diversity reduction, wild swimming in Hatchmere has been ceased since November 2019. https://www.cheshirewildlifetrust.org.uk/nature-reserves/hatchmere References Cheshire Wildlife Trust reserves Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cheshire Lakes and reservoirs of Cheshire Nature reserves in Cheshire Lakes of Cheshire Ponds of Europe ","title":"Hatchmere"},{"id":"16033013","text":"The Shrimp is a children's novel by Emily Smith.

It increases lymphocyte numbers and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in animals. It is extracted from bovine thymus.  History  Prior to 1960, the thymus gland, which lies in the cervical thoracic area, was thought to be of little importance. In adult animals, the thymus is almost non-existent because it atrophies as animals reach adulthood. It was observed, however, that when pre- adolescent animals are thymectomized, they experience a variety of maladies including increased incidence of infection, failure to grow, neuromuscular disorders, cancer, etc., collectively known as ‚Äúwasting disease‚Äù. The greater susceptibility to infection was shown to be directly attributable to a dramatic decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes in thymectomized animals. By 1964 it had been demonstrated that regulatory factors extracted from the thymus gland could prevent many of the manifestations of wasting disease. This suggested that the thymus produces substances important in the development of immunity. It was not until 1971 that it was discovered that thymus-derived lymphocytes (T-cells) were important regulators of bone-marrow-derived antibody-producing lymphocytes (B-cells). After the discovery that the thymus was producing profound regulatory factors, several groups of scientists began trying to extract and purify this factor from thymus glands in much the same manner that insulin was prepared from the pancreas for therapeutic use in diabetes. The difficulty was that the thymus is a very small gland and produces very small quantities of the factor. Thus, purification techniques did not allow appropriate pure fractions to be produced in sufficient quantities. Thymus is a preferred tissue for viral replication of feline immunodeficiency virus, which results in lesions and dysfunction. In 1983 scientists succeeded in cloning epithelial cell lines from the thymus of various species and began to biochemically and biologically characterize these thymus derived regulatory factors. A protein with a molecular weight of about 50,000 daltons was subsequently described and shown to augment the immune responses of both immature and mature T-cells. This protein came to be known as lymphocyte T-cell immunomodulator.  Production and identity  Lymphocyte T-cell immunomodulator, or T-4 immune stimulating factor (TISF), is a single chain polypeptide that is a strongly cationic glycoprotein and is purified with cation exchange resin. Purification of protein from bovine-derived type II thymic epithelial cell supernatants produces a substantially homogeneous factor, free of extraneous materials. The bovine protein is homologous with other mammalian species and is a homogeneous 50 kDa glycoprotein with an isoelectric point of 6.5. The protein is prepared in a lyophilized 1 microgram dose. Reconstitution in sterile diluent produces a solution for subcutaneous injection. It is unknown what LTCI is in terms of its sequence. It is not interleukins 1-7 nor G-CSF. The manufacturer verifies its potency by checking for stimulation of IL-2 production.  Mechanism of action  Generally, a proportion of immature thymus-derived lymphocytes differentiate into mature CD4+ T-cells which produce a certain amount of cytokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and gamma interferon. To attack tumor cells and viruses, CD-4 cells coordinate the overall immune response and help activate CD8 T-lymphocytes. Often called ‚Äúeffector‚Äù or ‚Äúcytotoxic‚Äù T-cells, CD-8+ T-lymphocytes they respond to intracellular pathogens and cancer cells. Under viral attack CD-4+ T-cells fail to mature, fail to produce IL-2 and gamma interferon, and consequently fail to coordinate CD-8 responses to viruses. LTCI increases the production of CD-4+ T-cells and can subsequently overcome this immunosuppression.  Veterinary uses  =Viral diseases in cats= LTCI, manufactured by T-Cyte Therapeutics, has been conditionally approved by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as an aid in the treatment of cats infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and/or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and the associated symptoms of lymphopenia, opportunistic infection, anemia, granulocytopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Peer- reviewed literature disputes the benefit claims from the manufacturer. T-Cyte data as of 2011 does not strongly support the medication's ability to significantly increase the length or quality of life of treated cats. =Canine osteoarthritis= LTCI increases the immune response to foreign antigens and dampens the immune-mediated response to self-antigens by increasing the number of precursors of a regulatory T-Cell population. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, 11 of the 12 LTCI-treated canines had a 40 percent increase in function while the placebo group had a 17 percent decrease in function. Following the study, LTCI was approved by the USDA to treat osteoarthritis in dogs in 2016.

Part of the camp was reopened in April 1899 for the muster out of a number of volunteer units (2nd, 4th, 5th and 9th U.S. Vol. Inf.) up through June 1899. In addition, several of the new volunteer regiments authorized by Congress in 1899 for the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War assembled there during July to November 1899. The Mt. Gretna rifle range was used by these regiments. Namesake Named after George Gordon Meade, (1815‚Äì1872) a career United States Army officer and famous Civil War general. Location The camp was located south of Harrisburg and just west of Middletown. The site is bisected by the east-west Pennsylvania turnpike (76) east-west State Highway 283 and the north-south extension from State Highway 283 to the Harrisburg International Airport. The site is north of the airport in between Middletown and Highspire. The land rises to the north from the Susquehanna River. Much of the area in the north central part of the camp is still semi-rural. Residential areas cover many of the sites south of State Highway 283. Rosedale Road cuts across the site diagonally northwest-southwest. The Penn State University Harrisburg Campus is at the south side of the site and a number of the 1898 camp sites are located on the campus. There is a historical marker on the west side of Pennsylvania Highway 441 (Union Street) at the Middletown Area High School (1155 North Union Street).Camp George Gordon Meade Historical Marker Camp Conewago The 203rd Regiment of the New York U.S. Volunteer Infantry was moved to a quarantine camp at Conewago, Pennsylvania on October 2, 1898, because of the high incidence of typhoid in its ranks at Camp Meade. Conewago is a small town southeast of Middletown. The regiment remained there until it left for Camp Wetherill, Greenville, South Carolina, on November 12, 1898. This camp is sometimes referred to as Camp Conewago. The camp site was near the Conewago railroad station.

The Coupe 60 is a pillarless concept car that explores the limits of Holden's current Zeta rear-wheel drive architecture, combining V8 Supercar- inspired styling with innovative technology to form a road-going sportscar. The Coupe 60 is based on a short-wheelbase version of the Holden VE Commodore. The concept car was first revealed at the 2008 Melbourne International Motor Show, along with the HSV W427. The Coupe 60 celebrates the six decades since Holden built the 48-215 at its Fishermans Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria, and provides a glimpse of Holden's future directions in design, engineering and emerging engine technologies. It cost A$2.5 million to manufacture.  Production feasibility  At the time of launch, a great deal of speculation ensued that the Coupe 60 may point to another incarnation of the iconic Monaro. The designer stated that the car is production-feasible, including the B-pillarless design. Nevertheless, the Coupe 60 remained a concept car largely because of unjustified development and production costs relative to small sales volume unless accompanied by any export program. Such program was not feasible especially as General Motors, by that time, was developing the larger volume fifth-generation Chevrolet Camaro based on the same Zeta platform shared with the Coupe 60.  Specifications  The luxury- sports theme of The Coupe 60 is emphasised by such features as a racing- derived chassis setup, including rear-diffuser, front-splitter and carbon- fibre spoiler, and 21-inch centre-lock alloy wheels with unique design Kumho high performance semi-slick tyres. The Coupe 60 is powered by a 6.0-litre LS2 V8, with Active Fuel Management and ethanol (E85) capabilities.

Emerging as the language of the city- states of the Arameans in the Levant in the Early Iron Age, Old Aramaic was adopted as a lingua franca, and in this role was inherited for official use by the Achaemenid Empire during classical antiquity. After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, local vernaculars became increasingly prominent, fanning the divergence of an Aramaic dialect continuum and the development of differing written standards. Ancient Aramaic \\"Ancient Aramaic\\" refers to the earliest known period of the language, from its origin until it becomes the lingua franca of the Fertile Crescent and Bahrain. It was the language of the Aramaean city-states of Damascus, Hamath and Arpad. Distinctive royal inscriptions at Sam'al have been interpreted by some scholars as a distinctive variant of Old Aramaic, by others as an independent but closely related Samalian language. Silver ingot of Bar-Rakib, son of Panammuwa II,Panammuwa II and Bar-Rakib: Two Structural Analyses, K. Lawson Younger, Jr., University of Sheffield King of Sam‚Äòal (now called Zincirli H√∂y√ºk). There are inscriptions that evidence the earliest use of the language, dating from the 10th century BCE. The inscriptions are mostly diplomatic documents between Aramaean city-states. The alphabet of Aramaic then seems to be based on the Phoenician alphabet, and there is a unity in the written language. It seems that in time, a more refined alphabet, suited to the needs of the language, began to develop from this in the eastern regions of Aram. The dominance of the Neo-Assyrian Empire under Tiglath-Pileser III over Aram-Damascus in the middle of the 8th century led to the establishment of Aramaic as a lingua franca of the empire, rather than it being eclipsed by Akkadian. From 700 BCE, the language began to spread in all directions but lost much of its homogeneity. Different dialects emerged in Assyria, Babylonia, the Levant and Egypt. However, the Akkadian-influenced Aramaic of Assyria, and then Babylon, started to come to the fore. As described in 2 Kings 18:26, envoys of Hezekiah, king of Judah, ask to negotiate with Assyrian military commanders in Aramaic so that the common people would not understand. Around 600 BCE, Adon, a Canaanite king, used Aramaic to write to the Egyptian Pharaoh. The first Old Aramaic inscription found in Europe, but originally from (Ptolemaic?) Egypt, is the Carpentras Stela, published by Rigord in 1704.See and . The stele is known as KAI 269. Imperial Aramaic After 539 BCE, following the Achaemenid conquest of Mesopotamia under Darius I, the Achaemenids adopted the local use of Aramaic. The term \\"Imperial Aramaic\\", originally German \\"\\", was coined by Josef Markwart in 1927.Josef Markwart, ‚ÄúNp. ƒÅƒëƒ´na ‚ÄòFreitag‚Äô,‚Äù Ungarische Jahrb√ºcher 7, 1927, pp. 91: \\"In der Bedeutung 'bestimmte (kommende, zuk√ºnftige) Zeit‚Äô ist das Wort zaman schon ins Reichsaram√§ische und von da ins aramaisierende Hebr√§isch und ins Nabat√§ische und aus diesem sp√§ter ins Arabische √ºbergegangen.

Frye reclassifies Imperial Aramaic as the of Achaemenid territories, suggesting then that the Achaemenid-era use of Aramaic was more pervasive than generally thought. The 4th century BC Letoon trilingual uses Greek, Lycian and Aramaic. Fethiye Museum. Imperial Aramaic was highly standardised; its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect, and the inevitable influence of Old Persian gave the language a new clarity and robust flexibility. For centuries after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire (in 331 BCE), Imperial Aramaic or a similar dialect would remain an influence on the various native Iranian languages. Aramaic script and, as ideograms, Aramaic vocabulary would survive as the essential characteristics of the Pahlavi scripts. One of the largest collections of Imperial Aramaic texts is that of the Persepolis fortification tablets, which number about five hundred. Many of the extant documents witnessing to this form of Aramaic come from Egypt, Elephantine in particular (see: Elephantine papyri). Of them, the best known is the Wisdom of Ahiqar, a book of instructive aphorisms quite similar in style to the biblical Book of Proverbs. In addition, current consensus regards the Aramaic portion of the Biblical book of Daniel (i.e., 2:4b-7:28) as an example of Imperial (Official) Aramaic. Achaemenid Aramaic is sufficiently uniform that it is often difficult to know where any particular example of the language was written. Only careful examination reveals the occasional loanword from a local language. A group of thirty Aramaic documents from Bactria has been discovered, and an analysis was published in November 2006. The texts, which were rendered on leather, reflect the use of Aramaic in the fourth century BCE Achaemenid administration of Bactria and Sogdia. Old Aramaic and Biblical Hebrew both form part of the group of Northwest Semitic languages, and during antiquity, there may still have been substantial mutual intelligibility. In Pesahim, Tractate 87b, Hanina bar Hama said that God sent the exiled Jews to Babylon because \\"[the Babylonian] language is akin to the Leshon Hakodesh\\".  Biblical Aramaic  Biblical Aramaic is the term for the Aramaic passages interspersed in the Hebrew Bible. These passages make for a small fraction of the entire text (of the order of 1%), and most of it is due to the Aramaic parts of the Book of Daniel: * Genesis 31:47 ‚Äì translation of a Hebrew place-name. * Ezra 4:8‚Äì6:18 and 7:12‚Äì26 ‚Äì documents from the Achaemenid period (5th century BCE) concerning the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem. * Jeremiah 10:11 ‚Äì a single sentence in the middle of a Hebrew text denouncing idolatry. * Daniel 2:4b‚Äì7:28 ‚Äì five subversive tales and an apocalyptic vision. Biblical Aramaic is a somewhat hybrid dialect. It is theorized that some Biblical Aramaic material originated in both Babylonia and Judaea before the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty. Post-Achaemenid Aramaic Coin of Alexander the Great bearing an Aramaic language inscription Bilingual inscription (Greek and Aramaic) by Ashoka, third century BCE at Kandahar, Afghanistan The conquest by Alexander the Great did not destroy the unity of Aramaic language and literature immediately. Aramaic that bears a relatively close resemblance to that of the fifth century BCE can be found right up to the early second century BCE. The Seleucids imposed Koine Greek in the administration of Syria and Mesopotamia from the start of their rule. In the third century BCE, Koine Greek overtook Aramaic as the common language in Egypt and Syria. However, a post-Achaemenid Aramaic continued to flourish from Judea, Assyria, Mesopotamia, through the Syrian Desert and into northern Arabia and Parthia. Under the category of post-Achaemenid is Hasmonaean Aramaic, the official language of the Hasmonean dynasty of Judaea (142‚Äì37 BCE). It influenced the Aramaic of the Qumran texts, and was the main language of non-biblical theological texts of that community. The major Targums, translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, were originally composed in Hasmonaean. Hasmonaean also appears in quotations in the Mishnah and Tosefta, although smoothed into its later context. It is written quite differently from Achaemenid Aramaic; there is an emphasis on writing as words are pronounced rather than using etymological forms. Babylonian Targumic is the later post-Achaemenid dialect found in the Targum Onqelos and Targum Jonathan, the \\"official\\" targums. The original, Hasmonaean targums had reached Babylon sometime in the 2nd or 3rd century CE. They were then reworked according to the contemporary dialect of Babylon to create the language of the standard targums. This combination formed the basis of Babylonian Jewish literature for centuries to follow. Galilean Targumic is similar to Babylonian Targumic. It is the mixing of literary Hasmonaean with the dialect of Galilee. The Hasmonaean targums reached Galilee in the 2nd century, and were reworked into this Galilean dialect for local use. The Galilean Targum was not considered an authoritative work by other communities, and documentary evidence shows that its text was amended. From the 11th century onwards, once the Babylonian Targum had become normative, the Galilean version became heavily influenced by it. Babylonian Documentary Aramaic is a dialect in use from the 3rd century onwards. It is the dialect of Babylonian private documents, and, from the 12th century, all Jewish private documents are in Aramaic. It is based on Hasmonaean with very few changes. This was perhaps because many of the documents in BDA are legal documents, the language in them had to be sensible throughout the Jewish community from the start, and Hasmonaean was the old standard. The Nabataean language was the Western Aramaic variety used by the Nabateans of the Negev, including the kingdom of Petra. The kingdom (c. 200 BCE‚Äì106 CE) covered the east bank of the Jordan River, the Sinai Peninsula and northern Arabia. Perhaps because of the importance of the caravan trade, the Nabataeans began to use Aramaic in preference to Ancient North Arabian. The dialect is based on Achaemenid with a little influence from Arabic: \\"l\\" is often turned into \\"n\\", and there are a few Arabic loan words. Some Nabataean Aramaic inscriptions exist from the early days of the kingdom, but most are from the first four centuries CE. The language is written in a cursive script that is the precursor to the modern Arabic alphabet. The number of Arabic loan words increases through the centuries, until, in the 4th century, Nabataean merges seamlessly with Arabic. Palmyrene Aramaic is the dialect that was in use in the city state of Palmyra in the Syrian Desert from 44 BC to 274 CE. It was written in a rounded script, which later gave way to cursive Estrangela. Like Nabataean, Palmyrene was influenced by Arabic, but to a much lesser degree. The use of written Aramaic in the Achaemenid bureaucracy also precipitated the adoption of Aramaic-derived scripts to render a number of Middle Iranian languages. Moreover, many common words, including even pronouns, particles, numerals, and auxiliaries, continued to written as Aramaic \\"words\\" even when writing Middle Iranian languages. In time, in Iranian usage, these Aramaic \\"words\\" became disassociated from the Aramaic language and came to be understood as signs (i.e. logograms), much like the sign is read as \\"and\\" in English and the original Latin et is now no longer obvious. Under the early third-century BCE Parthian Empire, whose government used Koine Greek but whose native language was Parthian, the Parthian language and the Aramaic-derived writing system used for Parthian both gained prestige. This in turn influenced the adoption of the name pahlavi (< parthawi, \\"of the Parthians\\") for their use of Aramaic script with logograms. The Sasanian Empire, which succeeded the Parthian Arsacids in the mid-3rd century CE, subsequently inherited/adopted the Parthian-mediated Aramaic-derived writing system for their own Middle Iranian ethnolect as well.Beyer. p. 28 n. 27; That particular Middle Iranian dialect, Middle Persian, i.e. the language of Persia proper, subsequently also became a prestige language. Following the Muslim conquest of Persia by the Arabs in the seventh-century, the Aramaic-derived writing system was replaced by the Arabic script in all but Zoroastrian usage, which continued to use the name pahlavi for the Aramaic-derived writing system and went on to create the bulk of all Middle Iranian literature in that writing system. Late Old Eastern Aramaic Mandaic magical \\"demon trap\\" The dialects mentioned in the last section were all descended from Achaemenid Imperial Aramaic. However, the diverse regional dialects of Late Ancient Aramaic continued alongside them, often as simple, spoken languages. Early evidence for these spoken dialects is known only through their influence on words and names in a more standard dialect. However, the regional dialects became written languages in the 2nd century BCE and reflect a stream of Aramaic that is not dependent on Imperial Aramaic. They show a clear division between the regions of Mesopotamia, Babylon and the east, and Judah, Syria, and the west. In the East, the dialects of Palmyrene and Arsacid Aramaic merged with the regional languages to create languages with a foot in Imperial and a foot in regional Aramaic. The written form of Mandaic, the language of the Mandaean religion, was descended from the Arsacid chancery script.\\"Iranian Scripts for Aramaic Languages,\\" in the Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 341 (2006), pp. 53-62. In the kingdom of Osroene, centred on Edessa and founded in 132 BCE, the regional dialect became the official language: Old Syriac. On the upper reaches of the Tigris, East Mesopotamian Aramaic flourished, with evidence from Hatra, Assur and the Tur Abdin. Tatian, the author of the gospel harmony known as the Diatessaron, came from the Seleucid Empire and perhaps wrote his work (172 CE) in East Mesopotamian rather than Syriac or Greek. In Babylonia, the regional dialect was used by the Jewish community, Jewish Old Babylonian (c. 70 CE). The everyday language increasingly came under the influence of Biblical Aramaic and Babylonian Targumic. Late Old Western Aramaic The western regional dialects of Aramaic followed a similar course to those of the east. They are quite distinct from the eastern dialects and Imperial Aramaic. Aramaic came to coexist with Canaanite dialects, eventually completely displacing Phoenician and Hebrew around the turn of the 4th century CE. The form of Late Old Western Aramaic used by the Jewish community is best attested, and is usually referred to as Jewish Old Palestinian. Its oldest form is Old East Jordanian, which probably comes from the region of Caesarea Philippi. This is the dialect of the oldest manuscript of the Book of Enoch (c. 170 BCE). The next distinct phase of the language is called Old Judaean into the 2nd century CE. Old Judaean literature can be found in various inscriptions and personal letters, preserved quotations in the Talmud and receipts from Qumran. Josephus' first, non-extant edition of his The Jewish War was written in Old Judaean. The Old East Jordanian dialect continued to be used into the 1st century CE by pagan communities living to the east of the Jordan. Their dialect is often then called Pagan Old Palestinian, and it was written in a cursive script somewhat similar to that used for Old Syriac. A Christian Old Palestinian dialect may have arisen from the pagan one, and this dialect may be behind some of the Western Aramaic tendencies found in the otherwise eastern Old Syriac gospels (see Peshitta). In the 1st century CE, Jews in Roman Judaea primarily spoke Aramaic (besides Koine Greek as the international language of the Roman administration and trade). In addition to the formal, literary dialects of Aramaic based on Hasmonaean and Babylonian there were a number of colloquial Aramaic dialects. Seven dialects of Western Aramaic were spoken in the vicinity of Judaea in Jesus' time. They were probably distinctive yet mutually intelligible. Old Judaean was the prominent dialect of Jerusalem and Judaea. The region of Ein Gedi had the Southeastern Judaean dialect. Samaria had its distinctive Samaritan Aramaic, where the consonants he, and ayin all became pronounced the same as aleph, presumably a glottal stop. Galilean Aramaic, the dialect of Jesus' home region, is only known from a few place names, the influences on Galilean Targumic, some rabbinic literature and a few private letters. It seems to have a number of distinctive features: diphthongs are never simplified into monophthongs. East of the Jordan, the various dialects of East Jordanian were spoken. In the region of Damascus and the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, Damascene Aramaic was spoken (deduced mostly from Modern Western Aramaic). Finally, as far north as Aleppo, the western dialect of Orontes Aramaic was spoken. The three languages influenced one another, especially Hebrew and Aramaic. Hebrew words entered Jewish Aramaic (mostly technical religious words but also everyday words like ' \\"wood\\"). Vice versa, Aramaic words entered Hebrew (not only Aramaic words like mƒÅmm√¥n \\"wealth\\" but Aramaic ways of using words like making Hebrew rƒÅ‚Äô√ªi, \\"seen\\" mean \\"worthy\\" in the sense of \\"seemly\\", which is a loan translation of Aramaic ' meaning \\"seen\\" and \\"worthy\\"). The Greek of the New Testament often preserves non-Greek semiticisms, including transliterations of Semitic words: * Some are Aramaic like talitha (œÑŒ±ŒªŒπŒ∏Œ±) that can represent the noun ' (Mark 5:41). * Others can be either Hebrew or Aramaic like Rabbounei (Œ°Œ±Œ≤Œ≤ŒøœÖŒΩŒµŒπ), which stands for \\"my master/great one/teacher\\" in both languages (John 20:16).

Jones in the Rialto Room, Liverpool Street, Hobart on 28 April 1898 for the purpose of reviving club football in Hobart.\\"Peep at Sport\\" - Hobart Mercury: Tuesday, 9 August 1973 (Page 26) After starting out in the STFA, the club joined the TFL in 1906 when the league was renamed and played in the league until 1941. Lefroy and Cananore were two of the original clubs to be replaced in the league after World War Two (by Sandy Bay and Hobart respectively) when the TANFL switched to a district-based competition. Notable footballers to have played with Lefroy include Jim Atkinson, Harvey Kelly and Eric Zschech. Lefroy were league premiers on nine occasions and dual Tasmanian State Premiership winners.

He is the Howdy figure that was used in Howdy Doody still photo sessions for the Howdy Doody Show and the publicity pictures taken with Buffalo Bob Smith. The near-stringless Howdy marionette was also used in personal appearances and parades. His arm joints and legs were specially built to hold a pose for advertising and marketing photography. He sat easily in Buffalo Bob Smith's lap. Photo Doody, made of carved wood, is 30\\" tall. His face is hand-painted with blue eyes; he has red hair, a gap-tooth grin, pronounced ears and 48 freckles (one for each of the states at the time when the show first went on the air). He wears a western style outfit consisting of blue jeans, a plaid shirt, cowboy boots and a red bandanna.  From prop to the private market  Prior to sale, Roger Muir, executive producer of The Howdy Doody Show, owned the puppet. In 1983 Photo Doody was mutilated by vandals who broke into the New York NBC office of Muir. Puppeteers successfully repaired the damage but Photo Doody still bears neck \\"scars\\" where the vandals pulled his head off. Photo Doody sold at Leland's auction house in 1997 for $113,432 to a private collector. The Howdy Doody sale made international print and broadcast headline news. Following the 1997 auction, Art and Antiques Magazine named Photo Doody one of the world's \\"Top 100 Treasures\\" for 1997. In 1998 the Palm Beach Daily News (The Shiny Sheet), a Palm Beach Post newspaper, identified TJ Fisher as the Photo Doody high bidder. A \\"Howdy Doody Comes to Town\\" front- page feature story profiled Fisher taking Howdy around town in a convertible and dining out with him at local restaurants. Photo Doody is the only original Howdy Doody prop-marionette to ever be privately owned. The other two screen- used Howdy puppets are museum property ‚Äî the one used in the show remains on display at the Detroit Institute of Arts; and the other (\\"Double Doody\\") is on permanent exhibition at the Smithsonian.  The TV show  The half-hour Howdy Doody Show was the first children's program to appear on TV. The pioneering show set the pattern for many children's programs. A near-record 2,343 episodes aired during its 13-year NBC national TV stint from 1947 to 1960. During the show's heyday, Howdy received 1,500 pieces of mail a week. The program's host, Buffalo Bob Smith created the Howdy character for radio and performed the voice of Howdy on television. Actual fabrication of the various Howdy puppets fell to the show's props and puppetry specialists: Rufus Rose, Velma Wayne Dawson, and Scott Brinker. The show was among the first color TV productions ‚Äîin part to promote the sale of color television sets (NBC, which aired the show, was owned by TV-maker RCA). Beginning in 1950, the NBC test pattern featured a picture of Howdy. Photo Doody was the model for the NBC test pattern. With hundreds of thousands of children in the television viewing audience glued to their TV sets at 5:30 p.m. weekdays, each show opened with Buffalo Bob asking ‚Äî\\"Say, kids, what time is it?\\" The children in the studio audience \\"peanut gallery\\" responded in unison, \\"It's Howdy Doody time!\\" Buffalo Bob Smith did commercials for Wonder Bread, Campbell Soup, Hostess Twinkies and other sponsors that were new to television; it taught marketers the strength of marketing to children.

This keyboard is the sister synthesizer to the Korg Polysix. It has four highly stable voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), a 4-pole, self-oscillating low pass filter (LPF), several modulation capabilities and pseudo-polyphony (paraphony). Features and architecture Features include four voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) with tuning, footage (16, 8, 4, 2), waveshape (triangle, saw, pulse-width, and pulse-width modulated), and amplitude. The first oscillator is the master oscillator as far as fine tuning goes. Two direct modifiers to the VCOs are a detune control that only affects oscillators 2 and 4, and a Pulse Width control that goes to cancellation either side of 50% phase symmetry of a square wave; pulse width can be routed to MG1, MG2, or voltage-controlled filter (VCF) envelope. There is one independent noise generator with an amplitude control (frequency and shape is modified by the VCF). There is one 24/db octave exponential low-pass VCF with resonance, scaling and invertible envelope control shared across all four VCOs. One voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) envelope with triggering and dampering controls is shared across all four VCOs. There are two low frequency modulators: MG1 controls VCO Pitch/Pulse-width, 'EFFECTS' and VCF cutoff; MG2 controls the tempo of the arpeggiator, and Pulse-Width. There is one arpeggiator with on/off/latch control, up/down/up-down pitch control, and 1/2/full keyboard control (44 notes). The arpeggiator can cycle through each oscillator in POLY mode, or all four at a time in MONO. There is an 'EFFECTS' section which includes VCO frequency modulation (X-MOD) with hard-sync control, and a frequency modulator with which the frequency of the modulator can be altered by the VCF envelope or MG1. For both modulators there is the option of single modulation of all oscillators, or two carriers, and two modulators (using the VCOs). Controller Interfaces are external inputs/outputs for CV/Trigger, VCF and VCO mod inputs, arpeggiator, portamento, and the pitch/MG1 mod wheels can be assigned to control VCO1 pitch, pitch or the filter. Bender goes to 2.5 octaves +/- for Pitch and full range for VCF cutoff. There are 5 different oscillator assignment modes: 'Hold' drones the oscillators until force dampered or Chord Memory is activated; 'Chord Memory (MONO)' allows 2-4 oscillators (VCOs) to be set to any arrangement across 44 keys (for example, in organ or rave chords); 'Unison (MONO)' stacks all 4 oscillators; and 'Unison/Share', which defaults to Unison with one note played, but divides the oscillators across the notes as 2 or more are played. Poly is without explanation, and oscillators always play in sequenced order from 1-4. Usability The main drawback of the Mono/Poly is that the 4 VCOs share one common VCA and VCF envelope, like all the knobby monophonic synthesizers like MiniMoog, but there are triggering and auto-dampering switches to compensate for the envelope sharing. This synth was not so much designed to be a polysynth like its sister the Polysix (which was manufactured at the same time), but more of an experimental synth with different footages and waveshapes per oscillator. The Mono/Poly also did not include a digital memory like its sister the Polysix, because its focus was again on experimentation. Other drawbacks are the chipboard construction on the base and sides of the unit, which tend to get damaged easily or allow screws to come out, and the rubber contacts under the keyboard, which tend to wear over time resulting in dead keys; this may be fixed with a little cleaning and/or obtaining a new rubber strip, as Mono/Polys are fairly easy to disassemble. As far as circuit reliability, they tend to fare well by the standard of most analog synths. The most likely component to fail is generally one of the 4 VCOs (making its uselessness variable in POLY mode, depending on which oscillators have burned out); next to go is usually the filter. The VCOs and VCF are Solid State Micro Technology for Music(SSM) chips: (4 SSM2033 VCOs and 1 SSM2044 VCF, for replacement purposes). The filter will self-oscillate (and blow an amplifier), but can also be scaled 1:1 with frequency so that the resonator can act as a 5th oscillator (sine wave). The frequency modulator in the 'EFFECTS' section can be used with the VCF envelope for pitch envelope control. A triangle wave can be used as a sub-oscillator to beef up the bass of the other oscillators: set a widespread chord in chord memory and then use the arpeggiator, and then switch back and forth between poly/chord memory. The Mono/Poly can be used as a rhythm machine, by setting the instrument in 'Poly' and setting the different footages of the oscillators and the different waveshapes (triangle actually works best), and then using the ring modulator/frequency modulators with the Arpeggiator; adjust the envelopes accordingly to percussive settings and fiddle with the cut-off and noise from time to time to add tone color, and finally, set the LFO to pitch and set it at a considerable amplitude. Further, the pedal inputs can be routed from synths like the Korg MS-20 so that external oscillators can further modulate above what's already available. Because the VCOs have separate tuning controls they tend to be slightly out of tuning phase no matter how well they're tuned; to play chords that are in direct tuning phase, play the notes in a rapid, descending order from high to low. Like most analog synthesizers, it tends to scale better from high to low than low to high. The Mono/Poly is one of the vintage synthesizers reproduced by Korg for its software-based Legacy Collection. It can be used as a Virtual Studio Technology (VST) in common Digital audio workstations or as a stand-alone synth with any software compatible PC or Mac product. More recently, KORG introduced a mobile iOS application for iPad (iMono/Poly ), which faithfully reproduces the dynamics of the original.

They are commonly found on stony coral, Catalaphyllia and the sea anemone, Dofleinia armata. Morphology As an arthropod, A. magnificus, is segmented and bilaterally symmetrical. The body of the shrimp contains a hard external skeleton called, exoskeleton, made of chitin which periodically molts by a process called ecdysis. A. magnificus, has a compressed body composed of a cephalothorax, containing a head and a thorax attached to an elongated abdomen. It has five pairs of pereiopods, two pair of antennae, a mandible, and three pairs of maxillipeds. Most of A. magnificus have a transparent body, except on the carapace and segments of the abdomen, which have bands of white specks outlined in red. The tail and the hump on the abdomen are also white. Reproduction As other shrimps in the family Palaemonidae, A. magnificus, are gonochoric species. After molting, the female's exoskeleton is soft. During this time, the male is able to transfer a spermatophore to the female's exoskeleton. This allows the female to produce a large amount of eggs, which she carries under her abdomen. The female carries the eggs until they hatch. The eggs hatch into larvae form and then go through a series of transformations to become adult shrimps. A. magnificus grows up to 2.5 cm (1 in.) in size. Feeding and digestion Shrimps are typically scavengers, feeding on detritus at the bottom of the ocean. Other shrimps are filter feeders, which allow them to eat small food particles. A. magnificus as part of the subphylum Crustacea, possess a mouth to ingest food, which then passes through to be broken down by chitinous teeth that line the stomach. The stomach is connected to digestive glands, which secrete enzymes that absorb the nutrients of the food. Lastly, the digestion ends in the anus. Relationship with its environment thumb As with many shrimps of the Infraorder Caridea, cleaner shrimps have shown a symbiotic relationships with sponges, cnidarians, mollusks, fish, and other species. These relationships, in most cases, can be seen as a mutualistic because cleaner shrimps provide their services, such as cleaning services, nitrogen excretion, while the species' provide the cleaner shrimp protection from predators and sometimes a food source. In these types of relationships, both species work together to benefit one another. Some cleaner shrimps, like, A. magnificus, are relatively small and vulnerable to live by themselves, therefore, they need other organisms to live, in like sea anemones or stony corals.

Weaving *Ghalamkar *Iranian Termeh (weaving special table cloths) Termeh is a cloth which is woven since the Safavid era in Iran. There is an argument between researchers about its origin. In the past, the first step in termeh weaving was preparing its raw materials. So it was very important to be careful while preparing wool, washing and drying it. Weaving termeh needs proper wool which has long fibers. Usually the designs of Iranian termeh were the result of the co-operation between two main persons ‚Äì an expert and a worker. Weaving termeh was a very careful, sensitive and time consuming work that a good weaver could produce only 25 to 30 centimeters (1 feet) in a day. The background colors which are used in termeh are mostly jujube red, light red, green, orange and black. Termeh as a valuable textile has many different usages and patterns such as: * Checked pattern which is like a beehive and is used for tablecloth. * Stripped pattern which is of two models ‚Äì narrow and wide striped . * Atabaki pattern which was one of the kashmiri‚Äôs termeh used for expensive fabric because it was a finely woven termeh. Usually nobles and aristocrats used it as costly and nice cloth. * Zomorrodi pattern in which the green color was used more than the others. * Kashmiri (cashmere) in which the shape of deer‚Äôs horn was used for its design. Termeh is a very durable cloth in which fixed colors are used so it can be washed and dried easily. Nowadays termeh is mostly used for collectible tablecloth. These tablecloth are usually decorated with elaborate Persian embroidery called ‚Äúsermeh doozy‚Äù. *Kilims *Persian embroidery (broderi dzi) *Zaridozi (decorating fabrics by sewing with golden stitches) *Patteh Patteh is a wide piece of wool fabric which is needle worked with colored thread, mostly of silk.

Gershevitch (1985) p.154 Wood works *Moarragh *Wood carving Stone and mosaic *Ceramic and mosaic works *Turquoise Inlaying Turquoise Inlaying both on jewelry and containers includes a copper, brass, silver, nickel or bronze object on parts of the surface of which small pieces of turquoise are set in mosaic fashion thus giving the object a special glamor. The production of Turquoise Inlaying includes two general stages: A. Goldsmith Goldsmith includes the making and preparation of the object intended for Turquoise Inlaying using one of the metals indicated above. This is done by a goldsmith or forger using hands, press machine or both. After the object is formed generally, be it a piece of jewelry or a container, the part to be turquoise inlaid is demarked and a thin metal strand (of the same material as the metal used in the fabrication of the object) called ‚Äúkandan‚Äù is placed around and soldered onto it. This part around the intended form is a so-called wall standing two or three millimeters above the surface of the container. This is usually done by or sometimes the turquoise inlayer himself. If the part prepared for Turquoise Inlaying takes up too much of the surface with an empty looking background, strands of the same metal are used to place smaller patterns of decorative nature (such as flowers, bushes, etc.) inside it and soldered again. This both makes the work more beautiful and makes the turquoise inlaid surface stronger. B. Turquoise Inlaying First of all, the turquoise inlayer buys waste turquoise chips from turquoise forming workshops or turquoise mines in Mashhad, Neishabour or Damghan. Since such turquoise chips are usually accompanied by some earth and ordinary stone chips, they are first separated and cleaned. Then, the turquoise chips are graded based on their sizes so the right size turquoise chips are used in making each Turquoise Inlaying object in proportion to the surface area. In the next step, the object is heated (to about 30 ¬∞C) and, while heating, a ‚Äúwalnut lac‚Äù is sprinkled onto the parts that have to be turquoise laid so that the lac powder is almost melted and covers the intended surface. While the lac is still soft and sticky on the object surface, some of the turquoise chips that were prepared before based on their size are place on the work surface. The chips must be placed in a way so that no space is left between them as far as possible. In order to fill the possible gaps between turquoise chips, temperature is added (to about 40 ¬∞C) and some more lac powder is sprinkled onto the chips until the lac layer is softened to a melting form, and then try to fill all the spaces by adding smaller turquoise chips, or, as they say, the chips sit well on the surface. This is usually done by pressing the turquoise chips by hand onto the surface so that they stick fast to it. After the object is cooled, the lac covered parts become rigid. After that stage, the parts covered by lac and turquoise chips are polished with emery so the extra lac and little raised parts of the chips are flattened. That is the stage where the color of the turquoise chips becomes visible as turquoise and that of lac as black (or dark brown) in the spaces between the chips. After this stage is completed, if there is still some fallouts in some parts of the work, the object is heated again, and the empty parts are restored with small turquoise chips and lac. Then, the surface is polished and honed again. The restoration is sometimes done with a type of turquoise colored putty that is prepared with ‚Äúmol‚Äù mud, oil and lapis paint. The final stage of Turquoise Inlaying is burnishing which is done in two stages itself. The first stage consists of burnishing the metal parts which is done at a goldsmith or machining workshop where the opaque layer that is formed on the metal parts during Turquoise Inlaying is removed with hand tools or a machine blade, and then, those parts are polished so the metal becomes shiny. The second stage consists of burnishing the turquoise inlaid product. After polishing the metal parts of the object, the work is returned to the turquoise inlayer‚Äôs workshop where the turquoise inlaid surface is polished with olive or sesame oil so that part becomes shiny, too. A Turquois Inlaying craftsman employs different tools and devices for different stages of the job mostly including dies, hammers, drills, natural gas and gasoline torches, pincers, pliers, forceps, different metal pipes tweezers, files and emeries. The most important point in Turquoise Inlaying is correct installation of turquoise chips on the metal so that it is strong enough and the chips do not come off while burnishing the work. The other important point is that a piece of turquoise inlaid work will be of more artistic value if the turquoise chips are installed more regularly in close contact, i.e. without a space in between. *Sculpturing File:Persian Folklore Dress.jpg|Iranian Folkloric dress of Abyaneh File:Boite khatam.jpg|A sample of Iranian Khatamkari File:Iranian Termeh.jpg|A sample of Iranian Termeh File:ChosroesHuntingScene.JPG|Persian metal Engraving (golden plate),depicting King Anushirvan File:Persian Silk Brocade - Large Flower, Cypress - Seifollah Monajati Kashani - 1971.jpg|Persian Textile (The Golden Yarns of Zari - Brocade).

Early life and career Manigault was born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1824. His parents were Joseph and Charlotte Manigault. His grandfather, Peter Manigault, was the richest person in British North America in 1770. Joseph Manigault's great- great-grandfather was Pierre Manigault (1664‚Äì1729), a French Huguenot who was born in La Rochelle, France and settled in Charleston. His mother was both the daughter of Charles Drayton,A brother of Congressman William Henry Drayton and cousin to Jurist William Drayton a South Carolina Lt. Governor, and the granddaughter of Henry Middleton, the second President of the First Continental Congress, whose grandfather, Edward Middleton, emigrated from England via Barbados. Her uncle, Arthur Middleton, was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Manigault attended the College of Charleston, although he abandoned his studies to pursue an interest in business. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he served in the United States Army as a first lieutenant with the Palmetto Regiment. From 1847 to 1856, he was a businessman in Charleston. On April 15, 1850 he married Mary Proctor Huger, the granddaughter of Daniel Elliott Huger.{Daniel Huger wife was a daughter of Arthur Middleton} They had five children together. In 1856, he inherited a rice plantation in Georgetown County, South Carolina and moved there. Civil War A few days before the outbreak of the Civil War, Manigault participated in the Battle of Fort Sumter. He was colonel of the 10th South Carolina Infantry, and helped construct the batteries for the defense of Winyah Bay in Georgetown County. In March 1862, he was ordered to dismantle the coastal batteries and to ship the guns to Charleston. In April 1862, he was commanded to take his troops and report to General P. G. T. Beauregard with the Army of Mississippi.Official Records, Series 1, Vol. 1, p. 34; Vol. 6, pp. 268‚Äì69, 285, 417‚Äì418, 433‚Äì34. In northern Mississippi, Manigault saw action during the Siege of Corinth. Afterwards he served with the reorganized Army of Tennessee and saw action at the Battles of Stone's River and Chickamauga. He was present during the Battle of Missionary Ridge.Eicher, The Longest Night, p. 610. During the late spring and summer of 1864, he participated in the Atlanta Campaign. On April 26, 1863, he was promoted to brigadier general. During the war, he was wounded twice: first in Georgia at the Battle of Resaca in May 1864, and then at the Second Battle of Franklin during November 1864. His second injury prevented his return to active service. Postbellum activities After the war, Manigault returned to manage his rice plantation in South Carolina. From 1880 to 1886, he served as the Adjutant and Inspector General of South Carolina. He died in Georgetown County, South Carolina in 1886 and is buried in the Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston.Owens and Owens, Generals at Rest, p. 199.

Homophilic binding between SLAMs is involved in cell-to-cell adhesion during antigen presentation. Signaling lymphocytic activation molecules are a CD2-related surface receptor expressed by activated phagocytes, T helper cells, and platelets. SLAMs have a variety of functions, including enhancing T cellular proliferation by stimulating IL-4 and IFN-gamma production. SLAM family (SLAMF) receptors can interact directly with microbes, which can cause phagocytic cells to migrate to the area. SLAMF activation can trigger SLAM- associated protein (SAP) activation and a defective SAP can cause X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP).  Family Members  Members of the family include: * SLAMF1 (CD150) * SLAMF2 (CD48, FimH, 2B4) * SLAMF3 (CD229, LY9) * SLAMF4 (CD244) * SLAMF5 (CD84) * SLAMF6 (CD352) * SLAMF7 (CD319, CRACC) * SLAMF8 (CD353) * SLAMF9  Location and Function  SLAMFs are CD2-related surface receptors expressed by activated B and T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, and platelets, although different SLAMF receptors have varying expression patterns. SLAMF receptors are cell surface transmembrane molecules that can interact directly with microbes, which can cause phagocytic cells to migrate to the area. SLAMF1 and SLAMF6 are known to directly interact with outer membrane porins on gram negative bacteria. SLAMF1 is a known receptor for the measles virus and also serves as an opsonin for phagocytic cells, enhancing phagocytosis by localizing to phagosomes and inducing a signaling cascade resulting in enhanced fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes. SLAMF2 is known bind gram negative bacteria and is internalized after binding, promoting phagocytosis. SLAMFs are also involved in immune cell communication; SLAMFs are co- stimulatory molecules for both T-cells and NK cells. SLAMs enhance T helper cell proliferation by increasing IFN-gamma and IL-4 production.  Structure  This diagram shows the signaling pathway for a SLAMF1 receptor in a CD4 T-helper cell. It depicts SAP (Slam-Associated Protein) outcompeting EAT-2 (Ewing‚Äôs sarcoma-associated transcript 2) using a 3-pronged binding pattern to ITSMs on the SLAMF. The ITSMs do not necessarily need to be phosphorylated for SAP to bind, but they do need to be phosphorylated for EAT-2 to bind. SAP binding leads to Fyn recruitment and eventually IL-4 and IFN-gamma release. All members of the SLAMF family are classified as type I glycoproteins and share an amino-terminal IgV variable domain and a membrane-adjacent IgC2 constant domain, along with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs). The IgV and IgC2 domains are located on the extracellular portion of the receptor, while the ITSMs are used for signaling within the cell. SLAMFs can undergo alternative splicing, which can generate different isoforms of the SLAMF molecules that have different numbers of ITSMs and tyrosines, potentially with different functions. Proteins with SH2 domains are able to bind these ITSMs to initiate signaling cascades within the cell. SLAMF2 and SLAMF4 interact with one another, but all other SLAMF receptors are self- ligands, meaning that they interact with the corresponding receptor on other cells in a homophilic way.  Uses in Immunotherapy  SLAMFs are potential targets for immunotherapy. For example, elotuzumab is an anti-SLAMF7 humanized monoclonal antibody used to treat multiple myeloma. SLAMF7 is a self-ligand over-expressed in plasma cells of multiple myeloma patients. Elotuzumab stimulates NK cells to release granzyme through blocking SLAMF7, through triggering antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and through NK cell activation via Ewing‚Äôs sarcoma-associated transcript 2 (EAT-2). EAT-2 is known to bind to phosphorylated tyrosines on ITSMs and alter cytokine production. Elotuzumab also blocks multiple myeloma cells from interacting with one another via the SLAMF7 ligand.  SLAM-Associated Protein (SAP)  The X-linked SLAM-associated protein (SAP), encoded by the SH2D1A gene, consists primarily of an SH2 domain which can interact with ITSMs present on most SLAMF receptors. Unlike most SH2 binding proteins, SAP does not require tyrosines on the ITSMs to be phosphorylated prior to binding. SAP is expressed in lymphocytes (specifically NK cells and T cells, but not usually B cells), eosinophils, and platelets. A defective SLAM associated protein (SAP) causes X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP), a frequently lethal mononucleosis characterized by inability to respond to infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), leading to a failure to clear B-cells infected with the virus, which can be fatal.

Methodology Darnton, influenced Clifford Geertz who was a colleague of Darton's and had pioneered the approach of \\"thick description\\" in cultural anthropology, aimed to gain greater insight into the period and social groups involved by studying what he perceived to be something which appeared alien to the late modern mind ‚Äì the fact that killing cats might be funny. The book containing this account, The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History, has become one of Darnton's most popular writings; it has been published in eighteen languages.Faculty, Harvard University Department of History, 2015. Accessed 2015-12-10. Darnton describes how, as the apprentices suffered hard conditions, they came to resent the favours which their masters gave to their cats, and contrived to deal with the nuisance cats by slaughtering them so as to distress their masters. Darnton interprets this as an early form of workers' protest. (As may the wife in the story, who says she believes that \\"they were threatened by a more serious kind of insubordination\\" beyond the simple stoppage of work.) The cats were a favourite of the printer's wife and were fed much better than the apprentices, who were in turn served \\"catfood\\" (rotting meat scraps). Aside from this, they were mistreated, beaten and exposed to cold and horrible weather. One of the apprentices imitated a cat by screaming like one for several nights, making the printer and his wife despair. Finally, the printer ordered the cats rounded up and dispatched. The apprentices did this, rounded up all the cats they could find, beat them half to death and held a 'trial'. They found the cats guilty of witchcraft and sentenced them to death by hanging. Darton concluded: Darnton's approach to the historical texts he uses, both in the Cat Massacre chapter and others in the volume, has been criticised since shortly after the work's appearance for its simplistic assumptions. An early exchange between Darnton and French cultural historian Roger Chartier was subjected to a scathing analysis by Dominic LaCapra of the 'Great Symbol Massacre' involved.LaCapra, D. (1988).

It is located at 630 West 168th Street in Manhattan, New York City. According to American Dental Education Association, CDM is one of the most selective dental schools in the United States based on average DAT score, GPA, and acceptance rate. In 2014, 2,029 people applied for 80 positions in its entering class. The median undergraduate GPA and average DAT score for successful applicants in 2014 were 3.7 and 23, respectively. History The College of Dental Medicine traces its origin to 1852, as the New York College of Dentistry, later the New York College of Dental and Oral Surgery. In 1916 Columbia University, recognizing dentistry as an integral part of the health sciences, established its own school of dental education and absorbed both the New York Post-graduate School of Dentistry and the New York School of Dental Hygiene. In 1923, the New York College of Dentistry merged with the New York College of Dental and Oral Surgery to form the present School of Dental and Oral Surgery of Columbia University. In January 2006, the School of Dental and Oral Surgery was renamed the Columbia University College of Dental Medicine. Education Like most American dental schools, the College of Dental Medicine at Columbia offers the following academic programs: *Advanced Education in General Dentistry Certificate (AEGD) Program *General Practice Residency *Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology Residency *Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery/MD Residency *Pediatric Dentistry Residency *Dental Public Health Program *Endodontics Program *Implantology Program *Orthodontics Program *Periodontics Program *Prosthodontics Program Research The College of Dental Medicine possesses several research facilities, including the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Laboratory as well as the Center for Craniofacial Regeneration. The faculty engages in wide-ranging areas of research, from Oropharyngeal Cancer to Biomaterials/Regenerative Biology/Stem Cells, Neuroscience and Pain, Microbial Pathogenesis/Microbiome, Behavioral and Social Sciences/Population Oral Health, and Systemic and Oral Disease Interactions. Columbia University has a long-standing, rich history in dental education and research. Dr. Gies (1872-1956), a professor of Biochemistry at the College of Physicians & Surgeons and a founder of the College of Dental Medicine, is recognized as a pioneer in the profession. He was an advocate for rigorous medical and scientific instruction in dental education. In the early 1950s the Birnberg Research Medal Award of the Dental Alumni of Columbia University was established to encourage dental research excellence and help stimulate public interest in support of dental research.

Member of the interdisciplinary Groupe ¬µ. President of the International Association for visual Semiotics.  Biography  Jean-Marie Klinkenberg, born in 1944 in Verviers (Belgium), received his Masters (1967) and his Doctorate (1971) in Romance Philology at the State University of Li√®ge. He teaches language studies at the University of Li√®ge, focusing on rhetoric and semiotics. He also teaches French-language literature (particularly Belgian and Qu√©b√©cois). His scientific activities focus on two areas: linguistics/semiotics and French-speaking cultures. In the first area, he made his mark in the late 1960s by revitalizing the field of rhetoric as a member of the interdisciplinary team known as the ¬µ Group. More recently, he has helped to steer semiotics in a social, cognitivist direction. His writings on semiotics and rhetoric have been translated into 15 or more languages. In the second field, he has modernized the study of the arts in Belgium by casting them in a social and institutional light, an approach that can be readily transferred to the other French-speaking cultures he has studied (such as Quebec's) and by establishing inter-university research programs. He founded and chairs Belgium's Centre d‚Äô√âtudes des Lettres Francophones. He is president of the International Association for visual semiotics.

Constructed in 1823, it is the oldest public building in Franklin. It is nationally significant as the site of negotiations leading to the Treaty of Franklin, the first Indian removal treaty agreed after passage of the 1830 Indian Removal Act. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973. and It continues to serve the local Masonic lodge. Description and history The Hiram Masonic Lodge is located in downtown Franklin, on the east side of 2nd Avenue South, between Main and Church Streets. It is a three-story brick building with Gothic Revival features. The front facade is five bays wide, with a false front extending above the gabled roof to a crenellated parapet with pyramid-topped posts and a central gable. Windows on the facade are narrow lancet-arches, set in two-story round-arch panels in the outer bays, and in a lancet-arched bay in the center. The interior has large meeting spaces on the first two floors and offices and storage on the smaller third floor. The building houses Hiram Lodge No. 7, founded in 1809. It was built in 1823, and is the oldest public building in Franklin and the oldest Masonic Hall in continuous use in Tennessee. In 1830, it was the site of negotiations between the Chickasaw Indians and a commission headed by President Andrew Jackson, which resulted in the Treaty of Franklin. This treaty, the first of the Indian removal agreements made in the wake of the 1830 Indian Removal Act, called for the Chickasaw to sell their lands and move west to today's Oklahoma. The treaty was never ratified, and the Chickasaw were later forced into the Treaty of Pontotoc Creek. During the American Civil War, the building was used as a hospital for wounded Union soldiers after the Battle of Franklin.

It is issued to people on work visas/work authorisations, to the spouse of an Irish citizen, to the spouse of an EU citizen (Stamp 4 EUFam), to refugees, to people with Irish Born Child residency and those with long-term residency status. Once a person has been granted Stamp 4 status by the Irish Department of Justice and Equality, he or she is to report to their local Garda National Immigration Bureau in order to receive the physical card, or \\"Certificate of Registration\\".

In Ireland, applications for the Residence Card, are made on form EUTR1 and sent to the EU Treaty Rights Section of the Department of Justice. Article 10(1) of the Directive requires that such applications are processed within six months of submission. Once processed, a letter is sent to the applicant, instructing him or her to visit their local Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), in order to receive their Residence Card. The Residence Card comes in the form of a \\"Certificate of Registration\\" like any other issued by the GNIB, however a crucial distinction is made in that \\"Stamp 4 EUFam\\" is printed as the stamp number. This serves to confirm that the holder is a family member of an EEA national who is resident in Ireland in accordance with Directive 2004/38/EC. The Residence Card is valid for five years.

Lead guitarist Ash Poon during a show at the Media Club in Vancouver in June 2009. Lead singer Andrew Lee at It Was Warm and Sunny's album release show at the Biltmore Cabaret in Vancouver (July 16, 2011). In Medias Res (also known as IMR) is an indie rock band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The band consists of Andrew Lee (lead vocals and guitar), Ash Poon (lead guitar), Ryan Flowers (bass) and Robert Tornroos (drums). The band's original drummer, Steve Watts, left in 2011. After forming in 1999, In Medias Res have released one EP and two full-length albums, Of What Was (2003) and It Was Warm and Sunny When We First Set Out (2011). They have been categorized in the media as alternative, post-rock and math rock, while being stylistically compared to such bands as Pedro the Lion, Radiohead and TV on the Radio. Background Prior to the In Medias Res' formation, Lee and Poon played in a band with the latter's older brother and another bassist. They won a Battle of the Bands show at Lee's high school, competing against another group that Flowers and Tornroos played in (Lee, Flowers and Tornroos attended the same high school). After Poon's brother left town, Watts joined the band, having known the group's members from summer camp. Playing out of a church basement, In Medias Res formed in 1999. A year later, Flowers replaced the band's original bassist. The band's name, frequently misspelled or mispronounced in the media and at shows, is a literary term referring to a narrative that begins in the rising action portion of a story; translated from Latin, it means \\"in the middle of things.\\" Poon has explained that the band \\"chose the name because the middle is where the real story is, like our music.\\" During the band's early years, they all lived separately in Richmond, British Columbia, with the exception of Watts, who resided in nearby Surrey. Watts has recalled wanting to quit at one point in the band's beginning stages until they played a show in 2000 with Seattle indie band Pedro the Lion, a band they grew up idolizing. Poon has further identified opening for Pedro the Lion as a turning point in the band's career, commenting \\"It...let us know that we could make this a viable musical endeavor.\\" The show was held at Trinity Western University, where the band played regularly and subsequently developed much of their early fan base. Early self-proclaimed musical influences include Pedro the Lion, the Appleseed Cast, and Radiohead, while Lee has cited Scottish poet Robert Burns as a lyrical inspiration. Studio releases After selling out 500 copies of their second EP, Intimacy, In Medias Res independently released Of What Was, their first full-length album, in April 2003 to favourable local reviews. Distributed by Vancouver's Scratch Records, In Medias Res sold out their initial 1,000 copies of the album within a year-and-a-half, before re-releasing it under local label Anniedale Records on May 24, 2005. (By the time of their next full-length release in January 2011, Of What Was sold over 2,000 copies.) Watts has described the album as a turning point in the band's musical identity, referring to their previous work as more characteristic of their collective stylistic taste in such bands as Pedro the Lion and Radiohead. It was produced by Jonathan Anderson of Jonathan Inc., a fellow Vancouver indie act, who In Medias Res has worked and performed with extensively. Following their debut LP's re-release under Anniedale, In Medias Res took six years to put forth their next effort, sparking rumours of the band's dissolution during the period in between. Lee later commented on the band's seeming hiatus, stating that they were in \\"too comfortable\\" a state that \\"didn't require [them] to push.\\" He added that \\"We had to field all kinds of rumours as people wondered if were still together, which didn't help the situation that was brewing internally.\\" In 2006, an article featuring an interview with In Medias Res stated that the band was working on new material. Leading up to their second LP, the band made a new 11-minute track entitled \\"The Dark Crystal\\" available for download on Bandcamp.com. Released on December 15, 2010, the band allowed the track to be purchased on a name-your- price basis. \\"The Dark Crystal\\" was recorded Mushroom Studios (Vancouver) in 2008 and featured cover art re-appropriated from a Norwegian photographer. Watt declared it in an earlier interview as \\"one of the best pieces [they have] ever written/recorded.\\" The following month, nearly eight years after the initial release of their first LP, In Medias Res digitally self-released It Was Warm And Sunny When We First Set Out on January 4, 2011. The 10-track album was recorded primarily at Mushroom Studios and Sapphire Sound in Vancouver, while being produced once more by Jonathan Anderson, who also contributed vocals and instrumentals for the album, as well as Dave Carswell and John Collins. Positively reviewed by local publications, including The Georgia Straight and The Vancouver Sun, the album was categorized as post- rock, yielding \\"atypical pop song structures\\" and stylistic comparisons to Radiohead and Coldplay. Tracks \\"Final Flight of the Bees\\", \\"This Could Be The One\\" and \\"Tonight I Am New\\" were consistently singled out as album highlights by reviewers. On June 23, In Medias Res signed with Vancouver label File Under: Music, facilitating the hard-copy release of It Was Warm and Sunny 18 days later. Several months later, in October 2011, they released a music video for \\"Hollis\\", the eighth track on the album. A second music video was released in conjunction with their March 2012 tour for \\"This Could Be The One\\". Produced by Flowers, the video featured a friend of the band, Jimmy Leung, bodybuilding. Following drummer Steve Watts' departure from the band (in order to pursue his studies in Scotland; he was replaced by Robert Tornroos), In Medias Res began to experiment with a more ambient sound. Featuring a lap steel guitar, keyboard and synthesized beats, the band released Variations on March 3, 2012. The two-track EP contained re-arrangements of \\"Come Back Down\\" and \\"The Dark Crystal\\". It was recorded live off the floor at Buena Vista Studios (Vancouver) by Anderson. Two years after It Was Warm and Sunny, the band released \\"The Center\\", a track intended for the second LP, but was ultimately left out. Live performances and touring In Medias Res is known for their energetic live performances. After playing a show in a smaller-sized Vancouver venue in February 2011, a concert review declared that the location \\"could not contain the band's intense sound.\\" Lead guitarist Ash Poon is known to have his eyeglasses fall off of his face, or to inadvertently break his strings as a byproduct of the band's on-stage movement and intensity. Lee's voice has been described in live performances as \\"broken\\", yet \\"emotive\\". In the years between their first two LPs, they have refined their setlist for acoustic and symphonic arrangements to perform as an alternative to their usual shows. The re-arranged songs, complemented by a violin and cello, are not available on any studio recordings, however. Aside from playing local venues in Vancouver, In Medias Res has toured throughout North America. In the band's early years, they played shows around Western Canada, travelling as far as Winnipeg, Manitoba, on two occasions. In 2005, they embarked on a three- month, North American tour, supporting Of What Was's re-release under Anniedale Records. Spanning from May 21 to July 17, the tour featured 42 dates, including a hometown show at the Pacific Coliseum. After releasing It Was Warm and Sunny under File Under: Music in July 2011, In Medias Res announced a month-long, 12-date Canadian tour, beginning with a show in Vancouver. While the majority of the tour took place in Ontario, there were dates in Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well. During a stop in Lethbridge, Alberta, on August 2, the band was featured on Global Lethbridge's Scene and Heard segment. After returning from their tour, Lee and Flowers performed in support of their album on Global BC's Morning News Caf√© on August 22. The band embarked on another tour beginning in mid-November for what was planned to be a month-long, ten-stop circuit in the Pacific Northwest. It was stopped short in early-December when Lee's father was diagnosed with terminal thyroid cancer. The band cancelled their remaining tour dates as Lee travelled to Regina, Saskatchewan, to be with his father in the hospital. While in Regina, he recorded an acoustic version of \\"Come Back Down\\", a track from It Was Warm and Sunny, in the hospital parking lot. The track was offered online by donation with all proceeds going to Lee's family. Several months later, the band returned to the road with a 16-stop North American tour in March 2012. In Medias Res has also participated in such annual summer festivals as the Woodsong Arts and Music Festival in Orcas Island, Washington, and Sled Island in Calgary, Alberta. They have shared the stage with such notable acts as Pedro the Lion/David Bazan, Stabilo, Damien Jurado, Emery, Delirious?, Death From Above 1979, Rosie Thomas, You Say Party! We Say Die! and Ladyhawk. Personal lives Providing a background for Lee's lyrics is his education in writing and philosophy, which he received at Capilano College in North Vancouver and Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia. Flowers also attended both Capilano and Simon Fraser, studying film; he has produced short films that have played at the Toronto International Film Festival. Poon, meanwhile, has worked as a radio producer. After graduating with a Master's in theology at Regent College in Vancouver (on the University of British Columbia's campus), Watts left the band following It Was Warm and Sunny's release to further pursue his education in Scotland.

On 29 February 2008, the author as well as her lawyers admitted that the bestselling book was fictional, despite it having been presented as autobiographical. In 2014 a court ordered Defonseca to repay her publisher $22 million. Biography Plaque in Schaerbeek to employees of the local government who \\"died for the nation\\" in the Second World War. The blank line at the bottom once held De Wael's father's name. Defonseca was born Monique de Wael, the daughter of Catholic parents who were arrested, deported, and murdered by the Nazis for being resistance members. After her parents' arrest, Monique was sent to live with her grandparents, then her uncle. In the local community, she was known as the \\"daughter of the traitor,\\" as her father was accused of disclosing secrets to the Nazis during his imprisonment. After being liberated, her father's name was erased from the stone plaque in honour of the local Nazi-victim employees on the walls of the Schaerbeek municipality.Survivre avec les loups : la v√©ritable histoire de Misha Defonseca, by Lionel Duroy, XO, 2012 Defonseca and her husband, Maurice, moved to the United States from Paris in 1988 and bought a house in Millis, Massachusetts. He was unemployed by the mid-1990s. Defonseca began to fantasize a vivid story about her childhood, including having wandered across Europe at the age of six after her parents were deported in 1941, being sheltered by friendly packs of wolves, killing a German soldier in self- defence, sneaking into and out of the Warsaw Ghetto, and finding her way home at the end of the war. Jane Daniel, a local book publisher, convinced Defonseca to write a memoir about her alleged past after she heard the writer tell the story in a Massachusetts synagogue. Daniel published Misha: A Memoire of the Holocaust Years in 1997 through her \\"one woman operation\\", Mt. Ivy Press. Prior to the uncovering of the hoax, the book had spawned a multimillion-dollar legal battle between Defonseca and the book's ghostwriter, Vera Lee, against Jane Daniel and her small publishing company, Mt. Ivy Press. Daniel and Defonseca fell out over profits received from the best-selling book, which led to a lawsuit. In 2005, a Boston court ordered Daniel to pay Defonseca and Lee $22.5 million. Defonseca's lawyers said Daniel has not paid the court-ordered sum. Following her admission, a court in 2014 ordered Defonseca to repay the full amount. Despite the book's popularity, many critics pointed to passages that were logically or historically implausible. The first person who publicly doubted the authenticity of the story was Henryk M. Broder, who wrote an article about Defonseca in 1996 for the German newspaper Der Spiegel.Verliebt in eine tote Kobra, Der Spiegel 50/1996, 9 December 1996 In late February 2008, a baptismal certificate from a Brussels church for a Monique De Wael and a register from an elementary school near the De Waels' home that shows Monique enrolled there in September 1943 ‚Äì two years after Misha claimed to have left Brussels ‚Äì were posted by Jane Daniel on her blog. Belgian national newspaper Le Soir soon reported these findings. Finally the leading historian of the Shoah in Belgium, the late Dr. Maxime Steinberg, pointed out the story's historical anomalies and errors.Maxime Steinberg: Homepage. On 29 February 2008, Defonseca admitted to Le Soir that she had fabricated the tale, after she had been presented with what the paper described as \\"irrefutable\\" evidence that her story was false. \\"The book is a story, it's my story\\", said the writer in a statement issued under her real name. \\"It's not the true reality, but it is my reality. There are times when I find it difficult to differentiate between reality and my inner world.\\" Defonseca told Le Soir that she had always wanted to forget her real name because she had been called \\"the traitor's daughter.\\" Forensic genealogists Sharon Sergeant and Colleen M.

Created in 1964, its main tasks are research and public service in space aeronomy, which is the physics and chemistry of the atmosphere of the Earth and other planets, and of outer space. The scientists rely on ground-based, balloon-, air- or space-borne instruments and computer models. History On 25 November 1964 the Aeronomical Service is separated from the Royal Meteorological Institute (RMI) and lives on as a scientific institution of the state with the name: Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (BIRA-IASB). In 2014, BIRA-IASB celebrates its 50th anniversary and gains its royal statute. On this occasion, the Institute gathered 50 important events in its history. The institute has as main competence, tasks of public service and research in the domain of Space Aeronomy. BIRA-IASB mostly works with data acquired via rockets and artificial satellites for research to the physical and chemical structure of the higher atmosphere and extraterrestrial space. The first director is M. Nicolet. Activities BIRA-IASB * focuses on Chemistry & Physics of Atmospheres and Space Plasma Physics * designs and builds instruments to monitor atmospheres and the space environment * operates Belgian experiments on board the International Space Station and other satellites * participates in international measurement programmes * compares observations with numerical simulations to validate and improve our knowledge * turns scientific know-how into services to the benefit of society * disseminates this knowledge through publications, web services and public outreach. Chemistry and physics of atmospheres BIRA-IASB studies the Earth's stratosphere by looking at ozone depletion and related key parameters like volcanic aerosols, polar stratospheric clouds and halogenated compounds. Long-term changes are evaluated and forecasting capabilities have been developed. The research supports the Montreal Protocol on the protection of the ozone layer. BIRA-IASB also studies Earth tropospheric chemistry, with a focus on natural and manmade emissions, like SO2 and NO2, tropospheric ozone precursors, the relationship to air quality and the evolution of greenhouse gases in support of the Kyoto Protocol. Forecasting of chemical weather is being developed. BIRA-IASB examines the solar radiation and its penetration to the surfaces of the Earth. It monitors the long-term changes of the UV radiation. BIRA-IASB also contributes to research on planetary atmospheres, in particular Mars and Venus. Space plasma physics The Sun fills interplanetary space with plasma, a gas of charged particles, in the form of a constant solar wind. Also the Earth's outer atmosphere, the magnetosphere, is filled with plasma, just like the environments of many other Solar System objects. The Institute has built a strong theory and modeling programme, deeply rooted in observations provided by ESA's space missions, Ulysses, Cluster and Rosetta spacecraft. BIRA-IASB has extensive expertise in: *The dynamic behavior of the outer magnetospheric boundary in response to the variable solar wind, which controls the energy input from the solar wind into the magnetosphere. *The interaction between the outer magnetosphere and the corotating plasma in the inner magnetosphere. *The coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere as manifested by the aurora or polar lights These modeling efforts help to mitigate the empiricism still prevailing in present-day space weather forecasting. Services BIRA-IASB provides products and services that fulfill needs of the user community. * Solar UV index for the public * Assessments of the state of the atmosphere to support policy makers * Accumulated ionising radiation dose predictions for the space industry Services related to the Earth's atmosphere include stratospheric ozone forecasting, air quality global analysis and prediction, volcanic emission warnings, satellite data validation and tropospheric emission monitoring. These services will be integrated in international initiatives like the European led GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security). In the domain of Space Weather BIRA-IASB focuses on ionising space radiation and its effects. These services are exploited in the context of the Belgian Solar- Terrestrial Centre of Excellence. Tools, methods and procedures are set up to deliver these services to the user community (European Space Weather portal). BIRA-IASB, through the Belgian User Support and Operation Centre (BUSOC), provides support and infrastructure to scientific teams to prepare, develop and operate space experiments. BUSOC is the operations center for the Solar Monitoring Observatory on board the International Space Station and the scientific mission center for the CNES solar observation satellite PICARD.

A safety rating is determined by a compliance review, an on-site examination of motor carrier operations, such as drivers' hours of service, maintenance and inspection, driver qualification, commercial drivers' license requirements, financial responsibility, accidents, hazardous materials, and other safety and transportation records to determine whether a motor carrier meets the safety fitness standard. A compliance review may be conducted in response to a request to change a safety rating, to investigate potential violations of safety regulations by motor carriers, or to investigate complaints, or other evidence of safety violations. The compliance review may result in the initiation of an enforcement action. One of three safety ratings will be issued following a compliance review: Satisfactory - A Satisfactory rating means that a motor carrier has in place and functioning adequate safety management controls to meet the safety fitness standard prescribed in ¬ß385.5 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR). Safety management controls are adequate if they are appropriate for the size and type of operation of the particular motor carrier. Conditional - This rating means a motor carrier does not have adequate safety management controls in place to ensure compliance with the safety fitness standard found in ¬ß385.5 of the FMCSR. Unsatisfactory - An Unsatisfactory rating means a motor carrier does not have adequate safety management controls in place to ensure compliance with the safety fitness standard which has resulted in occurrences listed in ¬ß385.5 (a) through (k)of the FMCSR. Generally, a motor carrier rated unsatisfactory is prohibited from operating a CMV. If a proposed unsatisfactory safety rating becomes final, the FMCSA will issue an order placing its interstate operations out of service. Any motor carrier that operates CMVs in violation of this section will be subject to the penalty provisions listed in 49 U.S.C. 521(b). 'What you can do: - All companies have a window after an audit where they can appeal the decision by proving they made an effort to improve their situation. This can include doing an entire company overhaul, replacing management, or hiring a reputable consultant to be on retainer for future incidents. Records requests A carrier's current safety rating can be found on safer.fmcsa.dot.gov. The Safety and Fitness Electronic Records (SAFER) System offers company safety data to industry and the public over the internet. Data from the SAFER website is pulled from the Motor Carrier Management Information System, a database administered by the FMCSA. MCMIS contains information on the safety fitness of commercial motor carriers and hazardous material (HM) shippers subject to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and the Hazardous Materials Regulations. A number of reports are available from the MCMIS. Anyone may request these reports for a fee, however, a \\"Company Snapshot\\" is available to the public, free of charge. This information includes: *Carrier Legal Name/Doing Business As (DBA) Name *Complete Address (Physical/Mailing) *US Department of Transportation (DOT) Number *Carrier Operation (e.g. Private/For Hire) *Cargo(s) Carried *Hazardous Material(s) Carried *Fleet Size *Number of Drivers *Total Crashes *Number of Fatalities/Injuries/Disabled Vehicles *Total Inspections *Number of Violations for Drivers/Vehicles *Safety Rating Criticism of the effectiveness of motor carrier safety ratings The audit activity and the resultant motor carrier safety rating has been criticized for being imperfect, and perhaps misleading. Studies have shown that for a considerable number of audit items, correlation coefficients between audit item outcome and actual safety performance have counter-intuitive signs: the better the compliance rating of firms, the worse their accident rates. Some elements of the audit are important predictors of actual safety performance, in particular questions concerning if a safety director is appointed, and background checks on new drivers. Nevertheless, \\"the overall conclusion is that the worse a firm does on a large part of the audit, the worse its accident record\\".

New York Yankees, 346 U.S. 356 (1953), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld, 7‚Äì2, the antitrust exemption first granted to Major League Baseball (MLB) three decades earlier in Federal Baseball Club v. National League. It was also the first challenge to the reserve clause which prevented free agency, and one of the first cases heard and decided by the Warren Court. Since it presumed that Congress's failure to act in the years since Federal Baseball Club was an implicit expression of intent to keep baseball exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act, it has been read as having done more to create that exemption than the older case. Two justices (Stanley Forman Reed and Harold Hitz Burton) dissented from the short, unsigned per curiam majority opinion, arguing MLB and its revenue sources had changed enough since 1922 that the logic of that case no longer applied. In 1972, a third justice (William O. Douglas) would express his regret at having joined the majority when Toolson was again upheld in the similar Flood v. Kuhn.  Background  George Earl Toolson was a pitcher with the Newark Bears in 1949, a farm team for the New York Yankees in the AAA- class International League. He believed he was good enough to play in the major leagues, if not for the Yankees then for another team. But due to the reserve clause in his and every other player's contract, under which teams reserved rights to a player for a year after the contract expired, he was effectively bound to the talent-rich Yankees and could not negotiate a new contract with another team. When the Newark franchise was dissolved prior to the 1950 season, he was demoted by the Yankees' organization to the Binghamton Triplets, an A-class team within its minor league system. He refused to report and instead filed suit, arguing the reserve clause was a restraint of trade and that baseball should not be exempt from antitrust laws. = Baseball antitrust exemption = In 1922, in an opinion by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., a unanimous court held in Federal Baseball Club that professional baseball did not meet the definition of interstate commerce under the Constitution and the Sherman Act because, although teams traveled between states from game to game, that travel was \\"incidental\\" to the business and not an essential aspect, since all the revenue was generated from the actual games.Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore v. National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, 259 U.S. 200 et seq., Holmes, J. By the time Toolson filed his suit, baseball had grown greatly in popularity and as such had changed. Improved roads and public transportation meant that fans in some areas crossed state lines to attend games, and radio and television broadcasts, from which the teams derived substantial revenue, brought those games to the fans who did not leave home. The interstate aspects of the professional game had greatly increased. In 1947, Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler was sued by former New York Giants outfielder Danny Gardella, who argued that the five-year ban Chandler imposed on players who, like Gardella, had jumped briefly to the rival Mexican League was an unfair use of monopoly power and that the Federal Baseball Club decision no longer applied. A preliminary ruling in favor of the baseball commissioner was reversed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, returning the case to the lower court for trial. In 1949, Chandler settled with Gardella for a reported $65,000. Gardella initially sought $300,000, settling for less on his lawyers' advice he would lose on appeal to the Supreme Court. In 1951, Brooklyn congressman Emanuel Celler, an advocate for strong antitrust enforcement, had chaired a special Judiciary Committee subcommittee on monopoly power, which had looked into baseball, among other things. It had been strongly critical, but took no action because of the pending court cases from other Mexican League players. = Trial and appeal = Both the district court in Los Angeles and the Ninth Circuit relied on Federal Baseball Club in ruling for the defendants. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear it and consider a number of other cases by former Mexican League players pending at the appellate level. Among the lawyers working on the case for baseball was Bowie Kuhn, then of the prestigious firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, who would later himself become baseball commissioner and the respondent in Flood v. Kuhn, the next case to challenge the reserve clause. When the case reached the Supreme Court, the Boston Red Sox filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the Yankees, their bitter rival.As Boston American League Base Ball Company, the team's corporate name. 349 U.S. 356. Since the Second Circuit, in reinstating Gardella's challenge, had called Federal Baseball \\"an impotent zombi\\" in light of recent Supreme Court antitrust decisions,Gardella v. Chandler, 172 F.2d 402, 408-09 (1949) (Frank, J., concurring). baseball did not expect the Court to rule in its favor.  Opinion of the Court  A one-paragraph unsigned per curiam opinion was followed by a longer dissent by Justice Harold Hitz Burton, joined by Stanley Forman Reed. = Majority = After briefly restating the conclusion of Federal Baseball Club, the majority continued: = Dissent = Burton listed a number of aspects of contemporary baseball‚Äîthe extensive farm system, broadcasting revenues, national advertising campaigns and even its reach beyond the borders of the United States‚Äîto justify his statement that \\"it is a contradiction in terms to say that the defendants in the cases before us are not now engaged in interstate trade or commerce as those terms are used in the Constitution of the United States and in the Sherman Act\\". He also cited a report by a House subcommittee that had come to a similar conclusion. He conceded \\"the major asset which baseball is to our Nation, the high place it enjoys in the hearts of our people, and the possible justification of special treatment for organized sports which are engaged in interstate trade or commerce\\".Id., Burton J., dissenting. But while it was certainly within Congress's power to repeal or specifically enact an antitrust exemption for baseball, it had not done so, \\"and no court has demonstrated the existence of an implied exemption from that Act of any sport that is so highly organized as to amount to an interstate monopoly or which restrains interstate trade or commerce\\". He concluded \\"The present popularity of organized baseball increases, rather than diminishes, the importance of its compliance with standards of reasonableness comparable with those now required by law of interstate trade or commerce.\\"Id. at 364-65.  Subsequent developments  = Jurisprudence = Within the next few terms, Toolson's logic was criticized directly and indirectly by other justices, including some who had been in the majority, in dissents from opinions in which the Court held that it was specific to baseball and that even other professional sports weren't covered. Chief Justice Earl Warren admitted, writing for the majority two years later when denying boxing the exemption, that \\"this Court has never before considered the antitrust status of the boxing business. Yet, if it were not for Federal Baseball and Toolson, we think that it would be too clear for dispute.\\"United States v. International Boxing Club of New York, 348 U.S. 236, 240 (1955), Warren, C.J. Dissenters Felix Frankfurter and Sherman Minton, who were in the Toolson majority, were harshly critical. \\"It would baffle the subtlest ingenuity to find a single differentiating factor between other sporting exhibitions ...and baseball insofar as the conduct of the sport is relevant to the criteria or considerations by which the Sherman Law becomes applicable to a 'trade or commerce.'\\", the former wrote. \\"I cannot translate even the narrowest conception of stare decisis into the equivalent of writing into the Sherman Law an exemption of baseball to the exclusion of every other sport different not one legal jot or tittle from it.\\"Id., 248-250, Frankfurter J., dissenting. Minton, in his dissent, added: Another two years passed, and Radovich v. National Football League came before the Court. The circumstances of professional football at the time were almost identical to those of baseball, yet the Court ruled that the antitrust exemption was specific to the latter. Tom C. Clark, writing for a majority of six, defended the Toolson decision as preferable to the alternative: \\"[M]ore harm would be done in overruling Federal Baseball than in upholding a ruling which, at best, was of dubious validity\\"Radovich v. National Football League, 352 U.S. 445, 450, Clark, J. and admitted \\"were we considering the question of baseball for the first time upon a clean slate, we would have no doubts.\\"Id. at 452. Frankfurter again expressed his incredulity. \\"...[T]he most conscientious probing of the text and the interstices of the Sherman Law fails to disclose that Congress, whose will we are enforcing, excluded baseball ‚Äî the conditions under which that sport is carried on ‚Äî from the scope of the Sherman Law, but included football\\", he said.Id. at 455, Frankfurter, J., dissenting. He was joined in a separate opinion by John Marshall Harlan II signed by then-new justice William Brennan: \\" I am unable to distinguish football from baseball under the rationale of Federal Baseball and Toolson, and can find no basis for attributing to Congress a purpose to put baseball in a class by itself.\\"Id. at 456, Harlan, J., dissenting.  Flood v. Kuhn  In 1970, St. Louis Cardinals star center fielder Curt Flood decided to refuse a trade to the Philadelphia Phillies and challenge the reserve clause again. Due to his stature as a player, his case attracted wide attention. It reached the Court in 1972. Although Flood lost, widespread support for his suit paved the way for free agency. William O. Douglas, who had been on the Toolson majority, had ruled in a 1971 emergency appeal from a suit brought by Spencer Haywood that basketball wasn't exempt, either, and suggested he was reconsidering his role in Toolson: \\"the decision in this suit would be similar to the one on baseball's reserve clause which our decisions exempting baseball from the antitrust laws have foreclosed.\\"Haywood v. Nat'l Basketball Assn., 401 U.S. 1204, 1205, Douglas, J. The following year he was the only justice from the Toolson court still sitting when Flood v. Kuhn was heard, and made his change of mind explicit in a footnote to his dissent: \\"While I joined the Court's opinion in Toolson ... I have lived to regret it; and I would now correct what I believe to be its fundamental error.\\"Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258, 286n1, Douglas, J., dissenting. In that case's majority opinion, Harry Blackmun conceded that the facts no longer supported the exemption and that baseball was indeed interstate commerce,Id., at 282-284, Blackmun, J. but echoed Clark in suggesting that the consequences of overturning the previous decisions would be worse than letting it stand. Chief Justice Warren Burger agreed in a short concurrence that also indicated his acceptance of Douglas's regret.Id. at 285-86, Burger, C.J., concurring. = Legal analysis and criticism = Sports business historian Andrew Zimbalist attributes the unexpected outcome to \\"a game of cat and mouse\\" between Congress and the Court: Much of the criticism of Toolson over the years has viewed it as the middle term of the sequence that begins with Federal Baseball Club and ends with Flood, and considers it in that context. Its embrace of stare decisis and presumption of congressional inaction as a justification, is notably at odds with the position that Justice Felix Frankfurter took when writing for the Court in a 1940 trust-law case, Helvering v. Hallock, where prior flawed decisions had not been corrected through legislative action, that \\"it would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from re-examining its own doctrines\\"Helvering v. Hallock, . One critic, antitrust expert Kevin McDonald of Jones Day, singles out the 1953 case for having truly created the antitrust exemption by reading congressional intent into Holmes' original opinion. After quoting the per curiam's closing sentence, he writes: Lower courts, he said, took the court's reasoning to mean that other professional team sports were also exempt, forcing the justices to clarify that it only applied to baseball, and criticize their earlier ruling, in order to sustain decisions that football and boxing were interstate commerce and within the scope of antitrust law.Ibid., 8. = Effect on baseball = Toolson's career was over, and MLB resumed its status quo ante. But the underlying issues remained, and a decade later began to be addressed when players unionized as the Major League Baseball Players Association, with free agency one of many goals. Two years later, baseball held its first amateur draft, ending the system whereby wealthier and successful teams like the Yankees were able to keep their farm teams stocked with talent the way they had with Toolson, not only as insurance against player injuries but to prevent opposing teams from signing them. That ended the continuous domination of the Yankees. Despite legal and judicial criticism and embarrassment, baseball's antitrust exemption remains in effect. Players in the major leagues won free agency with the Seitz decision in 1975, and the 1998 Curt Flood Act gave major league players, but not others involved in baseball, rights under the antitrust laws.Pub. L. 105-297, 112 Stat. 2824https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-105publ297/pdf/PLAW-105publ297.pdf But for players in the minor leagues, like Toolson, the reserve system persists, and they are still bound to the organization that initially signed them.

It may be given when the patient has an obvious but unidentifiable medical problem, when a doctor wants to reassure an anxious patient about the doctor's belief in the existence of reported symptoms, when a patient pressures a doctor for a label, or when a doctor wants to facilitate bureaucratic approval of treatment. The term may also be used pejoratively to describe disputed medical conditions. In this sense, the term implies that the condition has not been properly classified. It can carry a connotation that the prognosis of individuals with the condition are more heterogeneous than would be associated with a more precisely defined clinical entry. As diagnostic tools improve, it is possible for these kinds of wastebasket diagnoses to be properly defined and reclassified as clinical diagnoses. Wastebasket diagnoses are often made by medical specialists, and referred back to primary care physicians for long term management. In one study, more than three quarters of primary care visits were found to have no organic or physical cause.Kroenke K, Mangelsdorff AD. Common symptoms in ambulatory care: incidence, evaluation, therapy, and outcome. Am J Med. 1989;86:262‚Äì6. It is probable that the stress response and emotional dysregulation contributes to the patient presentation.Am Fam Physician. 2000 Feb 15;61(4):1073-1078. Specific diagnoses Many alternative medicine diagnoses based in pseudoscience, such as candida overgrowth and multiple chemical sensitivities, are considered trashcan diagnoses. Common wastebasket diagnoses include: * Chronic fatigue syndrome (when applied to undiagnosed fatigue) * Fibromyalgia (when applied to undiagnosed pain) * Subclinical hypothyroidism * Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis * Irritable bowel syndrome * Chronic pain syndromes * Interstitial cystitis (\\"bladder pain syndrome\\") * Costochondritis (when applied to undiagnosed chest pain) * Gastroesophageal reflux (when applied to undiagnosed chest pain) Reactive hypoglycemia has been used as a trashcan diagnosis for people who complain about normal physiological reactions to being hungry. In these cases, the labels are offered when nothing more serious can be identified. Bronchitis may be used as a trashcan diagnosis to label sick children. Some diagnoses are being used as trashcan diagnoses in response to unintentional incentives. For example, government-run schools in the United States get additional funding for providing services to students with autism spectrum disorders, so some children with atypical behavior patterns are labeled as having ASD so the school can more easily obtain funding for special education services. History Fake diagnoses are not a modern invention. Medicine around the world has a long history of using and abusing the concept of trashcan diagnoses, from \\"rectifying the humors\\" to marthambles to neurasthenia to garbled Latin-sounding names which were made up to impress the patient's family.  Management  The medical community is often split on the best approach to managing a wastebasket diagnosis. The biggest challenge for a physician is maintaining their interest and desire to see the patient through their illness.https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/health/views/25case.html Anti-depressants and cognitive therapies are commonly employed, speaking to the probable emotional basis that underpins these diagnoses.http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0301/p1423.html See also * Diagnosis of exclusion, the diagnosis given to a patient when all other plausible options have been ruled out References Psychiatric diagnosis Psychiatric false diagnosis ","title":"Wastebasket diagnosis"},{"id":"16034364","text":"4th Rhode Island Infantry Regiment was organized during the American Civil War from 1861 and 1864.

Elerithattu is located in West Eleri village, about 30 km east of Nileshwar in the Kasaragod district of Kerala in India. The settlement is situated in a sylvan environment, surrounded by rubber trees and various tropical vegetation.  Education  Elerithattu Lower Primary School Elerithattu Lower Primary School, is situated in the village. The E.K. Nayanar Memorial Government College is co-located with the school. Mar Gregorios Memorial Upper Primary School (MGMUPS) and Varakkad high school are located at 1 km distance from Elerithattu. History Elerithattu was partly ruled by the Nileshwar Raja until the 1940s. During the Indian freedom struggle, the area was a local hub for communist movement. The area is still considered to be a strong fort for left wing political ideologies. Prominent left leaders such as E K Nayanar have spent time in exile at this place during the British rule, prior to the Indian independence in 1947. The early inhabitants of this place came from places such as Nileshwar, Cheruvathur and Payyanur, and they predominantly were nairs (nambiar). Migration from South Kerala During the middle of twentieth century, Christian and ezhava families migrated in large numbers and settled there. Most of such migration came from travancore and southern parts of Kerala. Thanks to the agrarian and fertile landscape prevailed then, many families decided to settle there and became integral part of the social setup. Harijan community A small share of harijan tribal community also live in various parts of this locality. The harijan families among themselves used to speak an unidentified dialect, but over time Malayalam has taken over and at present it is spoken uniformly across the society. Elerithattu is known to be quite and peaceful with different communities living in harmony. Economy Large section of people rely on individual agrarian income to make their livelihoods. Education There are many schools and high schools in Elerithattu but the biggest organization is the E.K. Nayanar Memorial Government College. The college offers post-graduate course in Applied Economics and undergraduate courses in economics, Hindi, English and commerce.http://www.kannuruniversity.ac.in/~kannuruser/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=119&Itemid;=111 Sports In the 1970s and 80s Elerithattu claimed to have a strong volleyball team in the locality, but these days cricket take precedence among the younger population. Etymology Even though there is no reported written reference to the origin of the name Elerithattu, a widely talked about story goes likes this. Geographically, this place is a flat locality situated at the top of a hill range. The term \\"thattu\\" is a Malayalam word for \\"flat surface\\". Years ago, Elerithattu and surrounding areas used to have a single season (in a year) paddy crop. Since the season for such a paddy cultivation coincided with the pre-monsoon time, the rice produced there came to be known as \\"elaya ari\\" referring to \\"early (to monsoon) rice\\" (\\"ari\\" in Malayalam when translated to English is rice grains and \\"elaya\\" stands for young or early). Over time, \\"Eleya Ari\\" shortened to become \\"eleri\\". \\"eleri\\" and \\"thattu\\" combined to reason out the current name of the locality. Neighbouring places Konnakkad and Kottancheri Hills are located within 20 kilometers from this locality. Cherupuzha, a local trading center is about 15 kilometers away. Bheemanady, Chittarikkal, Vellarikundu and Narkilakkad are the adjacent commercial localities. The nearest municipal town is Nileshwar.

Power grid frequency and their 11th, 13th, 23rd and 25th harmonics are marked GKK Etzenricht, an abbreviation of Gleichstromkurzkupplung Etzenricht, meaning Etzenricht HVDC-back-to-back station, was an HVDC back-to- back facility near Etzenricht in the district of Neustadt an der Waldnaab in Bavaria, Germany. It was built on the site of the Etzenricht substation, a 380 kV/220 kV/110 kV-substation, which went into service in 1970 and expanded afterwards several times. The facility was used between 1993 and 1995 for exchange of power between Germany and the Czech Republic, operated by Bayernwerk AG (now part of TenneT). History Construction started April 26, 1991 and was completed September 1991. First power was achieved in May 1992 and a powerline to Hradec, Czech Republic was completed September 3, 1992. Trial operation started January 27, 1993 with official opening July 9, 1993. It was shut down after synchronisation of the German and the Czech Power Grid on October 18, 1995. After the synchronization of the power grids between Germany and Czech, the maximum amount of power which can be transmitted between Etzenricht and Hradec increased from 600 MW to 1316 MW. The inauguration of the second 380 kV-interconnection to Prestice substation on July 29, 1997 increased the transmission capacity from Etzenricht to Czech to further 1579 MW, so via Etzenricht substation today a maximum power exchange of 2895 MW between Czechia and Germany is possible. In 1997, after inauguration of the second 380 kV-powerline to Czechia, which ends at Prestice substation, most external components of GKK Etzenricht were dismantled and stored on the area of the facility. Since beginning of this dismantling, the facility was not in working condition any more. Only the transformers, the smoothing reactor and one harmonic filter remained on their original sites. Since shutdown of the static inverter, it was planned to sell the installation to eastern Europe, where it would have allowed the construction of an HVDC back-to-back station for exchanging power between eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. As the static inverter went more and more out of date and one was meanwhile able to build static inverters like that of GKK Etzenricht much simpler by using photo thyristors, no such deal ever took place. In 2006 the facility was sold to IDPC, an Austrian recycling company, which wanted first to sell the installation completely and as this did not work, part by part. However, only a few components were sold. In spring 2009 all remaining components of GKK Etzenricht were dismantled and scrapped. Technical features GKK Etzenricht had a maximum transmission power of 600 megawatts (MW) and worked with a DC voltage of 160 kV. The two static inverters are in a high hall with of surface area, which was built in a combination of local and finished concrete building method. Each static inverter consists of 432 thyristors, which are put in six thyristor towers arranged in a row. Each thyristor tower has 2 valve functions and consist of 8 thyristor modules, which are arranged one on top of the other. Each thyristor module consists of 9 thyristors switched in series and the necessary auxiliary equipment as the saturation coils, which are in series with the thyristors. Parallel to each thyristor a series combination of a resistor and a capacitor is switched, which limits the speed of current grow. From this combination the power for the supply of the electronic used for thyristor steering is gained. The electronic used for thyristor steering has at operation a high voltage potential against ground. It is connected to the main control electronic on ground potential by fiber-optic cables, which allow a bidirectional data transmission. Parallel to each thyristor module a capacitor and parallel to each valve function a varistor is switched. As thyristors the model U78 S346 S34 manufactured by Siemens, which has a maximum power rating of 4100 amperes and which was when GKK Etzenricht was built the most powerful thyristor in the world. At both ends of the hall there are three bays for the accommodation of the static inverter transformers, which are built as single-phase units.

The single-circuit 380kV power transmission link runs from the (Ex) GKK Etzenricht to the Czech substations at Hradec u Kadanƒõ. In 1997 a second single-circuit 380 kV-interconnection from Etzenricht to P≈ôe≈°tice substation was realized. Its conductors, which are of the same type as that used for the line to Hradec, are between Etzenricht and Straz installed on the same pylons. For overvoltage protection the whole powerline is equipped with two ground conductors, which are installed on a separate crossbar on the top of the pylons. One conductor contains a fiber optic cable for data transmission. The link from Etzenricht to Hradec has a maximum power transmission capacity of 1639 MW at an operating voltage of 380 kV. However it is limited by substation equipment to 1316 MW. On the German section of the line the conductors are bundles of four ropes consisting of steel and aluminum. Each conductor has a cross section of 340 mm¬≤ aluminum and 30 mm¬≤ steel. Between Weiden and Etzenricht this line is installed on 14 pylons of the \\"Danube type\\". One of these pylons was built after the shutdown of the GKK, in order to run the line directly - past the static inverter hall - into the switchyard of the Etzenricht substation. By this the length of the German section of the line grow by 180 metres to 33.8 kilometres. Except of the first pylon, these pylons were used before 1992 for the 110 kV-powerline from Etzenricht to Weiden. In 1992 this line was rebuilt on pylons running parallel to the old 110 kV-powerline to Weiden, whose pylons were equipped with a third crossbar for the ground conductors and with the 380 kV-conductors for the line to Czech. The section between Weiden/Oberpfalz and Eslarn consists of 60 pylons with a fourth crossbar under the crossbars for the 380 kV conductors in order to carry the two 110 kV circuits of the powerline Weiden/Oberpfalz - Vohenstrauss and the two 30 kV-circuits for the powerline between Vohenstrauss and Eslarn. This was necessary because, due to environmental protection, only one right of way was available. Therefore, the circuits of these lines, which existed in 1992 already since several years, had to be installed on the pylons of the powerline with the 380 kV-circuits to the Czech Republic. In Vohenstrauss the 110 kV-circuits run to the local substation, which is situated close to the right of way of the powerline to the Czech Republic. Behind Vohenstrauss on the lowest crossbar the circuits of the 30 kV-line Vohenstrauss-Eslarn are installed. For a future upgrade of this line to 110 kV, the conductors of this line are mounted on insulators for 110 kV on the pylons. Near Riedlhof this line leaves the track of the line to Czech and runs on concrete pylons to Eslarn substation. From Riedlhof the 380 kV-line to the Czech Republic runs on 15 pylons of \\"Danube type\\" to the border between Germany and the Czech Republic. The border is crossed close north of the border crossing of the motorway A6 near Furth in Forest. After the border the construction type of pylon does not change, but their design and the type of conductors. In the Czech Republic the line uses conductors, which are bundles of 3 conductors with a cross section of 450 mm¬≤ aluminum and 50 mm¬≤ steel. 31.5 kilometers behind the frontier near Straz the line splits off in two 380kV-lines with a single circuit. One of these lines is the long line section to Hradec in Northern Bohemia and the other is the line to P≈ôe≈°tice, which was built in 1997. Both lines are installed on Delta type pylons. A very remarkable feature is, that the powerline to Hradec substation is implemented on its last section on the area of Hradec substation between the termination portal and the busbar as underground cable.

He fought in a number of battles, and was a controversial figure, most remembered for his part in the defeat at the Battle of Toulon, and the subsequent court-martial. Family and early years Lestock is believed to have been born on 22 February 1679, though he may have been born some years previously. He was the second son of Richard Lestock (d. 1713) and his wife, Rebecca (d. 1709). His father had been magistrate for Middlesex, and commander of a number of merchant ships. On 26 December 1690, the father was among those invited by the Admiralty to volunteer for naval service, which he did. On 6 January 1691 Lestock's father was appointed to command HMS Cambridge. Lestock followed his father into the navy. In April 1701 he was appointed third lieutenant to the Cambridge. A number of postings to different ships then followed, to HMS Solebay, HMS Exeter and then HMS Barfleur. The Barfleur was at this time the flagship of Sir Cloudesley Shovell. Lestock was present with Shovell at the Battle of V√©lez-M√°laga. Shovell then promoted him to his first command, and in August 1705 Lestock became master and commander of the fire ship HMS Vulture. Whilst in command of her, he was active ashore at the relief of Barcelona and the capture of Alicante. Captain of the Fowey and the Panther Lestock took over the command of the 32-gun HMS Fowey on 29 April 1706, and was sent home in September with the news of the surrender of Alicante. On his return he was among those who helped to destroy a 64-gun French warship off Almeria in December that year. He was then ordered to join with Sir George Byng to assist the ground forces in the failed attack on Toulon in 1707. Lestock and the Fowey were then present at the capture of Menorca the following year. The Fowey was sailing from Alicante to Lisbon in April 1709, when on 14 April she was overhauled by two enemy 40-gun frigates. A two-hour battle ensued, after which the outgunned Fowey was forced to surrender. Lestock was exchanged shortly after and returned to England, where he faced a court-martial for the loss of his ship. He was fully acquitted on 31 August 1709. His next appointment was to command HMS Weymouth in the West Indies, which he did from 1710 until 1712. When she was paid off (decommissioned), Lestock went to half pay for five years, before he finally received command of HMS Panther in the Baltic in 1717. The fleet he joined was under George Byng, whom he had served with before. Lestock was given command of a seven-ship squadron, and ordered to cruise off G√∂teborg and in the Skagerrak, operating against Swedish privateers. Lestock seems to have made a favourable impression, and Byng made him second captain aboard his flagship, the Barfleur, during the Battle of Cape Passaro in 1718. Career stalled Despite impressing so highly influential an admiral, Lestock remained on half pay for nearly ten years. He returned to active duty only in 1728, commanding HMS Princess Amelia. He moved the next year to join HMS Royal Oak, and served aboard her in the Mediterranean in 1731 under Sir Charles Wager. He took up his next command, that of HMS Kingston on 21 February 1732 and received orders on 6 April to wear a red broad pennant and prepare to sail to the West Indies to take up the post of commander-in-chief of the Jamaica Station.Cundall, p. xx Contrary winds however stopped him sailing until 29 April. Three weeks later Sir Chaloner Ogle was appointed commander-in-chief at Jamaica instead, and a letter was written ordering Lestock to strike his flag and return to Britain. No reason was given. Lestock was dismayed by this snub, writing in a letter from Port Royal on 21 November: > My affair being without precedent I cannot say much, but such a fate as I > have met with is far worse than death, many particulars of which I doubt not > will be heard from me when I shall be able to present myself to my lords of > the admiralty.(National Archives of the United Kingdom, Public Record > Office, London, ADM 1) Further humiliation followed when he was twice passed over for flag-rank in 1733 and again in 1734. During this period five captains of lesser seniority were promoted. Despite this apparent stalling of his career, Lestock continued in active service. He was appointed captain of HMS Somerset on 22 February 1734, the Somerset then stationed as guard ship in the Medway. He served aboard her until April 1738, then moving to HMS Grafton, stationed at the Nore. During his time here he was noted for being occasionally overly zealous in arresting vessels that had no right to wear an official pendant. He was made captain of HMS Boyne in August 1739, and accompanied Sir Chaloner Ogle to the West Indies the following year. Return to prominence Whilst in the West Indies, Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon appointed him commodore and third in command of the fleet. Lestock regularly attended Vernon's naval councils of war. During the Battle of Cartagena de Indias he was appointed to command the attack on Fort San Luis on 23 March 1741. The battle ended in defeat and the Boyne was severely damaged. Lestock returned to England in the summer aboard the Princess Carolina. He then took over the command of HMS Neptune and was appointed Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Fleet and sent out with a large contingent of reinforcements in November 1741. Bad weather contrived to delay the sailing for several weeks, and he was unable to join Vice-Admiral Nicholas Haddock's fleet until the end of January 1742. By this time, the ships had been badly damaged by the weather, and many of the crew were ill or had died. Nevertheless, Lestock was promoted to rear-admiral on 13 March 1742. Haddock was forced to return to England a couple of months later due to ill health, leaving Lestock as acting commander-in-chief. Lestock hoped to have the appointment confirmed from England, but was bitterly disappointed to learn that Vice-Admiral Thomas Mathews had been dispatched to take over command. =Relations with Mathews= The two men had already worked together. Mathews had been commissioner at Chatham during the period Lestock had been in charge of the guard ships. Mathews arrived and took over command, and began to openly criticise Lestock's performance. He also countermanded his appointments. Mathews was much occupied with the diplomatic duties of his position and relied on Lestock to manage the fleet, but became increasingly resentful of Lestock's inability to do his job owing to his poor health. Despite sending complaints back home, Lestock was promoted to vice-admiral of the white on 29 November 1743 and remained as Mathews' second. The Battle of Toulon It was whilst the two were on the Mediterranean station that the Battle of Toulon was fought on 11 February 1744. The British fleet attempted to engage a Spanish convoy, with Lestock taking command of the Rear division. The battle ended in failure for the British. Lestock was accused of adhering to a restrictive interpretation of the fighting instructions and for a failure to take the initiative, so contributing to the failure. The British had been following the Spanish the previous day, but on the evening of 10 February Lestock halted the rear before it had reached its proper position in line abreast. By morning they had drifted even further out of line, eventually lying some five miles distant of the rest of the fleet. Only then did Lestock attempt to reach the action, but arrived too late. Mathews had been making signals all morning, and had twice sent a lieutenant in a boat to urge Lestock to bring his ships into the battle. Lestock replied that he was doing all he could, but that some of his ships were slow. He did not however order his faster ones forwards, nor did he follow Mathews' signal to engage, allowing four lagging Spanish ships to slip away from him. After the action Lestock argued that the signal for the line was still flying, which he saw as his primary duty to obey. He would only therefore follow the signal to engage when he could do so from his position in the line. When challenged why he had allowed such a gap to open between the rear and the rest of the fleet the previous night, Lestock claimed that the rules required him to follow the signal to ‚Äòbring to‚Äô the moment it was given, this taking precedence over the signal to move to line abreast. These interpretations were highly dubious, and failed to satisfy Mathews. He suspended Lestock and sent him home. The action is debated On his return, Lestock began to cast blame on Mathews and other captains that had not served in his division. A pamphlet war ensued, but high and low opinion was against him. Lestock did have important political friends though, and they managed to obtain a parliamentary inquiry into the outcome. This took place in the House of Commons over a number of days between March‚ÄìApril 1745, and sharply divided public opinion. Anti-Mathews speeches were made by Henry Fox and George Grenville, whilst Lestock himself impressed the MPs with his cool, calm demeanour. Mathews' defence in comparison was seen as heated and disorganized, just as how Lestock claimed Mathews had fought the battle. Mathews was also viewed with suspicion by the naval authorities, who were wary of his ‚Äòout of doors‚Äô popularity. The Admiralty Board convened a court-martial made up of officers sympathetic to Lestock, who was acquitted of any wrongdoing. Controversy over the judgement The outcome failed to convince the wider population. A later naval historian wrote in 1758 that: > ‚Äòthe nation could not be persuaded that the vice-admiral ought to be > exculpated for not fighting‚Äô and the admiral cashiered for fightingThe Naval > History of Great Britain, 4 vols., 1758, 4.270 The evidence of the court-marital was not released and confusion over the true events persisted for some time. Robert Beatson decided that Lestock > ‚Äòshewed a zeal and attention which gives a very advantageous idea of his > capacity as a seaman and an officer‚ÄôBeatson, 1.220 whilst John Campbell declared in his Lives of the British Admirals that Lestock ‚Äòought to have been shot‚Äô. Public opinion remained divided, but a song written in the earlier nineteenth century about the heroism of Richard Avery Hornsby, entitled Brave Captain Hornsby references Lestock, depicting him as betraying his friends: There is an old proverb I've lately thought on, When you think of a friend you're sure to find none'; For when that I thought to see Lestock come by, He was five miles a distance, and would not come nigh;Naval songs and ballads Return to service and last days On 5 June 1746, just two days after his acquittal he was promoted admiral of the blue and given command of a large squadron. The original plan called for the launching of an assault on Quebec, but an attack on the French port of Lorient was decided instead. Despite planning difficulties, the force was landed and nearly succeeded in taking the city. The result was ultimately a failure and was viewed as such by a disappointed public, but Lestock appears to have acquitted himself well. He hoped to receive an appointment to command a spring expedition to North America, but his health suddenly declined, and he died of a stomach ailment on 13 December 1746. Family and personal life Lestock probably married Sarah (d. 1744), of Chigwell Row in Essex during his time on half pay in the early 1720s. They may have had a son, as a boy named Richard Lestock was baptised at Chigwell on 14 July 1723, but if so he presumably died young as no more is heard about him.History of Chigwell The couple also had a daughter, Elizabeth, who survived her father. In addition, Lestock promoted a man named James Peers to the command of the Kingston at Jamaica on 26 August 1732. Peers was apparently spoken of as Lestock's son-in-law; however there was no mention of him in Sarah's will. His wife predeceased him on 12 September 1744. Their daughter married James Peacock, a purser in the navy. Lestock seems to have been on bad terms with his family, leaving all of his property to an apothecary, William Monke of London. He also left a bequest to his friend Henry Fox, who had been one of those defending him in the Commons.

Affiliations The British Accreditation Council has been a member of Enqua since 2015, became a member of INQAAHE in 2006 and has a memorandum of agreement with the Quality Assurance Agency. The Chief Executive of the BAC is a member of the British Council‚Äôs Accreditation Scheme Advisory Committee. The British Accreditation Council is a stakeholder of the Federation of Awarding Bodies. It also a onto the European Quality Assurance Register for Higher Education (EQAR) since 2015 . Charitable objectives The charitable objectives of the organisation are: * To improve and enhance the standards of independent further and higher educational institutions by the establishment of a system of accreditation of such institutions and bodies administering schemes for such institutions and by the provision of an advisory and consultancy service in the field of independent further and higher education; * To define the eligibility of institutions and bodies to apply for such accreditation and to establish the criteria and standards to be observed by institutions and bodies applying for such accreditation; * To arrange for inspection of institutions and bodies applying for such accreditation and to prescribe fees payable therefore; * To act as the national accrediting authority for independent further and higher education. Research and development activities As well as assisting law enforcement in cases of potential fraud, the British Accreditation Council has provided evidence on the private sector to the UK parliament. In 2008, the charity undertook a research project on private further and higher education in Kosovo, as requested by the British Council and the Kosovo Government. The findings of that project were published in a report in July 2008, which was fully endorsed by the Kosovo Government. In 2012 the organisation was commissioned along with CFE by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to provide a comprehensive picture of provision by privately funded institutions operating in the UK higher education (HE) sector. Inspection and accreditation The British Accreditation Council inspects and accredits around 250 organisations within the UK and overseas. An inspection of a private college assesses four main areas: * Management, staffing and administration * Teaching, learning and assessment * Student welfare * Premises and facilities. As well as private colleges such as Hult International Business School, the charity inspects training providers such as Crown Agents. In October 2012, it announced that it would also inspect and accredit online colleges. Non-UK colleges accredited by the organisation include, City College (international faculty of the University of Sheffield), AKMI Athens Metropolitan College, AKTO (Art & Design), American University of Culture & Education (AUCE), BCA (Business College Athens), HTMi, Hotel & Tourism Management Institute, IMI University Centre, Independent Science & Technology (IST) Studies, International University College, Sofia, Mediterranean College - Athens, Mediterranean College - Thessaloniki, New York College, Athens-SBS, New York College, Thessaloniki, Rushmore Business School, University of New York in Prague and VUZF University. Until October 2012, colleges outside the UK were only eligible for BAC accreditation if they offered higher education courses and had a formal validation agreement or other link with a UK higher education institution, awarding body or BAC- accredited college. In October 2012, a new accreditation scheme was launched for certain overseas institutions that did not meet these criteria. Inspection reports are considered by the Accreditation Committee, which includes representatives from the British Council and the Council of Validating Universities.

It aired on MBC from May 31 to July 20, 2006 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 16 episodes. Plot Although not related by blood, Seo Gun (Gong Yoo) and Seo Ha-neul (Sung Yu-ri) are legally siblings after the marriage of Gun's father and Ha-neul's mother. But after the deaths of their parents, the siblings are sent to an orphanage where they tearfully part once they get adopted into different families. In Korea, Ha-neul is a given a new name, Park Hae-won, and grows up in a wealthy, loving family, so much so that she finds it suffocating. Her adoptive mother (Sunwoo Eun-sook) treats Ha-neul like her dead biological daughter, while her adoptive brother Park Tae-won (Yoo Ha-joon) is obsessed with her. In Australia, Gun lives a life of destitution with his adoptive father Goo Kyung- taek (Lee Ki-yeol) and adoptive sister Goo Hyo-joo (Lee Yeon-hee). He becomes a small-time gangster whose main talents are swindling and fighting. When he hears from his best friend Goo Sung-chan (Kang Sung-jin) that his sister Ha- neul was adopted by a rich family and is now living like a princess, he decides to return to his native country in order to con Ha-neul into giving him money. Hyo-joo, who's nursed a crush on him for a long time, follows Gun to Korea. Meanwhile, Ha-neul lives every day wanting to get away from her adoptive parents and brother. She secretly works at an aquarium and constantly gets into quarrels with the curator, Kang Dong-ha (Namkoong Min), who starts to like her. Then one day, Gun suddenly appears in front of her. She'd never forgotten him and like she'd imagined a million times in her dreams, her \\"real\\" brother has come back to get her, just as he'd promised. Now worlds apart from each other, they reunite after 15 years of separation. Gun initially just wants to swindle money from Ha-neul, but he can't help protecting and caring for his little sister. As the two grow closer, their relationship and feelings become more complicated, and they come to realize that their mutual affection is something more than that of a brother and a sister.

The present day building was opened in 1862, but the chapel was first established in 1827. History The current chapel was opened in 1862. The Baptist mission in Wraysbury can be traced back 35 years earlier to the sole efforts of the chapel's first Pastor, William Thomas Buckland. Born and raised in Wraysbury, Buckland lived for several years in Holborn Bridge and Hammersmith, where he first joined the Baptist Church. On his return to Wraysbury in 1826, he found the moral and spiritual condition of the villagers to be in a deplorable state. The only place of worship was the parish church, the vicar of which resided at a distance. Extracts from Buckland's diary, reproduced in The Baptist Magazine, detail how he first rented a house for meetings, and invited local ministers, Mr Hall from Poyle and Mr Hawson from Staines, to preach on alternate Sundays. The first meeting was held on 20 May 1827 and in March, William opened the Sunday school to teach the local children. With ever increasing numbers, a new chapel was built and opening on 23 September 1830. The Baptist mission continued to flourish, and 'wishing to provide more commodious and beautiful accommodation', the old chapel was knocked down and a new one erected with a convenient schoolroom attached. The work cost ¬£800 and was covered by donations within the year. Previously, Wraysbury had been regarded as an offshoot from Staines, but in December 1868, it decided that it was to become a station in its own right. Buckland was unanimously chosen to be its first pastor, a role he retained until his death in 1870. Others who became pastors included Arthur Shorrock, who married a relative of William Buckland.

Presentation Strangely, in boys with X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder, there is an inability to mount an immune response to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which often leads to death from bone marrow failure, irreversible hepatitis, and malignant lymphoma. However, the connection between EBV and X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder is yet to be determined. Patients produce insufficient numbers of CD27 memory B cells. Cause =XLP1= There is a mutation on the X-chromosome that has been found to be associated with a T- and NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. The mutation is on the long arm of the chromosome, at position 25, which is denoted as Xq25. At this position, there is a deletion in the SH2D1A gene, which codes for an SH2 domain on a signal transducing protein called SLAM-associated protein (SAP). The term \\"SH2\\" domain stands for src-homology 2 domain, which is a three-dimensional domain structure of about 100 amino acid residues. These domains are present in many signalling proteins because they permit specific, non-covalent bonding to proteins that contain phosphotyrosines. The amino acid residues adjacent to the phosphotyrosine on the target protein are what determine the unique binding specificity. The SAP protein is important in the signalling events that activate T- and NK-cells due to its adaptor function. Normally, the SAP protein is expressed in the cytoplasm of T- and NK-cells, where it binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the surface receptor called signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM). This binding initiates a signal transduction pathway, which results in the modulation of IFN-Œ≥. A deletion in the SH2D1A gene leads to a non-functional SH2 domain on the SAP protein, making it unable to bind to SLAM. This leads to aberrant IFN-Œ≥ modulation, causing uncontrolled cell proliferation. =XLP2= A second form is associated with XIAP. Some sources recommend classifying this condition as \\"X-linked familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\\" instead of X-linked lymphoproliferative disease.

It could carry five passengers. The aircraft was also built under licence in Germany as the Fokker-Grulich F.III. Design and development The Fokker F.III was a straightforward development of the F.II. A widened cabin allowed all five passengers to sit within; in the earlier aircraft, one passenger sat alongside the pilot in his exposed cockpit. The pilot now sat alongside the engine, which was offset laterally by about ; whether to port or starboard depended on the type of engine installed. Although this unusual arrangement meant that pilots were \\"burned on one side and frozen on the other,\\" they had a much better view than from the F.II. The view was further improved by a cut-out in the wing leading edge for the pilot's head, allowing his seat to be raised. The external wing struts of the F.II were removed, leaving a clean cantilever wing. The trapezoidal windows seen in the Grulich built F.IIs were standard on the F.III. Like its predecessor, the F.III was initially powered by a readily available, war surplus 138 kW (185 hp) BMW IIIa engine, but once again KLM re- engined theirs with the 172 kW (230 hp) Armstrong Siddeley Puma. Operational history The F.III was first used by KLM when they reopened their Amsterdam- London service on 14 April 1921 (they did not, at this time operate over winter). Soon, F.IIIs were also flying on routes to Bremen, Brussels, Hamburg, and Paris. They proved to be very reliable aircraft. KLM received 14 F.IIIs from Fokker's German factory at Schwerin during 1921 and built two more itself from spares in the following year. This final pair used Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engines, with the pilot on the left. Another operator of new F.IIIs was Deutsch-Russiche Luftverkehrs Gesellschaft (Deruluft) which used nine aircraft on their Berlin-K√∂nigsberg-Moscow route from May 1922. These machines, partially built in Schwerin and finished in the Netherlands at Veere, had Eagle engines. One was a Fokker-Grulich. Deutsche Aero Lloyd gained a licence to build F.IIIs as they had for F.IIs and the company, with its southern subsidiary built and operated 18 of these Fokker-Grulich F.IIIs. Most of these used BMW engines, typically the BMW IV in preference to the BMW IIIa. Some of these were re-engined with the BMW Va, and were designated F.IIIc. Another operator from new was the Hungarian airline Malert, which received six Dutch- built aircraft for their Budapest-Vienna-Belgrade service from 1922 to 1929. These initially had BMW IIIa engines, but later ran with Breitfeld & Danƒõk Hiero IV engines. They had larger wings, increased in area by about 14%. Deutsche Luft-Reederei also operated two, originally intended for KLM. Four F.IIIs probably went to the United States. Later F.IIIs changed ownership frequently as airlines went bankrupt or merged. They were still flying commercially in Germany until about 1936. Accidents and incidents *On 24 April 1924, Fokker F.III H-NABS of KLM departed Lympne for Rotterdam and Amsterdam. The aircraft was not heard of again. It was presumed to have crashed into the sea, killing the pilot and both passengers. *On 25 June 1925, a KLM Fokker F.III, registration H-NABM, crashed at Landr√©cies, France in poor weather while on an Amsterdam-Paris service, killing all four on board.

It was launched into Low Earth Orbit on November 15, 1974 and remained operational until a battery failure in 1981. Then after 21 years of apparent silence, the satellite was heard again on June 21, 2002 ‚Äì 27 years after launch. At that time the public learned that the satellite had remained intermittently functional and was used surreptitiously for communication by the anticommunist opposition Fighting Solidarity during the martial law in Poland. AO-7 is the oldest amateur satellite still in use, and is one of the oldest operational communications satellites. It carries two amateur radio transponders. Its \\"Mode A\\" transponder has an uplink on the 2-meter band and a downlink on the 10-meter band. The \\"Mode B\\" transponder has an uplink on the 70-centimeter band and a downlink on the 2-meter band. The satellite also carries four beacons which are designed to operate on the 10-meter, 2-meter, 70-centimeter and 13-centimeter bands. The 13-cm beacon was never activated due to a change in international treaties. AMSAT reported AO-7 still operational on June 25, 2015, with reliable power only from its solar panels; the report stated the cause of the 21-year outage was a short circuit in the battery and the restoration of service was due to its becoming an open circuit. The satellite eclipses on every orbit during the northern summer and autumn; the rest of the year it is in continuous sunlight and alternates between transmission modes A and B. All transponders and beacons are operational. Build AO-7 was the second Phase 2 satellite (Phase II-B). At launch, the satellite had a mass of and it was placed into a 1444 x 1459 km orbit. It is shaped as an octahedron 360 mm high and 424 mm in diameter. It has a circularly-polarized, canted turnstile VHF/UHF antenna system and HF dipole. Four radio masts mounted at 90 degree intervals on the base of the satellite and two experimental repeater systems provided store-and-forward for Morse code and teletype messages (\\"codestore\\") as it orbited around the world. The Mode-B transponder was designed and build by Karl Meinzer, DJ4ZC and Werner Haas, DJ5KQ. The Mode-B transponder was the first using ‚ÄúHELAPS‚Äù (High Efficient Linear Amplification by Parametric Synthesis) technology was developed by Dr. Karl Meinzer as part of his Ph.D. research. AO-7 has redundant command decoders of a design similar to the unit proven highly successful in AMSAT-OSCAR 6. The decoder has provisions for 35 separate functions, and is designed to provide a reliable means of controlling the emissions of the repeaters, beacons and other experiments aboard the spacecraft. Firsts AO-7 demonstrated several uses of new technologies and operations *First satellite-to-satellite relay, through AO-6. *Early demonstrations of low-budget medical data relay and Doppler location of ground transmitters for search-and-rescue operations were carried out using this satellite. *The Mode-B transponder was the first using \\"HELAPS\\" (High Efficient Linear Amplification by Parametric Synthesis) technology developed by Dr. Karl Meinzer as part of his Ph.D. *First to fly a battery charge regulator. Legal issues constellation allowing intersatellite communication from the United States with AMSAT-OSCAR 6 and AMSAT-OSCAR 7. The uplink frequency predates the WARC 1979 allocation of 435-438 MHz by the ITU for the Amateur Satellite Service which places the uplink in the 70cm weak signal segment. Additionally, the IARU bandplan has the 432.1 MHz range (which is used for mode B uplink) marked for \\"weak signal\\" in all three Regions. Accessing the Mode B uplink is permitted in the United States under a waiver from the FCC.http://ww2.amsat.org/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2013/07/FCC_AO7_waiver-19740419.jpg Use by Polish anticommunist opposition In the summer of 1982 the Fighting Solidarity in Wroc≈Çaw learned that AO-7 became periodically functional, when its solar panels got enough sunlight to power up the satellite. It was then used to communicate with Solidarity activists in other Polish cities and to send messages to the West. Satellite communication was invaluable at that time, as the regular telephone network was tapped by the government and shut down when martial law was imposed in December 1981. Ham radios were not of much use as they were easy to track. On the other hand, a satellite link required highly directional antennas which were impossible to track by the regime. In 2002 Pat Gowen (G3IOR), inspired by the history of Fighting Solidarity, attempted to communicate with AO-7 and confirmed it to be operational. Current status , contacts with AO-7 are reported daily.

Singer Jim Morrison wrote the lyrics as a tribute to the soul food restaurant Olivia's in Venice Beach, California. Because he often stayed too late, the staff had to kick him out, thus the lines \\"let me sleep all night, in your soul kitchen\\". Composition The song is notated in the key of A Major with Jim Morrison's vocal range spanning from E4 to A5. Like other song from their debut album, the album liner notes list the songwriters as the Doors; the performance rights organization ASCAP shows the writers as the individual Doors members. Despite the songwriting credit, it was written by Morrison during the summer of 1965. When the band came to record the song for their eponymous debut album, session musician Larry Knechtel joined in to play bass, though in an interview Robby Krieger said that he played the bass. Guitarist Robby Krieger has stated that the song's main riff was inspired by soul singer James Brown. Critical reception According to rock critic Greil Marcus, \\"Soul Kitchen\\" is the Doors' version of \\"Gloria\\" by Van Morrison, a song the Doors often covered in their early days. Marcus writes, \\"It was a staircase‚Äînot, as with 'Gloria' in imagery, but in the cadence the two songs shared, slowed down so strongly in 'Soul Kitchen' that a sense of deliberation, so physical that it was more body than thought, became the guiding spirit of the song.\\" In a 1967 article in Crawdaddy! magazine, Paul Williams compared it to \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" since both songs had a message, with the message of \\"Soul Kitchen\\" being \\"Learn to forget.\\" He praised the song: \\"The End‚Äù is great to listen to when you‚Äôre high (or any other time), but ‚ÄúSoul Kitchen‚Äù will get you high, which is obviously much cruder and more important.\\" In an AllMusic album review, Richie Unterberger praised the song's \\"stomping rock\\".

The aircraft was used regularly on the route from the 1 October 1931. In 1932 KLM started to use the larger Fokker F.VIIIs on the route and the F.XIIs were then used for European destinations. In 1936 KLM sold four of the aircraft to the British Crilly Airways to operate between London and Madrid, this didn't get the support of the Spanish government and the aircraft were passed to British Airways for use on European routes to Paris and Scandinavia. They were soon considered obsolete by British Airways and sold with some ending up with Spanish Nationalists for use in the civil war. Two of KLMs remaining F.XIIs were sold to British Airways and one to a company in French West Africa but ended up in Spanish Republican hands. The two KNILM aircraft were still in Java when the Japanese invaded in 1942.

History Henry Duffield arrived in Eramosa Township in 1832, and was a leading land owner who later served as reeve of Eramosa Township. Duffield owned of land on the corner of Fourth Line and Eramosa Road, the location which became known as Centre Inn. The Centre Inn name was chosen because of its location in the centre of Eramosa Township. Hotel in Centre Inn, circa 1880 A hotel was operated on the main corner of Centre Inn, and was used by people travelling by horse-drawn carriage between Erin and Guelph. A covered wagon carrying mail and passengers between those locations would stop at Centre Inn to board passengers. The passenger service continued after rural mail survive began. The hotel was used for meetings by local groups, such as the South Wellington Teachers' Association, which met at Centre Inn in 1864, and the Eramosa Township Council, which held meetings at Centre Inn from the 1870s to 1890s. In 1833, John Loree donated land to establish the Centre Inn Cemetery. That same year, his brother Hezekiah was the first interment. A wooden frame church, the Methodist Episcopal Church, was erected next to the cemetery. In 1862, an extant stone church was erected \\"on top of several tombstones\\". In 1964, extensive renovations were made to what is now called Stone United Church. The cemetery closed around 1975. George Caughlin had a farm in Centre Inn with a race track. A barn was built in 1879, and a farmhouse in 1881. The hotel was abandoned in the early 1890s, and was purchased in 1905 to be used as a home by Alex Hyndman and his family. One of the buildings on the property was temporarily used as a school in 1905. A property near the corner was purchased in 1920, and a sawmill operated there. Eramosa Road was widened in 1950 and renamed Highway 24 (now called Highway 124). This required the former hotel building to be moved back from the corner.

The team which consisted of Astrid Ayling, Alexa Forbes, Gillian Hodges, Kate Holroyd, Belinda Holmes, Sarah Hunter-Jones, Kate McNicol and Sue Bailey (cox) finished in fifth place. She was part of the coxed four with Alison Bonner, Sarah Hunter-Jones, Tish Reid, and Lesley Clare (cox), that won the national title rowing for A.R.A squad, at the 1985 National Championships and represented England and won a silver medal in the eight and a bronze medal in the four, at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Scotland.

During her sabbatical, she developed an interest in osteopathy and thus trained at the British School of Osteopathy following her year out, qualifying in 1990. In late 1990, she established The Redgrave Clinic in Bourne End, which has since begun to offer a range of other treatments from physiotherapy to the Alexander Technique.

Early life Terry was born in Long Island City, New York, the fifth child of Katherine (n√©e Conley), an elementary school teacher, and Peter David Finn, a New York City fireman stationed in Brooklyn. Growing up on the Island, Finn attended St. Pius X Elementary School in Plainview. She made her stage debut at the age of 11 as a member of the Pius Players in the leading role of Flora in The Innocents. She attended high school at Queen of the Rosary Academy in Amityville where she studied to go on to a teaching career. Finn began undergrad studies at Iona College in New Rochelle as a psychology major. Following an impromptu audition for Professor Roderick Nash, she was persuaded to switch her major to Communication Arts in the Theatre Department. As a member of the Iona Players, Finn appeared in a series of leading roles, from Blanche Du Bois in A Streetcar Named Desire to Sally Bowles in Cabaret. Following her graduation, she was once again persuaded to return to Iona during post-grad summer session and was cast in the lead as Maria in West Side Story, this was her third Stephen Sondheim musical, which included roles as Marta in Company and Young Dolly in Follies.  Stage career  Alvin Theatre stage door (Merrily We Roll Along, 1981) Finn made her Broadway debut at the Morosco Theatre in Hugh Leonard's A Life as understudy to Dana Delany. Following A Life, casting director Joanna Merlin chose Finn to create the role of Gussie Carnegie in Merrily We Roll Along. With music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, book by George Furth and direction by Hal Prince, this stage production is considered a musical theatre legend in spite of the fact that it closed after 52 previews and 16 performances. Despite a flurry of negative reviews, Clive Barnes raved in the New York Post that \\"A beautifully acrid comic skit is provided by Terry Finn as a producer's wife with even less morals than taste and a turn a phrase that would cause a viper to bite out its tongue in envy,\\" and in the New York Daily News Douglas Watt wrote \\"There is also good work by Jason Alexander and his gushingly imperious wife Terry Finn.\\" Following the brief run at the Alvin Theatre, the cast gathered at RCA Records Studio 'A' on November 29, 1981 -- the day after the show closed -- to record the original cast album. The album's popularity eventually led to a \\"Merrily We Roll Along Original Broadway Cast Reunion Concert\\" which was staged at the La Guardia Concert Hall in Lincoln Center on September 30, 2002. Following a search outlined in a Broadway.com article entitled \\"Finding Finn,\\" Merrily director Lonny Price recalled, \\"Terry was dazzling in the role of Gussie ... I couldn't imagine doing [the reunion] without her and now I'm glad that I don't have to!\\" Finn was reunited with her original cast mates in the one-night-only benefit that raised more than $200,000 for Musical Theatre Works. Robert Simonson and Kenneth Jones of Playbill.com noted that the \\"inclusion of lesser-known songs considerably beefed up the role of Gussie, played by Terry Finn, who is barely present on the show's famous original cast album.\\" Finn is interviewed in Best Worst Thing That Ever Could Have Happened, a 2016 documentary film recalling the history of the show and the later lives of its actors, directed by Lonny Price. Off Broadway, Finn appeared as Pearl Gordon in Clifford Odets's Paradise Lost at The Mirror Repertory Company under the direction of John Strasberg, as Kate Poplin in Big Maggie at the Douglas Fairbanks Theatre, as Audrey in William Shakespeare's As You Like It with the New York Acting Unit and in regional theatre starred as Constanze Weber-Mozart in Peter Shaffer's play Amadeus in The Wells Theatre at The Virginia Stage Company.

The film is directed by George Bessudo and written by Daniel P. Coughlin. Plot Scarlet and Chad are a young married couple. Financial troubles and the death of their infant son convince them to move to Seattle, in the hopes of starting a new life. During the drive, Chad falls asleep at the wheel and runs off the road, crashing their vehicle. Although the car itself is destroyed the couple is unharmed. They go to a nearby farmhouse and meet the owner, \\"Sam\\" (short for Samael), his wife Lilith, and their deaf handyman helper, Alal. Sam and Lilith let Chad and Scarlet sleep at their house, but during the night Chad and Scarlet are savagely knocked unconscious by Lilith and Sam. Upon waking, Chad and Scarlet discover that Sam and Lilith intend to torture and kill them. They nearly drown Scarlet in a barrel, but after they leave the room Chad resuscitates her, and the couple tries to flee the farmhouse. Chad is caught by Lilith, but wrestles away a shotgun from her and knocks her unconscious. Scarlet, aided by Alal, runs away into a vineyard field, but is eventually caught by Sam, who kills Alal and takes Scarlet back into the house. While Sam goes to look for Chad, Lilith tortures Scarlet by scraping the flesh off her knees with a grater. Chad interrupts the torture session and kills Lilith by stabbing her in the head with a meat thermometer. Chad tries to set Scarlet free, but is unable to do so before Sam gets back. Chad and Sam fight, and Scarlet stabs Sam in the back with a chef's knife, seriously injuring him. The couple flees in Sam's pickup truck, but Sam revives and pursues them; Chad runs Sam over with the truck several times before they drive off. After several hours, they begin to wonder why it is not yet morning, and the truck runs out of fuel. Chad and Scarlet set off on foot, only to find themselves mysteriously back at Sam and Lilith's farmhouse. Sam, Lilith, and Alal are all revived and confront them. It is revealed that Chad and Scarlet actually died in the car crash and are now in hell. They meet Satan, who shows them that they are being punished for murdering their son in order to collect a life insurance premium that would be enough to pay back a debt that Chad owed. Scarlet pleads with Satan for a second chance, and she gets it. The film ends with Scarlet looking into the eyes of her infant son. The scene fades to black, and the last piece of dialogue is Scarlet whispering the word 'no' to the devils question as to whether she or her husband would do anything different should they actually get another chance thus confirming their damnation.

British Cypriot people may be of Greek-, Turkish-, Maronite-, or Armenian- Cypriot descent. Migration from Cyprus to the UK has occurred in part due to the colonial links between the countries and the internal conflict that followed Cyprus' independence from the British Empire in 1960. Migration peaked at the time of independence but has continued on a smaller scale. The number of Cypriot-born people in the UK fell between the 1991 and 2001 censuses, but the community, including people of Cypriot ancestry, remains sizeable, and the Cypriot-born population grew slightly between the 2001 and 2011 censuses. A number of famous British people are of Cypriot ancestry, including musicians George Michael and Cat Stevens, footballer Leon Osman, comedians Jamie Demetriou and Natasia Demetriou, visual artist Tracey Emin, and politician Lord Adonis.  History  Before the First World War, very few Cypriots migrated to the UK and the British Cypriot population at this time was around 150, according to historian Stavros Panteli. Only a handful of marriages involving Cypriots are recorded at London's Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia in the years before 1918. During the First World War many Cypriots joined the allied forces. When the British annexed Cyprus in 1914, Cypriots' political status changed and they found it easier to travel. The 1931 British Census recorded more than 1,000 Cypriot-born people, but many of these were the children of British military personnel serving in the Mediterranean. However, some Greek Cypriots did migrate to the UK in the 1920s and 1930s, often finding jobs in the catering industry in Soho. By the start of the Second World War, there were around 8,000 Cypriots in London. More Cypriot immigrants arrived during the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters (EOKA)'s campaign for Cypriot independence from Britain and union with Greece, which started in 1955. In the four years of conflict, an average of 4,000 Cypriots left the island per year for the UK, because of violence on the island and the fear felt by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots in mixed villages where they formed minorities. Migration peaked following independence in 1960, with around 25,000 Cypriots migrating in the year that followed. Many migrants joined family already living in Britain. Further migration accompanied the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974. Home Office figures show that roughly 10,000 Cypriots fled to the UK, the majority of them refugees, but many of them subsequently returned to the island. In the 1960s, Greek Cypriots in London outnumbered Turkish Cypriots by four to one. The increase in post-war rents in central London had forced many Cypriot immigrants to move north within the city. The Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities tended to be geographically segregated, with Greeks settling mainly in Camden and Turks in Stoke Newington. This was due to the migrants' reliance on social networks to find housing on their arrival. Robert Winder reports that \\"Haringey became the second biggest Cypriot town in the world\\". Many Cypriots set up restaurants, filling a gap left by Italians, many of whom had been interned during the Second World War. Much of the Turkish Cypriot migration to the UK occurred as a consequence of intercommunal violence in Cyprus during the 1950s and 1960s. Many Turkish Cypriots viewed the EOKA insurgency as an attempt on the part of Greek Cypriots to establish hegemony on the island with the aim of achieving union with Greece. By 1958, there were around 8,500 Turkish Cypriots in Britain. Between 1960 and 1962, the inflow increased substantially because of a fear that Britain would impose immigration controls, and indeed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 did reduce migration flows from Cyprus to Britain. Although the expansion of Britain's Turkish Cypriot community took place primarily between the late 1940s and the mid-1960s, there was a further influx of around 3,000 immigrants after partition in 1974. Migration continued because of the political and economic situation in the 1970s and 1980s, and Turkish Cypriots have continued to migrate to the UK due to high unemployment rates in northern Cyprus. In the early 1980s, it was estimated that 160,000 Cypriots were resident in the UK, 20 to 25 per cent of them being Turkish Cypriots. Since Cyprus joined the European Union in May 2004, holders of Republic of Cyprus passports have been able to migrate freely to the UK under EU law. According to the BBC, while divisions and resentment exist between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the UK, particularly amongst those old enough to remember atrocities committed in Cyprus, \\"if differences of opinion exist, both sides have learnt to live together regardless\\". Community relations are generally good, with Turkish Cypriot community centres welcoming Greek Cypriots and vice versa. In oral history interviews conducted by academic Nergis Canefe in the late 1990s, Turkish Cypriots in London tended to define themselves as Anglo-Cypriot, particularly if they were born in the UK. Canefe notes that her interviewees were proud to be Cypriot, but also of being British and not Turkish. They had Turkish friends, but also close Greek and Greek Cypriot friends. The neighbourhoods they inhabited tended to be ethnically mixed, and often shared with Greeks and Greek Cypriots.  Demographics  = Population = Peter Droussiotis, Chair of the National Federation of Cypriots in the UK speaking at a reception held at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Cyprus appeared amongst the top ten non-British countries of birth for the first time in the 1961 Census, which recorded 42,000 Cypriot-born people living in England and Wales. This number peaked in the 1981 Census, at 83,000. The 2001 Census recorded 77,673 Cypriot-born people residing in the whole of the UK. The number of Cypriot-born people in Great Britain fell from 78,191 in 1991 to 77,156 in 2001, one of the few country-of-birth groups to experience a decrease in numbers. According to the 2011 UK Census, there were 78,795 Cypriot-born residents in England, 1,215 in Wales, 1,941 in Scotland, and 344 in Northern Ireland. More recent estimates by the Office for National Statistics put the number of Cypriot-born residents in the UK as a whole at 60,000 in 2015. British Cypriot people include those of Greek-, Turkish-, Maronite-, or Armenian-Cypriot descent. The National Federation of Cypriots in the UK, an umbrella organisation representing the Cypriot community associations and groups across the UK with largely Greek Cypriot memberships, claims to represent more than 300,000 people of Cypriot ancestry. A similar figure was given by then Minister for Europe Caroline Flint, who, giving a speech at the London School of Economics in February 2009, stated that more than 300,000 Greek and Turkish Cypriots were living in the UK. One estimate states that 130,000 nationals of the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) resided in the UK in 2008, a figure also given by the Turkish consulate in London, whereas the Museum of London reports that 100,000 Turkish Cypriots live in Britain‚Äî20,000 more than in Cyprus itself. Nergis Canefe suggests a figure of 190,000, whereas the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested in May 2001 that 200,000 Turkish Cypriots were living in the United Kingdom. Evidence submitted by the Home Office to the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee in February 2011 suggested that there were about 300,000 Turkish Cypriots living in the UK. Of the 80,010 people in England and Wales who specified their country of birth as Cyprus in the 2011 Census, 57.5 per cent stated that they were Christian, 20.8 per cent that they were Muslim, 13.1 per cent responded that they had no religion, and 7.9 per cent did not state a religion. Small numbers of Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Sikhs and those of other religions were recorded, totaling 0.6 per cent of the Cypriot-born resident population. = Population distribution = Of the 80,010 Cypriot- born residents of England and Wales recorded by the 2011 Census, 43,428 were in London and 8,254 in South East England. Detailed analysis of data from the previous census shows that of the 77,156 Cypriot-born people living in mainland Britain, 60 per cent lived in areas of London with Turkish communities. A total of 45,887 were resident in Greater London. Analysis of the census shows that Cypriot-born people were found in large numbers in the London boroughs of Enfield, Haringey, Barnet and Hackney. The census tracts with the highest number of Cypriot-born people were Southgate, Palmers Green, Upper Edmonton, Cockfosters, Lower Edmonton, Tottenham North and Tottenham South. Outside of London, concentrations are found in Borehamwood, Cheshunt, and Bristol.  Notable individuals  Fatima Whitbread A number of British Cypriot people are well known in the UK and overseas. These include George Michael, who was born in London to a Greek Cypriot father; Cat Stevens, who was also born in London to a Greek Cypriot father; entrepreneur Stelios Haji- Ioannou; Andreas Liveras, a Greek Cypriot-born businessman killed in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks; Theo Paphitis, an entrepreneur and TV personality; Greek Cypriot-born artist Panayiotis Kalorkoti; artist Tracey Emin, who has a Turkish Cypriot father; and fashion designer Hussein Chalayan, who was born in Nicosia. Everton footballer Leon Osman has a Turkish Cypriot father. Politician Andrew Adonis's father is a Greek Cypriot who moved to the UK aged 18, and both of Labour MP Bambos Charalambous's parents were born in Cyprus. British athlete and former world javelin champion Fatima Whitbread was born in London to a Turkish Cypriot mother and Greek Cypriot father, though she was later adopted.

Plot This story takes place in the distant future on the planet Aspidiske VII. A meeting of the \\"Special Subcommittee on Intergalactic Culture\\" is called to investigate the possibility of excessive wastefulness on the part of the \\"Historical Preservation Teams of the Bureau of Cultural Affairs\\". Secretary Hablar comes to present a sample of the work being done by the Historical Preservation Team. The sample he submits is an interview with one of the few surviving pioneers of the planet Gomeisa III. He is an old man named Hilmot Gustin. During the course of the interview it is learned that Hilmot was the inventor of the rollitor, a plow harness for an alien life form native to the planet, and also the man who discovered what swamp cream does for the complexion.

Early life The son of Lt.-Colonel Edward Butler Ruttledge, of the Indian Medical Service, and of his wife Alice Dennison, Ruttledge was educated at schools in Dresden and Lausanne and then at Cheltenham College. In 1903 he matriculated as an exhibitioner at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and in 1906 he took a second-class Honours degree in the Classical Honours tripos.Audrey Salkeld, Ruttledge, Hugh (1884‚Äì1961), mountaineer in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, online at Ruttledge, Hugh (1884‚Äì1961) (subscription required) accessed 1 March 2008 India and mountaineering Ruttledge passed the Indian Civil Service examination in 1908 and spent a year at the University of London studying Indian law, history and languages, before going out to India towards the end of 1909. He was posted as an assistant in Roorkee and Sitapur, then was promoted a magistrate at Agra. He played polo and took part in field sports including big game-hunting until in 1915 a fall from a horse left him with a curved spine and a compacted hip. Also in 1915, he married Dorothy Jessie Hair Elder at Agra, with whom he had one son and two daughters. In 1917, Ruttledge transferred to Lucknow as city magistrate and in 1921 became deputy commissioner there. In 1921, while on leave in Europe, he took up climbing in the Alps. In 1925, he went as deputy commissioner to Almora in the foothills of the Himalaya, and within sight of some of its great peaks. Despite his injuries, Ruttledge was still able to climb, and he made up his mind to get to know every part of his district. With his wife he began to explore the glaciers and peaks on India's northern frontier. The highest peak in the British Empire was then Nanda Devi, ringed around by a series of peaks above , so that it had hardly been approached. In 1925, with Colonel R. C. Wilson of the Indian Army and Dr T. H. Somervell, the Ruttledges scouted the area to the north-east of the great mountain, hoping to find an approach to it by Milam and the Timphu glacier; they eventually concluded that this would be too hazardous. Northern side of Mount Kailas Together with his wife, he completed the pilgrim circuit of Mount Kailas in July 1926, his wife being the first Western woman to perform this ceremony.John Snelling, The Sacred Mountain: Travellers and Pilgrims at Mount Kailas in Western Tibet, and the Great Universal Symbol of the Sacred Mountain, Hounslow: East West Publications, 1983, p. 120 Ruttledge was in Tibet on official business, but because the official whom he was expecting to see, the senior Garpon of Gartok, was detained elsewhere, Ruttledge and his wife decided to make the Kailas parikrama, whilst Wilson (who accompanied them on the trip) and a Sherpa called Satan (sic) explored the various approaches to the mountain. Ruttledge considered the north face of Kailas to be high and 'utterly unclimbable'.The Sacred Mountain, p. 118 He contemplated an ascent of the mountain via the north-east ridge but decided that he did not have sufficient time; on returning to Almora he wrote that he had enjoyed 'some of enjoyable trekking, performed entirely on foot to the scandal of right-thinking Indians and Tibetans'.The Sacred Mountain, pp. 119‚Äì20 Ruttledge and his wife also made the first known crossing of Traill's Pass between Nanda Devi and Nanda Kot. In 1927, with T. G. Longstaff and supported by Sherpas, Ruttledge reconnoitred the Nandakini valley and crossed a high pass between Trisul and Nanda Ghunti. (Left to right) Diplomat and glaciologist Philips Christiaan Visser, Ruttledge and photographer Erich Salomon (1930) Although Longstaff reported that the many peoples of Ruttledge's district had great respect for him, Ruttledge took early retirement from the Indian Civil Service in 1929. Somervell commented that \\"He was so tired of making plans that he knew to be right, to find that the Government always thought they knew better than the man on the spot\\".J. Longland, T. H. Somervell, and R. Wilson, \\"Hugh Ruttledge, 1884‚Äì1961\\", Alpine Journal, 67 (1962), pp. 393‚Äì9 By the time of his retirement, Ruttledge and his wife had crossed twelve different high passes. Ruttledge attempted to reach Nanda Devi three times in the 1930s and failed each time. In a letter to The Times he wrote that 'Nanda Devi imposes on her votaries an admission test as yet beyond their skill and endurance', adding that gaining the Nanda Devi Sanctuary alone was more difficult than reaching the North Pole.Review in The Guardian online (accessed 1 March 2008) 1933 Everest expedition In 1933 permission was granted to the British by the authorities in Tibet for a further attempt on the mountain. The Mount Everest Committee's task of finding a leader for this, the fourth British expedition, was made difficult by the incapacity of Charles Granville Bruce (the leader of previous British expeditions to the mountain), and the unwillingness of Major Geoffrey Bruce and Brigadier E. F. Norton to assume the role. As Ruttledge wrote, 'it was necessary to find someone with experience of Himalayan peoples as well as with mountaineering knowledge, and eventually the lot fell upon me'.Hugh Ruttledge, \\"The Mount Everest Expedition, 1933\\", The Geographical Journal, Vol. 83, No. 1 (Jan. 1934), p. 1 The northern side of Mount Everest, scene of British attempts in the 1920s and 1930s The personnel for this attempt, which used the then-standard route of choice of the British via the North Col, was made up of a combination of military types and Oxbridge graduates, and included none of those who had been on the 1924 attempt. The full British complement was Frank Smythe, Eric Shipton, Jack Longland, Eugene Birnie, Percy Wyn-Harris, Edward Shebbeare, Lawrence Wager, George Wood-Johnson, Hugh Boustead, Colin Crawford, Tom Brocklebank, E. Thompson and William Maclean, with Raymond Greene as senior doctor and William 'Smidge' Smyth-Windham as chief radio operator. The highest point attained on this attempt was 8,570 m (28,116 f), but the route was found to be too difficult and the vital camp V that should have been reached on a rare day with fair weather ‚Äì 20 May ‚Äì was, as a result of disagreements between team members, never established. It was during this expedition that Wyn-Harris found the ice axe which belonged to Andrew Irvine, who had disappeared on the peak on the 1924 British Expedition with George Mallory. One of the men rejected for this expedition was Tenzing Norgay, who made the first ascent of Everest in 1953 with Sir Edmund Hillary. Fortunately, Ruttledge had the foresight to hire Tenzing to come with him to Everest in 1936. In 1934 Ruttledge was awarded a Royal Geographical Society Founder's Gold Medal; his citation read 'For his journeys in the Himalayas and his leadership of the Mount Everest Expedition, 1933.' Although the Mount Everest committee set up an inquiry into the reasons for the failure of the expedition, Ruttledge was not blamed, almost all members of the expedition expressing their admiration and fondness for him. Publicity Following the 1933 expedition H.J. Cave & Sons used the fact that their Osilite trunks had been carried on the expedition as marketing.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1933/1933%20-%200115.html Following the success of this many other companies looked at sponsoring further attempts. 1936 Everest expedition With the near-universal support for his leadership on the 1933 trip, Ruttledge was selected to lead a second expedition (the sixth British expedition), which was the largest to date to attempt Everest. Alongside veterans of the 1933 expedition ‚Äì Frank Smythe, Eric Shipton and Percy Wyn-Harris ‚Äì team members were Charles Warren, Edmund Wigram, Edwin Kempson, Peter Oliver, James Gavin, John Morris and Gordon Noel Humphreys. William Smyth-Windham was again chief radio operator. Although the North Col was reached, a combination of high winds, storms and waist-deep snow made progress above 7,000 m difficult and, with the monsoon arriving early, Ruttledge called off the expedition. Tenzing Norgay wrote of Ruttledge and the 1936 expedition:Quoted in Man of Everest: The Autobiography of Tenzing, James Ramsey Ullman, London: George Harrap, 1955, (1956 reprint by The Reprint Society, p. 62) The island of Gometra (left), connected to the island of Ulva (right) by a bridge Later life In 1932 Ruttledge planned a life as a farmer and to this end bought the island of Gometra in the Inner Hebrides, just off the west coast of Mull. Upon returning from the 1936 expedition to Everest he decided that a life at sea would be preferable, and he bought several boats ‚Äì a converted Watson lifeboat and later a larger sailing cutter ‚Äì to pursue this idea. In 1950 he moved ashore, buying a house on the edge of Dartmoor. Ruttledge died in Stoke, Plymouth, on 7 November 1961.

The RMI depends on the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO). The Institute is a member of the World Meteorological Organization, of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, of EUMETSAT, and of the EIG Eumetnet. History In 1823, Adolphe Quetelet obtains from the Minister of Public Education the creation of an astronomical Observatory in Brussels. Meanwhile, are the first meteorological observations done with rudimentary instruments. In 1876, Jean-Charles Houzeau de Lehaie becomes the new director of the Observatory. Quickly, he plans to move the Observatory from the site of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode to Uccle, as well as making from astronomy and meteorology two separate departments. On September 1, 1876, the first Belgian weather forecast was edited, based on the analysis of a synoptic map. In April 1903, the first weather balloon was launched, in order to obtain meteorological observations at a higher altitude. On July 31, 1913, the meteorological service of the Observatory becomes an autonomous institute under the name of Royal Meteorological Institute (RMI). Jean Vincent is its first director. From 1914 until 1918, during the German occupation, the RMI stops all activities. It was bombed on August 20, 1914 and rebuilt at the beginning of 1919. In 1919, Jules Jaumotte, astronomer, aviator from World War I and pioneer in the aerial photography, becomes director of the RMI and focuses on the possibility to realize atmospheric soundings in real time. Those new approaches in the study of atmosphere lead to a new science, the synoptic Aerology. In this context, during Belgium's participation to the International Polar Year in 1932-1933, Jules Jaumotte performs automatic cloud photographs at high altitude by balloons, with a method that links the functioning of instruments to their altitude level. During World War II, the Institute was used by the Nazis as a military observatory and was destroyed by the English troops in 1944. In 1956, the RMI inaugurates the Geophysical Center of Dourbes, which studies magnetism and atmospheric electricity among other fields of research. Technological evolution In the 1990s and under the directorate of Henri Malcorps, the RMI started using several new technologies such as the installation in 1992 of a lightning detection system by radio interferometry (SAFIR). It is able to localize every impact of lightning throughout Belgium in real time, with an accuracy of about 1 km. Another example is, in 1993, when the RMI launched a meteorological database easily accessible with a computer: MeteoBBS. This system allows the display of satellite photos, meteorological radar pictures, the SAFIR maps, as well as all observations, weather forecasts and meteorological warnings. The scientific technology is quickly evolving and, in 1995, the METEOSAT satellite localized at 36.000 km above the Earth provided the first high quality images every half-hour. In 2001, the Royal Meteorological Institute acquired a brand new radar able to measure all kind of precipitation within a range of 240 km. It is located in Libramont, in the province of Luxembourg. Dr. Henri Malcorps retired in 2010, and Dr. Daniel Gellens has since then been the director ad interim of the RMI. Today The RMI is located in Uccle, in a site shared with the Royal Observatory of Belgium and the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy. Among other remarkable places on site, the climatological park of the RMI is the reference in Belgium for climatology. Under the authority of BELSPO, the RMI makes its priority in providing meteorological warnings to the Belgian population, along with the European organization Meteoalarm.meteoalarm.be The Institute gives daily weather forecasts to the public and to a few specific sectors including agriculture, transport, media and energy. Moreover, the RMI publishes a monthly climatological report, containing for every day of the previous month data on wind speed, average/minimum/maximum temperature, precipitation, insolation. It is entirely free and accessible through the RMI website.meteo.be The current face of RMI reflects the importance given to scientific meteorological research, in the fields of forecasting, issues concerning atmosphere and climate, the hydrological cycle, observations' systems, magnetism and the ionosphere. Tools and collaboration The Institute tops a network of meteorological stations all over Belgium, of radars, of a lightning detection system, of measures on satellites... The RMI takes also part into the elaboration of numerous projects, like the Solar Impulse, this extremely light and ambitious plane that functions on solar energy. The Royal Meteorological Institute works together with IRCELINE, and the Federal Public Service Health to warn the population in case of ozone peaks and heat waves.
