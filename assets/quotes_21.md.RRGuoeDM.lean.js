The United States assigned it the code-name Joe-1, in reference to Joseph Stalin. It was detonated on 29 August 1949 at 7:00 a.m., at Semipalatinsk Test Site, Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, after top-secret research and development as part of the Soviet atomic bomb project. In the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, it was discovered that the design of the RDS-1 was obtained via espionage, from documents stolen from the Los Alamos lab.  Description  The weapon was designed at the Kurchatov Institute, then at the time officially known as \\"Laboratory ‚Ññ 2\\" but designated as the \\"office\\" or \\"base\\" in internal documents, starting in April 1946. Plutonium for the bomb was produced at the industrial complex Chelyabinsk-40. David Greenglass's sketch of an implosion-type nuclear weapon design, illustrating what he allegedly gave the Rosenbergs to pass on to the Soviet Union. That was later discovered to be part of the plans involved in the development of RDS-1 at the espionage trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The RDS-1 explosion yielded 22 kilotons of TNT, similar to the US Gadget and Fat Man bombs. At Lavrentiy Beria's insistence, the RDS-1 bomb was designed as an implosion type weapon, similar to the Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan; RDS-1 also had a solid plutonium core. The bomb designers had developed a more sophisticated design (tested later as RDS-2) but rejected it because of the known reliability of the Fat Man type design, the Soviets having received extensive intelligence on the design of the Fat Man bomb during World War II, which was discovered in the espionage case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and during the Venona project. To test the effects of the new weapon, workers constructed houses made of wood and bricks, along with a bridge, and a simulated metro railway in the vicinity of the test site. Armoured hardware and approximately 50 aircraft were also brought to the testing grounds as well as over 1,500 animals to test the bomb's effects on life. The resulting data showed the RDS explosion to be 50% more destructive than originally estimated by its engineers. There are several explanations for the Soviet code-name of RDS-1, usually an arbitrary designation: a backronym \\"Special Jet Engine\\" (, Reaktivnyi Dvigatel Spetsialnyi), or \\"Stalin's Jet Engine\\" (, Reaktivnyi Dvigatel Stalina), or \\"Russia does it herself\\" (, Rossiya Delayet Sama). Later weapons were also designated RDS but with different model numbers. Mikhail Pervukhin served as the chairman of the commission in charge of the RDS-1 testing. Five RDS-1 weapons were completed as a pilot series by March 1950 with a serial production of the weapon that began in December 1951. The mushroom cloud from the first RDS-1 test (1949)  Detection by the West  Some United States Air Force WB-29 weather reconnaissance aircraft were fitted with special filters to collect atmospheric radioactive debris. On 1 September 1949, the Air Force Office of Atomic Energy had a WB-29 fly from Misawa Air Base in Japan to Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. The plane collected some debris during this flight. This data was then cross-checked with data from later flights, and it was determined that the Soviet Union had effectively tested a nuclear weapon.  Response in the West  The test surprised the Western powers. American intelligence had estimated that the Soviets would not produce an atomic weapon until 1953, while the British did not expect it until 1954. When the nuclear fission products from the test were detected by the U.S. Air Force, the United States began to follow the trail of the nuclear fallout debris.U.S. Intelligence and the Detection of the First Soviet Nuclear Test, September 1949, William Burr, Washington, D.C., 22 September 2009 President Harry S. Truman notified the world of the situation on 23 September 1949: \\"We have evidence that within recent weeks an atomic explosion occurred in the U.S.S.R.\\" Truman's statement likely in turn surprised the Soviets, who had hoped to keep the test a secret to avoid encouraging the Americans to increase their atomic programs, and did not know that the United States had built a test-detection system using the WB-29 Superfortress. The announcement was a turning point in the Cold War, that had just begun. Once the Soviet Union was confirmed to be in possession of the atomic bomb, pressure mounted to develop the first hydrogen bomb.

His period as king marked the beginning of the civil war era in Norway, which lasted until 1240.Magnus 4 Sigurdsson Blinde (Helge Salvesen. Store norske leksikon) Biography Magnus was the son of King Sigurd I of Norway and Borghild Olavsdotter. When King Sigurd died in 1130, Magnus became king of Norway together with his uncle Harald Gille. After four years of uneasy peace, Magnus began to openly prepare for war on Harald. On August 9, 1134, he defeated Harald in the decisive Battle at F√§rlev near F√§rlev in St√•ngen√§s herred in B√•huslen. Harald fled to Denmark. Against the advice of his councilors, Magnus disbanded his army and traveled to Bergen to spend the winter there. Harald then returned to Norway with a new army and the support of the Danish King Erik Emune. Meeting little opposition, he reached Bergen before Christmas. Magnus had few men, and the city fell easily to Harald's army on January 7, 1135. Magnus was captured and dethroned. He was blinded, castrated and had one leg cut off. After this he was known as Magnus the Blind (Magnus Sigurdsson den blinde). Magnus was put in Nidarholm Abbey on the island of Munkholmen in Trondheim Fjord, where he spent some time as a monk. Harald Gille was killed in 1136 by Sigurd Slembe, another royal pretender who had himself proclaimed king in 1135. To back his claim, Sigurd Slembe brought Magnus back from the abbey and made him co-king. They decided to split up their forces, and Magnus headed for eastern Norway, where he had most popular support. There, he was defeated at the Battle of Minne by the forces of King Inge I. He then fled to G√∂taland and subsequently to Denmark, where he tried to get support for his cause. An attempted invasion of Norway by King Erik Emune of Denmark failed miserably.Sigurd Slembe (Store norske leksikon) Magnus then rejoined Sigurd Slembe's men, but they continued to have little support in Norway. After some time spent more like bandits than kings, they met the forces of King Inge I and King Sigurd II in a final battle on November 12, 1139. Magnus fell during the naval Battle of Holmengr√• south of Hvaler in the Oslofjord. The loyal guard Reidar Grjotgardsson lifted his king at the final battle, but a spear impales them both. Magnus was buried in the Church of St. Hallvard in Oslo. There is a monument erected in memory of King Magnus the Blind at the Storedal farm in Skjeberg in √òstfold county.Magnus 4 Sigurdsson Blinde ‚Äì utdypning ( Nils Petter Thuesen. Store norske leksikon) Norwegian civil war During the civil wars period of Norwegian history (1130‚Äì1240) there were several interlocked conflicts of varying scale and intensity. The background for these conflicts were the unclear Norwegian succession laws, social conditions and the struggle between church and king. There were then two main parties, firstly known by varying names or no names at all, but finally condensed into parties of Bagler and Birkebeiner. The rallying point regularly was a royal son, who was set up as the head figure of the party in question, to oppose the rule of king from the contesting party.

It was founded in 1916, receiving its royal charter in 1928. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the patron. The majority of members are registered nurses; however student nurses and healthcare assistants are also members. There is also a category of membership, at a reduced cost, for retired people. The RCN describes its mission as representing nurses and nursing, promoting excellence in practice and shaping health policies. It has a network of stewards, safety representatives and union learning representatives as well as advice services for members. Services include a main library in London and regional libraries around the country. The RCN Institute also provides courses for nurses. History In 1916 the College of Nursing Ltd was founded with 34 members as a professional organisation for trained nurses on a proposal from Arthur Stanley. Part of the objective was to set up a register of nurses. It was very explicitly not to be a Trade Union. It attempted an amalgamation with the Royal British Nurses' Association, but this was frustrated, largely by the efforts of Ethel Gordon Fenwick. In March 1917 the College had 2,553 members and by 1919 13,047, a great deal more than the RBNA. It had most of the nursing places on the General Nursing Council when it was first established, and by 1925 it had about 24,000 members. Membership was restricted to registered general nurses, thus excluding male nurses. A Royal Charter was granted in 1928 and the organisation became the College of Nursing. It pushed for registered nurses to be given precedence, and to be in charge. In 1935 the Trades Union Congress promoted a Bill to secure a 48-hour working week for all hospital employees. The college opposed this and was accused by the TUC of being \\"an organisation of v oluntary snobs\\". In 1939 the college's name was changed to the Royal College of Nursing. The Ministry of Health guaranteed a salary of ¬£40 to nursing students in training in 1941, about double what voluntary hospitals were paying before the war. The Royal College said that this was too high. Since 1977 the RCN has been registered as a trade union. In 2018, after a pay agreement that was not clearly explained to the membership was agreed, the Chief Executive and General Secretary Janet Davies resigned and Dame Donna Kinnair was appointed in an acting capacity. She was eventually confirmed in the role in April 2018. A motion of no confidence in the RCN Council was called shortly afterwards and passed in September 2018 with 78% of members' votes, but only 3.7% of the membership voted. As well as the Chief Executive and General Secretary, the Director of Member Relations had previously resigned. Twelve of the 17 council members resigned, ten of them standing for re-election in the subsequent election.

Following the announcement of the removal of NHS Student bursaries in November 2015 the RCN declared its opposition for this decision in their manifesto \\"Nursing counts\\". RCN libraries RCN Library and Archives at the Senate House History Day, 2019 The RCN Library claims to be Europe's largest nursing-specific collection. The London Library, which is now known as the UK Library, was founded in 1921, and its contents include 60,000 volumes, 500 videos and 400 current periodicals on nursing and related subjects. The catalogue, with information on over 600m records, is now online. Due to its historical holdings, the Library is a member of The London Museums of Health & Medicine group. Special collections include the Historical Collection and the RCN Steinberg Collection of Nursing Research, the latter of which comprises over 1,000 nursing theses and dissertations. Set up in 1974, the RCN Steinberg Collection of Nursing Research contains a selection of influential nursing theses and dissertations from the early 1950s to the present day. Fellowships The RCN awards Fellowships for exceptional contributions to nursing. Honorary Fellowships can also be granted by RCN Council to those who are unable to become an RCN member, either because they are from overseas or because they work outside the nursing profession. Fellows and Honorary Fellows are entitled to the postnominal FRCN. RCN Publications RCN Publishing (branded as RCNi since March 2015) produces RCN Bulletin, a monthly member publication, and Nursing Standard, which is available through subscription and on news stands. It also publishes a range of journals for specialist nurses: Cancer Nursing Practice, Emergency Nurse, Learning Disability Practice, Mental Health Practice, Nursing Children and Young People, Nursing Management, Nursing Older People, Nurse Researcher, and Primary Health Care.

He was also, for a time, a prominent Esperanto author, translator and activist, until in 1911 he suddenly, without explanation, abandoned the Esperanto movement. Bein became at least as well known for his involvement with Esperanto as for his medical accomplishments, and as much for the manner in which he left the Esperanto movement as for what he had accomplished within it. Life As a young man, Bein participated in the Polish movement for independence from Russia, for which he was exiled for several years; thus he was forced to finish his medical training in Kazan. Bein authored many technical books and articles, and founded the Warsaw Ophthalmic Institute and the Polish Ophthalmological Society. He was also a noted amateur photographer. Esperanto movement Bein was among the earliest adopters of Esperanto, the international language that had been created by a fellow Polish ophthalmologist, Ludwik Zamenhof. Bein became an eminent pioneer of Esperanto prose, writing under the pseudonym, \\"Kabe,\\" an abbreviation of his actual name (and also the Polish pronunciation of his initials, \\"K.B.\\"). In 1904 he gained fame with his translation of a 1900 novel by Wac≈Çaw Sieroszewski, Dno nƒôdzy (The Depths of Misery; Esperanto title: Fundo de l' Mizero). In 1906 Bein became vice-president of the Academy of Esperanto. He had a profound influence on the language's early development. The highlights of his career were most likely his Esperanto translation of Boles≈Çaw Prus' historical novel, Faraon (Pharaoh), and one of the first Esperanto dictionaries, Vortaro de Esperanto. Bein is, however, probably best known for his sudden, comment-less 1911 disappearance from the Esperanto scene. Interviewed twenty years later, in 1931, by the Esperanto magazine, Literatura Mondo (World of Literature), he spoke of Esperanto's stalled progress, and said that he no longer regarded the language as a viable solution to the need for an international language.

Taron (; Western Armenian pronunciation: Daron; , Tar≈çn; ) was a canton of the Turuberan province of Greater Armenia, roughly corresponding to the Mu≈ü Province of modern Turkey.The Heritage of Armenian Literature: From the Sixth to the Eighteenth Century By Agop Jack Hacikyan - Page 478  Early Middle Ages  The main source on the principality's history during the Early Middle Ages is the History of Taron, a relatively short \\"historical\\" romance in five parts, purporting to describe significant events occurring in the district of Taron during the Byzantine‚ÄìSassanid Wars when the Sassanid emperor was Khosrau II (590-628). During Khosrau's reign, Taron was frequently invaded by the Persians. The History describes the actions of five generations of Mamikonians (Taron's princely house), in defending and avenging the district. Each section or cycle of the story is devoted to the exploits of one of the defenders: Mushegh, Vahan, Smbat, his son Vahan Kamsarakan, and the latter's son Tiran. The heroes are at times superhumanly brave or duplicitous, wise or cunning, humble or bombastic, humane or brutally merciless as the situation requires. Above all, they are the holy warriors of St. Karapet (John the Baptist, their patron saint), and they zealously defend the Saint Karapet Monastery (Glakavank) as well as all the churches and Christians in the district. Much of the narration describes battles fought and the cunning tactics used by the Taronites to defeat the invading Iranians.John Mamikonean's - History of Taron  Later history  With the death of Mushegh VI Mamikonian at the Battle of Bagrevand in April 775, and the eclipse of the Mamikonian from Armenian affairs, and following a conflict with the Jahhafids, Taron passed to Ashot Msaker of the Bagratuni family. His successors ruled Taron until 967: * Ashot I Msaker (died 826), ca. 813‚Äì826, presiding prince of Armenia (as Ashot IV) from 806 * Bagrat I (died after 851), 826‚Äì851, presiding prince of Armenia (as Bagrat II) after 830 * Ashot II (ca. 835 ‚Äì 878), after 851‚Äì878 * David (ca. 840 ‚Äì 895), 878‚Äì895 (brother of Ashot II) * Gurgen (murdered 895/6), 895/6 (son of Ashot II) * Taron seized by Ahmad ibn Isa al-Shaybani, 895/6‚Äì898 * Grigor I (died 923/36), 898‚Äì923/936 (cousin of Gurgen) * Bagrat II (died before 940) and Ashot III (died 967), 898‚Äì967 Upon the death of Ashot III in 967, his two sons, Grigor II (Gregory Taronites) and Bagrat III (Pankratios Taronites), ceded the principality to the Byzantine Empire in exchange for lands and noble titles. In Byzantium, probably along with other branches of their family already established there in previous decades, they formed the Taronites family, which was one of the senior Byzantine noble families during the 11th‚Äì12th centuries. Under Byzantine rule, Taron was united with the district of Keltzene into a single province (theme), whose governor (strategos or doux) usually bore the rank of protospatharios. In the middle of the 11th century, it was united with the theme of Vaspurakan under a single governor. Taron also became a metropolitan see with 21 suffragan sees. Following the Byzantine defeat in the Battle of Manzikert against the Seljuk Turks in 1071, an independent Armenian lord named Tornik seized power in Taron, with Mu≈ü as his capital. Tornik established a principality which held out as ruler of Taron until overrun by the Turks in 1189/90.

Early life Plowden was born at Plowden Hall, Lydbury North, Shropshire. He was the son of Humphrey Plowden (1490‚Äì1557), by his wife, Elizabeth Sturry (died 1559), widow of William Wollascot, and daughter of John Sturry, Esq., of Rossall, Shropshire.See Tresswell & Vincent, Vis. of Shropshire 1623, 1569 & 1584, 2 (H.S.P. 29) (1889): 448‚Äì449 (Stury ped.). Educated at the University of Cambridge, he did not take a degree, and proceeded to the Middle Temple in 1538 to study law. Subsequent to studies at Oxford, he qualified as a surgeon and physician in 1552. Upon the accession of the Catholic Queen Mary, Plowden was appointed one of the Council of the Marches (of Wales). In 1553, he was elected Member of Parliament for Wallingford (then in Berkshire now in Oxfordshire), followed, in the next two years, by the same office for both Reading, Berkshire and then Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire. He lived mostly at Shiplake Court in Oxfordshire and Wokefield Park in Berkshire. The unusual breadth of his religious views were shown early in his career when he, however, withdrew from the House, on 12 January 1555, because he disapproved of the proceedings there. Recusant under Elizabeth His Roman Catholicism prevented Plowden from further promotion under Queen Elizabeth I, and he received increasing suspicion from members of the Privy Council. At the beginning of the reign he undertook the management of the Shropshire lands of Sir Francis Englefield, an important Catholic courtier under Mary who went into exile. In 1567 he, with Edward Saunders, became joint guardian of Englefield's nephew and heir, Francis, through influence with the Earl of Pembroke.Plowden, Edmund (1519/20-85), of the Middle Temple, London; Plowden, Salop; Shiplake, Oxon. and Burghfield, Berks. At one time, it is said, the queen wished to elevate Plowden to the Lord Chancellorship. Plowden declined, deprecating religious persecution. The occasion, according to the History of Parliament, could only have been the vacancy of 1578. Plowden continued in the Queen's employ in his capacity as a lawyer. He sought to assist those of his faith, including his defence of Robert Horne, Bishop of Winchester. In 1565 he defended Edmund Bonner, with William Lovelace and Christopher Wray. Death Plowden died on 6 February 1585 in London and was entombed in the Temple Church. \\"The case is altered\\" \\"The case is altered\\" was a proverbial expression in the 17th century, as well as the title of a 1609 play by Ben Jonson. As \\"the case is alter'd, quoth Plowden\\", it is attached to anecdotes. In one of them, while defending a gentleman charged with hearing Mass, Plowden worked out that the service had been performed by a layman for the sole purpose of informing against those present, and exclaimed, \\"The case is altered; no priest, no Mass\\", and thus secured an acquittal. Works Plowden is noted today for his legal scholarship and theory, in his written works: *Les comentaries ou les reportes de Edmunde Plowden (1571) in law French. The Commentaries were abridged by Thomas Ashe (around 1597), and indexed by William Fleetwood. They contained a report by Plowden on the legal status of the Duchy of Lancaster in relation to The Crown, and its settlement by Henry IV of England. Plowden and Anthony Browne had, two decades earlier, formulated the theory of the King's Two Bodies to explain political arrangements; Ernst Kantorowicz has argued that this doctrine came to the fore in the 1560s, in debates over the status of the Duchy. *Quares del Monsieur Plowden. A Treatise on Succession attempted to prove that Mary, Queen of Scots, was not debarred from the English throne under Henry VIII's will. Family Plowden married Catherine Sheldon of Beoley, daughter of the Worcestershire Member of Parliament William Sheldon; they had three sons and two daughters (Anne and Mary). Anne was the wife of Francis Perkins of Ufton, Berkshire, and Mary was the wife of Richard White of Hutton, Essex. Mary was also the mother of Thomas White. Plowden's sister Margaret inherited the Rossall estates and married Richard Sandford of Eglington.

The Brahmin king Mayooravarma-2'nd of 9'th A.D. was instrumental in bringing the first Brahmin families. It is believed that second Kadamba dynasty brought many Brahmins in to perform the royal rituals and the related functions of the empirical government from a place called Ahichchathra in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Thus the first few families were settled in Banavasi, the capital of the Kadambas and the place adored by Pampa.[3] King Mayooravarma -2'nd act of inviting Brahmins to Banavasi has been inscribed on a stone stab(Shilashasana), which now lies near the village of Varadahalli in Sagara. It is now assumed and claimed that these Brahmin families brought from ahichchathra might be those of present-day havyaka families. The descendants and associates of Parshuram are called Tyagi Brahmins in Western UP, Bhumihar Brahmins in Eastern U.P. and Bihar, Goud Brahmins in U.P. and Rajasthan, Chitpawan Brahmins in Maharashtra, Anavil Brahmins in Gujarat, Namboothiri Brahmins in Kerela and Mohyals in the Punjab region. Their variants are found with different names all across the Indian sub-continent. They have same customs and practices.  Present day  Havyakas today are the followers of either Ramachandrapura Math or Swarnavalli Mutt and are guided by Advaita philosophy of Shankaracharya. Havyakas derive their last names from the jobs that they perform rather than by their origin. Till recently Havyakas were primarily engaged in Vedic professions or they were in agriculture especially growing betel nut, paddy, banana, coconut etc. A few decades ago they also started entering into all other vocations like business, education, employment etc. You won't find any Havyaka as Purohit at temples or performing any Havana in today's date. Most of the temple Purohits in South India are Kota, Gowda Saraswats, the Tamil and Telgu Brahmins, few Shivalli's and Namboodiris.  Geographic Distribution  Havyakas are mainly concentrated in the state of Karnataka. Dakshina Kannada, Uttar Kannada, Shimoga, Chikmagaluru and Kodagu Districts in Karnataka and Kasarogod in Kerala are the districts where Havyakas live for centuries. They are now spread all over India, especially in metropolitan cities of Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengaluru and other Industrial and business centres. Havyakas are also in large numbers in countries like United States of America, United Kingdom and other places outside India. [4]  Language  The Havyakas are united by their unique language. They speak a dialect of Kannada known as Havyaka Kannada. It is similar to mainstream Kannada but draws more words from ancient Kannada. However, most mainstream Kannada speakers find it difficult to understand Havyaka Kannada. The Havyaka dialect is supposed to be quite old. Its origins, like many other things in India, are shrouded in mystery. Notably certain Havigannada(Havyaka Kannada) speakers use neuter gender in place of feminine gender while addressing females. The dialect and even accent of Havyaka Kannada spoken in Uttara Kannada,Sirsi,Shimoga and Dakshina Kannada / Kasaragodu regions differ significantly.  Havyaka Food  Havyaka people are strict vegetarians and have a unique speciality dishes. Havyaka are known to cook food from all the available seasonal vegetables without wasting any part of it for example : every part of a jackfruit is used to cook variety of items from dosa to desserts like halwas The unique variety of dosa include Banana Dosa(bale hanni dose, bale kayi dose, jackfruit dosa(halasina hanni na dose, halasina kayi dose), coconut dosa, cucumber dosa(southe kayi dose) varities of rice cakes like: \\"halasina kottige\\", \\"southe kottige\\",\\"pathrode\\" and many many more Havyaka recipe consists of some unique food items like \\"Tellavu\\", \\"Todedevu\\", \\"Odape\\", \\"Kocheegayi gojju\\", \\"Mavinkai bootgojju\\", \\"Kai sasme\\", \\"Majjige Polja\\",\\"Holige\\", \\"Appehuli\\", \\"Tambli\\",\\"Halasinakayi huli\\", \\"Halasina happala\\", \\"Kaa'ee rasa\\", \\"Atrasa\\", \\"Hashi\\", \\"Sandige\\".

Cheema was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1993, and a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 2001 to 2004, making him one of only a few Canadian politicians to sit in two provincial legislatures since Confederation. He is the first Indian-born person to be elected MLA in Canada. He was also a cabinet minister in the government of Premier of British Columbia Gordon Campbell from 2001 to 2004, and was a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada in the federal election of 2004. Education The son of Ajinder Singh Cheema and Ajit Kaur Aulakh. he was born in village-Benagarh Jammu district in the [Jammu and kashmir] of India and received a bachelor's degree in medicine and surgery from Punjab University in 1977. In 1979, he married Harinder Claire daughter of Inderjit singh Kalair and Baljit Kalair and moved to Canada. He interned at Memorial University of Newfoundland and was a resident at Saskatoon's University Hospital. He was a family physician in Winnipeg from 1984 to 1993. In 1992, he was awarded the Canada 125 Medal for community service. To promote the health and welfare of the community, Cheema participates weekly on local multicultural radio talk shows and M Channel, a local multicultural television channel. Cheema is practicing family medicine and is a clinical assistant professor for the Department of Family Practice at UBC as well as the medical director for iCON South Asian Division eHealth Strategy Office Faculty of Medicine, UBC. He lives in Surrey, British Columbia, with his wife and children. Manitoba politics In the Manitoba general election of 1988, Cheema was elected as a Liberal in the northeastern Winnipeg riding of Kildonan. The Liberals went from one to twenty seats in the Manitoba legislature in this election, winning several Winnipeg seats from the governing New Democratic Party (NDP). Cheema defeated Progressive Conservative candidate John Baluta by 585 votes, with NDP incumbent Marty Dolin finishing third. The Progressive Conservatives came out of the election with a minority government, and Cheema became a member of the official opposition. Cheema increased his margin of victory in the 1990 provincial election when he ran in the new riding of The Maples, but the Liberal Party fell to seven seats and third-party status. During his time in the Manitoba assembly, he served as critic for health, labour, housing, native affairs, sport and co-operatives, and consumer and corporate affairs. He resigned his seat on June 17, 1993. BC politics Soon afterwards, he opened a family practice in Surrey, British Columbia. Cheema became involved in several community activities in British Columbia, including acting as chair of the 1998 British Columbia Games for Athletes with Disabilities' medical section. Although the British Columbia Liberal Party is usually regarded as significantly more right-wing than the Manitoba party, Cheema nevertheless ran as a BC Liberal in that province's 1996 provincial election. He was unsuccessful, finishing 380 votes behind New Democratic Party candidate Ian Waddell in Vancouver-Fraserview. The BC New Democrats experienced a sharp decline in their popularity between 1996 and 2001, and the provincial Liberals were elected in a landslide in that year's provincial election. Cheema had no difficulty being elected in Surrey-Panorama Ridge, defeating NDP candidate Bruce Ralston by over 6,000 votes. On June 5, 2001, he was appointed Minister of State for Mental Health Services. On January 20, 2004, he was appointed Minister of State for Immigration and Multicultural Services. Federal politics Later in 2004, Cheema sought and won the federal Liberal nomination in the new riding of Fleetwood‚ÄîPort Kells. He was removed from cabinet hours after submitting his nomination papers, and subsequently resigned as a provincial Member of the Legislative Assembly (Canadian politicians seeking federal office are usually required to step down from their provincial responsibilities.) In a relatively close three-way race, Cheema was defeated by Conservative candidate Nina Grewal, 14,052 votes to 11,568 (New Democratic Party candidate Barry Bell received 10,976 votes).

In the Early Middle Ages a feudal state of Gardman emerged on the area of Caucasian Albania. It roughly corresponded within the modern Qazakh, Shamkir, Agstafa, Dashkasan, Goygol, Tovuz, Gadabay rayons of Azerbaijan and Tavush Region of Armenia. History The Kingdom of Gardman- Parisos (yellow) in 1017 when it was acquired by the Kingdom of Lori (red). In prehistoric times Gardman was homeland of the proto-Armenian tribe Gardman, with a doubtful Georgian connection.Hewsen. Armenia, pp. 119, 163 Contemporary Armenian authors referred to the historical area of Gardman as Northern Artsakh. During the reign of the Arshakuni kings of Armenia (66-428 A.D.), Gardman was the seat of the nakharars of Utik' (and for this, it was sometimes called \\"Gardmantsvots ishkhanutyun\\", or the principality of Gardman).

After the collapse of the Armenian royal dynasty Gardman was acquired by Caucasian Albania in 387. In the seventh century the local house of Gardman was replaced by the Mihranid family (of Persian or Parthian origin),Bosworth, C.E. \\"Arran .\\" Encyclopedia Iranica. which later became the ruling dynasty in the region of Arran. The region was conquered by the Arabs in 855. Contemporary Armenian historians repeatedly noted the presence of two well known venues in Gardman: a fortress called Getabakk' (in the current-day Azerbaijani region of Gadabay) and a copper mine. In 982, Gardman and Parisos, the northern district of Artsakh, became a small Armenian kingdom of Parisos, which lasted until 1017 and thereafter it became part of the Kingdom of Lori. In 1601, the princely family of Melik-Shahnazaryan established the melikdom of Gardman. The ruling family belonged to a branch of the House of Khachen, and their residence was in the village of Voskanapat (and for this reasion, the statelet was sometimes referred to as the Voskanapat melikdom). The territorial rights of the meliks were confirmed after the Russian Empire took control of the region in the early nineteenth century.Hakobyan. Historical Geography, p. 378.

It is known for having produced the largest number of nobles under the Muhammad Ali dynasty from the 19th to the mid-20th Century. While no individual Abaza has been the ruler or president of Egypt, some Egyptian media have referred to them as one of the \\"families that rule the country\\", and as \\"Egypt‚Äôs oldest parliamentary dynasty\\".http://www.albawabhnews.com/482311#.UzL6117RRaw.facebook The Abaza family has also contributed to modern Arabic literature and art through the works of journalist and political activist Fekry Pasha Abaza, author Desouky Bek Abaza, poet Aziz Pasha Abaza, novelist Tharwat Abaza, actor Rushdy Abaza, among others.http://alqabas.com/97409/ They are thought to number around 50,000 members, but no official census has ever been conducted of Circassian communities residing in Egypt and thus the number is highly unreliable.  History  Abkhazia is a region of the Caucasian Black Sea coast, the home of the Abkhazians and Abazins, ethnic groups related to the Circassian people. The Abazins were one of several ethnic groups living in the Russian Empire who left during the ethnic cleansing of Circassians in the mid-19th century. However, some sources indicate that the Abaza family was well established in the Nile Delta by the late 18th century In Egypt, the Abkhazians took ‚Äî or were given ‚Äî the last name \\"Abaza\\". A belief among the Abaza family is that they were named after \\"a beloved grandmother ... or her place of birth\\". This maternal ancestor is thought to have married the head of the powerful El Ayed family prior to the reign of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. Many elders of the family sat on the Majlis created by Ibrahim Pasha. The monarchy had also endowed the family with villages and lands allowing the Abazas to flourish. Hassan Pasha Abaza, is widely considered to be the modern founding father of the family, also titled Sheikh of the Arabs, a title given to the heads of sufficiently influential families at the time. Other Abazas received variations on the title, such as Shiekh Boghdady Pasha Abaza who, along with Hassan Pasha, served in Ibrahim Pasha's Majlis making the Abazas the only family to hold two seats at the same time. Fekry Pasha Abaza On one occasion, during the accession of the young King Farouk, the Abaza family solicited palace authorities to permit the royal train to stop briefly, at their village, so that the king could partake in refreshments which were offered in a large, ornate tent they had erected at the train station.Yunan Labib Rizk, The making of a king , Al-Ahram Weekly, 762, 29 Sep - 5 Oct 2005. In 2014, the family sued Sada Elbalad TV for the creation of a children's cartoon named Abaza and the program was forced off the air. In the same year Egyptian satellite channel CBC Two aired a one-hour documentary about the family. A lentil dish attributed to Egypt's Abaza family is known in the country as \\"'ads abazy\\" (). Notable members Notable family members include Wagih Abaza, who served as governor in several Egyptian governorates including Sharqia, Cairo, Beheira and Gharbia. Wagih Abaza was an active member of the Free Officers Movement that toppled the Egyptian monarchy and forced King Farouk to abdicate in 1952. Rushdy Abaza The family is known for their contributions to modern Arabic literature through the works of Aziz Pasha Abaza and Tharwat Abaza, as well as the journalism and political activism of Fekry Pasha Abaza. Tharwat was a journalist and novelist who opposed the nationalization of the Suez Canal. His best-known novel, A Man Escaping from Time, was televised in the late 1960s. Rushdy Abaza, an actor with no less than 150 movies to his name was not chosen to star in Lawrence of Arabia but acted \\"like a star\\" during the audition. Amina Tharwat Abaza Tharwat Abaza's daughter, Amina Tharwat Abaza, is an active member of Egypt's animal rights community, having founded the country's first and largest animal rights organization, the Society for Protection of Animal Rights in Egypt. Other notable members of the family include the longest-serving minister in Egyptian history, Maher Abaza. He was the Minister of Electricity and Energy and is credited with connecting the vast majority of the country's rural areas to the electric grid. Their main stronghold was the governorate of Sharqia. Several villages in the Nile Delta are named after members of the family, mainly concentrated around the town of Kafr Abaza. For decades, the family had a political monopoly over several districts. In the 2015 parliamentary elections, three members of the Abaza family won seats in the House of Representatives and this was criticized by some in the media referring to their win as \\"dynastic heredity\\".

The species is native to freshwater habitats in the United States. M. temminckii is one of the heaviest freshwater turtles in the world. It is the largest freshwater species of turtle in North America. It is often associated with, but not closely related to, the common snapping turtle, which is in the genus Chelydra. The specific epithet temminckii is in honor of Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Macrochelys temminckii, p. 263). Taxonomy Although it was once believed that only one extant species exists in the genus Macrochelys, recent studies have shown that there are two species, the other being the Suwannee snapping turtle (M. suwanniensis) of the Suwannee River A third species, the Apalachicola snapping turtle (M. apalachicolae), has been proposed, but is generally not recognized. Common name The alligator snapping turtle is given its common name because of its immensely powerful jaws and distinct ridges on its shell that are similar in appearance to the rough, ridged skin of an alligator. It is also slightly less commonly known as \\"the loggerhead snapper\\" (not to be confused with the loggerhead sea turtle or loggerhead musk turtle). Distribution and habitat The alligator snapping turtle is found primarily in waters of the southeastern United States. It is found from the Florida Panhandle west to East Texas, north to southeastern Kansas, Missouri, southeastern Iowa, western Illinois, southern Indiana, western Kentucky, and western Tennessee. Typically, only nesting females venture onto open land. There are non-native established invasive populations of the alligator snapping turtle in South Africa.http://www.invasives.org.za/component/k2/item/852-alligator-snapping- turtle-macrochelys-temmincki Invasive Species South Africa - Protecting Biodiversity from Invasion - Alligator snapping turtle Macrochelys temminckii Physical description Holbrook's North American Herpetology, 1842 The alligator snapping turtle is characterized by a large, heavy head, and a long, thick shell with three dorsal ridges of large scales (osteoderms), giving it a primitive appearance reminiscent of some of the plated dinosaurs, most notably Ankylosaurus. It can be immediately distinguished from the common snapping turtle by the three distinct rows of spikes and raised plates on the carapace, whereas the common snapping turtle has a smoother carapace. M. temminckii is a solid gray, brown, black, or olive-green in color, and often covered with algae. It has radiating yellow patterns around the eyes, serving to break up the outline of the eyes to keep the turtle camouflaged.

A mature male's cloaca extends beyond the carapace edge, a female's is placed exactly on the edge if not nearer to the plastron. The base of the tail of the male is also thicker as compared to that of the female because of the hidden reproductive organs. The inside of the turtle's mouth is camouflaged, and it possesses a vermiform (i.e., \\"worm-shaped\\") appendage on the tip of its tongue used to lure fish, a form of aggressive mimicry. This turtle must be handled with extreme care and considered potentially dangerous. This species can bite through the handle of a broom and rare cases have been reported in which human fingers have been cleanly bitten off by the species.Pritchard P (1979). Encyclopedia of Turtles. Neptune, New Jersey: T.F.H. Publications, Inc. . No human deaths have been reported to have been caused by the alligator snapping turtle. Diet The alligator snapping turtle is an opportunistic feeder that is almost entirely carnivorous. It relies on both live food caught by itself and dead organisms which it scavenges. In general, it will eat almost anything it can catch. Fishermen have glorified the species' ability to catch fish and to deplete fish populations, whereas in fact it largely targets any abundant and easily caught prey, and rarely has any extensive deleterious effect on fish populations.Ernst C, Barbour R, Lovich J (1994). Turtles of the United States and Canada. Washington, District of Columbia: Smithsonian Institution Press. . Its natural diet consist primarily of fish and fish carcasses, molluscs, carrion, and amphibians, but it is also known to eat snakes, crayfish, worms, water birds, aquatic plants, other turtles and sometimes even small alligators. In one study conducted in Louisiana, 79.8% of the stomach contents of adult alligator snapping turtles was found to be composed of other turtles, although the resistance of shell and reptile-bone fragments to digestion may have led these fragments to remain longer in the digestive tract than other items. This species may also, on occasion, prey on aquatic rodents, including nutrias and muskrats or even snatch small to mid-sized other mammals, including squirrels, mice, opossums, raccoons, and armadillos when they attempt to swim or come near the water's edge. The alligator snapping turtle seemingly most often hunts at night. It may also hunt diurnally, however. By day, it may try to attract fish and other prey by sitting quietly at the bottom of murky water and letting its jaws hang open to reveal its tongue appendage, which looks like a small, pink, worm in the back of its gray mouth, and lure the prey into striking distance. The vermiform tongue imitates the movements of a worm, luring prey to the turtle's mouth. The mouth is then closed with tremendous speed and force, completing the ambush. Although the turtle does not actively hunt its prey, it can detect chemosensory cues from prey, like the mud turtle in order to choose the location in which it is most likely to catch food. Small fish, such as minnows, are often caught in this way by younger alligator snapping turtles, whereas adults must eat a greater quantity per day and must forage more actively. Though not a regular food source for them, adult alligator snappers have even been known to kill and eat small American alligators.Alligator Snapping Turtle. Bronx Zoo In captivity, it may consume almost any kind of meat provided, including beef, chicken, rabbit, and pork. It will refuse to eat if exposed to extremes in temperature. Reproduction and lifespan Maturity is reached around 12 years of age. Mating takes place yearly, in early spring in the southern part of its geographic range, and in later spring in the northern part. About two months later, the female builds a nest and lays a clutch of 10‚Äì50 eggs. The sex of the young depends on the temperature at which the eggs are incubated. This is called temperature dependant sex determination, and it is used by all turtle species to determine sex. For the alligator snapping turtle, higher temperatures produce more males in a clutch. Nests are typically excavated at least 50 yards from the water's edge to prevent them from being flooded and drowned. Incubation takes from 100 to 140 days, and hatchlings emerge in the early fall. Though its potential lifespan in the wild is unknown, the alligator snapping turtle is believed to be capable of living to 200 years of age, but 80 to 120 is more likely. In captivity, it typically lives between 20 and 70 years. Predation The alligator snapping turtle is most vulnerable to predators before and shortly after hatching. The eggs can be eaten by birds or mammals. The risk of predation decreases as the turtle gets bigger, so the adult turtle does not have as many predators. Humans are also a threat to the alligator snapping turtle. Under human care Correct handling of a 45-pound alligator snapping turtle at Austin Reptile Service, in Austin, Texas The alligator snapping turtle is sometimes captive-bred as a pet and is readily available in the exotic animal trade. Due to its potential size and specific needs, it does not make a particularly good pet for any but the most experienced aquatic turtle keepers.AST Care Sheet. Austinsturtlepage.com. Retrieved on August 22, 2012. It prefers to feed on live fish, but will readily feed on other types of meat or leafy vegetables if offered. Hand feeding is dangerous. Extreme temperatures are known to affect the turtle's appetite and would result in the turtle refusing to feed until it has been remedied. Due to its sheer size, handling adult specimens can pose significant problems. Small turtles can be held by the sides of the shell with relative safety, but large individuals must be held by grabbing the turtle's shell just behind the head and in front of the tail. Despite its reputation, the alligator snapping turtle is typically not prone to biting. However, if provoked it is quite capable of delivering a powerful bite which can easily amputate fingers or cause other significant injuries such as cuts. Some U.S. states, where the alligator snapping turtle does not naturally occur (such as California), prohibit it from being kept as a pet by residents. Invasive species Some alligator snapping turtles were released or escaped into waters of the Czech Republic, Germany and Hungary.

Conservation status Because of collection for the exotic pet trade, overharvesting for its meat, and habitat destruction, some states have imposed bans on collecting the alligator snapping turtle from the wild. The IUCN lists it as a threatened species, and as of June 14, 2006, it was afforded some international protection by being listed as a CITES III species (which will put limits on exportation from the United States and all international trade in this species). The alligator snapping turtle is now endangered in several states, including Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri, where it is protected by state law.Recommendation for preliminary adoption of amendments to the list of endangered reptiles and amphibians in 312 IAC 9-5-4; Administrative Cause No. 10-170D. in.gov It is designated as \\"in need of conservation\\" in Kansas.Kansas Admin.

The intention behind the activity might be to subject the unguarded vessel to piracy, hold the inebriated sailors hostage or simply drum up business for local taverns and brothels. At the time when the practice was common, it was often accomplished by sending prostitutes carrying large quantities of alcohol onto the targeted ships to serve as lures; those arranging for this to occur might be described as having committed the action in addition to those actually boarding the ships.

This includes infections of the eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea. It is used as eyedrops. Natamycin is also used in the food industry as a preservative. Allergic reactions may occur. It is unclear if medical use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. It is in the macrolide and polyene families of medications. It results in fungal death by altering the cell membrane. Natamycin was discovered in 1955 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1978. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is produced by fermentation of certain type of the bacterium Streptomyces.  Uses   Medical  Natamycin is used to treat fungal infections, including Candida, Aspergillus, Cephalosporium, Fusarium, and Penicillium. It is applied topically as a cream, in eye drops, or (for oral infections) in a lozenge. Natamycin shows negligible absorption into the body when administered in these ways. When taken orally, little or none is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, making it inappropriate for systemic infections.Sweetman, S. (2004). Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference Natamycin lozenges are also prescribed to treat yeast infections and oral thrush.Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine (http://cpharm.vetmed.vt.edu/VM8784/antimicrobials/Classes/antifungals.cfm)  Food  Natamycin has been used for decades in the food industry as a hurdle to fungal outgrowth in dairy products and other foods. Potential advantages for the usage of natamycin might include the replacement of traditional chemical preservatives, a neutral flavor impact, and less dependence on pH for efficacy, as is common with chemical preservatives. It can be applied in a variety of ways: as an aqueous suspension (such as mixed into a brine) sprayed on the product or into which the product is dipped, or in powdered form (along with an anticaking agent such as cellulose) sprinkled on or mixed into the product. While not currently approved for use on meats in the United States, some countries allow natamycin to be applied to the surface of dry and fermented sausages to prevent mold growth on the casing. Also, natamycin is approved for various dairy applications in the United States. More specifically, natamycin is commonly used in products such as cream cheeses, cottage cheese, sour cream, yogurt, shredded cheeses, cheese slices, and packaged salad mixes. One of the reasons for food producers to use natamycin is to replace the artificial preservative sorbic acid.Kraft cheese singles ditch artificial preservatives As a food additive, it has E number E235. Throughout the European Union, it is approved only as a surface preservative for certain cheese and dried sausage products. It must not be detectable 5 mm below the rind. While natamycin is approved in different applications at different levels in the world, it is approved in over 150 countries worldwide.Regulatory information: www.natamycin.com The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) panel took over the responsibilities of providing scientific food safety advice to the EU from the Scientific Committee on Food in 2002.Safety and regulation: the formal process for analyzing the test data on food additives In 2009, the EFSA considered the proposed use levels of natamycin are safe if it is used for the surface treatment for these cheese and sausage types.Scientific Opinion on the use of natamycin (E 235) as a food additive  Safety  Natamycin does not have acute toxicity. In animal studies, the lowest found was 2.5-4.5 g/kg. In rats, the LD50 is ‚â•2300 mg/kg, and doses of 500 mg/kg/day over 2 years caused no detectable differences in survival rate, growth, or incidence of tumors. The metabolites of natamycin also lack toxicity. The breakdown products of natamycin under various storage conditions may have a lower LD50 than natamycin, but in all cases, the numbers are quite high. In humans, a dose of 500 mg/kg/day repeated over multiple days caused nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.Mattia, A. et al. Safety evaluation of certain food additives and contaminants: natamicin (pimaricin). WHO Food Additives Series #48. No evidence shows natamycin, at either pharmacological levels or levels encountered as a food additive, can harm normal intestinal flora, but definitive research may not be available. However, some people are allergic to natamycin.Natacyn Side Effects Center The EFSA has concluded that the use of natamycin as a food additive has no relevant risk for the development of resistant fungi.  Mechanism of action  Natamycin inhibits the growth of fungi by specifically binding to ergosterol present in fungal cell membranes. Natamycin inhibits amino acid and glucose transport proteins leading to a loss of nutrient transport across the plasma membrane. While this binding is reversible, ergosterol binding acts as a universal mechanism of fungal inhibition, allowing pimaricin to act on diverse fungal pathogens from Saccharomyces yeast to Aspergillus moulds. Natamycin is unique amongst related antifungals specifically because it does not cause membrane permeabilization. Natamycin has very low solubility in water; however, natamycin is effective at very low levels. Its minimum inhibitory concentration is less than 10 ppm for most molds.  History It is produced as a secondary metabolite by some Streptomyces species: S. natalensis, S. lydicus, S. chattanoogensis and S. gilvosporeus. Natamycin was first isolated in 1955 from fermentation broth of a Streptomyces natalensis cell culture.‚ÄúPimaricin, a new antifungal antibiotic‚Äù in Antibiotics Annual in 1957. Natamycin VGP (http://www.natamycinvgp.com/the-origins-of-natamycin/#prettyPhoto) It was originally named pimaricin to honor Pietermaritzburg, where Streptomyces natalensis was acquired.

The term creationism in its broad sense covers a wide range of views and interpretations, and was not in common use before the late 19th century. Throughout recorded history, many people have viewed the universe as a created entity. Many ancient historical accounts from around the world refer to or imply a creation of the earth and universe. Although specific historical understandings of creationism have used varying degrees of empirical, spiritual and/or philosophical investigations, they are all based on the view that the universe was created. The Genesis creation narrative has provided a basic framework for Jewish and Christian epistemological understandings of how the universe came into being ‚Äì through the divine intervention of the god, Yahweh. Historically, literal interpretations of this narrative were more dominant than allegorical ones. From the 18th century on, various views aimed at reconciling the Abrahamic religions and Genesis with geology, biology and other sciences developed in Western culture. At this time, the word creationism referred to a doctrine of creation of the soul. Those holding that species had been created in a separate act, such as Philip Gosse in 1857, were generally called \\"advocates of creation\\", though they were also called \\"creationists\\" in private correspondence between Charles Darwin and his friends, dating from 1856. In the 20th century the word \\"creationism\\" became associated with the anti-evolution movement of the 1920s and young Earth creationism, but this usage was contested by other groups, such as old Earth creationists and evolutionary creationists, who hold different concepts of creation, such as the acceptance of the age of the Earth and biological evolution as understood by the scientific community.Haarsma 2010, p. 168, \\"Some Christians, often called 'Young Earth creationists,' reject evolution in order to maintain a semi-literal interpretation of certain biblical passages. Other Christians, called 'progressive creationists,' accept the scientific evidence for some evolution over a long history of the earth, but also insist that God must have performed some miracles during that history to create new life-forms. The theory of Intelligent Design, as it is promoted in North America is a form of progressive creation. Still other Christians, called 'theistic evolutionists' or 'evolutionary creationists,' assert that the scientific theory of evolution and the religious beliefs of Christianity can both be true.\\" The Genesis Flood (1961) became the most successful young earth creationist publication after 1945. From the mid-1960s, creationists in the United States promoted the teaching of \\"scientific creationism\\" using \\"Flood geology\\" in public school science classes. After the legal judgment of the case Daniel v. Waters (1975) ruled that teaching creationism in public schools contravened the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the content was stripped of overt biblical references and renamed creation science. When the court case Edwards v. Aguillard (1987) ruled that creation science similarly contravened the constitution, all references to \\"creation\\" in a draft school textbook were changed to refer to intelligent design, which was presented by creationists as a new scientific theory. The Kitzmiller v. Dover (2005) ruling concluded that intelligent design is not science and contravenes the constitutional restriction on teaching religion in public school science classes. In September 2012, Bill Nye (\\"The Science Guy\\") expressed his concern that creationist views threaten science education and innovations in the United States. Creation and Modern science In the 15th and 16th centuries, discoveries in new lands brought knowledge of the diversity of life. In 1605, Francis Bacon emphasized that the works of God in nature teach us how to interpret the Bible, and the Baconian method introduced the empirical approach which became central to modern science. Natural theology sought evidence in nature supporting an active role of God, and attempts were made to reconcile new knowledge with the biblical deluge myth and story of Noah's Ark. Adapted from Young 1995 The development of modern geology in the 18th and 19th centuries found geological strata and fossil sequences indicating a very ancient Earth. The diluvial cosmogonies fell victim to their own success, as the spirit of scientific inquiry they had stimulated, gradually led to discoveries that undercut the biblical premises of flood geology and catastrophism. From around the start of the 19th century, ideas such as Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's concept of transmutation of species had gained supporters in Paris and Edinburgh, mostly amongst anatomists. The anonymous publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation in 1844 aroused wide public interest with support from Quakers and Unitarians, but was strongly criticised by the religious establishment and the scientific community, which called for solidly backed science. In 1859, Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species provided that evidence from an authoritative and respected source, and within a decade or so convinced scientists that evolution occurs. This view clashed with that of conservative evangelicals in the Church of England, but in 1860 their attention turned to the much greater uproar about Essays and Reviews by liberal Anglican theologians, which introduced \\"higher criticism\\", a hermeneutic method re-examining the Bible and questioning literal readings. By 1875 most American naturalists supported ideas of theistic evolution, often involving special creation of human beings. At this time those holding that species had been separately created were generally called \\"advocates of creation,\\" but they were occasionally called \\"creationists\\" in private correspondence between Charles Darwin and his friends. The term appears in letters Darwin wrote between 1856 and 1863, * and was also used in a response by Charles Lyell. By this time, geologists recognised that the Earth was millions of years old. The exact chronology proposed by Darwin was disputed by other geologists, and the leading physicist William Thomson (later ennobled as Lord Kelvin) produced an analyses of the heat energy and thermal histories of the Earth and Sun which yielded age estimates that were too short for gradual evolution. Thomson's colleague Fleeming Jenkin wrote an 1867 review of Darwin's On the Origin of species which opposed evolution on the basis of the shortened time available. Kelvin's age paradox was not resolved until it was discovered in the 20th century that the Earth is heated by radioactive decay, that its internal thermal gradient is affected by mantle convection, and that the Sun is heated by nuclear fusion. Since the 1980s, the big-bang theory has been the prevailing cosmological model for the universe. It was envisioned by a Roman Catholic priest, Monsignor Georges Lema√Ætre in the 1930s. Lema√Ætre suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a \\"primeval atom\\" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence. However, in the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist subscribed to a view that the universe is in an eternal steady state. After Lema√Ætre proposed his theory, some scientists complained that its assumption that time had a beginning amounted to a reimportation of religious concepts into physics. When the expression \\"Big Bang\\" was coined by Fred Hoyle in 1949, he meant it to be slightly pejorative, but the term stuck and gained currency. Lema√Ætre himself concluded that an initial \\"creation-like\\" event must have occurred. The Big-Bang is contrary to young-Earth creationism, sensu stricto. But it has been welcomed by other Christian creeds, and it is in line with the Roman Catholic concept of creation., citing Under the Anthropic principle, by which the properties of the universe is seemingly fine-tuned for our own existence, some Christians see evidence that a divine creator has purposefully designed the universe. Pre-scientific era Early history St. Augustine of Hippo David Sedley, in his book Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity, traces creationary thought to the presocratic thinkers Anaxagoras and Empedocles, in the 5th century BCE. Sedley states that Anaxagoras was recognized by Plato as \\"the first overt champion of a creative cosmic intelligence. Anaxagoras's theory was that the original state of the world was a roughly even mixture of all opposites, and that it was the effect of the action of nous (intelligence or mind) that led to the partial separation of such opposites, hot from cold, land from water, rarefied from dense. Anaxagoras also developed the philosophical innovation of dualism of mind from matter, diverging from the stringent monism of his predecessor, Parmenides. Empedocles proposed a system whereby two competing divine forces, Love (harmony and blending) and Strife (separation) had alternating dominion over the universe and the four elements, earth, water, air and fire. Around 45 BCE, Cicero made a teleological argument that anticipated the watchmaker analogy, in De natura deorum, ii. 34 :When you see a sundial or a water-clock, you see that it tells the time by design and not by chance. How then can you imagine that the universe as a whole is devoid of purpose and intelligence, when it embraces everything, including these artifacts themselves and their artificers? (Gjertsen 1989, p. 199, quoted by Dennett 1995, p. 29) 170 ‚Äì Galen, Stoic Roman physician wrote against creation beliefs in On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body, 11.14: :It is precisely this point in which our own opinion and that of Plato and of the other Greeks who follow the right method in natural science differ from the position taken up by Moses. For the latter it seems enough to say that God simply willed the arrangement of matter and it was presently arranged in due order; for he believes everything to be possible with God, even should he wish to make a bull or a horse out of ashes. We, however, do not hold this; we say that certain things are impossible by nature and that God does not even attempt such things at all but that he [sic] chooses the best out of the possibility of becoming. In the 5th century, Saint Augustine wrote The Literal Meaning of Genesis in which he argued that Genesis should be interpreted as God forming the Earth and life from pre-existing matter and allowed for an allegorical interpretation of the first chapter of Genesis. For example: he argues that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a logical framework, rather than the passage of time in a physical way. On the other hand, Augustine called for a historical view of the remainder of the history recorded in Genesis, including the creation of Adam and Eve, and the Flood. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that Christians should be willing to change their minds about it as new information comes up. He also warned believers not to rashly interpret things literally that might be allegorical, as it would discredit the faith. 610‚Äì632 ‚Äì Muhammad reports receiving the Qur'an by divine revelation. The Qur'an holds many of the core concepts of creationism, including a 6-day creation, Adam and Eve, Enoch, and Noah's ark, but also provides some details absent from Genesis, including reference to a fourth son of Noah who chose not to enter the ark. Through Islam, creation beliefs and monotheism replace paganism among the Arabs. Renaissance and protoscience Creation of the Animals by Tintoretto, c. 1550. Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice The Renaissance starting in the 14th century saw the establishment of protoscience that eventually became modern science. This was a period of great social change. The Protestant Reformation introduced lay people reading the Bible in translation and more literal understandings, and led to a new belief that every biological species had been individually created by God. Protoscience The Baconian method introduced the empirical scientific method. Natural theology sought evidence in nature supporting Christianity. Nicolaus Copernicus's idea of Heliocentrism was proposed in the 16th century and established by Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler and Newton. This overturned the Greek Ptolemaic system of geocentrism, which had been adopted as Church dogma with the fusion of Christianity with Greek Philosophy in the first few centuries CE. The English naturalist John Ray (1627‚Äì1705) is sometimes referred to as the father of English natural history. As well as collecting and classifying plants, he wrote two books entitled The Wisdom of God manifested in the Works of the Creation (1691), and Miscellaneous Discourses concerning the Dissolution and Changes of the World (1692), which included essays on The Primitive Chaos and Creation of the World, The General Deluge, its Causes and Effects, and The Dissolution of the World and Future Conflagrations. In The Wisdom of God he included many of the familiar examples of purposive adaptation and design in nature (the teleological argument), such as the structure of the eye, the hollowness of the bones, the camel's stomach and the hedgehog's armor. Carl Linnaeus, in the 18th century, established a system of classification of species by similarity. At the time, the system of classification was seen as the plan of organization used by God in his creation. Later, the theory of evolution applied it as groundwork for the idea of common descent. Religious arguments In 1650 the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh, James Ussher, published a monumental history of the world from creation to 70 A.D. He used the recorded genealogies and ages in the bible to derive what is commonly known as the Ussher chronology. This calculated a date for creation at 4004 BCE. The date was widely accepted in the English-speaking world. In 1696, William Whiston published A New Theory of the Earth, in which he proposed an account of the creation of the world. He grounded his argument in the following three Postulata: :1) The obvious or literal sense of scripture is the true and real one, where no evidence can be given to the contrary. :2) That which is clearly accountable in a natural way, is not, without reason to be ascribed to a miraculous power. :3) What ancient tradition asserts of the constitution of nature, or of the origin and primitive states of the world, is to be allowed for true, where ‚Äòtis fully agreeable to scripture, reason, and philosophy. Whiston was the first to propose that the global flood was caused by the water in the tail of a comet. The English divine William Derham (1657‚Äì1735) published his Artificial Clockmaker in 1696 and Physico-Theology in 1713. These books were teleological arguments for the being and attributes of God, and were used by Paley nearly a century later. The Watchmaker analogy was put by Bernard Nieuwentyt (1730) and referred to several times by Paley. A charge of wholesale plagiarism from this book was brought against Paley in the Athenaeum for 1848, but the famous illustration of the watch was not peculiar to Nieuwentyt, and had been appropriated by many others before Paley. David Hume (1711‚Äì1776), a Scottish naturalist, empiricist, and skeptic, argued for naturalism and against belief in God. He argued that order stems from both design and natural processes, so it is not necessary to infer a designer when one sees order; that the design argument, even if it worked, would not support a robust or even moral God, that the argument begged the question of the origin of God, and that design was merely a human projection onto the forces of nature. Scientific era Modern geology and gap theory James Hutton is often viewed as the first modern geologist. In 1785 he presented a paper entitled Theory of the Earth to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Based upon a detailed examination of what we now recognise as the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere he showed that the present forces seen on the earth were sufficient to explain all the phenomena observed. He wrote \\"The Mosaic history places this beginning of man at no great distance; and there has not been found, in natural history, any document by which a high antiquity can be attribted to the human race. But this is not the case with regard to the inferior species of animals, particularly those which inhabit the ocean and its shorees. We find in natural history monuments which prove that those animals had long existed; and thus we thus preocure a measure for the computation of time extremely remote though far from being precisely ascertained\\"(p8) Based upon these principles of uniformitarianism, he demonstrated that the Earth is much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediment to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land.Hutton, J. (1785) Theory of the Earth The presumption that the world was only 6,000 years old was scientifically abandoned as a result of Hutton's work. This development of the scientific discipline of geology, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the discovery that the Earth was far older than a literal interpretation of the Book of Genesis could account for, led to the development, and popularity, of the Gap Theory (now known as gap creationism) to accommodate these discoveries. Gap Theory assumes a recent six-day creation, but also that the Earth existed for many ages before this event, ending in cataclysm and a new creation (hence its alternative title 'ruin-restoration theory'). In the early 19th century, \\"a heterogeneous group of writers,\\" known as scriptural geologists, arose to oppose these discoveries,The Great Devonian Controversy, Martin J. S. Rudwick, 1988, , pp. 42-44 and the Gap Theory. Their views were marginalised and ignored by the scientific community of their time.\\"But since [William Henry Fitton] and other geologists regarded [scriptural geology] as scientifically worthless‚Ä¶\\" ‚Äî Worlds before Adam, Martin J. S. Rudwick, 2008, , p. 84 They \\"had much the same relationship to 'philosophical' (or scientific) geologists as their indirect descendants, the twentieth-century creationists.\\" Paul Wood describes them as \\"mostly Anglican evangelicals\\" with \\"no institutional focus and little sense of commonality.\\" They generally lacked any background in geology, and had little influence even in church circles. From 1830 to 1833, the geologist and clergyman Sir Charles Lyell released a three volume publication called Principles of Geology, which developed Hutton's ideas of uniformitarianism, and in the second volume set out a gradualist variation of creation beliefs in which each species had its \\"centre of creation\\" and was designed for the habitat, but would become extinct when the habitat changed. John Herschel supported this gradualist view and wrote to Lyell urging a search for natural laws underlying the \\"mystery of mysteries\\" of how species formed.Herschel, J.F.W and Paul l Kesaris (1990), \\"Letters and papers of Sir John Herschel: a guide to the manuscripts and microfilm\\" (University Publications of America) In 1857, Philip Henry Gosse published Omphalos: Untying the Geological Knot. The Omphalos hypothesis argued that the World had been created by God recently, but with the appearance of old age. This was largely ignored, and some considered it blasphemous because it accused the Creator of deceit. Some young Earth creationists would later incorporate parts of his arguments.Gosse, P.H. (1857) Omphalos: Untying the Geological Knot Pre-Darwinian biology Erasmus Darwin published his Zo√∂nomia between 1794 and 1796 foreshadowing Lamarck's ideas on evolution, and even suggesting \\"that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which the great First Cause endued with animality ... possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down these improvements by generation to its posterity.\\" Advances in paleontology, led by William Smith, saw the recording of the first fossil records that showed the transmutation of species. Then, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809, a theory of evolution, later known as Lamarckism, by which traits that were \\"needed\\" were passed on. William Paley (1743‚Äì1805) proponent of the Watchmaker analogy, a variant of the teleological argument In 1802, William Paley published Natural TheologyPaley, Wm (1802) Natural Theology in response to naturalists such as Hume, refining the ancient teleological argument (or argument from design) to argue for the existence of God. He argued that life was so intricately designed and interconnected as to be analogous to a watch. Just as when one finds a watch, one reasonably infers that it was designed and constructed by an intelligent being, although one has never seen the designer, when one observes the complexity and intricacy of life, one may reasonably infer that it was designed and constructed by God, although one has never seen God. The official eight Bridgewater Treatises \\"On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation\\" included the Reverend William Buckland's 1836 Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology setting out the logic of day-age, gap theory, and theistic evolution. The computing pioneer Charles Babbage then published his unofficial Ninth Bridgewater Treatise in 1837, putting forward a thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) that then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ad hoc miracles each time a new species was required. By 1836 the anatomist Richard Owen had theories influenced by Johannes Peter M√ºller that living matter had an \\"organising energy,\\" a life- force that directed the growth of tissues and also determined the lifespan of the individual and of the species. In the 1850s Owen developed ideas of \\"archetypes\\" in the divine mind producing a sequence of species in \\"ordained continuous becoming\\" in which new species appeared at birth. Late in 1844 the anonymous publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation popularised the idea of divinely ordered development of everything from stellar evolution to transmutation of species. It quickly gained fashionable success in court circles and aroused interest in all sections of society. It also aroused religious controversy, and after initially being slow to respond, the scientific establishment attacked the book. It continued to be a best seller to around the end of the century. Herbert Spencer was a 19th-century English philosopher who developed ideas about the unifying concept of evolution across the natural and social sciences. Spencer is the first to develop a theory of cultural evolution and is considered by some to be the father of Social Darwinism. It is also he and not Darwin who coined the phrase survival of the fittest. Much of the positivist ideas of progress that dominated the social science philosophy of Spencer and subsequent Social Darwinists has been criticized by present-day sociologists, but such ideas continue to be one of the major critiques made by creationists against evolution in general, even though strict biological evolution does not depend on it nor offer any type of endorsement of so-called \\"Social Darwinism\\" or its derivative philosophies such as eugenics. Age of Darwin When Darwin appeared in public with a beard in 1866, cartoonists were quick to satirise his ideas about common descent with apes. In this 1872 cartoon Darwin is fascinated by the apparent steatopygia in the new fashion for bustles. The woman asks him to \\"leave my emotions alone,\\" a reference to Darwin's new book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. The decades following Charles Darwin's publication of The Origin of Species, in 1859, saw the overwhelming majority of North American and British naturalists accept some form of evolution, with many liberal and educated churchmen following their example, and thereby rejecting a biblically literalist interpretation of Genesis.Numbers(2006) p. 15 Although Darwin's work rejected \\"the dogma of separate creations,\\" he invoked creation as the probable source of the first lifeforms (\\"into which life was first breathed\\"). This led Asa Gray, who was both religiously orthodox, and Darwin's most prominent American supporter, to suggest that Darwin had accepted \\"a supernatural beginning of life on earth\\" and that he should therefore allow a second \\"special origination\\" for humanity. Darwin however rejected this view, and used uncompromisingly naturalistic language in place of biblical idiom, starting with The Descent of Man in 1871.Numbers(2006) pp. 16‚Äì17 Darwin's book caused less controversy than he had feared, as the idea of evolution had been widely popularized in Victorian Britain by the 1844 publication of Vestiges of Creation.Charles Darwin: gentleman naturalist: A biographical sketch, John van Wyhe, 2006. However, it posed fundamental questions about the relationship between religion and science. Though Origin did not explicitly deal with human evolution, the jump was one both supporters and opponents of the theory immediately made, and the idea that man was simply an animal (common descent) who had evolved a particular set of characteristics ‚Äî rather than a spiritual being created by God ‚Äî continued to be one of the most divisive notions of the 19th century. One of the most famous disputes was the Oxford Debate of 1860, in which T.H. Huxley, Darwin's self-appointed \\"bulldog,\\" debated evolution with Samuel Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford. Both sides claimed victory, then the controversy was overshadowed by the even greater theological furore over the publication of Essays and Reviews questioning whether miracles were atheistic, bringing to a head arguments in the Church of England between liberal theologians supporting higher criticism, and conservative Evangelicals.Introduction to Essays and Reviews (1860), Glenn Everett, Associate Professor of English, University of Tennessee at Martin, VictorianWeb.org. The essays were described by their opponents as heretical, and the essayists were called \\"The Seven Against Christ.\\" In 1862, the Glaswegian physicist William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) published calculations, based on his presumption of uniformitarianism, and that the heat of the sun was caused by its gravitational shrinkage, that fixed the age of the Earth and the solar system at between 20 million and 400 million years, i.e. between ~3,000 and ~70,000 times Ussher's value. This came as a blow to Darwin's anticipated timescale, though the idea of an ancient Earth was generally accepted without much controversy. Darwin and Huxley, while not accepting the timing, said it merely implied faster evolution. It would take further advances in geology and the discovery of radioactivity that showed that the sun was in fact heated by nuclear fusion that demonstrated the present estimated 4.567 billion years, or ~700,000 times Ussher's value. A way to measure the age of the universe would be discovered by Edwin Hubble in the 1930s, but due to observational constraints, an accurate measurement of the Hubble constant would not be forthcoming until the late 1990s. According to the ESA/Planck data, released in March 2013, the age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years or some ~2,000,000 times Ussher's value. The Swiss-American paleontologist Louis Agassiz opposed evolution. He believed that there had been a series of catastrophes with divine re-creations, evidence of which could be seen in rock fossils. Though uniformitarianism dominated ideas from the 1840s onwards, Catastrophism remained a major paradigm in geology until replaced by new models that allowed for both cataclysms (such as meteor strikes) and gradualist patterns (such as ice ages) to explain observed geologic phenomena. In 1878, American Presbyterians held the first annual Niagara Bible Conference, founding the Christian fundamentalist movement, which took its name from the \\"Five Fundamentals\\" of 1910, and came to be concerned about the implications of evolution for the accuracy of the Bible. But by no means all orthodox Presbyterians were opposed to evolution as a possible method of the Divine procedure. Dr Charles Hodge of Princeton Seminary objected in 1874 to the atheism he considered inplied in the naturalistic explanation but both he and Dr B. B. WarfieldBenjamin Breckinridge Warfield Evolution, Science & Scripture (Baker 2000) ed. Mark Noll & David N. Livingstone were open to its possibility/probability within limits, and most churchmen sought to reconcile Darwinism with Christianity. Darwin died in 1882. In 1915, Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope, spread rumors that he had repented and accepted God on his deathbed. Lady Hope's story is almost certainly false, and it is unlikely that she visited Darwin as she claimed.\\"Charles Darwin's Death-Bed: Story of Conversion Denied,\\" Mrs R B Litchfield, The Christian, February 23, 1922, p. 12 Early 20th century In the 1920s, the term creationism became particularly associated with a Christian fundamentalist movement opposed to the idea of human evolution, which succeeded in getting teaching of evolution banned in United States public schools. From the mid-1960s young Earth creationism proposed \\"scientific creationism\\" using \\"Flood geology\\" as support for a literal reading of Genesis. After legal judgements that teaching this in public schools contravened constitutional separation of Church and State, it was stripped of biblical references and called creation science, then when this was ruled unacceptable, intelligent design was coined. The decades before the start of the 20th century, and the first decades of that century, have been described as the eclipse of Darwinism. Darwin's work had quickly established scientific consensus that evolution occurred, but there was considerable disagreement about the mechanisms involved, and few gave as much significance to natural selection as Darwin himself. Evolution itself was assumed, but the mechanism of how it happened was in considerable debate, and none had anything near to a consensus. Among these theories were neo-Lamarckism (which merged certain aspects of Lamarck's theory of acquired characteristics with certain aspects of Darwinian evolution), orthogenesis (\\"straight-line\\" evolution, which talked about evolution towards a specific goal by forces within the organism), and the discontinuous variation of Mendelism and Hugo De Vries' mutation theory. Some of these alternative theories, in particular neo- Lamarckism and orthogenesis, allowed more easily for an interpretation of the intervention of God, which appealed to many scientists at the time. The term Darwinism had covered a wide range of ideas, many of which differed from Darwin's views, but it became associated with the minority view of August Weismann who went further than Darwin by rejecting inheritance of acquired characters and attributing all evolution to natural selection, a view also called neo-Darwinism. By the first decades of the 20th century, the debate had become generally one between continuous-variation biometricians and discontinuous-variety Mendelians. In the 1930s and 1940s, though, they were combined with natural selection into the modern evolutionary synthesis, which soon became the dominant model in the scientific community. This model has also been called Darwinism and neo-Darwinism. George McCready Price was important in developing flood geology, and while he had limited influence at a time when all geologists had long accepted an ancient earth, many of his ideas that a young earth could be deduced from science were taken up later. Price was a Seventh-day Adventist, and followed one of the founders of the church, Ellen White, in seeing fossils as evidence of the Great Flood. In 1906, Price published Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory in which he offered $1000 \\"to any one who will, in the face of the facts here presented, show me how to prove that one kind of fossil is older than another.\\" United States In 1910, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church distilled the principles of Christian fundamentalism into what were known as the \\"five fundamentals,\\" one of which was the inerrancy of the Scriptures, including the Genesis account of creation. The Fundamentals were published as a series of essays. Its authors accepted ancient earth geology, while holding different ideas about how this was reconciled with biblical accounts. The views expressed on evolution were mixed: two short articles were anti evolution, one anonymous and one by the little-known Henry Beach. Their focus was on human evolution, as were attacks made on evolution by Dyson Hague. Major figures were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through a Lamarckian form of evolution: long articles by James Orr and George Frederick Wright expressed this openness, and Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield and A H Strong shared this view. After the First World War (1914‚Äì1918), the teaching of creation and evolution in public education grew as a public controversy. By this time, many texts taught the theory of evolution as scientific fact. Many Christians in the US and later Jews and Muslims, expressed concern that in teaching evolution as fact, the State was unconstitutionally infringing on their right to the free exercise of religion, as in their opinion this taught their children that the Bible had been proven false. For example, the Democratic Party politician William Jennings Bryan \\"became convinced that the teaching of Evolution as a fact caused the students to lose faith in the Bible, first, in the story of creation, and later in other doctrines, which underlie the Christian religion.\\"William Jennings Bryan, W. C. Williams, Putnam, New York, 1936, p. 448Creationism in 20th- Century America, Ronald L. Numbers, Science 218 (5 November 1982): 538‚Äì544 During the First World War, reports of horrors committed by Germans, who were citizens of one of the most scientifically advanced countries in the World, led Bryan to state \\"The same science that manufactured poisonous gases to suffocate soldiers is preaching that man has a brute ancestry and eliminating the miraculous and the supernatural from the Bible.\\" A popular book published in 1917 by Stanford University professor and entomologist Vernon L. Kellogg entitled Headquarters Nights,First published in Atlantic Monthly in 1917 drew a direct association between German war ideology and Darwinian description of nature as a struggle. Kellogg was a leading authority on evolution of insects, and had published Darwinism Today in 1907. His anti-Darwinian and anti-German rhetoric in Headquarters Nights influenced biologists who tried to play down the negative implications of \\"survival of the fittest.\\"Evolution as Gospel: William Patten, the Language of Democracy, and the Great War, Gregg Mitman, Isis, Vol. 81, No. 3 (Sep. 1990), pp. 446‚Äì463 Benjamin Kidd's 1918 book Science of Power, claimed that there were historical and philosophical connections between Darwinism and German militarism.Defender of The Faith William Jennings Bryan, L. W. Levine, (Oxford Univ. Press. New York, 1965) pp. 261‚Äì265 This book and others around this time had an effect on many people. In 1922, William Jennings Bryan published In His Image, in which he argued that Darwinism was both irrational and immoral. On the former point, he pointed to examples such as the eye, which he argued could not be explained by Darwinian evolution. On the latter point, he argued that Darwinism advocated the policy of \\"scientific breeding\\" or eugenics, by which the strong were to weed out the weak, a policy that directly contradicts the Christian doctrine of charity to the helpless. In 1923, fundamentalist preacher and evangelist William Bell Riley, known as \\"The Grand Old Man of Fundamentalism,\\" founded the Anti- Evolution League of Minnesota, which, in 1924, became the Anti-Evolution League of America. The organization was behind anti-evolution legislation in Kentucky, where its efforts were supported by William Jennings Bryan.Powell, William. North Carolina Through Four Centuries. University of North Carolina Press, 1988. In 1924, Clarence Darrow defended Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb on the charge of kidnapping and killing Bobby Franks; his defense included an argument that \\"this terrible crime was inherent in his organism, and it came from some ancestor.\\" In the 1920s and 1930s, Harry Rimmer was one of the most prominent American creationists. Known as the \\"noisiest evangelist in America,\\" he published many creationist tracts, debated other creationists and was involved in a famous trial known as the \\"Floyd-Rimmer trial\\" against the atheist William Floyd.The Bible Defeats Atheism ‚Äì A Story of the Famous Harry Rimmer Trial as told by Attorney for Defendant James E. Bennet, James E. Bennet, Zondervan; Frederick Naef, Printers, 1941. In 1925, G. K. Chesterton published The Everlasting Man, in which he developed and articulated many creationist ideas and criticisms of the philosophical underpinnings and perceived logical flaws of evolution. H. L. Mencken, whose nationally published coverage of the Scopes Trial referred to the town's creationist inhabitants as \\"yokels\\" and \\"morons,\\" referred to assisting counsel for the prosecution as a \\"buffoon\\" and his speeches as \\"theologic bilge,\\" while referring to the defense as \\"eloquent\\" and \\"magnificent.\\" The Scopes Trial of 1925 is perhaps the most famous court case of its kind. The Butler Act had prohibited the teaching of evolution in public schools in Tennessee. Clarence Darrow was the defense counsel, and William Jennings Bryan was the prosecutor. Bryan appealed for assistance to George McCready Price, Johns Hopkins University physician Howard A. Kelly, physicist Louis T. More, and Alfred W. McCann, all of whom had written books supporting creationism. Price was away in England, Kelly and More told Bryan they considered themselves more convinced by evolution, and McCann was not interested because of Bryan's stance on prohibition. Nevertheless, a schoolteacher named John T. Scopes was found guilty of teaching evolution and fined, although the case was later dismissed on a technicality. Following up on the Butler Act, antievolutionary laws were passed in Mississippi in 1926, and then in Arkansas in 1928. However, the 1928 election and the onset of the Depression changed the playing field. Creationists shifted their attention from state legislatures to local school boards, having substantial success. They set themselves to the tasks of \\"the emasculation of textbooks, the 'purging' of libraries, and above all the, continued hounding of teachers.\\" Discussions of evolution vanished from almost all schoolbooks. By 1941, about one third of American teachers were afraid of being accused of supporting evolution.W. B. Gatewood, 3r., Ed., Controversy in the Twenties (Vanderbilt Univ. Press, Nashville 1969), p. 39; J. V. Grabiner and P. D. Miller Science 185, 832 (1974). In 1929, a book by one of George McCready Price's former students, Harold W. Clark described Price's catastrophism as \\"creationism\\" in Back to Creationism.Clark, Harold W. (1929) Back to Creationism (Angwin, Calif.: Pacific Union Press, 1929), p. 135 Previously anti-evolutionists had described themselves as being \\"Christian fundamentalists\\" \\"Anti-evolution\\" or \\"Anti-false science.\\" The term creationism had previously referred to the creation of souls for each new person, as opposed to traducianism, where souls were said to have been inherited from one's parents. In 1933, a group of atheists seeking to develop a \\"new religion\\" to replace previous, deity-based religions, composed the Humanist Manifesto, which outlined a fifteen-point belief system, the first two points of which provided that \\"Religious humanists regard the universe as self-existing and not created\\" and \\"Humanism believes that man is a part of nature and that he has emerged as a result of a continuous process.\\" This document exacerbated the ideological tone of the discussion in many circles, as many creationists came to see evolution as a doctrine of the \\"religion\\" of atheism. In 1935, the \\"Religion and Science Association\\" was formed by a small group of creationists, led by a Wheaton College professor, to form \\"a unified front against the theory of evolution.\\"Christian Faith and Life 42 (1936) There were three main schools of creationist thought, represented by Price, Rimmer, and tidal expert William Bell Dawson. However, since Dawson was a proponent of day-age creationism and Rimmer was ardently convinced that gap creationism was correct, the staunch supporters of a literal 6 day creation and 6000-year-old earth were incensed, and the organization fell apart.H. W. Clark to G. M. Price, 12 September 1937 (Price Papers) Price and his supporters retreated to California, and with several doctors working at the College of Medical Evangelists (now Loma Linda University), formed the \\"Deluge Geology Society.\\" The \\"Deluge Geology Society\\" published the Bulletin of Deluge Geology and Related Science from 1941 to 1945. They made secret plans to unveil discoveries of fossils of human footprints that were in rock that was purportedly older than accounted for in evolutionary theory.Newsletters, Creation‚ÄìDeluge Society, 19 August 1944 and 17 February 1945. However, again the organization foundered over disagreements about a 6000 year old earth.B. F. Allen to Board of Directors of the Creation‚ÄìDeluge Society, 12 August 1945 (courtesy of Molleurus Couperus). Price was particularly strident in his attacks against fellow creationists. His friend and former student Harold W. Clark had earned a masters degree in biology from the University of California, Berkeley, and felt that Price's book New Geology was \\"entirely out of date and inadequate.\\" Unfortunately, Price responded angrily when he found out, accusing Clark of suffering from \\"the modern mental disease of universityitis\\" and of falling in with the \\"tobacco-smoking, Sabbath-breaking. God-defying\\" evolutionists. Clark pleaded with Price that he still believed in a 6 day creation and a young earth and a universal flood, but Price responded with a vitriolic publication entitled Theories of Satanic Origin about Clark and his views.R. L. Numbers, Spectrum 9, 22 (January 1979) The American George Gaylord Simpson argued that the paleontological record supported evolution in the 1940s. Some creationists, however, objected to his supposed equation of microevolution and macroevolution, acknowledging the former but denying the latter, and continue to do so to this day. Post-war United States The Second World War (1939‚Äì1945) saw the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust. American creationist explanation for the Holocaust is that it had been driven in part by eugenics, or the principle that individuals with \\"undesirable\\" genetic characteristics should be removed from the gene pool. Eugenics was based in part on principles of cultural evolutionary theory, though many biologists had long opposed it. Although eugenics was rejected by other nations after the war, the memory of it did not quickly fade, and professional scientists sought to distance themselves from it and other racial ideologies associated with the Nazis. Fissures within the creationist community, which had always been present, continued to deepen as fundamentalists received advanced training in the sciences. Geochemist J. Laurence Kulp had gone to the evangelical school Wheaton College for his undergraduate degree and was a Plymouth Brother. He obtained a PhD from Princeton before taking a faculty position at Columbia. He felt it was his duty to warn fellow Christians in the evangelical scientific organization the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) of the problems with Price's claims. Kulp wrote a review of Price's work, in which he stated that \\"major propositions of the theory are contradicted by established physical and chemical laws\\" in 1950. This caused substantial consternation among his fellow members of the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA), an affiliation of Christians who are also scientists, causing many to claim that Kulp had been contaminated with \\"the orthodox geological viewpoint\\" and this was responsible for his faith in the Bible being badly shaken.J. L. Kulp, J. Am. Sci.20 (June 1949); J. L. Kulp J. Am. Sci. 2, 1 (No. 1) (1950); J. L. Kulp, J. Am. Sci. 2, 2 (June 1950); Page 304 of \\"The Creationists\\" by R.L. Numbers, 2006 Kulp's influence, however, continues today within the American Scientific Affiliation, which continues to support old earth creationism. In the 1950s the United States slid into a Cold War with the communist Soviet Union, its former ally. Communism had as one of its principles atheism. Americans divided over the issues of Communism and atheism, but with the Great Purge, Cultural Revolution and 1956 Hungarian Uprising, many became concerned about the implications of Communism and atheism. At the same time, the scientific community was making great strides in developing the theory of evolution, which seemed to make belief in God unreasonable under Occam's razor. The American shock and panic about the 1957 Sputnik launch led to the passage of the National Defense Education Act in 1958 to reform American science curricula. This resulted in the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, also begun in 1958 and with the goal of writing new up-to-date biology textbooks. These new biology textbooks included a discussion of the theory of evolution. Within a few years, half of American schools were using the new BSCS biology textbooks. In addition, the hundredth anniversary of the publication of The Origin of Species was in 1959, and this sparked renewed public interest in evolutionary biology. The creationist fervor of the past seemed like ancient history. A historian at Oklahoma's Northeastern State University, R. Halliburton, even made a prediction in 1964 that \\"a renaissance of the [creationist] movement is most unlikely.\\"R. Halliburton, Jr., Arkansas Hist. Q. 23, 283 (1964) In 1961, Henry M. Morris and John C. Whitcomb, Jr published a book entitled The Genesis Flood, in an effort to provide a scientific basis for young earth creationism and Flood geology. Morris had published several books previously, but none had the impact that The Genesis Flood did. Its publication resulted in ten like-minded creationists forming the Creation Research Society in 1963, and the Institute for Creation Research in 1972. In 1968, the US Supreme Court ruled in Epperson vs. Arkansas that a 1928 act forbidding the teaching of human evolution violated the Establishment Clause of the US constitution. This clause lays out the Separation of church and state in the United States and states that \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or restricting the free exercise thereof.\\" In 1970, creationists in California established the Institute for Creation Research, to \\"meet the need for an organization devoted to research, publication, and teaching in those fields of science particularly relevant to the study of origins.\\" In 1973, a famous anti-young earth creationist essay by the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky was published in the American Biology Teacher entitled Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution. He argued that evolution was not incompatible with a belief in God nor a belief in the accuracy of scriptures. In 1975, in Daniel v. Waters, the U.S. Sixth Circuit of Appeals struck down Tennessee's \\"equal time\\" law that any biology textbook which discussed human origins must give equal emphasis to the Biblical account. In 1978 the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy developed the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, which denies \\"that scientific hypotheses about earth history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation and the flood.\\" In 1980, Walt Brown became director of the Center for Scientific Creation. In 1981, the San Diego based fundamentalist group the Creation Science Research Center claimed, in a trial dubbed the \\"Monkey Trial Replay,\\" that teaching evolution as the sole theory of development violated the rights of children who believed in biblical creation. In his opening statement for the group lawyer Richard Turner argued: > It is not a showdown at high noon between creation and evolution. It is not > religion versus science. We are not trying to sneak the Bible into the > classroom, or any other religious doctrine. The real issue here is that of > religious freedom under the United States Constitution. Turner went on to explain that the plaintiffs were seeking protection for the belief that \\"God created man as man, not as a blob.\\" The Times of 7 March 1981 reported that some were of the opinion that the case was \\"a signal of things to come, with more and more fundamentalist groups trying to flex their not inconsiderable influence in schools across the country.\\" At the same time Frank D. White, the Governor of Arkansas signed a Bill requiring that creation science and the theory of evolution be given equal weight in schools. Although fifteen states attempted to introduce such Bills around this time, only that in Arkansas made it into law. Following hearings in Little Rock the law was overturned by Judge William Overton early in 1982, just as a similar (and equally unsuccessful) Bills were approved by legislators in Mississippi and Louisiana. Carl Baugh established the Creation Evidence Museum in Glen Rose, Texas in 1984. Kent Hovind's Young Earth Creationist ministry was founded in 1989. In 1986, another creationist organization called \\"Reasons to Believe\\" was established. Unlike most current creationist organizations, RTB supports Old Earth creationism. In 1987, the US Supreme Court again ruled, this time in Edwards v. Aguillard, that requiring the teaching of \\"creation science\\" every time evolution was taught illegally advanced a particular religion, although a variety of views on origins could be taught in public schools if shown to have a basis in science. The court gave a clear definition of science, and further ruled that so-called \\"creation science\\" was simply creationism wrongly using a contrived dualism to assert that any evidence against evolution would prove Creation. Later that year, drafts of the creation science school textbook Of Pandas and People were revised to change all references to \\"creation\\" to relate to \\"intelligent design.\\"Barbara Forrest's testimony at Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District. Retrieved 2007-05-27. In 1989, the Foundation for Thought and Ethics published Of Pandas and People by Percival Davis and Dean H. Kenyon, editor Charles Thaxton, with the definition that \\"Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact. Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, wings, etc.\\" The publisher got church groups and Christian radio to campaign for state textbook approval, with a petition in Alabama urging that \\"Intelligent Design\\" be presented as an alternative to evolution, and their attorney arguing that it did not compel belief in the supernatural and was not a creationist text.Brande, Scott (January‚ÄìFebruary 1990): Science Text Adoptions in Alabama Part II NCSE Resource After setbacks it focussed efforts \\"outside the schools\\" to prompt grass-roots activity from local school boards, teacher's groups and parents.Thomas, The Foundation for Thought and Ethics, Thomas, John A.

In 1994, the court case Peloza v. Capistrano School District was decided against a teacher who claimed that his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion was violated by the school district's requirement to teach evolution. In 1996, the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture (CSC), formerly known as the Center for Renewal of Science and Culture, was founded to promote Intelligent design, and entered public discourse with the publication of Darwin's Black Box by Michael Behe,Behe, M.J. (1996) Darwin's Black Box arguing for evidence of Irreducible complexity. Critics claimed that this was a thinly veiled attempt to promote creationism, particularly in light of Edwards v. Aguillard. The Discovery Institute rejects the term creationism, which it defines narrowly as meaning young earth creationism, though in court intelligent design was found to be creationism.s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context In October 1999 the Michael Polanyi Center was founded in the science faculty of Baylor University, a Baptist college, to study intelligent design. A year later was disbanded amidst faculty complaints that the center had been established without consulting them, and would cause the school to be associated with pseudoscience. In December 2001, the United States Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act, which contained the following statement of policy, called the Santorum Amendment, authored by Johnson: :\\"The Conferees recognize that a quality scientific education should prepare students to distinguish the data and testable theories of science from religious or philosophical claims that are made in the name of science. Where topics are taught that may generate controversy (such as biological evolution), the curriculum should help students to understand the full range of scientific views that exist, why such topics may generate controversy, and how scientific discoveries can profoundly affect society.\\" In December 2001, Dembski established the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design. Answers In Creation was established in 2003 to provide answers to young earth creation organizations. They claim that the young earth position is unscientific, and through their website they claim to provide proof against young earth creation science. They are anti-young earth, and promote Christianity by endorsing old earth creationism. In 2004 Ohio adopted education standards sympathetic to intelligent design promoted by the Discovery Institute. In February 2006 the Ohio Board of Education voted to drop the Discovery Institute's \\"Critical Analysis of Evolution\\" intelligent design lesson plan after the 2005 ruling against intelligent design in Kitzmiller v. Dover and revelations that the lesson plan was adopted despite warnings from the Ohio Department of Education, whose experts described it as wrong and misleading. In May 2005, the Kansas school board held the Kansas evolution hearings. The court-style hearings were promoted by the Discovery Institute and attended by its Fellows and other intelligent design advocates but not by mainstream scientists, who accused it of being a kangaroo court. The result of the hearings was the adoption by the Republican-dominated board of new science standards that relied upon the Discovery Institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan employing the institute's Teach the Controversy approach, despite these having been rejected by the State Board Science Hearing Committee. With the 2006 ouster of the majority of the conservative board members, the Kansas State Board of Education approved a new curriculum that removed any reference to Intelligent Design as part of science in February 2007. In 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania ruled on the case of Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District that intelligent design was religious in nature, a form of creationism, not scientific and thus violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The ruling barred the teaching of intelligent design in public school science classrooms for that district, but the 'Dover trial' as it came to be known, has had far-reaching effects.s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District et al. Around the same time as the Kiztmiller ruling, many state legislators were considering bills promoted by the Discovery Institute supporting the teaching of intelligent design. Most were rejected in the light of the ruling in Dover trial out of what has been called the \\"Dover-effect.\\" In September 2012, Bill Nye (\\"The Science Guy\\") warned that creationist views threaten science education and innovations in the United States.(Bill Nye video) See also * Abiogenesis * Biogenesis * Cosmology * Evolutionary biology Notes References * Bowler, P.J.

Origins The Pahlavunis (also spelled Pahlavounis) were an offshoot of the Kamsarakan noble house, which had ceased to exist as a result of a failed uprising against the Arab rule in Armenia, in the late 8th century. In 774 the nature of the Arab rule had provoked the Armenian nakharars into a major rebellion which included the Kamsarakans. The defeat of the rebels at the Battle of Bagrevand in April 775 was followed by ruthless suppression of opposition in the years that followed. The power and influence of the Kamsarakans along with other leading nakharar houses such as the Mamikonians and the Gnunis was destroyed for good. Those that survived were either exiles in the Byzantine Empire or dependants of other houses, chiefly the Artsruni and the Bagratuni. They were forced to sell their hereditary principalities to the Bagratunis, such as the regions of Shirak and Arsharunik. The Bagratuni Prince Ashot the Carnivorous bought the former estates of the Kamsarakan family around Arpa River near Mren, 34 km south of Ani which was also a Bagratuni possession. Branches In the 11th century the Pahlavunis controlled and built various fortresses throughout Armenia such as Amberd and Bjni and played a significant role in all the affairs of the country. According to Cyril Toumanoff, following the abdication in 1045-46 of Prince Gregory II (who received from the court of Constantinople the rank of magistros and the office of duke of Mesopotamia, Vaspurakan, and Taron) in favor of the emperor, the Pahlavunis, under Oshin of Gandzak, moved to Cilician Armenia, forming the House of Hethumids.

He won the first two Australian Correspondence Chess Championships, in 1938 and 1945. He also won the New Zealand Chess Championship in 1924/25.

They were formed in 1981, toured South America, North America, Asia and Europe and still continue to play today. Their core lineup of Jo√£o Gordo on vocals and J√£o on drums and later guitars has remained since virtually the band's beginning. Lead singer Jo√£o Benedan (better known as Jo√£o Gordo) is a former well-known VJ on MTV Brasil and later worked at Rede Record in a comedy TV show called: \\"Legend√°rios\\" (Portuguese for \\"Legendaries\\"). He now has a YouTube channel where he hosts a talk show and cooks vegan food, called Panela√ßo. History Early days Ratos de Por√£o, or simply RxDxPx, was formed in November 1981, existing in the Brazilian (S√£o Paulo city) punk rock scene (alongside bands such as Olho Seco, C√≥lera, Inocentes, Garotos Podres, and Lobotomia). Directly influenced by the UK 82 hardcore bands such as Discharge, Charged G.B.H., The Varukers and Swedish and Finnish bands such as Anti-Cimex and Kaaos, they started to write songs that criticized Brazilian society, a revolutionary concept at the time. Their sound is regarded as one of the rawest of their scene (because other bands such as C√≥lera and Garotos Podres were more 'punk rock' sounding than 'hardcore punk'). Their first album was released in 1983 and was titled Crucificados pelo sistema. Released on the Ataque Frontal label, it was one of the best-selling hardcore albums to come out of the country, and was soon considered a punk classic worldwide. The line up was Jo√£o Gordo (vocals), Mingau (guitar - later in many punk and pop bands in Brazil), Jab√° (bass) and J√£o (drums). Soon after, with the fall of the S√£o Paulo punk scene (because of associated gang violence), the band split up and since then Jo√£o Gordo has been accused of selling out and betraying the DIY ethics of the hardcore punk movement for several alleged reasons; he has said, \\"I'm a traitor since 1983, because I told the guys I played hardcore, not punk. Then, I got labelled.(...)That's a stigma\\".Marcos Bragatto.Article. In Portuguese. Initial crossover thrash era In 1985, RxDxPx came back, but with a different line up and sound. They brought thrash metal to their music, influenced by bands such as Slayer, Exodus, Kreator and hardcore bands around the world that were also transitioning to a more thrash metal sound, like Suicidal Tendencies, D.R.I., English Dogs, Cro-Mags, Agnostic Front and others (including Brazilian bands such as Lobotomia and Armagedom). J√£o switched over to playing guitar, and an old punk named Spaghetti (who later adopted a thrash metal sound) replaced him on drums. Subsequently, they released the Descanse Em Paz album on Baratos Afins. With their new sound, they began to associate more with heavy metal bands, becoming friends with longtime RxDxPx fans Sepultura and other bands of the Brazilian 1980s metal scene, including Korzus and Anthares. Their next studio release with Baratos Afins Records, 1987's Cada Dia Mais Sujo e Agressivo, was also released in an English-language version (Dirty and Aggressive) (the band feared that their English was so grammatically inaccurate that many of their native English speaking fans might ridicule their translated lyrics).) This release continued the band's D-beat drum tempos. In 1989, they signed to Roadrunner Records at the urging of Igor Cavalera of Sepultura, who played one of the band's tapes for the label's executives. RxDxPx then went to Germany to record their next studio LP, Brasil. With Harris Johns of Voivod and Tankard producing, the band's production quality improved substantially in contrast to their previous releases; the instrumentation was noticeably more technical. In 1990, they returned to Germany to record their last album with the 'classic' line-up of Jo√£o Gordo, J√£o, Jab√° and Spaghetti. With Harris Johns acting again as producer, their next album titled Anarkophobia was met with criticism by some fans for being the band's most metallic release to date, having considerably more complex and lengthy song compositions and more technical musicianship. Nevertheless, Anarkophobia increased their profile within the worldwide metal scene of the early 1990s. But in mid-1991, they had their first line-up change in years, with Spaghetti leaving the band, citing that he had \\"been tired of the musical life\\". They auditioned several drummers to replace him, including Beto Silesci from Korzus, but the band decided that Silesci's style was too metal for the new direction they were planning to pursue. Silesci was in turn replaced with Boka of the Santos Beach thrash/death metal band Psychic Possessor. In 1992, RxDxPx released its first official live album, called Ao Vivo, with a corresponding music video for the song \\"Aids, Pop, Repress√£o\\" receiving heavy air play on Furia Metal of MTV (the Brazilian equivalent of Headbanger's Ball). At the decline of the thrash scene, under tension and personal problems (Jab√° left the band and they had a heavy drug problem), they entered into the studio in 1994 to record their only 'all lyrics in English' album, called Just Another Crime In Massacreland. The album suffered a thin production and a low promotion by the label, and it was a hard time in the life of RxDxPx. Return to hardcore punk After the departure of Jab√°, the band had several different bass players and recorded a studio album with only punk and hardcore covers called Feijoada Acidente?, a play on the Guns N' Roses album \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\". (Feijoada is a traditional food from Brazil, a stew based on beans and pork.) There were two versions of this album: one covering only Brazilian bands such as Olho Seco, Lobotomia, Garotos Podres, among others; and one covering only non-Brazilian bands such as G.B.H., Black Flag, Anti-Cimex, Minor Threat, among others. At this time, Walter Bart (who used to play in a punk band called \\"N√£o Religi√£o\\") and \\"Pica Pau\\" (Portuguese for woodpecker), who stayed in the band until 1999, played bass. Released in 1997, Carniceria Tropical marked a return to hardcore and Portuguese lyrics, and the band regained their former success. The same year, Jo√£o Gordo started to work as a VJ for MTV Brasil. In 1999, the bassist Cristian \\"Fralda\\", who used to play in the punk rock band \\"Blind Pigs\\" joined the band, and they entered into the studio to re-record their first album, and called this album Sistemados Pelo Crucifa (a play on the original album title, \\"Crucificados Pelo Sistema\\"). The front cover was designed by the Korzus bass player Dick. Return to Crossover In 2002, they released the Onisciente Coletivo album, and came back to be more friendly with thrash metal, mixing the 1980s with 1990s faces. The bassist Cristian \\"Fralda\\" left to join the old hardcore/crossover/thrash band Lobotomia. In his place entered an old underground musician, the bass player Paulo J√∫nior, who still plays with his hardcore band called \\"Discarga\\" and guitarist of \\"Point of no Return\\". In 2006, they released Homem Inimigo Do Homem.

It is the capital of the Department of Caldas, and lies near the Nevado del Ruiz volcano. Currently, the city is the main center for the production of Colombian coffee and an important hub for higher educational institutions. History Manizales was founded on October 12, 1849. The city was founded by a group of twenty Antioquians (The Expedition of the 20), who came from Neira and Salamina. There is a strong Spanish influence in the culture and the population was very homogeneous, mostly white, until other ethnic groups migrated to the city, attracted by the universities. Geography Manizales is the capital city of one of the smallest Colombian departments. The city is described as having an \\"abrupt topography\\", and lies on the Colombian Central Mountain Range (part of the longest continental mountain range, the Andes), with a great deal of ridgelines and steep slopes, which, combined with the seismic instability of the area, has required architectural adaptations and public works to make the city safer. Even though Manizales has this very difficult topography, there are many coffee plantations in its fertile lands. The city is located in the northern part of the Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis (\\"Eje Cafetero\\"), near the volcano Nevado del Ruiz, which has an altitude of 5,321 meters (17,457.3 ft). It is in the basin of the Chinchin√° River and sub- basin of the Guacaica River. Its natural threats are earthquakes, mudslides, and volcanic eruptions. Climate Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, Manizales is Cfb, a subtropical highland climate but ever moist. Lower elevations approach an equatorial climate (Af) as found in the plains. Despite being located in the tropics, the city seldom gets very hot, featuring spring- like temperatures throughout the year owing to its high altitude. There are only two seasons in the city: the wet and dry seasons that alternate throughout the year, with each lasting about three months. Monthly averages are quite uniform. Manizales receives about of precipitation a year, with October being wettest. Economy The Nevado del Ruiz of Los Nevados National Park seen from the city Its core economy has traditionally been the cultivation and production of coffee. This fomented the creation of new types of employment and several factories, some of which remain in the metropolitan area while others have reduced their operations or moved to other cities aggravating the unemployment problem. These companies manufacture products such as liquor, shoes, rubber, chocolate, banks, detergents and soaps, threshing and packaged coffee, software, and metallurgy, among others. In addition, there are institutions and companies involved in the coffee sector as the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Caldas, Almacaf√©, Cenicaf√©, and a number of other industries involved in the process of coffee (threshers, cooperatives, exporters). During the latter half of the twentieth century, many universities were founded in the city to the point that some studies regard Manizales as the second largest University city in the country. The universities are attended by students from various regions of the country such as Tolima, Risaralda, Valle, Quindio, Antioquia, Nari√±o and Huila, among others. The service sector has thrived, mostly in the form of call centers, and this has become one of the city's primary economic activities. Manizales won first place in the special category of business promotion in the V Iberoamerican Digital Cities Award, organized by the Latin American Association of Research Centers and Telecommunication Enterprises (AHCIET). In a 2010 study conducted by the World Bank, Manizales was ranked as the best and easiest Colombian city to do business. Street of Manizales near the major square  Infrastructure   Main roads  The city's mountainous topography causes journeying in an east‚Äìwest direction and vice versa to be flatter and faster than going north‚Äìsouth or south‚Äìnorth; therefore the main parallel thoroughfares are the Santander, Paralela, and Kevin √Ångel, and are arranged longitudinally most of the city's length. The few avenues with a north‚Äìsouth or south‚Äìnorth are the Avenida Centenario and Avenida 12 de Octubre; the former is more important, for it connects downtown with the main transport hub where major access routes merge towards the city. *Avenida Santander was the first main road of the city, formerly called Cervantes, and remains the most important motorway of the city. Its four lanes travel in the east‚Äìwest‚Äìeast direction. This roadway spans the entire Carrera-23 in the downtown area all the way to Calle 71 in the Battalion sector. Surrounding it are some of the most important landmarks of the city such as: Founders Theatre, Plaza 51, The Triangle, Panorama Towers, University of Caldas, Catholic University, Cervantes Building, Park Antonio Nari√±o, Instituto Universitario de Caldas, Herbeo Tower, General Cable Plaza and the Zona Rosa. *Avenida Paralela was the city's second main road. It also has four lanes moving between west and east, and as its name attests, it runs parallel to Avenida Santander. This road spans from downtown to Calle 71 in the Palermo neighborhood. It passes by some iconic places such as San Est√©ban Cemetery, University of Caldas, Palogrande Stadium. *Avenida Alberto Mendoza Hoyos *Avenida Kevin √Ångel *Avenida Panamericana  Manizales Aerial Tramway  Manizales Aerial Tramway was inaugurated on October 30, 2009. It connects downtown Manizales with the regional bus station, with a length of . Each gondola has a seating capacity of ten passengers, the whole system can carry 2,100 persons per hour. Owing to its success, the gondola lift was extended in 2013, and now connects also the suburb of Villamaria. The entire Aerial Tramway was built by the Italian manufacturer Leitner ropeways. Currently it has four stations on its route: Downtown Manizales, La Fuente, Manizales Los Cambulos Bus Terminal, and Villamaria.  Air transportation  Manizales has a domestic airport called La Nubia Airport which has a runway of about 1,400 meters and provides services from 6 am to 6 pm. Due to foggy weather conditions, it is often closed due to low visibility. Meanwhile, the existence of buildings over two stories close to the landing head make it topographically unfeasible to expand the airport, which in turn has become an obstacle to regional development; For these reasons, the International Coffee Airport is being built within the metropolitan area, in the town of Palestina, 25 minutes from Manizales. At an altitude of 1,525 m, the airport will have a runway of 2,800 meters which could be extended to 3,500 meters in order to receive long-range aircraft. It is expected that the new airport will function 24/7. It is currently being studied for its adequacy in terms of ground motion. Arts and culture The most important cultural events held in the city are the Manizales International Theater Festival, which is one of the major theater events in Latin America created in 1968 by initiative of Carlos Ariel Betancur, and the Manizales Jazz Festival, which gathers jazz musicians from all over the world; both are held annually. The Manizales Fair was created in 1951 on the first centenary of the city. It began with bullfights and the typical \\"Manolas\\" parade (Spanish procession). Due to its hospitality, more shows and presentations have been brought into the fair, such as the International Coffee Beauty Pageant which together with the bullfighting season are the main events of the fair. Currently the fair includes activities such as horseback riding parades, artisanal fairs, \\"trova\\" concerts, other parades, sports, national and international musicians and bands, horse and livestock contests, and cultural shows. It is an important celebration in Colombia, as is the Barranquilla Carnival. Coffee International Beauty Pageant Coffee International Beauty Pageant (from ) is an international beauty pageant held annually in Manizales as part of the Feria de Manizales, a feast promoting the region known for its flagship product, coffee. The current winner is Maydeliana Liyimar Diaz, from Venezuela. The international beauty contest originally began in 1957 and was held every two years (1957, 1959, 1961, 1963) under the name of Continental Queen of Coffee. However, to give a wider scope, in 1972 its name was changed to Miss International Queen of Coffee Pageant, thereby increasing the participation of coffee-producing countries from other continents. Manizales is the permanent home since its inception.

Manizales has also had two professional basketball teams Caldas Bancafetero Aces and Wise Caldas which were champions of the Colombian Professional Basketball tournament in 1989 and 2000 respectively, both played in the Coliseo Mayor Jorge Uribe venue. The city also has indoor soccer presence through the futsal cup microf√∫tbol in both male with Real Caldas FS and female with Real Caldas, and the FIFA Futsal League in Club Deportivo Linear which won the 2011-II championship, all these are played in the Coliseo Menor Vargas Ram√≥n Mar√≠n venue. Manizales has also been home to sporting events such as the Fourth National Games in 1936, South American Football U-20 in 1987, the Copa America 2001, the South American U-20 2005 and most importantly World Cup 2011 U-20.

Academic background In 1961, Tobler received his Ph.D. in the Department of Geography at the University of Washington at Seattle. At Washington, he participated in geography's William Garrison-led quantitative revolution of the late 1950s. After graduating in 1961, Tobler became an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan, where he remained until moving to the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1977. Until his retirement he held the positions of Professor of Geography and Professor of Statistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The University of Zurich, Switzerland, awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1988. Research Tobler was one of the principal investigators and a senior scientist in the National Science Foundation-sponsored National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis. He used computers in geographic research since the 1960s, with emphasis on mathematical modeling and graphic interpretations. Well known for his publications, he formulated the \\"first law of geography\\" in 1970 while producing a computer movie, and is the inventor of novel and unusual map projections, among which was the first derivation of the partial differential equations for area cartograms. He also invented a method for smooth two-dimensional mass-preserving areal data redistribution. In 1989, the American Geographical Society awarded Tobler with the Osborn Maitland Miller Medal.\\"The Cullum Geographical Medal\\" . American Geographical Society. Retrieved June 17, 2010. Tobler was involved in building a global, latitude- longitude oriented, demographic information base with resolution two orders of magnitude better than was previously available. He also examined the development of smooth finite element and categorical pycnophylactic geographic information reallocation models. In July 1999 he presented a keynote speech, \\"The World is Shriveling as it Shrinks,\\" at the ESRI International User Conference, and was the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award in GIS by ESRI. Taylor and Francis of London recently published a map projection book, co-authored with Q. Yang of China and the late John P. Snyder. More recent interests related to ideas in computational geography including the analysis of geographical vector fields and the development of migration and of global trade models. Tobler was also concerned with the representing flow (due to its involvement with movement as a mechanism of geographic change). In 2003, Tobler released a freeware, Microsoft Windows-based version of his flow representation software Flow Mapper. In 2005, an ESRI ArcGIS version of the software, inspired by Tobler, was developed by Alan Glennon and Michael Goodchild at UCSB.

He was the first prominent advocate of an independent Australian nation and of Australian republicanism. Background and family Lang was born near Greenock, Renfrewshire (now Inverclyde), Scotland, the eldest son of William Lang and Mary Dunmore. His father was a small landowner and his mother a pious Presbyterian, who dedicated her son to the Church of Scotland ministry from an early age. He grew up in nearby Largs and was educated at the University of Glasgow, where he excelled, winning many prizes and graduating as a Master of Arts in 1820. His brother, George, had found employment in New South Wales and Lang decided to join him. He was ordained by the Presbytery of Irvine on 30 September 1822. Arriving in Sydney Cove on 23 May 1823, he became the first Presbyterian minister in the colony of New South Wales. On the way back from the second of his nine voyages to Britain (1830‚Äì31), he married his 18-year-old cousin, Wilhelmina Mackie, in Cape Town. They were married for 47 years and had ten children, only three of whom survived him. There were no grandchildren. Lang and the claims of the Church of England Lang found the Presbyterian Scots in New South Wales to be a small minority, dominated by an Anglican administration and outnumbered by Irish Roman Catholics. There was no Presbyterian church in the colony and he commenced building one before he had applied to the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Thomas Brisbane, to provide public funds for it. Governor Brisbane refused. Lang had laid the foundation stone for the Scots Church on 1 July 1824 and it was completed with significant debt by William and Andrew Lang and opened on 16 July 1826, with a trust deed that tied it to the Church of Scotland. Lang visited Britain during 1824‚Äì25, where he successfully lobbied the Secretary for the Colonies, Lord Bathurst, to recognise the legal status of the Church of Scotland to the extent that he was allowed a stipend of ¬£300 per annum (current equivalent: ¬£). During this visit, he was made a Doctor of Divinity by Glasgow University and recruited the Revd John McGarvie for ministry at Portland Head. Lang resisted the claim to exclusive state recognition and support by the Church of England involved in the establishment of the Clergy and School Lands Corporation in 1826. It was suspended in 1829 and abolished in 1833. Also in 1826, he claimed the right to perform marriages by virtue of a British act of 1818 relating to the Diocese of Calcutta which protected Church of Scotland ministers there and thus broke the Church of England monopoly, with New South Wales then being part of that diocese. The Church Act of 1836 gave state-aid to the Church of England, the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church on the same basis. The Methodists were added in 1839. Lang's views on the Church of England were evident when he published his opinions in \\"On the Character and Influence of the Present European Population of New Zealand, as Regards the Aborigines\\" in four Letters To the Right Hon. Earl Durham that were published in England. Lord Durham was a supporter of the New Zealand Company. The second letter was a virulent attack on the Church Missionary Society in New Zealand, which opposed the colonial aspirations of the New Zealand Company. The Church Missionary Society in New Zealand was led by Archdeacon Henry Williams. Educational endeavours Lang founded the Caledonian Academy in 1826, but it soon folded. He made a second visit to Britain in 1830‚Äì31 and recruited several teachers, as well as acquiring a library and equipment for a school he was to call the Australian College. It opened at the beginning of 1832 on land adjoining the Scots Church. It had considerable promise which was not realised due to Lang's lack of administrative ability and his failure to achieve more general support because of his own flaws of character and ability, particularly financial mismanagement. By 1840 it had only about 30 students. In 1842 the college became simply a day school for boys meeting elsewhere and was no more by 1852. Lang dreamed of heading an educational institution of standing. He was a supporter of the Presbyterian Theological College and of St Andrew's College within the University of Sydney, although he used his political influence to try and change the legislation and hoped in 1872 to be appointed its first principal. He was not appointed and in anger stated that St Andrew's College was \\"conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity\\". His portrait does, however, continue to hang in the college's Senior Common Room. Lang and journalism Lang returned from his third visit to Britain (1833‚Äì34) with more ministers and teachers, as well as a printing press and tradesmen to operate it. He commenced The Colonist in January 1835, which he used to promote his schemes, and attack those with whom he disagreed. While he was absent in Britain 1839‚Äì41, and until it ceased in 1840, Rev William McIntyre edited the paper and it reported impartially on matters then agitating the Presbyterian Church. Lang commenced a new paper, The Colonial Observer, in October 1841, which ran until 1844. He also conducted The Press for a period in 1851. Lang's theology Lang was certainly a turbulent Scot but was not quite the fiery fundamentalist who hated all other denominations that some have claimed. Examination of his sermon manuscripts indicate they were orthodox by the standard of the Westminster Confession of Faith as adhered to by the Church of Scotland. He was influenced by Rev Dr Thomas Chalmers and held a form of the premillennial view of the future. He related quite positively to other denominations of evangelical Protestants, particularly Congregationalists, Lutherans and Methodists. He admitted Congregationalists and Baptists to the Synod which he operated 1850‚Äì64, and in 1856 ordained two Lutherans, regarding the Lutheran questions and Confession, which he used on the occasion, as the same in substance with those of the British Presbyterians. His ecclesiastical fights were with exclusivist Anglicans, other Presbyterians and the Catholics. Attitude to Roman Catholics The traditional evangelical Protestant belief concerning the predicted Antichrist, or Man of Sin in 2 Thessalonians 2, was that: the Man of Sin was not an individual as such but a movement of error in history under the guise of friendship to Christ. Lang shared this belief and saw the Man of Sin as illustrated in the Papacy. When the immigration of poor Irish Catholics was running at a massive level, he campaigned against Irish migration. His fear was that the colony would be swamped by such persons and that Protestant and British liberties would be lost. In 1841 he published The Question of Questions! or, Is this Colony to be transformed into a Province of Popedom? A Letter to the Protestant Landholders of New South Wales, and in 1847 he followed up with, Popery in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere: and How to Check it Effectually: An Address to Evangelical and Influential Protestants of all Denominations in Great Britain and Ireland. He strongly opposed Caroline Chisholm's campaign to sponsor the immigration of single Irish Catholic women to Australia. But, as Bridges states: \\"Lang considered opposition to harmful errors of Catholicism part of his duty as a minister but he consistently championed the cause of Irish and Catholic civil liberties and deprecated any incitement to Protestant-Catholic or Anglo-Celtic disturbances.\\" He visited Archbishop Polding when the Roman Catholic leader was dying in 1877. Lang and the Presbyterian Church The Presbytery of New South Wales (which then included what is now Victoria and Queensland) was formed on 14 December 1832, despite the intemperate habits of two of the ministers, and the opposition of John McGarvie, who had turned out to be a Scottish Moderate. This Presbytery ordained a minister for Launceston and in turn the Presbytery of Van Diemen's Land was constituted on 6 November 1835 by Lang and two others. The Presbytery in New South Wales had a number of unsuitable ministers. Lang determined on a further visit to Britain in 1836, securing about 20 men from the Church of Scotland and from the Synod of Ulster. Lang had a pre-arranged plan to set up a rival church court to the Presbytery. When he returned in 1837 he found that an Act to regulate the temporal affairs of the Presbytery had been secured from the Government, the terms of which made the Presbytery the only legal representative of the Church of Scotland in the colony. The Presbytery Moderator's certificate was necessary for payment of stipends under the Church Act. Lang thereupon represented the Temporalities Act as 'monstrous and disgraceful in the highest degree' and having the effect of forcing him and his supporters out. This was complete fabrication, but Lang and five of the new recruits joined in constituting a Synod on 11 December 1837. Lang placed men in the same localities as Presbytery ministers to draw off adherents and drive out the drunkards. A full-blown schism operated until union was effected in 1840. The Presbytery expelled Lang for schism on 18 January 1838. Lang used The Colonist to spread contention. As James Forbes put it, 'week after week he poured forth vollies of abuse against the Presbytery, unequalled for satanic bitterness and vulgar scurrility, by the worst of the London Sunday papers.' Lang was on a further trip to Britain and America 1839‚Äì41, and in his absence terms of union were agreed and the union consummated on 5 October 1840 under the name 'Synod of Australia in connection with the Established Church of Scotland.' The Basis did not give the Church of Scotland any legislative or judicial jurisdiction, but the Synod was committed to the same doctrinal basis as the Church of Scotland. Presbyteries were created subject to the Synod. Lang was admitted on his return in March 1841. In 1840 Lang published a substantial volume entitled Religion and Education in America in which he advocated support of churches by voluntary givings rather than the State, and went so far as to advocate no connection between Church and State. This conflicted with the official views of the Church of Scotland as set out in the Confession of Faith, which can be summarised thus: (1) Church and State are distinct and separate institutions, both being accountable to the Lord Jesus Christ who has received all authority in heaven and earth from the Father; (2) the mutually helpful relationship between Church and State does not imply subordination of one to the other in its own sphere; and, in particular, the civil authorities have no jurisdiction or authoritative control in the spiritual affairs of Christ's Church. (3) In maintaining these Scriptural principles, and the ideal of a united Christian Church in a Christian nation, the Church does not regard the involvement of the State in matters concerning religion as ipso facto contrary to liberty of conscience. Rather, she rejects intolerance or persecution as methods of advancing the kingdom of God, and recognises the individual's liberty of conscience and the right of private judgement. Lang's views brought opposition from many including some who had previously supported him. Lang's repute had already declined in Scotland. When he was censured for allowing to preach in Scot's Church a Congregational minister who had been rejected by the Synod, he reacted negatively. On 6 February 1842 he told his congregation that he would go to New Zealand and be supported by voluntary givings. In an extraordinary blast of invective, and alluding to the narrative of Joshua 6:20ff, he said that the Australian church could not prosper until she renounced with indignant scorn the Babylonish garment of an infidel establishment of religion and abandoned the wedge of gold that corrupted all who touched it. At length he consented to remain when the bulk of the 500 adults in his congregation agreed to sever all connection with the Synod and with the State. On 8 October 1842 the Synod deposed Lang for slander ‚Äì calling the Synod a synagogue of Satan particularly displeased the brethren ‚Äì divisive courses and contumacy by an 8‚Äì4 vote. Ultimately, on 9 September 1851, the Presbytery of Irvine in Scotland declared Lang no longer a minister of the Church of Scotland, but did not tell Lang what was afoot nor give him an opportunity to defend himself. Lang tried with minimal success to start a new body. In July 1846 he set off again for Britain returning in March 1850. He and two other ministers set up the Synod of New South Wales (the second of this name) on 3 April 1850, although the minutes term it The Australian Presbyterian Church. During its life of some 14 years, 31 ministers were connected with it at one time or another, including 8 of the 20 brought out by Lang in 1850. It was very loose in approach. Some have regarded it as an attempt to establish a comprehensive evangelical Protestant body, but it appears more an attempt by Lang to maintain a useful power base and maintain his own ego. In 1858, Lang recruited John Reid (the father of future prime minister George Reid) from a Melbourne congregation to serve as his associate. They shared the preaching duties and divided the pastoral duties between them, although Lang remained the church's sole leader. They eventually fell out and Reid moved on to another congregation. By November 1864, there were four ministers (including Lang) connected with the church. Lang was out of the mainstream from 1842, but his political influence was such that he had to be accommodated if union of the three Presbyterian streams was to be achieved. The original Synod of Australia did not wish to recognise Lang, despite having to recall the deposition in 1863 (which was done by a majority of one vote), following Lang securing the reversal of the Presbytery of Irvine's sentence in 1861. Lang's Synod lost its identity by being merged on 15 November 1864 with the majority of the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia, to form a General Synod which then merged with the original Synod of Australia to form the Presbyterian Church of New South Wales on 8 September 1865 with 47 ministers. In 1872 he was chosen Moderator of the Assembly but used his speech to seriously criticise his brethren for not choosing him earlier. There wasn't too much mellowing as he grew older. As a churchman Lang was wilful, egotistical, not respectable (twice jailed for libel). He 'preached more of the Gospel than he practised', someone quipped. From the Presbyterian viewpoint Lang is therefore something of an ambiguous figure. James Forbes, writing in 1846 about the 1837 period, stated: '...it has ever appeared to us one of the most mysterious permissions of Divine Providence, that the founding of an infant church in an infant colony should have fallen into such hands.' Lang and politics In The Colonist Lang agitated for the end of transportation, for the separation of the Moreton Bay Colony (which he proposed to be called Cooksland, but was eventually called Queensland) and the Port Phillip District (which he proposed to be called Phillipsland, but was eventually called Victoria) from New South Wales, and for the establishment of representative government and the reduction in the powers of the British-appointed Governors. In 1843 Lang was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council as one of five representatives of the Electoral district of Port Phillip, holding his seat until 1847. From July 1850 to October 1851 Lang was one of the Council members for City of Sydney, and in 1854 he was elected to the Council for County of Stanley. Lang was MLA for West Sydney from 1859 to 1869. Lang was not suited to parliamentary life, since he was temperamentally opposed to parliamentary procedure. He frequently used parliamentary privilege to pursue personal vendettas against his many enemies in the Presbyterian Church and the press. In 1851, in any case, he was unable to take his seat in Parliament, since he was heavily in debt from his various failed migration schemes and was being pressed by creditors. He was sued for debt, and when he attacked his creditors in the press he was prosecuted for libel, and sentenced to a 100-pound fine and four months imprisonment in Parramatta Gaol. He was imprisoned again in 1855, when his son George, manager of the Ballarat branch of the Bank of New South Wales, was convicted of embezzlement. Lang attacked the judge in print and was sentenced to six months imprisonment for criminal libel. Ten thousand people signed a petition for his release, but he served the full sentence. By 1850 Lang, inspired by the Chartist movement in Britain and by the 1848 revolution in France, had become a radical democrat and a republican. With Henry Parkes and James Wilshire he founded the Australian League, considered by historians to be Australia's first political party, although he soon quarrelled with his fellow-founders. He put forward ideas which were both visionary and radical ‚Äì the federation of the Australian colonies, the establishment of a fully democratic government (at a time when both in Britain and Australia the franchise was restricted to owners of property) and an Australian republic. These ideas reflected both the Presbyterian ideal of congregational self-government (despite the fact that in church affairs he was an autocrat) and his Scottish nationalist dislike of English and Anglican supremacy. In 1850 Lang published The Coming Event! Or, the United Provinces of Australia in which he predicted an independent Australian federal republic. He followed this in 1852 with Freedom and Independence for the Golden Lands of Australia, his best-known work. The title of this work has become an established slogan of political radicalism and republicanism in Australia. Despite his bitter anti-Catholicism, his political ideas won him wide support among the Irish Catholic population, who shared his dislike of English and Anglican dominance. In return, he supported Home Rule for Ireland ‚Äì partly because he thought this would reduce the Irish Catholic influence in British government. Lang was also an enthusiastic promoter of the development of the Australian colonies. In 1834 he published in Britain the first edition of An Historical and Statistical Account of New South Wales, both as a Penal Colony and as a British Colony, which ran through a series of editions until his death, to promote immigration and investment in Australia. The Westminster Review commented that the book should have been called A History of Dr. Lang to which is added a History of New South Wales'. He also published Port- Phillip, or the colony of Victoria in 1853, and Queensland, Australia in 1861 to promote the northern colony. In 1849, three immigrant ships (Fortitude, Chaseley, Lima) sponsored by Lang arrived in Moreton Bay with approximately 600 immigrants all personally selected by Lang. Lang Park in Brisbane is named after him in recognition of his work promoting the colony. Despite their eccentricity, Lang's works were influential in promoting Australia, but his practical schemes for immigration were usually fiascos owing to his lack of business sense. After 1851, in any case, immigration to Australia boomed due to the Gold Rush and had no need of promotion. Lang's influence should not be underestimated but was marred by his wilful personality. As well, the wave of radicalism in Britain and Australia of the mid-19th century soon passed and was succeeded by an era of enthusiasm for the British Empire. But he has become an iconic figure in Australian history, as the first public figure to advocate Australian nationalism, federation, full political democracy and republicanism. Lang is the namesake of Dunmore Lang College, at Macquarie University in Sydney. Lang's writings are voluminous, his activities multifarious. His power of description is remarkable, his assessments of individuals generally perceptive if tinged with his own prejudices. His egotism defies belief but his achievements are quite astonishing and overshadow his religious contribution. Excluding his newspaper articles his published work runs to some 10,000 pages. Lang died on 8 August 1878 in Sydney following a stroke. His funeral, on 10 August, was \\"one of the largest that has taken place in the Australian colonies\\" ‚Äì a funeral procession over a mile in length, led by 500 Chinese, with perhaps 70,000 people lining the streets. His wife died in 1888, and the last of his children in 1934. There were no grandchildren.

The park includes Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium, the Rose Garden, Rhododendron Garden, beaches, trails, a boardwalk, a boathouse, a Washington State Ferries ferry dock for the Point Defiance-Tahlequah route to Vashon Island, Fort Nisqually, an off-leash dog park, and most notably a stand of old-growth forest. It receives more than three million visitors every year. Point Defiance Park is maintained and operated by the Metropolitan Park District of Tacoma. Wildlife Point Defiance Park offers something for all its visitors, both wildlife and people. Not all the wild animals are confined inside Zoo & Aquarium. From high cliffs overlooking the Tacoma Narrows people can watch bald eagles feed on salmon runs passing through on the strong tidal currents. Their calls can be heard from their nests in the old growth forest that is preserved and make up the northern of the park. In winter, sea lions migrating from California feed in the swirling tides beneath the Gig Harbor overlook on the northernmost point of the peninsula. Harbor seals are common near the tip of the point most of the year. Seal pups are frequently observed north of Owen Beach in late summer and early fall (humans and their dogs should keep their distance to avoid spooking the pups.) The park also provides habitat for mule deer, red foxes, pileated woodpeckers, Douglas squirrels, and raccoons. Endangered species: One of the features of the park is to sit in quiet contemplation in one of the Japanese Gardens. At sunset, wolves howl as the sun sinks into the tall trees with the Olympic Mountains silhouetted on the horizon. The wolves are temporary guests as part of a restoration project for endangered species that the Zoo & Aquarium and Northwest Trek Wildlife Park sponsor. Recreation As the largest urban park in Pierce County, the network of roads and trails weaving through the forest preserve provides a quiet retreat for joggers, cyclists, hikers. Trails are marked with symbols. Portions of The Five Mile Drive are closed to cars on Saturday. There are many hiking trails along Pt. Defiance's cliffs, that have sweeping views of Vashon Island, Dalco Passage, Gig Harbor, and the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. The road network also passes by Fort Nisqually. Owen Beach in Point Defiance Park From Owen Beach, kayakers launch and ride the strong currents north into the tidal rips. Fishermen drift in these tides waiting for salmon bound to south sound rivers. The cliffs provide a buffer. Gliding out into the narrows, kayakers find a quiet oasis in the middle of an urban environment. There are also many beach goers, willing to venture further up the peninsula. View of Dune Peninsula with Point Ruston and Mount Rainier in the distance. History View from Point Defiance Park circa 1916 Point Defiance Park began as a military reservation after the Wilkes Expedition visited Puget Sound in the 1840s to map the bays and estuaries. Wilkes is thought to have noted that with a fort positioned at the point, and at Gig Harbor across the narrows, one could \\"Defy\\" the world. The high cliffs and prominent location were never used for military operations. In 1888, President Grover Cleveland authorized its use as a public park. By 1890, streetcars brought visitors to wander among the gardens. In 1903, a waterfront pavilion was completed. By 1907 a seaside resort designed by Frederick Heath offered heated saltwater bathing in a pavilion called the Nereides Baths located on a bluff above the boathouse. Fort Nisqually is a replica of Hudson's Bay Company's presence in the region in the 19th century when the English trading company had trading forts stretching from Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River, Fort Nisqually on south Puget Sound near the Nisqually River and continuing to the Far North to Fort Yukon on the Yukon River in Canadian territory which later became the state of Alaska. In recent years, Fort Nisqually programs invite traders, trappers and Indian tribes to dress in period costume and return to the fort replica for a weekend of re-enacting this early period of trade and travel through the region by dugout cedar canoe.http://www.burkemuseum.org/ethnology/faq_nwcanoes In 2019, the city's second-division soccer team renamed itself to Tacoma Defiance in reference to the park. The park opened Frank Herbert Trail and Dune Peninsula in July 2019 to honor science fiction writer Frank Herbert, known for his Dune novels, who was born in Tacoma.  Features  Formal Gardens Japanese Garden at Point Defiance Park Rose Garden at Point Defiance The gardens remain today. Visitors find a Japanese Garden, Rose Garden, and Dahlia gardens surrounding the former superintendent's home. The home was built in 1898 in the year of the Yukon Gold Rush. The gardens are located near the park's main entrance on the approach to the Zoo & Aquarium. It is sited on a bluff looking down on a waterfront containing the boathouse, Anthony's Restaurant and Washington State Ferry landing providing access to Vashon Island. Other public gardens on site include the Native Plant, Herb, Fuchsia, and Iris gardens. The prominent feature of the Japanese Garden is the Pagoda, built in 1914 as a streetcar station. When buses replaced street cars throughout the West, the Pagoda became a waiting area for buses in 1938. In 1963 it was transformed into a center for flower shows and social gatherings. The Pagoda and Lodge were refurbished in 1988. In 2011 the Pagoda was heavily damaged in an arson fire but beautifully restored. The Pagoda and Lodge are rented throughout the year for weddings and receptions. Brownfields and boating facilities After a century of depositing slag into the waters of Puget Sound, Asarco's Tacoma Smelter created a peninsula to form the park's protected harbor. The Tacoma Yacht Club sits on the peninsula's promontory as a guardian of snug harbor. A public boat launch at the entrance of the harbor is part of the park's recreational facilities. Zoo & Aquarium Science and Math Institute In the fall of 2009, Tacoma Public Schools opened the Science and Math Institute (SAMI), a science- and math-centered magnet high school within Point Defiance Park. SAMI features classes on the beach, pagoda, forests, and Zoo. Metro Parks was approached by the school district and gave them space for portable classrooms. The school has a concept and schedule similar to the district's other magnet high school, Tacoma School of the Arts (TSOTA). Landscapes and activities In addition to old-growth forest with 450-year-old Douglas fir (Mountaineers Tree) are 250-foot vertical bluffs exposing rich geology. Groups and individuals regularly gather at the park for picnics, weddings, organized runs, and other special events. Saturday and Sunday mornings Five Mile Drive outer loop closed to cars, giving pedestrians and cyclists free rein in park's most popular destination. It has an off-leash dog exercise area; fee-based attractions include Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium. Great American Place designation The American Planning Association designated Point Defiance Park as a 2011 Great American Place. Community involvement Tacomans appealed to President Grover Cleveland in 1888 to repurpose Point Defiance from a military reserve to a park; in 1905 President Theodore Roosevelt signed legislation giving city full title to park. The park's first superintendent, Ebenezer Roberts, asked schoolchildren in 1895 to donate rose clippings to start a rose garden; today gardens have expanded to include native plants, herbs, iris, dahlia, and fuchsia; volunteers contribute time and plants. Citywide 2005 Park Bond Program provides $5.5 million to improve Point Defiance Park; projects include restoration of the Pagoda, trail maintenance, soil decontamination and converting mowed turf to habitat plantings. More than 1,500 citizens have engaged in the park's 2005 Park Improvement Bond planning since the process began in 2008.

Named after the Armenian family of Vanandi, it was a principality of the Kingdom of Armenia and a later province of the Democratic Republic of Armenia. Its historic capital was the city of Kars. The region fell to numerous invaders including the Assyrians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Mongols, Persians, and the Ottoman Turks. After the 1877-1878 Russo-Turkish War, the Russian Empire acquired the region at the Congress of Berlin. The area still retained a substantial Armenian population, but after World War I, most of it was decimated during the Turkish-Armenian War in 1920.

It is a class II antiarrhythmic. Esmolol decreases the force and rate of heart contractions by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors of the sympathetic nervous system, which are found in the heart and other organs of the body. Esmolol prevents the action of two naturally occurring substances: epinephrine and norepinephrine. It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1987. Medical uses To terminate supraventricular tachycardia, Episodic atrial fibrillation or flutter, Arrhythmia during anaesthesia, To reduce HR and BP during and after cardiac surgery, and In early treatment of myocardial infarction. Esmolol is also used in blunting the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation. Dosing  A loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg is given followed by 0.05‚Äì0.2 mg/kg/min infusion. Metabolism Esmolol is considered a soft drug, one that is rapidly metabolized to an inactive form. Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol's short duration of action is based on the ester-methyl side chain which allows for quick hydrolysis. Esmolol's structure is reflected in its name, es-molol as in ester-methyl. Plasma cholinesterases and red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase do not have any action. This metabolism results in the formation of a free acid and methanol. The amount of methanol produced is similar to endogenous methanol production. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about two minutes and an elimination half-life of about nine minutes.

However, according to reports, and after that one of the French-Armenian princes named Constantine de Lavoie (son of Raymond de Lavoie and Catharine Balouni) declared himself king and for another 48 years continued to rule a number of areas of the country. It was not until 1424 that the Sultan of Egypt went to war against him, defeated him, and took possession of Cilicia.

Most database and spreadsheet programs are able to read or save data in a delimited format. Due to their wide support, DSV files can be used in data exchange among many applications. A delimited text file is a text file used to store data, in which each line represents a single book, company, or other thing, and each line has fields separated by the delimiter. Stephen R. Westman. \\"Creating Database-backed Library Web Pages: Using Open Source Tools\\". 2006\\\\. Section \\"Structured Text Files\\". p. 15. Compared to the kind of flat file that uses spaces to force every field to the same width, a delimited file has the advantage of allowing field values of any length. Richard Petersen. \\"Introductory Command Line Unix for Users\\". 2006\\\\. p. 356.  Delimited formats  Any character may be used to separate the values, but the most common delimiters are the comma, tab, and colon.Under UNIX, the colon is the most common DSV delimiter for values that may contain whitespace. Ibid. The vertical bar (also referred to as pipe) and space are also sometimes used. In a comma-separated values (CSV) file the data items are separated using commas as a delimiter, while in a tab-separated values (TSV) file, the data items are separated using tabs as a delimiter. Column headers are sometimes included as the first line, and each subsequent line is a row of data. The lines are separated by newlines. For example, the following fields in each record are delimited by commas, and each record by newlines: \\"Date\\",\\"Pupil\\",\\"Grade\\" \\"25 May\\",\\"Bloggs, Fred\\",\\"C\\" \\"25 May\\",\\"Doe, Jane\\",\\"B\\" \\"15 July\\",\\"Bloggs, Fred\\",\\"A\\" \\"15 April\\",\\"Muniz, Alvin \\"\\"Hank\\"\\"\\",\\"A\\" Note the use of the double quote to enclose each field. This prevents the comma in the actual field value (Bloggs, Fred; Doe, Jane, etc.) from being interpreted as a field separator. This necessitates a way to \\"escape\\" the field wrapper itself, in this case the double quote; it is customary to double the double quotes actually contained in a field as with those surrounding \\"Hank\\". In this way, any ASCII text including newlines can be contained in a field. ASCII includes several control characters that are intended to be used as delimiters. They are: 28 for File Separator, 29 for Group Separator, 30 for Record Separator, and 31 for Unit Separator. Use of these characters has not achieved widespread adoption; some systems have replaced their control properties with more accepted controls such as CR/LF and TAB.  Uses and applications  Due to their widespread use, comma- and tab-delimited text files can be opened by several kinds of applications, including most spreadsheet programs and statistical packages, sometimes even without the user designating which delimiter has been used. Despite that each of those applications has its own database design and its own file format (for example, accdb or xlsx), they can all map the fields in a DSV file to their own data model and format. Typically a delimited file format is indicated by a specification. Some specifications provide conventions for avoiding delimiter collision, others do not. Delimiter collision is a problem that occurs when a character that is intended as part of the data gets interpreted as a delimiter instead. Comma- and space-separated formats often suffer from this problem, since in many contexts those characters are legitimate parts of a data field. Most such files avoid delimiter collision either by surrounding all data fields in double quotes, or only quoting those data fields that contain the delimiter character. One problem with tab- delimited text files is that tabs are difficult to distinguish from spaces; therefore, there are sometimes problems with the files being corrupted when people try to edit them by hand. Another set of problems occur due to errors in the file structure, usually during import of file into a database (in the example above, such error may be a pupil's first name missing). Depending on the data itself, it may be beneficial to use non-standard characters such as the tilde (~) as delimiters. With rising prevalence of web sites and other applications that store snippets of code in databases, simply using a \\" which occurs in every hyperlink and image source tag simply is not sufficient to avoid this type of collision. Since colons (:), semi-colons (;), pipes (|), and many other characters are also used, it can be quite challenging to find a character that is not being used elsewhere.

It states that if f and g are n-times differentiable functions, then the product fg is also n-times differentiable and its nth derivative is given by :(fg)^{(n)}=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\\\choose k} f^{(n-k)} g^{(k)}, where {n \\\\choose k}={n!\\\\over k! (n-k)!} is the binomial coefficient and f^{(j)} denotes the jth derivative of f (and in particular f^{(0)}= f). The rule can be proved by using the product rule and mathematical induction. Second derivative If, for example, , the rule gives an expression for the second derivative of a product of two functions: :(fg)(x)=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{k=0}^{2}{\\\\binom{2}{k} f^{(2-k)}(x)g^{(k)}(x)}=f(x)g(x)+2f'(x)g'(x)+f(x)g(x). More than two factors The formula can be generalized to the product of m differentiable functions f1,...,fm. :\\\\left(f_1 f_2 \\\\cdots f_m\\\\right)^{(n)}=\\\\sum_{k_1+k_2+\\\\cdots+k_m=n} {n \\\\choose k_1, k_2, \\\\ldots, k_m} \\\\prod_{1\\\\le t\\\\le m}f_{t}^{(k_{t})}\\\\,, where the sum extends over all m-tuples (k1,...,km) of non-negative integers with \\\\sum_{t=1}^m k_t=n, and : {n \\\\choose k_1, k_2, \\\\ldots, k_m} = \\\\frac{n!}{k_1!\\\\, k_2! \\\\cdots k_m!} are the multinomial coefficients. This is akin to the multinomial formula from algebra. Proof The proof of the general Leibniz rule proceeds by induction. Let f and g be n-times differentiable functions. The base case when n=1 claims that: : (fg)'=f'g+fg', which is the usual product rule and is known to be true. Next, assume that the statement holds for a fixed n \\\\geq 1, that is, that : (fg)^{(n)}=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n\\\\binom{n}{k} f^{(n-k)}g^{(k)}. Then, :\\\\begin{align} (fg)^{(n+1)} &= \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\binom{n}{k} f^{(n-k)} g^{(k)} \\\\right]' \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\binom{n}{k} f^{(n+1-k)} g^{(k)} + \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\binom{n}{k} f^{(n-k)} g^{(k+1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\binom{n}{k} f^{(n+1-k)} g^{(k)} + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \\\\binom{n}{k-1} f^{(n+1-k)} g^{(k)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\binom{n}{0} f^{(n+1)} g + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\binom{n}{k} f^{(n+1-k)} g^{(k)} + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\binom{n}{k-1} f^{(n+1-k)} g^{(k)} + \\\\binom{n}{n} fg^{(n+1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= f^{(n+1)} g + \\\\left( \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\left[\\\\binom{n}{k-1} + \\\\binom{n}{k} \\\\right]f^{(n+1-k)} g^{(k)} \\\\right) + fg^{(n+1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= f^{(n+1)} g + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\binom{n+1}{k} f^{(n+1-k)} g^{(k)} + fg^{(n+1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \\\\binom{n+1}{k} f^{(n+1-k)} g^{(k)} . \\\\end{align} And so the statement holds for n+1, and the proof is complete. Multivariable calculus With the multi-index notation for partial derivatives of functions of several variables, the Leibniz rule states more generally: :\\\\partial^\\\\alpha (fg) = \\\\sum_{ \\\\beta\\\\,:\\\\,\\\\beta \\\\le \\\\alpha } {\\\\alpha \\\\choose \\\\beta} (\\\\partial^{\\\\beta} f) (\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha - \\\\beta} g). This formula can be used to derive a formula that computes the symbol of the composition of differential operators. In fact, let P and Q be differential operators (with coefficients that are differentiable sufficiently many times) and R = P \\\\circ Q. Since R is also a differential operator, the symbol of R is given by: :R(x, \\\\xi) = e^{-{\\\\langle x, \\\\xi \\\\rangle}} R (e^{\\\\langle x, \\\\xi \\\\rangle}). A direct computation now gives: :R(x, \\\\xi) = \\\\sum_\\\\alpha {1 \\\\over \\\\alpha!} \\\\left({\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\xi}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha P(x, \\\\xi) \\\\left({\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial x}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha Q(x, \\\\xi). This formula is usually known as the Leibniz formula. It is used to define the composition in the space of symbols, thereby inducing the ring structure.

Some of the region's oldest towns and villages have survived to this day, including Jugha (now Julfa) and Ordvat' (modern-day Ordubad). History Early to medieval According to Movses Khorenatsi, King Tigran Ervanduni (of the Orontid line) of Armenia, settled his wife and his daughters in an area to the east of (Ararat) and up to Goght'n, in Tambat, Oskiokh, Djaghguyn and other settlements giving them also three towns - Khram, Jugha and Khoshakunik, and on the other bank of the river (Arax) all the fields from Ajanakan up to the Nakhchavan Fortress. Mesrop Mashtots', the inventor of the Armenian alphabet, is assumed to have lived and worked in the town of Msrvanis (Mesropavan) during his stay in Goght'n. The Armenian princes of Goght'n probably had branched off from the family in Syunik' and had their own regional bishop.Hewsen, Robert (2001). Armenia: A Historical Atlas.

When the fortress of Yernjak fell to Yusuf in 912/14, Yusuf awarded it to the emir, whose successors sought to expand their landholdings through the course of the tenth century. The city of Nakhchavan was taken, though by the second half of the ninth century the emir of Goght'n had lost it to the Bagratuni kings of Armenia. The emirs of Goght'n and Armenians kings continued to struggle over control of the Arax River Valley until King Gagik I (r. 989-1020) reduced them at end of the tenth century.Ter-Ghewondyan.

Early modern to modern In 1604, the region was depopulated by Shah Abbas I and its Armenian inhabitants deported to Iran. Goght'n became a part of the khanate of Nakhichevan in the mid-1700s and was divided into five districts (mahals): Ordubad, Agulis, Dasht, Belev, and Chananab. In 1752, it was attacked and subjected by Azat Khan. In the early twentieth century, Goght'an was the name given to the subregion of Sharur-Nakhichevan by the government of the First Republic of Armenia. Its administrative center was at Agulis, with commissar Ashot Melik-Musian and militia chief Movses Giulnazarian at its head. The region suffered intense fighting during a brief conflict between Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in the latter half of 1919, including the destruction of Agulis in December by a Muslim mob. Monuments A number of historical Armenian churches were once found in Goght'n. These included Basilica of St. James in Sho·πõot', the Monastery of St. Thomas the Apostle in Upper Agulis, Holy Mother of God Church in Ts'gnay, and Monastery of St. Mesrop in Msrvanis.

Thanks to the finding of the remains of lake-dwelling villages in the small lakes of Sovenigo, it has been possible to ascertain that the area was already inhabited during the prehistoric era. When visiting Monte Boccale it is possible to encounter plaques belonging to the Romanesque period, the most spectacular being walled into the door of the parish church in San Michele. The town experienced Lombard domination, as is demonstrated by documents listing the property of some Lombards; in the 14th century it was subjected to the dominion of Mastino della Scala and in the 15th century to domination from Venice. During the period under the Venetian Republic Puegnago became part of the Valtenesi area. The plague of 1630 did not spare the town, bringing great suffering and mourning. Puegnago was subjected to the raids of bandits in the 17th century, among whom there was the terrible Dominisette, who subjected the population to appalling outrages. With the arrival of the war of Spanish succession, French and Spanish troops plundered Puegnago of the money of the Company of the Sacred Body of Christ and of many sacred works contained in the town. The population was proud of the assistance given to neighbouring towns after the battle of San Martino, when they aided the numerous injured soldiers. From 1818 to 1825 Puegnago, Soiano and San Felice were gathered together, whereas only in 1928 was Puegnago joined to Raffa. The origin of the unusual name is thought to date back to the Roman era, from the Roman \\"Popinius\\" which became \\"Popiniacus\\" following a form of Romanisation.

She subsequently worked as a home economist, and was a member of the Manitoba Home Economics Association and the Canadian Home Economics Association. Gray was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1988 provincial election as a Liberal, defeating incumbent New Democrat Harvey Smith by 624 votes in the central Winnipeg riding of Ellice. The election was won by the Progressive Conservatives, and Gray joined 19 other Liberals in the official opposition. She argued for an increase in welfare rates during this period. The Liberals fell back to seven seats in the 1990 provincial election, and Gray lost to NDP candidate Conrad Santos by 108 votes. Two years later, she returned to the legislature via a by-election in the south Winnipeg riding of Crescentwood, defeating NDP candidate Tim Sale by 441 votes. Despite an early lead in the polls, the Manitoba Liberal Party ran a poor campaign in the 1995 provincial election and fell from seven to three seats. Gray placed last in a close three-way race in Crescentwood, finishing behind Sale and PC candidate Debbie Vivian. She has not sought a return to the legislature since this time. Gray worked as the campaign manager for federal Liberal cabinet minister Reg Alcock when he ran for re-election in Winnipeg South in the 2004 federal election, and was subsequently hired as a lobbyist of the Canadian Wheat Board, a department under Alcock's ministry.

It is within the borough of Fareham but is part of the parliamentary constituency of Gosport. History Both Stubbington and neighbouring Crofton were mentioned in the Domesday Book (the 11th century UK census) as small districts belonging to the estates of Titchfield Abbey. The earliest known cricket match to have been played in Hampshire took place on Tues 22 May 1733 in the village. It was between Married v Single. The Married team won. Details were found by Martin Wilson in the American Weekly Mercury, a Philadelphia newspaper dated 20 to 27 September 1733. Mr Wilson subsequently found an earlier version of the report in an English newspaper, the 18 June 1733 edition of Parker's Penny Post.From Lads to Lords ‚Äì 1731 During the 19th century, Stubbington engulfed Crofton and the small fishing village of Hill Head. The Crofton name still remains in the name of many local facilities, such as the Crofton School and Crofton Old Church. At the start of the 20th century, the village still consisted of just a few dozen cottages and farms. By 1939, the population had risen to around 2,500 and a number of small shops had opened surrounding the village green. This remains the central focus of the village to the present day, with a war memorial situated on the central village green. The Church The 'Crofton Old Church' at Crofton is one of the oldest known inhabited sites in the area. It was mentioned in the Domesday Book and it is thought to date back to the reign of King Alfred in the 9th Century. It is believed to have caught the eye of Samuel Pepys in 1662 and was extensively renovated during the 13th Century. A new church (Holy Rood) was built in Stubbington which took over the function of Crofton Church in 1878. The War Memorial and Village Pump In 1922 a wooden War Memorial was built to commemorate those from Stubbington and Hill Head who fell in the First World War. Their names were carved into the roof of the memorial although over the years they have been worn away. The Memorial takes the form of a shelter over the village pump, and today it is one of few pre-war structures standing in the vicinity of Stubbington Village Centre. The names carved into the roof of the memorial have now been cleaned and can be seen clearly. Present day The population of Stubbington has risen to over 15,000, with new housing estates taking over a number of the surrounding fields. The town has a number of modern shops as well as a range of other facilities, including a doctor, dentist, library, community centre and seven schools. The former Royal Navy site of HMS Daedalus lies between Stubbington and neighbouring Lee-on-the-Solent, and a small part is currently being developed, however more is scheduled for further development that could further expand the town.  Neighbouring areas The nearest village is Titchfield. Also near Stubbington is the area of Fareham called Hill Head and the town of Lee-on-the-Solent.

The first attested member of the house is Manadjihr Rshtuni from about 330, brother of Zora, attested in 335 and 350 both of whom revolted against the King of Armenia Tiran, along with the prince Vatche Artsruni. The king ordered the extermination of the two families, but Savasp Artsruni and Tadjat Rshtuni survived. The latter is the father of Garegin Rshtuni, attested between 370‚Äì80. Artak Rshtuni is attested in 445. The family rules from their region of Rshtuniq, as well as Bznuniq obtained from Arshakunis after the extermination of the family Bznuni. Rshtunis support the Sassanid Persians for the most part against the Byzantines. The best-known member and the leading figure of the family in the early 7th century is Theodoros Rshtuni, marzban then prince of Armenia from 638 to 655, who had the difficult task of ensuring Armenia's survival between Byzantine and Arab ambitions. Following the destruction of the Sassanid empire, the Muslim incursions into Armenia in 642 began. He is eventually exiled by the Caliph to Damascus. The family becomes increasingly irrelevant following Theodoros' exile, becoming vassals of the Artsrunis and losing their hereditary land of Bznunik to the Mamikonians in 656.

Collectively, these electrons are defined as delta radiation when they have sufficient energy to ionize further atoms through subsequent interactions on their own. Delta rays appear as branches in the main track of a cloud chamber (See Figs. 1,2). These branches will appear nearer the start of the track of a heavy charged particle, where more energy is imparted to the ionized electrons.

Besides its historical values, it is currently known for traveling; it is listed as one of the main attractions for tourists visiting the city of Suqian.  Origin  Currently, most people in the city believe that Luoma lake gets its name from its shape, which looks like the backbone of a horse. They insist that this lake is formed by nature. Indeed, Luoma Lake was formed by the change of the Chinese river system. Due to the change in the course of Yellow River to Sihe River and Huaihe River, Huanghe flooded several times and caused this lake to enlarge its area. During the past three hundred years, Huanghe brought sediments into Luoma Lake and created depositions inside the lake.  History  The history of Luoma Lake can be traced back to the period of Gaozong of Song. According to his autobiography, he came to this place and named it as Luoma.

Those species include phragmites, nelumbo nucifera, silver carp, Chinese white shrimp, and crab.

Marriage On 9 March 1934, the public announcement of the engagement of Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th·ªã Lan and B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, King of Annam, was released. (In the 19th century, the occupying French forces had diminished the rank of the country's emperor to king, a situation that was not reversed until 1945.) In it, B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i stated, \\"The future Queen, reared like us in France, combines in her person the graces of the West and the charms of the East. We who have had the occasion to meet her believe that she is worthy to be our companion and our equal. We are certain by her conduct and example that she fully merits the title of First Woman of the Empire.\\" After a formal betrothal ceremony in the imperial summer palace in Da Lat,\\"Will Renounce Faith to Wed an Emperor\\", The New York Times, 18 March 1934 the king married Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th·ªã Lan on 20 March 1934, in Hu·∫ø. The ceremony was Buddhist, though the ruler's Catholic fianc√©e caused some controversy; the country's population was not entirely in favor of the bride's religious affiliation.\\"Commoner is Wed to Annam's Ruler\\", The New York Times, 21 March 1934. Others suspected that the marriage \\"smelled high of French chicanery.\\" The New York Times reported that \\"discontent was general\\" in the country, given that Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th·ªã Lan had declined to renounce Catholicism and was appealing to Pope Pius XI for a dispensation.\\"Annamite Girl Asks Pope for Right to Wed Emperor\\", The New York Times, 12 March 2004 (reprint of article dated 12 March 1934) Another article noted that there was much discussion over a report that the pope might allow the bride to \\"remain a Catholic if she gave the Church her girl children.\\"\\"Wedding and Thanks\\", Time, 2 April 1934. Further complicating the wedding plans was the apparent disapproval of the young monarch's mother, Doan Huy, and his late father's secondary wives, all of whom had other bridal candidates that B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i apparently did not consider.\\"Annam Greets Emperor's Catholic Bride\\", The New York Times, 20 March 1934 At the state ceremony that marked the end of the four-day wedding festivities, Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th·ªã Lan was given the title 'Imperial Princess' and the name Nam Ph∆∞∆°ng, which can be roughly translated as 'Fragrance of the South', in acknowledgment of her place of birth. Time on 2 April 1934 closely followed the traditional royal nuptials: > \\"Little Mariette Nguyen Huu Hao was beautifully married.

Coronation as Empress Nam Phuong stamp, published in 1950s On 18 June 1945, Nam Ph∆∞∆°ng was raised in rank from Her Majesty to Her Imperial Majesty. She also was granted the title of empress, her husband having assumed the title of emperor after proclaiming the country's independence from France, as he had been urged to do as a member of Japan's Greater East Asia Co- Prosperity Sphere. At this time, Tonkin, Cochinchina, and Annam, which came under the control of Imperial Japan after World War II, were reunited to become the Empire of Vietnam, a puppet state. However, the new emperor was soon convinced to abdicate the throne by the revolutionary leader H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, head of the Vi·ªát Minh. The former emperor returned to Vietnam in 1949 at the invitation of the civilian government and was named head of state, but he went into exile again in 1954. Influence on fashion Nam Ph∆∞∆°ng's first official visit to Europe, in the summer of 1939, launched a craze for what one reporter described as \\"trousers and embroidered tunics for evenings; pagoda silhouettes, [and] revers or sleeve forms.\\"\\"By Wireless from Paris\\", The New York Times, 23 July 1939 To the surprise of fashion observers, when she met with Pope Pius XII during that trip, \\"the visitor from Indochina did not wear the traditional black, long-sleeved gown and veil.

The terms company officer or company-grade officer are used more in the Army, Air Force, or Marine Corps as the ranks of captain, lieutenant grades and other subaltern ranks originated from the officers in command of a company or equivalent (cavalry squadron/troop and artillery battery). In many armed forces, a junior officer is specifically a commissioned officer holding rank equivalent to a naval lieutenant, an army captain or a flight lieutenant or below. In the United States Armed Forces, the term junior officer is used by the Navy and the Coast Guard for officers in the ranks of ensign (O-1), lieutenant, junior grade (O-2), lieutenant (O-3),and lieutenant commander (O-4). The U.S. commissioned officer corps is divided into ten pay grades (O-1 through O-10). Officers in pay grades O-1 through O-3 are considered company grade officers. In the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force, these pay grades correspond to the ranks of second lieutenant (O-1), first lieutenant (O-2), and captain (O-3), and in the Navy, these pay grades correspond to ensign (O-1), lieutenant (junior grade) (O-2), and lieutenant (O-3). Officers in pay grades O-4 through O-6 are considered field grade officers. In the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force, these pay grades correspond to the ranks of major (O-4), lieutenant colonel (O-5), and colonel (O-6), and in the Navy, lieutenant commander, commander, and captain.

The narrative is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the first two chapters of the Book of Genesis. In the first, Elohim (the Hebrew generic word for God) creates the heavens and the Earth in six days, then rests on, blesses and sanctifies the seventh (i.e. the Biblical Sabbath). In the second story, God, now referred to by the personal name Yahweh, creates Adam, the first man, from dust and places him in the Garden of Eden, where he is given dominion over the animals. Eve, the first woman, is created from Adam and as his companion. Borrowing themes from Mesopotamian mythology, but adapting them to the Israelite people's belief in one God, the first major comprehensive draft of the Pentateuch (the series of five books which begins with Genesis and ends with Deuteronomy) was composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE (the Jahwist source) and was later expanded by other authors (the Priestly source) into a work very like Genesis as known today. The two sources can be identified in the creation narrative: Priestly and Jahwistic. The combined narrative is a critique of the Mesopotamian theology of creation: Genesis affirms monotheism and denies polytheism. Robert Alter described the combined narrative as \\"compelling in its archetypal character, its adaptation of myth to monotheistic ends\\". In recent centuries, some believers have used this narrative as evidence of literal creationism, leading them to subsequently deny evolution. Composition Cuneiform tablet with the Atra- Hasis Epic in the British Museum Sources Although tradition attributes Genesis to Moses, biblical scholars hold that it, together with the following four books (making up what Jews call the Torah and biblical scholars call the Pentateuch), is \\"a composite work, the product of many hands and periods.\\" A common hypothesis among biblical scholars today is that the first major comprehensive draft of the Pentateuch was composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE (the Jahwist source), and that this was later expanded by the addition of various narratives and laws (the Priestly source) into a work very like the one existing today. As for the historical background which led to the creation of the narrative itself, a theory which has gained considerable interest, although still controversial, is \\"Persian imperial authorisation\\". This proposes that the Persians, after their conquest of Babylon in 538 BCE, agreed to grant Jerusalem a large measure of local autonomy within the empire, but required the local authorities to produce a single law code accepted by the entire community. It further proposes that there were two powerful groups in the community ‚Äì the priestly families who controlled the Temple, and the landowning families who made up the \\"elders\\" ‚Äì and that these two groups were in conflict over many issues, and that each had its own \\"history of origins\\", but the Persian promise of greatly increased local autonomy for all provided a powerful incentive to cooperate in producing a single text. Structure The creation narrative is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the two first chapters of the Book of Genesis (there are no chapter divisions in the original Hebrew text, see Chapters and verses of the Bible). The first account () employs a repetitious structure of divine fiat and fulfillment, then the statement \\"And there was evening and there was morning, the [xth] day,\\" for each of the six days of creation. In each of the first three days there is an act of division: day one divides the darkness from light, day two the \\"waters above\\" from the \\"waters below\\", and day three the sea from the land. In each of the next three days these divisions are populated: day four populates the darkness and light with Sun, Moon and stars; day five populates seas and skies with fish and fowl; and finally land-based creatures and mankind populate the land. Consistency was evidently not seen as essential to storytelling in ancient Near Eastern literature. \\"One aspect of narrative in Genesis that requires special attention is its high tolerance for different versions of the same event, a well-known feature of ancient Near Eastern literature, from earliest times through rabbinic midrash. ... This could not have happened if the existence of variation were seen as a serious defect or if rigid consistency were deemed essential to effective storytelling.\\" The overlapping stories of Genesis 1 and 2 are contradictory but also complementary, with the first (the Priestly story) concerned with the creation of the entire cosmos while the second (the Yahwist story) focuses on man as moral agent and cultivator of his environment. The highly regimented seven-day narrative of Genesis 1 features an omnipotent God who creates a god-like humanity, while the one-day creation of Genesis 2 uses a simple linear narrative, a God who can fail as well as succeed, and a humanity which is not god-like but is punished for acts which would lead to their becoming god-like. Even the order and method of creation differs. \\"Together, this combination of parallel character and contrasting profile point to the different origin of materials in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2, however elegantly they have now been combined.\\" The primary accounts in each chapter are joined by a literary bridge at , \\"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created.\\" This echoes the first line of Genesis 1, \\"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth\\", and is reversed in the next phrase, \\"...in the day that the God made the earth and the heavens\\". This verse is one of ten \\"generations\\" ( ') phrases used throughout Genesis, which provide a literary structure to the book. They normally function as headings to what comes after, but the position of this, the first of the series, has been the subject of much debate. Mesopotamian influence Marduk, god of Babylon, destroying Tiamat, the dragon of primeval chaos Comparative mythology provides historical and cross-cultural perspectives for Jewish mythology. Both sources behind the Genesis creation narrative borrowed themes from Mesopotamian mythology, but adapted them to their belief in one God, establishing a monotheistic creation in opposition to the polytheistic creation myth of ancient Israel's neighbors. as a whole is imbued with Mesopotamian myths. Genesis 1 bears both striking differences from and striking similarities to Babylon's national creation myth, the Enuma Elish. On the side of similarities, both begin from a stage of chaotic waters before anything is created, in both a fixed dome-shaped \\"firmament\\" divides these waters from the habitable Earth, and both conclude with the creation of a human called \\"man\\" and the building of a temple for the god (in Genesis 1, this temple is the entire cosmos). On the side of contrasts, Genesis 1 is monotheistic, it makes no attempt to account for the origins of God, and there is no trace of the resistance to the reduction of chaos to order (Greek: theomachy, lit. \\"God- fighting\\"), all of which mark the Mesopotamian creation accounts. Still, Genesis 1 bears similarities to the Baal Cycle of Israel's neighbor, Ugarit. The Enuma Elish has also left traces on Genesis 2. Both begin with a series of statements of what did not exist at the moment when creation began; the Enuma Elish has a spring (in the sea) as the point where creation begins, paralleling the spring (on the land ‚Äì Genesis 2 is notable for being a \\"dry\\" creation story) in that \\"watered the whole face of the ground\\"; in both myths, Yahweh/the gods first create a man to serve him/them, then animals and vegetation. At the same time, and as with Genesis 1, the Jewish version has drastically changed its Babylonian model: Eve, for example, seems to fill the role of a mother goddess when, in , she says that she has \\"created a man with Yahweh\\", but she is not a divine being like her Babylonian counterpart. Genesis 2 has close parallels with a second Mesopotamian myth, the Atra-Hasis epic ‚Äì parallels that in fact extend throughout , from the Creation to the Flood and its aftermath. The two share numerous plot-details (e.g. the divine garden and the role of the first man in the garden, the creation of the man from a mixture of earth and divine substance, the chance of immortality, etc.), and have a similar overall theme: the gradual clarification of man's relationship with God(s) and animals. Creation by word and creation by combat The narratives in Genesis 1 and 2 were not the only creation myths in ancient Israel, and the complete biblical evidence suggests two contrasting models. The first is the \\"logos\\" (meaning speech) model, where a supreme God \\"speaks\\" dormant matter into existence. The second is the \\"agon\\" (meaning struggle or combat) model, in which it is God's victory in battle over the monsters of the sea that mark his sovereignty and might. Genesis 1 is an example of creation by speech, while Psalm 74 and Isaiah 51 are examples of the \\"agon\\" mythology, recalling a Canaanite myth in which God creates the world by vanquishing the water deities: \\"Awake, awake! ... It was you that hacked Rahab in pieces, that pierced the Dragon! It was you that dried up the Sea, the waters of the great Deep, that made the abysses of the Sea a road that the redeemed might walk...\\" Genesis 1:1‚Äì2:3 The Ancient of Days (William Blake, Copy D, 1794) Background The cosmos created in Genesis 1 bears a striking resemblance to the Tabernacle in , which was the prototype of the Temple in Jerusalem and the focus of priestly worship of Yahweh; for this reason, and because other Middle Eastern creation stories also climax with the construction of a temple/house for the creator-god, Genesis 1 can be interpreted as a description of the construction of the cosmos as God's house, for which the Temple in Jerusalem served as the earthly representative. The word bara is translated as \\"created\\" in English, but the concept it embodied was not the same as the modern term: in the world of the ancient Near East, the gods demonstrated their power over the world not by creating matter but by fixing destinies, so that the essence of the bara which God performs in Genesis concerns bringing \\"heaven and earth\\" (a set phrase meaning \\"everything\\") into existence by organising and assigning roles and functions. The use of numbers in ancient texts was often numerological rather than factual ‚Äì that is, the numbers were used because they held some symbolic value to the author. The number seven, denoting divine completion, permeates Genesis 1: verse 1:1 consists of seven words, verse 1:2 of fourteen, and 2:1‚Äì3 has 35 words (5√ó7); Elohim is mentioned 35 times, \\"heaven/firmament\\" and \\"earth\\" 21 times each, and the phrases \\"and it was so\\" and \\"God saw that it was good\\" occur 7 times each. Pre-creation: Genesis 1:1‚Äì2 :1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. :2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. Although the opening phrase of Genesis 1:1 is commonly translated in English as above, the Hebrew is ambiguous, and can be translated at least three ways: # as a statement that the cosmos had an absolute beginning (\\"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\\"); # as a statement describing the condition of the world when God began creating (\\"When in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was untamed and shapeless.\\"); and # essentially similar to the second version but taking all of Genesis 1:2 as background information (\\"When in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth ‚Äì the earth being untamed and shapeless... ‚Äì God said, Let there be light!\\"). The second seems to be the meaning intended by the original Priestly author: the verb bara is used only of God (people do not engage in bara), and it concerns the assignment of roles, as in the creation of the first people as \\"male and female\\" (i.e., it allocates them sexes): in other words, the power of God is being shown not by the creation of matter but by the fixing of destinies. The heavens and the earth is a set phrase meaning \\"everything\\", i.e., the cosmos. This was made up of three levels, the habitable earth in the middle, the heavens above, and an underworld below, all surrounded by a watery \\"ocean\\" of chaos as the Babylonian Tiamat. The Earth itself was a flat disc, surrounded by mountains or sea. Above it was the firmament, a transparent but solid dome resting on the mountains, allowing men to see the blue of the waters above, with \\"windows\\" to allow the rain to enter, and containing the Sun, Moon and stars. The waters extended below the Earth, which rested on pillars sunk in the waters, and in the underworld was Sheol, the abode of the dead. The opening of Genesis 1 continues: \\"And the earth was formless and void...\\" The phrase \\"formless and void\\" is a translation of the Hebrew ', (), chaos, the condition that bara, ordering, remedies. Tohu by itself means \\"emptiness, futility\\"; it is used to describe the desert wilderness; bohu has no known meaning and was apparently coined to rhyme with and reinforce tohu. The phrase appears also in Jeremiah 4:23 where the prophet warns Israel that rebellion against God will lead to the return of darkness and chaos, \\"as if the earth had been 'uncreated'\\". The opening of Genesis 1 concludes with a statement that \\"darkness was on the face of the deep\\" ( '), [the] \\"darkness\\" and the \\"deep\\" being two of the three elements of the chaos represented in ' (the third is the \\"formless earth\\"). In the Enuma Elish, the \\"deep\\" is personified as the goddess Tiamat, the enemy of Marduk; here it is the formless body of primeval water surrounding the habitable world, later to be released during the Deluge, when \\"all the fountains of the great deep burst forth\\" from the waters beneath the earth and from the \\"windows\\" of the sky. The ruach of God moves over the face of the deep before creation begins. Ruach () has the meanings \\"wind, spirit, breath\\", and ' can mean \\"great\\" as well as \\"god\\": the ' may therefore mean the \\"wind/breath of God\\" (the storm-wind is God's breath in Psalms 18:16 and elsewhere, and the wind of God returns in the Flood story as the means by which God restores the Earth), or God's \\"spirit\\", a concept which is somewhat vague in the Hebrew Bible, or it may simply signify a great storm-wind. Six days of Creation: Genesis 1:3‚Äì2:3 The Creation ‚Äì Bible Historiale (c. 1411) God's first act was the creation of undifferentiated light; dark and light were then separated into night and day, their order (evening before morning) signifying that this was the liturgical day; and then the Sun, Moon and stars were created to mark the proper times for the festivals of the week and year. Only when this is done does God create man and woman and the means to sustain them (plants and animals). At the end of the sixth day, when creation is complete, the world is a cosmic temple in which the role of humanity is the worship of God. This parallels Mesopotamian myth (the Enuma Elish) and also echoes chapter 38 of the Book of Job, where God recalls how the stars, the \\"sons of God\\", sang when the corner-stone of creation was laid. First day Day 1 begins with the creation of light. God creates by spoken command and names the elements of the world as he creates them. In the ancient Near East the act of naming was bound up with the act of creating: thus in Egyptian literature the creator god pronounced the names of everything, and the En√ªma Elish begins at the point where nothing has yet been named. God's creation by speech also suggests that he is being compared to a king, who has merely to speak for things to happen. Second day RƒÅq√Æa, the word translated as firmament, is from rƒÅqa', the verb used for the act of beating metal into thin plates. Created on the second day of creation and populated by luminaries on the fourth, it is a solid dome which separates the Earth below from the heavens and their waters above, as in Egyptian and Mesopotamian belief of the same time. In Genesis 1:17 the stars are set in the raqia'; in Babylonian myth the heavens were made of various precious stones (compare Exodus 24:10 where the elders of Israel see God on the sapphire floor of heaven), with the stars engraved in their surface. Third day On the third day, the waters withdraw, creating a ring of ocean surrounding a single circular continent. By the end of the third day God has created a foundational environment of light, heavens, seas and earth. The three levels of the cosmos are next populated in the same order in which they were created ‚Äì heavens, sea, earth. God does not create or make trees and plants, but instead commands the earth to produce them. The underlying theological meaning seems to be that God has given the previously barren earth the ability to produce vegetation, and it now does so at his command. \\"According to (one's) kind\\" appears to look forward to the laws found later in the Pentateuch, which lay great stress on holiness through separation. Fourth day On Day Four the language of \\"ruling\\" is introduced: the heavenly bodies will \\"govern\\" day and night and mark seasons and years and days (a matter of crucial importance to the Priestly authors, as religious festivals were organised around the cycles of the Sun and Moon); later, man will be created to rule over the whole of creation as God's regent. God puts \\"lights\\" in the firmament to \\"rule over\\" the day and the night. Specifically, God creates the \\"greater light,\\" the \\"lesser light,\\" and the stars. According to Victor Hamilton, most scholars agree that the choice of \\"greater light\\" and \\"lesser light\\", rather than the more explicit \\"Sun\\" and \\"Moon\\", is anti-mythological rhetoric intended to contradict widespread contemporary beliefs that the Sun and the Moon were deities themselves. Fifth day In the Egyptian and Mesopotamian mythologies, the creator- god has to do battle with the sea-monsters before he can make heaven and earth; in Genesis 1:21, the word tannin, sometimes translated as \\"sea monsters\\" or \\"great creatures\\", parallels the named chaos-monsters Rahab and Leviathan from Psalm 74:13, and Isaiah 27:1, and Isaiah 51:9, but there is no hint (in Genesis) of combat, and the tannin are simply creatures created by God. Sixth day The Creation of the Animals (1506‚Äì1511), by Gr√£o Vasco When in Genesis 1:26 God says \\"Let us make man\\", the Hebrew word used is adam; in this form it is a generic noun, \\"mankind\\", and does not imply that this creation is male. After this first mention the word always appears as ha-adam, \\"the man\\", but as Genesis 1:27 shows (\\"So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\\"), the word is still not exclusively male. Man was created in the \\"image of God\\". The meaning of this is unclear: suggestions include: # Having the spiritual qualities of God such as intellect, will, etc.; # Having the physical form of God; # A combination of these two; # Being God's counterpart on Earth and able to enter into a relationship with him; # Being God's representative or viceroy on Earth. The fact that God says \\"Let us make man...\\" has given rise to several theories, of which the two most important are that \\"us\\" is majestic plural, or that it reflects a setting in a divine council with God enthroned as king and proposing the creation of mankind to the lesser divine beings. God tells the animals and humans that he has given them \\"the green plants for food\\" creation is to be vegetarian. Only later, after the Flood, is man given permission to eat flesh. The Priestly author of Genesis appears to look back to an ideal past in which mankind lived at peace both with itself and with the animal kingdom, and which could be re-achieved through a proper sacrificial life in harmony with God. Upon completion, God sees that \\"every thing that He had made ... was very good\\" (). This implies that the materials that existed before the Creation (\\"tohu wa-bohu,\\" \\"darkness,\\" \\"tehom\\") were not \\"very good.\\" Israel Knohl hypothesized that the Priestly source set up this dichotomy to mitigate the problem of evil. Seventh day: divine rest Creation is followed by rest. In ancient Near Eastern literature the divine rest is achieved in a temple as a result of having brought order to chaos. Rest is both disengagement, as the work of creation is finished, but also engagement, as the deity is now present in his temple to maintain a secure and ordered cosmos. Compare with Exodus 20:8‚Äì20:11: \\"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the thy , in it thou shalt not do any manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid- servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.\\" Genesis 2:4‚Äì2:25 Seventh Day of Creation, from the 1493 Nuremberg Chronicle by Hartmann Schedel Genesis 2‚Äì3, the Garden of Eden story, was probably authored around 500 BCE as \\"a discourse on ideals in life, the danger in human glory, and the fundamentally ambiguous nature of humanity ‚Äì especially human mental faculties\\". The Garden in which the action takes place lies on the mythological border between the human and the divine worlds, probably on the far side of the Cosmic ocean near the rim of the world; following a conventional ancient Near Eastern concept, the Eden river first forms that ocean and then divides into four rivers which run from the four corners of the earth towards its centre. It opens \\"in the day that the God made the earth and the heavens\\", a set introduction similar to those found in Babylonian myths. Before the man is created the earth is a barren waste watered by an ‚Äô√™·∏è (); Genesis 2:6 the King James Version translated this as \\"mist\\", following Jewish practice, but since the mid-20th century Hebraists have generally accepted that the real meaning is \\"spring of underground water\\". In Genesis 1 the characteristic word for God's activity is bara, \\"created\\"; in Genesis 2 the word used when he creates the man is yatsar ( y√Æ·π£er), meaning \\"fashioned\\", a word used in contexts such as a potter fashioning a pot from clay. God breathes his own breath into the clay and it becomes nephesh (), a word meaning \\"life\\", \\"vitality\\", \\"the living personality\\"; man shares nephesh with all creatures, but the text describes this life-giving act by God only in relation to man. Eden, where God puts his Garden of Eden, comes from a root meaning \\"fertility\\": the first man is to work in God's miraculously fertile garden. The \\"tree of life\\" is a motif from Mesopotamian myth: in the Epic of Gilgamesh (c. 1800 BCE) the hero is given a plant whose name is \\"man becomes young in old age\\", but a serpent steals the plant from him. \\"The story of Adam and Eve's sin in the garden of Eden (2.25‚Äì3.24) displays similarities with Gilgamesh, an epic poem that tells how its hero lost the opportunity for immortality and came to terms with his humanity. ... the biblical narrator has adapted the Mesopotamian forerunner to Israelite theology.\\" There has been much scholarly discussion about the type of knowledge given by the second tree. Suggestions include: human qualities, sexual consciousness, ethical knowledge, or universal knowledge; with the last being the most widely accepted. In Eden, mankind has a choice between wisdom and life, and chooses the first, although God intended them for the second. The mythic Eden and its rivers may represent the real Jerusalem, the Temple and the Promised Land. Eden may represent the divine garden on Zion, the mountain of God, which was also Jerusalem; while the real Gihon was a spring outside the city (mirroring the spring which waters Eden); and the imagery of the Garden, with its serpent and cherubs, has been seen as a reflection of the real images of the Solomonic Temple with its copper serpent (the nehushtan) and guardian cherubs. Genesis 2 is the only place in the Bible where Eden appears as a geographic location: elsewhere (notably in the Book of Ezekiel) it is a mythological place located on the holy Mountain of God, with echoes of a Mesopotamian myth of the king as a primordial man placed in a divine garden to guard the tree of life. \\"Good and evil\\" is a merism, in this case meaning simply \\"everything\\", but it may also have a moral connotation. When God forbids the man to eat from the tree of knowledge he says that if he does so he is \\"doomed to die\\": the Hebrew behind this is in the form used in the Bible for issuing death sentences. The first woman is created to be ezer kenegdo ( ‚Äò√™zer k…ône·∏°d≈ç) ‚Äì a term notably difficult to translate ‚Äì to the man. K…ône·∏°d≈ç means \\"alongside, opposite, a counterpart to him\\", and ‚Äò√™zer means active intervention on behalf of the other person. God's naming of the elements of the cosmos in Genesis 1 illustrated his authority over creation; now the man's naming of the animals (and of Woman) illustrates Adam's authority within creation. The woman is called ishah ( ‚Äôi≈°-≈°ƒÅh), \\"Woman\\", with an explanation that this is because she was taken from ish ( ‚Äô√Æ≈°), meaning \\"man\\"; the two words are not in fact connected. Later, after the story of the Garden is complete, she receives a name: ·∏§awwƒÅh (, Eve). This means \\"living\\" in Hebrew, from a root that can also mean \\"snake\\". The word traditionally translated \\"rib\\" in English can also mean \\"side\\", \\"chamber\\", or \\"beam\\". A long-standing exegetical tradition holds that the use of a rib from man's side emphasizes that both man and woman have equal dignity, for woman was created from the same material as man, shaped and given life by the same processes. Creationism and the genre of the creation narrative Eden (Lucas Cranach the Elder, 1472‚Äì1553) The meaning to be derived from the Genesis creation narrative will depend on the reader's understanding of its genre, the literary \\"type\\" to which it belongs (e.g., scientific cosmology, creation myth, or historical saga). According to Biblical scholar Francis Andersen, misunderstanding the genre of the text‚Äîmeaning the intention of the author(s) and the culture within which they wrote‚Äîwill result in a misreading. Reformed evangelical scholar Bruce Waltke cautions against one such misreading: the \\"woodenly literal\\" approach, which leads to \\"creation science,\\" but also such \\"implausible interpretations\\" as the \\"gap theory,\\" the presumption of a \\"young earth,\\" and the denial of evolution. As scholar of Jewish studies, Jon D. Levenson, puts it: Another scholar, Conrad Hyers, summed up the same thought by writing, \\"A literalist interpretation of the Genesis accounts is inappropriate, misleading, and unworkable [because] it presupposes and insists upon a kind of literature and intention that is not there.\\" Whatever else it may be, Genesis 1 is \\"story\\", since it features character and characterization, a narrator, and dramatic tension expressed through a series of incidents arranged in time. The Priestly author of Genesis 1 had to confront two major difficulties. First, there is the fact that since only God exists at this point, no-one was available to be the narrator; the storyteller solved this by introducing an unobtrusive \\"third person narrator\\". Second, there was the problem of conflict: conflict is necessary to arouse the reader's interest in the story, yet with nothing else existing, neither a chaos-monster nor another god, there cannot be any conflict. This was solved by creating a very minimal tension: God is opposed by nothingness itself, the blank of the world \\"without form and void.\\" Telling the story in this way was a deliberate choice: there are a number of creation stories in the Bible, but they tend to be told in the first person, by Wisdom, the instrument by which God created the world; the choice of an omniscient third-person narrator in the Genesis narrative allows the storyteller to create the impression that everything is being told and nothing held back. It can also be regarded as ancient history, \\"part of a broader spectrum of originally anonymous, history- like ancient Near Eastern narratives.\\" It is frequently called myth in scholarly writings, but there is no agreement on how \\"myth\\" is to be defined, and so while Brevard Childs famously suggested that the author of Genesis 1‚Äì11 \\"demythologised\\" his narrative, meaning that he removed from his sources (the Babylonian myths) those elements which did not fit with his own faith, others can say it is entirely mythical. Genesis 1‚Äì2 can be seen as ancient science: in the words of E.A. Speiser, \\"on the subject of creation biblical tradition aligned itself with the traditional tenets of Babylonian science.\\" The opening words of Genesis 1, \\"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\\", sum up the author(s) belief that Yahweh, the god of Israel, was solely responsible for creation and had no rivals. Later Jewish thinkers, adopting ideas from Greek philosophy, concluded that God's Wisdom, Word and Spirit penetrated all things and gave them unity. Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and identified Jesus with the creative word: \\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\\" (John 1:1). When the Jews came into contact with Greek thought it led to a major reinterpretation of the underlying cosmology of the Genesis narrative. The biblical authors conceived the cosmos as a flat disc-shaped Earth in the centre, an underworld for the dead below, and heaven above. Below the Earth were the \\"waters of chaos\\", the cosmic sea, home to mythic monsters defeated and slain by God; in Exodus 20:4, God warns against making an image \\"of anything that is in the waters under the earth\\". There were also waters above the Earth, and so the raqia (firmament), a solid bowl, was necessary to keep them from flooding the world. During the Hellenistic period this was largely replaced by a more \\"scientific\\" model as imagined by Greek philosophers, according to which the Earth was a sphere at the centre of concentric shells of celestial spheres containing the Sun, Moon, stars and planets. The idea that God created the world out of nothing (creatio ex nihilo) is central today to Islam, Christianity, and Judaism ‚Äì indeed, the medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared ‚Äì yet it is not found directly in Genesis, nor in the entire Hebrew Bible. The Priestly authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the Cosmos should function. This was still the situation in the early 2nd century AD, although early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God; by the beginning of the 3rd century this tension was resolved, world-formation was overcome, and creation ex nihilo had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.

Trade unions in Australia may be organised (i.e., formed) on the basis of craft unionism, general unionism, or industrial unionism. Almost all unions in Australia are affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), many of which have undergone a significant process of amalgamations, especially in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The leadership and membership of unions hold and have at other times held a wide range of political views, including communist, socialist and right-wing views. According to ABS figures, in August 2013, there were 1.7 million members of trade unions in relation to their main job (17% of all employees). A further 4% did not know whether they were trade union members or not, while 1% were trade union members not in conjunction with their main job. Of those who were a trade union member in relation to their main job, over two-thirds (68%) had been members for five years or more. Trade union membership has steadily declined over recent years, with 2013 being the lowest proportion in the history of the ABS series.Australian Bureau of Statistics, Cat No. 6310.0: SUMMARY OF FINDINGS According to ACTU figures, the number of members of trade unions in 1983 was 2,376,900 but by 2002 it was 1,833,700,ACTU: Future Strategies - Unions Working for a Fairer Australia and declining. The Australian Labor Party at both a federal and state/colony level pre-dates, among others, both the British Labour Party and the New Zealand Labour Party in party formation, government, and policy implementation. In particular, the 1910 federal election represented a number of firsts: it was Australia's first elected federal majority government; Australia's first elected Senate majority; the world's first Labour Party majority government at a national level; after the 1904 Chris Watson minority government the world's second Labour Party government at a national level; and the first time it controlled both houses of a bicameral legislature.  Early history  Eight-hour day banner, Melbourne, 1856 University of Melbourne site where Stonemasons won the 8-hour day in 1856 The colony of New South Wales came into existence in 1788 as a penal colony. Some dispute that Australia had slavery, but the convicts transported to the colony were required to work, without pay, either for the administration or could be required to work for private landholders. Others, particularly the \\"Kanaka\\" from the South Pacific islands, were either kidnapped or otherwise induced into exploitative long-term indentured service contracts. Initially, following British laws, trade unions in Australia were suppressed, particularly under the Combination Laws of 1799 and 1800. A trade union or other association could also be regarded as illegal because of being a \\"restraint of trade\\". The British Master and Servant Act 1823, and subsequent updates, were generally regarded as heavily biased towards employers, and designed to discipline employees and repress the \\"combination\\" of workers in trade unions. The law required the obedience and loyalty from servants (i.e., workers) to their contracted employer, with infringements of the contract, or disobedience, subject to criminal penalties, often with a jail sentence of hard labour; and the calling for strikes was punished as an \\"aggravated\\" breach of contract. On the other hand, the position was slowly liberalised and through the British Trade Union Act 1871 and the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act 1875 trade unions were legitimised.See also, the Royal Commission on Trade Unions (1867) Cmnd ???; Employers and Workmen Act 1875. Craft unions in Australia began in the early 19th century as craft associations of highly skilled urban workers who sought to organise (form a labour union), to increase their low wages and decrease their high number of hours. By 1902, the Master and Servant Act 1823 had been modified to include forfeit of wages if the written or unwritten contract for work was unfulfilled. Absence from place of work was punishable by imprisonment of up to three months with or without hard labour. There were also penalties of up to ¬£10 for anyone who harboured, concealed or re-employed a 'servant' who had deserted or absconded or absented himself from his duty implied in the 'contract'.Masters and Servants Act (1902) N.S.W. The Act was used against workers organising for better conditions from its inception until well after the first United Kingdom Trade Union Act 1871 was implemented, which secured the legal status of trade unions. Under the Master and Servant Acts enacted in the Australian colonies in the 1840s, employees who left their employment without permission were subject to being hunted down under the Bushrangers Act. As little as one hour's absence by a free servant without permission could precipitate a punishment of prison or the treadmill. In the Melbourne jurisdiction, between 1835 and 1845, when labour shortages were acute, over 20% of prison inmates were convicted under the New South Wales Master and Servant Act for offences including leaving place of work without permission and being found in hotels. Eight-hour day campaign Eight Hour Procession, 4 October 1909 In the 1800s, most Victorians worked up to 14 hours a day, six days a week. There was no sick leave, no holiday leave, and employers could sack employees at any time, without giving a reason.State Library of Victoria: Origins of the 8-hour day On 18 August 1855 the Stonemasons Society in Sydney issued an ultimatum to employers that in six months time, masons would only work an eight-hour day. However men working on the Holy Trinity Church (Garrison Church) in Argyle Cut, and on the Mariners Church, (an evangelical mission to seafarers, now an art gallery and caf√©) in Lower George Street (98-100 George Street), could not contain their enthusiasm and decided not to wait. They pre-emptively went on strike, won the eight-hour day, and celebrated with a victory dinner on 1 October 1855. On 21 April 1856 Stonemasons led by Cooper Bridges, building workers on building sites around Melbourne stopped work and marched from the University of Melbourne to Parliament House to achieve an eight-hour day. Their direct action protest was a success, and they are noted as being among the first organised workers in the world to achieve the eight-hour day with no loss of pay. It took further campaigning and struggles by trade unions to extend the reduction in hours to all workers in Australia. In 1916, the Victorian Eight Hours Act was passed granting the eight-hour day to a wide range of workers in the state. The eight-hour day was not achieved nationally until the 1920s, but that was in the context of a 48-hour week. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court gave approval of the 40-hour five-day working week nationally beginning on 1 January 1948.  Trades Halls  During 1856 the Melbourne Trades Hall Committee was formed and received a grant of land to build the Melbourne Trades Hall, which was completed in 1859. The Trades and Labor Council of Sydney was formed by eight unions in 1871, and Sydney Trades Hall was built between 1888 and 1895. The United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia has a history dating back to 1884.  1890s great strikes  As the craft union movement broadened, less skilled and rural workers began to organise. Australia was convulsed by a number of great strikes in the 1890s. The 1890 maritime strike saw the use of the military to combat protestors. The 1891 shearers' strike was broken after 13 union leaders were charged with sedition and conspiracy, and convicted. The 1892 Broken Hill miners' strike collapsed after several strike leaders were arrested and tried for 'unlawful conspiracy and inciting riots', found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment and it became unpracticable for locals to defend the mines from imported labour.Kearns, R.H.B. 1982, The Mines of Broken Hill, Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, p158-159. In the 1894 shearers' strike sheep shearers in Queensland struck against poor conditions and wages that were being lowered. The strike was broken by the use of non-union labour, and the use of police. Each of these industrial conflicts was seen as a demoralising blow for the labour movement. William Lane and many others sought refuge in building a new society called New Australia in Paraguay. Others in the labour movement, demoralised with direct action, turned to a political solution and sought election to colonial parliaments, and led to the formation of the Australian Labor Party.  Trade union banners  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, trade union banners were unfurled with pride in annual eight-hour day marches which advocated 'Eight Hours Labour, Eight Hours Recreation and Eight Hours Rest'. These marches were one of the most prominent annual celebrations staged in Australia by any group. In Sydney alone, by the early 20th century, thousands of unionists representing up to seventy different unions would take part in such parades, marching behind the banner emblematic of their trade. Most of these banners have not survived; Unions NSW has the largest surviving collection at Sydney Trades Hall in Sussex Street, Sydney. The State Library of NSW has a small collection of trade union banners that were donated to the library in the early 1970s such as this photograph of a Federated Society of Boilermakers, Iron & Steel Shipbuilders of Australia banner thought to have been made c. 1913‚Äì1919. The banner features a kneeling figure in the centre surrounded by scroll work and is decorated with Australian native flowers and images representative of the work of union members such as a New South Wales Government Railways 34 class steam locomotive, the Hawkesbury River rail bridge built in 1889, and a furnace. The reverse of the banner shows the warship \\"Australia\\" at sea. The banner is painted on canvas. Support for White Australia policy Melbourne Trades Hall was opened in 1859 with Trades and Labour Councils and Trades Halls opening in all cities and most regional towns in the following forty years. During the 1880s Trade unions developed among shearers, miners, and stevedores (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all blue-collar jobs. Shortages of labour led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an eight-hour day and other benefits unheard of in Europe. Eight-hour day march circa 1900, outside Parliament House in Spring Street, Melbourne. Australia gained a reputation as \\"the working man's paradise.\\" Some employers tried to undercut the unions by importing Chinese labour. This produced a reaction which led to all the colonies restricting Chinese and other Asian immigration. This was the foundation of the White Australia Policy. The \\"Australian compact\\", based around centralised industrial arbitration, a degree of government assistance particularly for primary industries, and White Australia, was to continue for many years before gradually dissolving in the second half of the 20th century. The growth of the sugar industry in Queensland in the 1870s led to searching for labourers prepared to work in a tropical environment. During this time, thousands of \\"Kanakas\\" (Pacific Islanders) were brought into Australia as indentured workers. This and related practices of bringing in non-white labour to be cheaply employed was commonly termed \\"blackbirding\\" and refers to the recruitment of people through trickery and kidnappings to work on plantations, particularly the sugar cane plantations of Queensland (Australia) and Fiji. In the 1870s and 1880s, the growing trade union movement began a series of protests against foreign labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for \\"substandard\\" wages, lowered working conditions and refused unionisation. Objections to these arguments came largely from wealthy land owners in rural areas. It was argued that without Asiatics to work in the tropical areas of the Northern Territory and Queensland, the area would have to be abandoned. Despite these objections to restricting immigration, between 1875 and 1888 all Australian colonies enacted legislation which excluded all further Chinese immigration. Asian immigrants already residing in the Australian colonies were not expelled and retained the same rights as their Anglo and Southern compatriots. Agreements were made to further increase these restrictions in 1895 following an Inter-colonial Premier's Conference where all colonies agreed to extend entry restrictions to all non-white races. However, in attempting to enact this legislation, the Governors of New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania reserved the bills, due to a treaty with Japan, and they did not become law. Instead, the Natal Act of 1897 was introduced, restricting \\"undesirable persons\\" rather than any specific race. The British government in London was not pleased with legislation that discriminated against certain subjects of its Empire, but decided not to disallow the laws that were passed. Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain explained in 1897: > We quite sympathise with the determination...of these colonies...that there > should not be an influx of people alien in civilisation, alien in religion, > alien in customs, whose influx, moreover, would seriously interfere with the > legitimate rights of the existing labouring population.Speech to Colonial > Conference of 1897, quoted in J. Holland Rose et al., eds. The Cambridge > History of the British Empire: Volume VII: Part I: Australia (1933) p 411; > full text The Barton Government which came to power following the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the Protectionist Party with the support of the Australian Labor Party. The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the Australian Workers Union and other labour organisations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded.  Growth of the trade and industrial unions  At the beginning of the 20th century the union movement was in disarray across Australia. Only a few tough craft unions had survived. The majority of workers were un-unionised. A variety of skilled organisers turned this around, and achieved remarkably high union membership density rates by 1914. The threats of wild cat industrial action on a national level convinced the Federal Parliament to adopt a system of compulsory registration of unions, and compulsory arbitration in disputes. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act was assented to in 1904, and dictated the terrain of industrial relations conflicts and unionism until the 1990s. In part this was caused by two new ideas of unionism: trade unionism and industrial unionism. Trade unionists sought to organise all people engaged in the same trade on job sites. Rather than simply organising the ditch diggers into one craft union and the dirt movers into another craft union, trade unionists sought to organise all people who moved earth into one union. Industrial unionism went one step further, claiming that all workers on one worksite, diggers, plasterers, engine drivers, cleaners, caterers, engineers, accountants and clerks should belong to one union, as part of a \\"construction industry.\\" Industrial unionists sought to organise all workers into One Big Union which could then conduct a strike across the entire society and peacefully usher in socialism. The 1912 Brisbane General Strike showed the combined power of the labour movement, effectively operating as an alternative social administration for five weeks, undermining the power of the conservative government. At the time there was no real conflict or division between the trade and industrial union mentality. Many supporters of the ALP in the Trades and Labour Councils were radical, militant and supported socialism. Both ideas of unionism shared the idea of organising the unskilled to win against the bosses.  Politics  1901 election, including Chris Watson, Andrew Fisher, Billy Hughes, Frank Tudor, and King O'Malley. The failure of each of the industrial conflicts of the 1890s was seen as a demoralising blow for the labour movement. Some unionists, demoralised with direct action, turned to a political solution and sought election to colonial parliaments, and led to the formation of the Australian Labor Party. The first general election contested by Labour candidates was the 1891 New South Wales election, where Labour Electoral League of New South Wales candidates won 35 of 141 seats, giving Labour the balance of power.So Monstrous a Travesty, Ross McMullen. Scribe Publications 2004. p.4. Also in 1891, three United Labor Party (ULP) of South Australia candidates were elected to the South Australian Legislative Council.Professional Historians Association (South Australia) At the 1893 South Australian election the United Labor Party led by John McPherson won 10 of the 54 seats and the balance of power in the House of Assembly, allowing the liberal government of Charles Kingston to be formed, ousting the conservative government of John Downer. By the 1905 South Australian election Thomas Price became the first Labor Premier of South Australia. Re-elected at the 1906 double dissolution election serving until his death in 1909, it was the world's first stable Labour Party government. So successful, John Verran led Labor to form the state's first of many majority governments at the 1910 South Australian election. In 1899, Anderson Dawson formed a Labour minority government in Queensland, the first Labour Party government in the world, which lasted one week while the conservatives regrouped after a split. Labour candidates emerged in the late 19th century with much success, being a part of informal coalition governments from the early 1890s. The first Labour government in the world came in 1899 through Anderson Dawson, though it only lasted for a week. The first national Labour government in the world was that of Chris Watson in 1904, whose government lasted four months. Labour held the balance of power in the early years of federation, and was able to use it to secure the setting up of the protectionist system in Australia, and the passage of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, to set up a compulsory arbitration system in Australia. In the 1870s and 1880s, the trade union movement had organised a series of protests against \\"foreign\\" (by which was meant non-Anglo-Saxon) labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for \\"substandard\\" wages, lowered working conditions and refused unionisation. The movement gave support to the White Australia policy following federation, which involved the expulsion of the Kanakas (South Pacific islanders) and stopping all immigration of non- white people. A scandalised establishment, took measures to counter Labour's growing electoral dominance. Believing that an anti-socialist alliance was necessary, it pressured Deakin and Anti-Socialist Party's new leader, Joseph Cook, to begin merger talks. The main body of Protectionists, including Deakin and his supporters, merged with the Anti-Socialist Party in May 1909 to become the Commonwealth Liberal Party. The more liberal Protectionists joined Labour. The 1910 federal election was a straight two-party contest between Labour and the combined anti-Labour forces. The election delivered total victory to Labour under the leadership of Andrew Fisher. It delivered the first national Labour majority government in the world, the first national majority government in Australia, and the first Senate majority in Australia. The Fisher government was able to pass 113 Acts in the three years of the government, an unprecedented record, a period of reform unmatched in the Commonwealth up until that point. The Fisher government carried out many reforms dear to the labour movement in defence, constitutional matters, finance, transport and communications, and social security, such as establishing old-age and disability pensions, a maternity allowance and workers compensation, issuing Australia's first paper currency, forming the Royal Australian Navy, the commencement of construction for the Trans- Australian Railway, expanding the bench of the High Court of Australia, founding Canberra and establishing the government-owned Commonwealth Bank. The state branches formed their first majority governments in New South Wales and South Australia in 1910, in Western Australia in 1911, and in Queensland in 1915. Such success eluded equivalent social democratic and labour parties in other countries for many years.  World War I  The chief proponent of industrial unionism in Australia was the Industrial Workers of the World, which actively sought out conflicts with management. The IWW also acted on a political plane, opposing boyhood conscription, then the first world war. The Australian labour movement united around opposition to conscription, largely due to vocal opposition by the IWW and Catholic archbishop of Melbourne, Daniel Mannix. Two referendum proposals to introduce conscription by Labor Prime Minister Billy Hughes were defeated, making Australia and South Africa the only nations at war during the First World War not to introduce conscription. The Labor Governments of Hughes in the Federal sphere, and William Holman in New South Wales, were held in low regard by much of the labour movement due to their policies on military conscription. On 23 September 1916 twelve members of the IWW (most of them active organisers) were arrested and charged with treason under the Treason Felony Act (1848). As four buildings had been deliberately damaged by fire, the charge of arson was added to the charges. They became known as the Sydney Twelve with many unions and people in the labour movement actively campaigning for their release for several years. The Unlawful Associations Act (1916) was rushed through Federal Parliament in late December and the IWW was declared an illegal organisation. The IWW simply changed its name to Workers' Defence and Release Committee, and continued as normal. In late July 1917 the Act was amended resulting in any organisation or individual able to be easily proscribed. In return the IWW ran a 'free speech movement' campaign in which over 80 members in Sydney were sentenced to 6 months hard labour (the maximum) for simply proclaiming their membership, which was enough to scare many others away from open defiance. Those not born in Australia were subsequently deported at the end of their sentences, mostly to Chile. A chain of international protests about the Sydney Twelve IWW prisoners followed. (Sydney's Burning (An Australian Political Conspiracy)) At the end of the first world war in Australia there were a number of major industrial and political actions which threatened the stability of society. In Queensland counter-revolutionary and racist riots broke out in the Red Flag Riots, when it was made illegal to fly or wear the red flag, except as a sign of danger. The New South Wales General Strike of 1917 started on 2 August 1917, by railway workers over the introduction of the Taylor system of determining where work could be speeded-up. It was the most widespread labour upheaval since the 1890s, and ended when mining workers returned to work on 15 October 1917.  The 1920s  The Communist Party of Australia was formed in October 1920 by a group of Trades Hall radicals that included Jock Garden, the members of the illegal IWW, and members of earlier socialist organisations in Australia. The party achieved some influence in the trade union movement in New South Wales, but by the mid-1920s it had dwindled to an insignificant sect, and Garden and other communists were expelled from the Labor Party in 1924. However, the Communist Party began to win positions in particular trade unions, such as the Miners Federation and the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia. Strikes in this period were commonplace, and remained threatening to the Commonwealth government, which took measures to control union activity. In 1926 the federal Crimes Act was amended for the Act to apply to unions and in 1928 the Transport Workers Act 1928 (more commonly referred as the Dog Collar Act) was enacted, directed against the Waterside Workers' Federation. Of particular note is the 1923 Victorian Police strike. Trade union membership was 703,000 in 1921ACTU: History of unions and reached its peak in 1927, according to Green and Cromwell, when trade union membership \\"comprised less than 15 per cent of the whole population, only 47 per cent of the workforce.\\" In 1931 union membership was 769,000.  Depression and attacks on unions  After the Transport Workers Act 1928, more widely known as The Dog Collar Act,Parliament: The Vision in Hindsight, Geoffrey Lindell, R. L. Bennett was passed, the Australian union movement sought to protect itself by forming a permanent national trade union organisation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions. By this point the idea of trade unionism had won out over industrial unionism. This was in part encouraged by the industrial courts which freely gave registration to small, shop and trade- specific unions. While the Communist Party of Australia would always argue for industrial unions, the idea of industrial unions smouldered until the 1960s, and only received support from the ACTU and the ALP in the 1980s. The Dog Collar Act was used to break up strong unions, in forestry and on the docks. These unions were perceived to be revolutionary, or at least militant. At the same time the fragmented trade unions sought to maintain member conditions in an environment of massive unemployment. For instance, rates of male unemployment in the industrial city of Newcastle never dropped below 20% throughout the 1920s. When the Great Depression hit, formal unemployment rates rose above 30%. The 1929 Australian timber workers' strike was the first large strike during the depression when Justice Lukin handed down a new timber industry award that increased the working week from 44 to 48 hours and reduced wages. During the strike Lukin ordered a secret ballot to be held which was the first attempt to enforce a secret ballot in an industrial dispute. A 15-month lockout during 1929‚Äì1930 of miners on the northern New South Wales coalfields was particularly bitter. The Rothbury riot resulted in police shooting at miners, killing Norman Brown and seriously injuring many more. The trade union response to unemployment was not inspiring. Before the depression, some strong trade unions would provide welfare for unemployed members, and seek jobs for them. However, the depression rendered this system unworkable, where it existed at all. (Union welfare primarily existed in seasonal work with militant unions, like dock-working. It was precisely these unions that were attacked by the Dog Collar Act). In response to the depression, the remains of the IWW set up a union for the unemployed. This idea was quickly taken up by both the CPA and the ALP, both of which established associations (not organised as unions of workers) for the unemployed. The militance of unemployed workers who identified with the CPA or ALP, and the spirit of universal unionism which remained from the IWW, changed these movements of the unemployed into effective unions. The unemployed unions attacked local councils, and occasionally landlords, in order to win conditions. Infamously, a series of CPA inspired riots occurred against evictions in Newtown, Bankstown, Newcastle and Wollongong. The unemployed movements did not win significant employment, payment or condition victories for the unemployed workers. No future union of the unemployed would ever match the achievements of the unemployed unions of the 1930s. As Australia approached the Second World War, the Dalfram dispute of 1938 in Port Kembla showed that trade unions and workers were not afraid to take strike action on political issues, in this case the export of pig iron to a military aggressive Japan invading China. Although workers returned to work after 10 weeks and 2 days on strike, the Transport Workers Act of 1928 (The Dog Collar Act) had been shown to be ineffective when concerted action and solidarity was undertaken. Attorney General Robert Menzies earned his nickname of Pig Iron Bob during this dispute as a result of significant union protest.  World War II and after  World War II created a significant feeling of sympathy for the Soviet Union among Australian workers, and the CPA attempted to take advantage of this by industrial agitation after the war in the 1948 Queensland Railway strike and the 1949 Australian coal strike (the first time the military were used in peacetime to break a strike), and disputes on the waterfront and in the meat industry. This attempt to seize control of the union movement failed and was the start of the decline in communist leadership and influence in the labour movement. At the same time, agitation by Catholic organisations such as the National Civic Council (or Groupers) started setting up of Industrial Groups within unions to counter the influence of communists. The 1950s and 1960s period was generally one of industrial peace, dictated by preference agreements and closed shops. This period saw union membership keep pace with the growth of the workforce. The post war years saw the Australian labour movement support Indigenous Australians in their fight for human rights, cultural rights and native title, through supporting the 1946 Pilbara strike, The Gurindji Strike at Wave Hill in the Northern Territory, equal pay for aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, and support for the Noonkanbah people in their land rights dispute with the Western Australian Government over mining companies disturbing sacred sites.Reconciliation in the Community - How do we make it a reality? - Speech by Jennie George, ACTU President, in 1997 During the 1960s a number of militant unions became locked in contests with governments and employers. Governments relied on penal powers to keep union activists in line. The general strike over Clarrie O'Shea's imprisonment broke the government law and ushered in a period of rising union demands. These demands existed in a context of a general social radicalisation under Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser. The militant wave was broken by the Australian Labor Party's Prices and Incomes Accord in 1984 under Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke. After 1984 industrial militance declined, and a newly amalgamated trade union movement presided over falls in real wages. In the 1985 Mudginberri dispute and the 1986 Dollar Sweets dispute employer organisations such as the National Farmers Federation successfully backed legal sanctions to defeat union industrial action. The 1989 Australian pilots' strike saw the Federal Labor Government using RAAF planes and pilots to break industrial action by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, taken outside the Prices and Incomes Accord. During the Hawke Labor Government in the 1980s, Australia experienced a push for economic reform encompassing deregulation of a number of previously regulated markets, including the labour market. This was first pursued by the Keating Labor Government in 1991, through the Enterprise Bargaining Agreements introduced into Australia under the Prices and Incomes Accord in 1991 (Mark VII). They later became the centrepiece of the Australian industrial relations system when the Accord was next revised in 1993 (Mark VIII). This ended nearly a century of centralised wage-fixing based industrial relations. Under the post-1996 Howard Liberal Government, increasing pressure was brought to bear on industrial relations reforms, aiming to reduce the industrial power of Australian trade unions. This included the introduction of Australian Workplace Agreements ‚Äî individual contractual agreements on pay and conditions between an employee and employer ‚Äî and the reduction of minimum conditions contained in Industrial awards. One of the first targets of the conservative Government was to undermine the power of the Maritime Union of Australia, through breaking its closed shop on waterfront labour. The 1998 Australian waterfront dispute resulted with stevedoring firm, Patrick Corporation under CEO Chris Corrigan, attempting to sack its entire waterfront workforce of 1400 people through company restructuring. The Australian Council of Trade Unions condemned the sacking as a gross act of collusion between Patrick, the Government, and the National Farmers Federation, and with the threat of legal action against the Government and Patrick Corporation, a settlement was negotiated to allow some reform with the MUA retaining its effective closed shop. When the Howard Liberal Government won an unexpected Senate majority at the 2004 election, despite not being part of their election manifesto they took the opportunity to introduce WorkChoices, a decision which would ultimately seal their fate at the 2007 election.  WorkChoices  A view of the rally in La Trobe Street, Melbourne, giving an indication of the size of the crowd After the Howard Liberal Government's 2004 election victory, and with a majority in the Senate from 1 July 2005, changes to industrial laws to further reduce the collective bargaining power of trade unions continued. In May 2005 the Howard Government announced its Industrial Relations changes known as WorkChoices. This legislation received widespread criticism from the Australian union movement, many religious and community groups and, significantly (but not widely reported), the International Labour Organization, of which Australia is a member. On 30 June 2005, up to 100,000 people marched through Melbourne in opposition to the proposed industrial relations changes, with meetings also held in capital cities and regional towns around Australia. On 15 November 2005, the ACTU organised a national day of protest, during which the ACTU estimated 546,000 people took part in marches and protests in Australia's state capitals and other cities. The rallies were addressed by State premiers and religious leaders. Other notable Australians, including former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, also spoke in opposition to the industrial relations changes. John Howard said that the protests will not change his policy and employer groups estimated that 95% of the workforce did not attend. The Bill was passed by the Senate, with minor amendments, by a vote of 35-33 on 2 December 2005 and received the Royal Assent on 14 December. Following the defeat of the Howard Liberal government at the 2007 federal election, the Rudd Labor government moved quickly to outlaw Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs) besides other changes. WorkChoices legislation was superseded by the Fair Work Act 2009 on 1 July 2009 which, whilst seen as an improvement for workers, has attracted criticism from industry experts, the Australian Greens Party and organised labour, especially the Victorian Branch of the Electrical Trades Union. In May 2009 the findings of a secret report on the new legislation, commissioned by the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), were revealed. The report found that \\"the act does not bring our laws into compliance with ILO standards\\".In an article of The Australian, 23 May 2009 Geoff Borenstein, an in-house solicitor of the ETU stated that the Fair Work legislation breaches ILO conventions regarding the right to strike, industrial action generally and restrictions on the content of industrial instruments (awards, collective agreements &c;). Professor Ron McCallum of the University of Sydney asserts that the new legislation will \\"probably\\" be deemed a breach of international law by the International Labour Organization, particularly in regards to ILO Conventions 87 and 98.

Career Youth and amateur Pickens initially attended Meramec Community College before playing college soccer for Missouri State University from 2000 to 2003. He also played for Chicago Fire Premier in the USL Premier Development League. Professional Matt Pickens after a match at Houston Dynamo 2010 Upon graduating, Pickens was drafted 19th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by the Fire. He was not able, however, to break through a deep lineup of Fire goalkeepers, which initially included Henry Ring and D.J. Countess, and later Zach Thornton. He was loaned out for much of the year to the A-League Virginia Beach Mariners, where he played 290 minutes, conceding only 3 goals. During the latter half of 2006, after an injury to Zach Thornton, Pickens started in goal for the Fire even once Thornton was match fit again. This also included his first play-off start on October 22, 2006 for the Fire, keeping a clean sheet in a game that the Fire won, 1-0 thanks to a goal from Justin Mapp in the 35th minute. Zach Thornton was traded to the Colorado Rapids before the 2007 season, clearing the way for Pickens to start. In February 2008, Pickens signed a deal with Queens Park Rangers until the end of the 2008 season. In May 2008, it was announced that Pickens would not have his contact extended and that he would be released by the club at the end of June. Pickens tried out with numerous clubs in England and Scotland after his release, including Hibernian, Doncaster Rovers, Falkirk and Nottingham Forest, the latter of which he claims he was close to signing with. However, despite not securing a new contract in Europe, Chicago Fire traded Pickens rights to Colorado Rapids on January 15, 2009 and was signed by the club shortly after. Pickens was released early in the 2014 season. After Pickens was released by Colorado Rapids in early 2014 New England Revolution acquired him in the waiver draft. Soon after signing with New England, Pickens was sold to Tampa Bay Rowdies in the North American Soccer League. On November 30, 2017 Nashville SC announced Pickens as the club's first signing ahead of their inaugural 2018 season in United Soccer League. International As of December 2010, Pickens has been called up to five United States training camps, including the camp in January 2011. However, he has never earned a national cap or been part of the final 18-man roster.

The town was a company town established by U. S. Vanadium Corporation in 1936 to extract the rich vanadium ore in the region. As a byproduct of vanadium extraction, small amounts of uranium were also produced, at the time mostly used as a yellow pigment. The town was located approximately south-southwest of Grand Junction along the San Miguel River. At one time, over 800 people lived in Uravan, and the town housed a school, a trading center (store), medical facilities, tennis courts, a recreation center, and a pool. The school and some other facilities remained operational until at least 1983, however Uravan was shut down by mid-1985, and no trace of its former buildings remain. History Prehistoric There are several prehistoric sites near Uravan on the Colorado State Register of Historic Properties:National & State Registers. Colorado Historical Society, Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation. Retrieved 10-8-2011. * Dolores Cave was inhabited from about 600 BC to AD 1400. A corn cob dated about AD 1500 was found in the site, which indicates that corn was grown in the area after the Ancient Pueblo People (Anasazi) abandoned their Colorado pueblos in the 13th century. * Tabeguache Cave II is a large prehistoric rock shelter occupied from about AD 600 - 1500. There is also a Tabeguache Cave and two other rock shelters near Nucla, Colorado. Gold In 1885, placer gold was discovered in a tributary of the San Miguel River, Mesa Creek, nine miles from Ouray. The Montrose Placer Mining Company constructed the Hanging Flume on the east wall of Dolores River Canyon.Voynick, S.M., 1992, Colorado Gold, Missoula: Mountain Press Publishing Company, 20th century uranium mining During World War II, Uravan provided part of the uranium needed by the Manhattan Project for the first atomic bomb. Because of wartime secrecy the Manhattan Project would only publicly admit to purchasing the vanadium, and did not pay the uranium miners for the uranium ore (in a much later lawsuit, many miners were able to reclaim lost profits from the U.S. government). Holding ponds for uranium processing (1972) In the beginning of the Cold War, to ensure adequate supplies of uranium for national defense, the United States Congress passed the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1946, creating the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) which had the power to withdraw prospective uranium mining land from public purchase, and also to manipulate the price of uranium to meet national needs. By setting a high price for uranium ore, the AEC created a uranium \\"boom\\" in the early 1950s, which attracted many prospectors to the four corners region of the country. Uravan's fortunes grew as it became one of the major \\"yellowcake towns\\" in the region. American military requirements of uranium declined in the 1960s, and the government completed its uranium procurement program by the end of 1970. Simultaneously, a new market emerged: commercial nuclear power plants. However, the U.S. domestic uranium mining industry collapsed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, due to lack of new nuclear power plants, and to low-price uranium imported from Canada. The town had been in decline for several years; the decision was made to close Uravan in 1985 and then commence a large-scale clean-up of the entire site. Environmental cleanup of the site commenced in 1986 and was essentially completed by 2001. (EPA, 2010, Five-Year Review) All the buildings have been removed and the site regraded and replanted.

At the , Bundanoon had a population of 2,729. It is an Aboriginal name meaning \\"place of deep gullies\\" and was formerly known as Jordan's Crossing. Bundanoon is colloquially known as Bundy/Bundi. Bundanoon, like its fellow Southern Villages of the Southern Highlands, has had a boom- and-bust economic cycle. The town became a well-known tourist destination early in the 20th century; its picturesqueness and the scenery of what is now Morton National Park, combined with being served by the railway network, made it a pleasant and convenient holiday area for city dwellers who could not afford more expensive accommodations at the popular Blue Mountains resort area. By the 1950s, however, changes in lifestyle, particularly the affordability of the motor car, gave city dwellers more options and Bundanoon declined. The Sydney real estate boom of the early 21st century made Bundanoon an affordable haven within commuting distance of the city. Property values increased several-fold, and houses in Bundanoon were selling for over a million dollars by 2007. Several houses in the town were destroyed by a bushfire in January 2020. Population The recorded 2,729 people living in Bundanoon. The town's population was significantly older than the general population: their median age was 56 years, 18 years older than the national median age of 38. Children aged under 15 made up 13.8% of the population (fewer than the national average of 18.7%) and people aged 65 years and over made up 36.0% of the population (more than double the national average of 15.8%). This is reflected in the low workforce participation, with only 1,078 of the 2,729 people reporting themselves as being in the labour force. Of these, 49.6% were employed full-time, 41.7% were employed part-time and 4.2% were unemployed. 76.6% of people living in Bundanoon were born in Australia; the next most common countries of birth were England 8.7%, New Zealand 1.4%, and Germany 1.1%. 92.5% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 29.4%, Anglican 27.4% and Catholic 18.7%. Annual events * Brigadoon Highland Gathering - every April (established 1977) - attracts Scottish participants and tourists from around the world. * Garden Ramble - every October (established 1996) * Bundanoon hosts the Sydney Gilbert & Sullivan Opera every spring over 1 x weekend. Performances are a sellout at the Soldiers'Memorial Hall and are a much loved annual event. Churches Anglican: Part of the Sutton Forest parish. In 1879, Holy Trinity Anglican church was built on its present site. (The timber church was destroyed by bushfire in December 1904; rebuilt in stone in 1905.) Catholic: Part of the parish of St Paul's in Moss Vale. St Brigid's Catholic Church was built in 1895. Prior to that, Roman Catholic services were conducted at Sutton Forest. Uniting: Part of the Moss Vale‚ÄìBundanoon‚ÄìRobertson parish. By 1870 the Primitive Methodist Church was established on the corner where the Soldiers‚Äô Memorial Hall now stands. The Primitive Methodists moved to a new building in 1885 (now the Uniting Church) and leased the original site to shop owners. School Bundanoon Public School was established in 1871 and had an enrolment of 191 students as at 2016. The Primitive Methodist Church hall served as the first school, with Mrs Dinah Osborne as teacher. A new school of two rooms was built in 1880 and is still used as the school library. Transport Bundanoon railway station is located on the Southern Highlands line. Most services terminate at Moss Vale, meaning Bundanoon only receives limited services. Sydney to Canberra services also stop at the station. Local bus services are provided by Berrima Bus Lines. On the day of the , 4.1% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 65.3% by car (either as driver or as passenger). Sport *Rugby League ‚Äì Bundanoon has a rugby league team currently playing in the Second Division competition of Group 6. Heritage listings Bundanoon has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Main Southern railway: Bundanoon railway station  History  Ban on bottled water In July 2009 \\"Bundy on Tap\\", a community initiative in Bundanoon, declared itself opposed to the sale of bottled drinking water on environmental grounds; local businesses instead committed themselves to filling re-usable bottles with tap water on request. The issue of bottled water was to protest against companies Norlex and Coca-Cola (that owns Australian bottled water brands Neverfail and Mount Franklin) extracting water from the town's groundwater.  2020 Bushfire  In January 2020 the town was affected by a bushfire during the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season. Several homes were destroyed.

The character Nasrudin Hod≈æa is popular throughout the former lands of the Ottoman Empire, and Sarajevo is no exception. Numerous stories about him dealing with the city have been written over the years. A famous piece of Sarajevo folklore is the story of the Orthodox Church. It was said that when a request came to build it, authorities required that it be no higher than the tallest minaret in Sarajevo. A wise old man was then said to have advised that the church be built into the ground. Thus the building reached a proper height but met the restrictions. Numerous other famous bits of Sarajevo folklore survive representing many different eras of Sarajevo's history. One of the earliest is the story of the Goat's Bridge. As the story goes, an old goat herder was tending his goats by the river Miljacka when one of them started ferociously digging at a certain spot of the ground. Mystified, he walked over for a closer look only to find numerous sacks of gold. With the gold, he then built a great bridge over the river that would for years be the main crossing for travelers on their way to Istanbul. Far more recent is the story of Sarajevo's Romeo and Juliet. During the Serbian siege of Sarajevo the couple of a young Serb boy and Bosniak girl decided to flee the city. They got as far as the Sniper Alley's \\"no man's land\\" before the boy was shot dead and the girl wounded by the Serbs. Rather than flee alone however, she turned to stay by her lover's side, where she too eventually died. This is not a myth; their names were Bo≈°ko Brkiƒá and Admira Ismiƒá, and they died on the Vrbanja bridge in May 1993.http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/Bosnia/updates/9604/10/ References Category:Culture in Sarajevo Category:European folklore Category:Slavic mythology ","title":"Folklore of Sarajevo"},{"id":"1116408","text":"Museo del Ciclismo at the top of the Madonna del Ghisallo. Madonna del Ghisallo is a hill in Magreglio, close to Lake Como in Italy. It is named after an alleged Marian apparition. According to the legend, the Medieval count Ghisallo was travelling by the hamlet of Magr√©glio when he was attacked by bandits. He saw an image of Virgin Mary at a shrine, ran to it and was saved from the robbers. The apparition became known as La Madonna del Ghisallo, and she became a patroness of local travellers. In later times, the hill Madonna del Ghisallo was made part of the Giro di Lombardia bicycle race and has often featured in the Giro d'Italia as well.Atkins, Ben. \\"La Madonna del Ghisallo ‚Äì the Patron Saint of Cycling\\", Cycling News, October 17, 2008 The church sits atop a steep hill that climbs up from the shores of Lake Como. It became a natural stopping point for cyclists.Cooper, Jonny. \\"My pilgrimage to the Patron Saint of Cycling\\", The Telegraph, August 22, 2014 For this reason a local priest, Father Ermelindo Vigano, proposed that La Madonna del Ghisallo be declared the patroness of cyclists. This was confirmed by Pope Pius XII. Nowadays the shrine of Madonna del Ghisallo contains a small cycling museum with photos and artifacts from the sport. There also burns an eternal flame for cyclists who have died. One particularly notable artifact is the crumpled bicycle that Fabio Casartelli, a native of the region, rode on the day that he died in a crash in the Tour de France. The church is home to many bikes and cycling jerseys used by cyclists in races. The Fondazione Museo del Ciclismo-Madonna del Ghisallo was created in 2000. Its first action was to organize a torch relay from the chapel to the Vatican, delivering the torch to the then Pope John Paul II. In 2010 a bike museum, the Museo del Ciclismo, opened nearby. The Colle del Ghisallo is a mountain pass road that connects the upper part of Valassina Larian Triangle. The point of the pass, at an altitude of 754 m above sea level, is located near Magreglio.

It breeds colonially on islands off the coasts of California and Mexico, and is one of six species of storm petrel that live and feed in the rich California Current system. Taxonomy The ashy storm petrel was first described by American ornithologist Elliott Coues in 1864. Both its common and scientific name, homochroa, \\"uniformly colored\\", from Ancient Greek (h)omoia (œåŒºŒøŒπŒ±), \\"alike\\" + \\"chroma\\" (œáœÅœéŒºŒ±) \\"color\\", come from its coloration. Description and ecology This is a small, uniformly sooty-brown storm petrel with a forked tail, closely resembling the black storm petrel, however it is smaller and has a more fluttering style of flight, with the upstroke only becoming horizontal to the body before beginning the downstroke (other storm-petrels in its range have a higher upstroke). It is a gregarious bird at sea, feeding nocturnally on cephalopods, fish (particularly the deep sea myctophids, which rise to the sea's surface at night) and euphausiid krill such as Thysanoessa spinifera, which also swarm at the surface. They will also attend fishing vessels for the fish oils released when the nets are pulled. Egg (coll.MHNT) Ashy storm petrels nest in rock burrows on offshore islands, returning to the nests at night. The species has a long breeding cycle, laying eggs in May and fledging in October, although timing varies greatly, more so than in most other storm petrels: some pairs may have a chick that is half grown when other pairs are still laying. Like in many other seabirds, pairs show both mate and site fidelity, mating in the same pair with the same mate for many years and nesting at the same burrow, despite the pairs spending their lives out of the breeding season separate from each other, and despite the fact that many individuals might seem to compete for burrows at the nesting colonies. A change in mate is usually associated with a change in nesting site. The ashy storm petrel is a long-lived bird; a banded individual has lived at least 31 years. Distribution, status and threats Ashy storm petrels breed on 17 islands in the northeast Pacific, principally off the coast of California, but including a few sites off the coast of northwestern Mexico. Half the world's population nests on the Farallon Islands near San Francisco. Other breeding islands include the eight Channel Islands of California and a small population on Mexico's Coronados. Bat Cave, on the north side of Santa Cruz Island in southern California, has the largest nesting colony for the ashy storm-petrel in the world, with over 100 nests. Outside of the breeding season it is believed to be more widely distributed, foraging on the California Current, but it undertakes no large migration and doesn't range as far as other species of storm-petrel. In the early fall large flocks can be seen in Monterey Bay. The birds do not range inland any significant distance except when storm-blown; for example a sighting in San Mateo County, California was considered \\"unusual\\" by an experienced naturalist. The world population is estimated to be around 10,000 birds, 8,000 of them breeders, the Farallon population having declined by one third between 1972 and 1992. The ashy storm petrel is designated as a species of conservation concern in California. It is threatened by western gull and burrowing owl predation, illumination from fishing boats, introduced predators such as rats and feral cats, and pollution. Most of the islands that it breeds on are covered by some degree of protection. Global warming could have a profound impact on the ashy storm petrel. Future changes to coastal California waters due to global warming could result in warmer, less productive waters, which would mean there would be less food available for the petrels. In addition, ocean acidification may result in a decline of crustacean prey species due to the effects that excess CO2 will have on the animals' shells. Sea-level rise will also threaten certain nesting sites that are located too close to the water. References Further reading * Ainley, D. (1995): Ashy Storm Petrel (Oceanodroma homochroa).

Family Henry was the second son of Margrave Leopold III of Austria, the first from his second marriage with Agnes of Waiblingen, a sister of the last Salian emperor, Henry V. Leopold himself was expected to stand as a candidate in the 1125 election as king of Germany; nevertheless, he renounced in favour of his half-brother, the Hohenstaufen duke Frederick II of Swabia, who eventually lost against Lothair of Supplinburg. Among Henry's younger brothers were Bishop Otto of Freising and Archbishop Conrad II of Salzburg. His sister Judith became the wife of Marquess William V of Montferrat. Henry's nickname, Jasomirgott, was first documented during the 13th century in the form of Jochsamergott, the meaning of which is unclear. According to one theory, it was derived from a spoofed Arab word bearing a connection to the Second Crusade in which Henry participated in 1147. According to popular etymology, it is derived from the Middle High German form of the oath joch sam mir got helfe (meaning: \\"Yes, so help me God\\"). Reign When Margrave Leopold III died in 1136, he was succeeded by his third-born son Leopold IV, probably because Henry already administered the Rhenish possessions of his mother's now-extinct Salian dynasty. In April 1140, the Hohenstaufen king Conrad III of Germany enfeoffed him with the County Palatine of the Rhine, which he ruled for only a short time as he was appointed Bavarian duke and margrave of Austria when his younger brother Leopold IV unexpectedly died in October 1141. Leopold had received the Duchy of Bavaria in 1139, after King Conrad had deposed Duke Henry the Proud in the course of the dispute between the Welf and Hohenstaufen dynasties. Henry took his residence in the Bavarian capital of Regensburg (Ratisbona). In May 1142 he married Gertrude, daughter of Emperor Lothair and widow of Henry the Proud. She died after less than one year, giving birth to her only child with Henry. Henry II on the Second Crusade, Babenberg Pedigree, Klosterneuburg Monastery (1489‚Äì1492) The duke remained a loyal follower of the Hohenstaufens and in May 1147 accompanied King Conrad on the Second Crusade. When they suffered a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Dorylaeum against the Seljuk Turks in October, Henry narrowly escaped together with Conrad's nephew, young Frederick Barbarossa. Later on, he attended the Council of Acre along with king Conrad III and Frederick Barbarossa, then the Siege of Damascus. On their way home, Henry stayed at the court of the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos, where he married his niece Theodora in late 1148. Elected king of Germany in 1152, Frederick Barbarossa tried to reach a compromise with the Welfs and endowed Henry the Lion, son of the late Henry the Proud, with the Duchy of Bavaria in 1156. A replacement duchy had to be found for the Babenberg family, which was accomplished by the Privilegium Minus, through which Frederick elevated Henry's Margraviate of Austria to a duchy with complete independence from Bavaria. Unlike his father, who had resided in Klosterneuburg most of the time, Henry moved his Austrian residence to Vienna in 1145. Only by this act could Vienna surpass other cities within the duchy, such as Krems, Melk, and Klosterneuburg. Since then, it has remained the capital of the country. In addition, in 1147 the first St. Stephen's Church was completed, becoming a visible landmark for the city and showing its prominence. In 1155, Henry founded the Schottenstift monastery in Vienna, in the courtyard of which a statue of him stands to this day. In November 1176, while his Austrian lands were campaigned by the forces of Duke Sobƒõslav II of Bohemia, Henry II with his horse fell from a rotten bridge near Melk and suffered a femoral neck fracture. Henry II succumbed to his injuries on 13 January 1177 in Vienna. According to his last will, he was buried in the Schottenstift monastery. Marriage and children Until 1143, Henry II was married to Gertrude of S√ºpplingenburg, the daughter of Emperor Lothair II. In 1148 he married Theodora Komnene, niece of the Byzantine emperor Manuel I. Both marriages were an expression of the importance of the Babenberg dynasty in Central Europe in that period. Henry had one child by Gertrude of S√ºpplingenburg: * Richenza (1143 ‚Äì unknown), married to Heinrich Landgraf von Steffling Henry had three children by Theodora Komnene: *Agnes of Austria ( ‚Äì 13 January 1182), married to King Stephen III of Hungary, secondly married to Duke Herman of Carinthia *Leopold V, Duke of Austria (1157 ‚Äì 31 December 1194) *Henry I, Duke of M√∂dling (1158 ‚Äì 31 August 1223), married Richeza, daughter of Duke Vladislav II of Bohemia.

It was compiled to commemorate the group's 30th anniversary of their formation. The idea was to bridge their two eras on one CD: the James William Guercio and Columbia Records period of the 1970s, and the David Foster and Warner Bros. Records period of the 1980s. In addition, the band added two new songs, \\"The Only One\\" produced by Lenny Kravitz and \\"Here in My Heart\\" by James Newton Howard. Both of these new tracks were successful in the adult contemporary market; \\"Here in My Heart\\" topped the AC charts, and \\"The Only One\\" was a top 20 AC hit. While the album was certified gold following its April 1997 release, many critics and fans disapproved of the concept, finding the distinct styles of both decades clashing with each other, and with the lack of many significant hits (i.e. \\"25 or 6 to 4\\", \\"Call on Me\\", and \\"What Kind of Man Would I Be?\\") detracting from the album's enjoyment. To balance this out, a second album, The Heart of Chicago 1967‚Äì1998 Volume II was released the following year to fill in the missing gaps that were left in the first one.

Moravian proskynesis in 1735. Proskynesis or proscynesis , or proskinesis (Greek , prosk√Ωnƒìsis; Latin adoratio) an act of solemn expression of respect for the gods and people; among the Persians, it was that a man prostrated himself and kissed the earth, kissed the arms or legs of a respected person. Proskynesis (adoratio) was one of the religious rites of the Greeks and Romans. In the Byzantine ceremonial it is a common gesture of supplication or reverence. The physical act ranged from full prostration to a genuflection, a bow, or a simple greeting and concretized the relative positions of performer and beneficiary within a hierarchical order (taxis).The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium : in 3 vol. / ed. by Dr. Alexander Kazhdan. ‚Äî N. Y. ; Oxford : Oxford University Press, 1991. ‚Äî 2232 p. ‚Äî . ‚Äî Third volume, P. 1738 Etymology The Greek word is derived from the verb œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫œÖŒΩŒ≠œâ, proskyneo, itself formed from the compound words œÄœÅœåœÇ, pros (towards) and Œ∫œÖŒΩŒ≠œâ, kyneo ([I] kiss).,,,. It describes an attitude of humbling, submission, or worship adoration ‚Äì particularly towards a sovereign ruler, God or the gods. Practice According to Herodotus in his Histories, a person of equal rank received a kiss on the lips, someone of a slightly lower rank gave a kiss on the cheek, and someone of a very inferior social standing had to completely bow down to the other person before them. To the Greeks, giving proskynesis to a mortal seemed to be a barbaric and ludicrous practice. Applications This may have led some Greeks to believe that the Persians worshipped their king as a god, the only Persian that received proskynesis from everyone, and other misinterpretations caused cultural conflicts. Alexander the Great proposed this practice during his lifetime, in adapting to the customs of the Persian cities he conquered, but it failed to find acceptance amongst his Greek companions (an example can be found in the court historian, Callisthenes) - and in the end, he did not insist on the practice. Most of his men could cope with Alexander‚Äôs interest for having a Persian wardrobe, but honouring the king as if he was a god by performing proskynesis went a bit too far.Alexander III and proskynesis: an affair According to Arrian, Callisthenes explains the existence of separated ways of honouring a god or a human and that prostration is a way to explicitly honour gods. It is seen as a threat to the Greeks, ‚Äòwho are men most devoted to freedom‚Äô. According to Callisthenes, prostration is a foreign and degrading fashion. The emperor Diocletian (AD 284-305) is usually thought to have introduced the practice to the Roman Empire, forming a break with the Republican institutions of the principate, which preserved the form, if not the intent, of republican government. However, there is some evidence that an informal form of proskynesis was already practiced at the court of Septimius Severus.Frank Kolb, Herrscherideologie in der Sp√§tantike. Review by Chris Epplett, Bryn Mawr Classical Review, 2002.07.02. The political reason for this change was to elevate the role of the emperor from \\"first citizen\\" to an otherworldly ruler, remote from his subjects, thus reducing the likelihood of successful revolt, which had plagued the Empire during the preceding 50 years. Certain forms of proskynesis, such as those which entailed kissing the emperor‚Äôs breast, hands, or feet, were reserved to specific categories of officials. Audience granted to native or foreign delegations included multiple series of proskynesis at points marked by porphyry disks (omphalia) set in the floor. Until the 10th century, at least, imperial ceremonial avoided proskynesis on Sundays out of reverence for the divinity. As a form of loyalty display, proskynesis had strong political overtones; it recurs in imperial iconography and its importance in imperial ceremonial could sometimes raise delicate diplomatic dilemmas when foreign potentates were involved.The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium : in 3 vol. / ed. by Dr. Alexander Kazhdan. ‚Äî N. Y. ; Oxford : Oxford University Press, 1991. ‚Äî 2232 p. ‚Äî . ‚Äî T. 3, P. 1738 Similarly, the emperor was hailed no longer as \\"Imp(erator)\\" on coins, which meant \\"commander in chief\\" but as \\"D(ominus) N(oster)\\" - \\"Our Lord.\\" With the conversion of Constantine I to Christianity, proskynesis became part of an elaborate ritual, whereby the emperor became God's vice-gerent on earth.John Julius Norwich Titular inflation also affected the other principal offices of the Empire. Justinian I and Theodora both insisted on an extreme form of proskynesis, even from members of the Roman Senate,Mitchell, Stephen. (2007) A History of the later Roman Empire AD 284-641: The Transformation of the Ancient World. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 228. and they were attacked for it by Procopius in his Secret History.Procopius, Secret History 30, 21-30. In Christianity The verb œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫œÖŒΩŒ≠œâ (proskyneo) is often used in the Septuagint and New Testament for the worship of pagan gods or the worship of the God of Israel. In addition, this word for in some cases used for the worship of angels. The question of the admissibility of proskynesis in relation to icons (bowing and kissing to icons) was raised in the 8th century, during the period of iconoclasm. Opponents of proskynesis in relation to the icons referred to the second commandment of the Law of Moses. It specifically states the following: \\"You shall not make for yourself a carved image any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down (œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫œÖŒΩŒÆœÉŒµŒπœÇ) to them nor serve (ŒªŒ±œÑœÅŒµœçœÉ·øÉœÇ) them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God.\\" One of the defenders of proskynesis in relation to the icons was John of Damascus. He wrote \\"Three Treatises on the Divine Images\\" in defense of the icons, in which he described several kinds of proskynesis. The first kind is the proskynesis of latreia (ŒªŒ±œÑœÅŒµŒØŒ±), which people give to God, who alone is adorable by nature. John believed that only the first kind of proskynesis associated with latreia was forbidden by God. Other kinds of proskynesis: proskynesis performed in relation to saints and proskynesis performed in relation to images of saints (icons) are permitted by God.PG 94. / col. 1237, œõ; col. 1245, Œπœõ \\"Greetings and respected proskynesis\\" (; ) for icons was established by the Second Council of Nicaea (Seventh Ecumenical Council) in 787.Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio.

According to legend, the aspro comes to the surface only in bad weather, when other fishes take refuge near the bottom. This trait gave rise to its nickname, \\"Sorcerer.\\" Aspro was laid down on 27 December 1942 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 7 April 1943; sponsored by Mrs. William L. Freseman; and commissioned on 31 July 1943, Lieutenant Commander Harry Clinton Stevenson in command. World War II Aspro held shakedown training in the waters off Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Newport, Rhode Island; and New London, Connecticut. After completing her tests and trial runs, she sailed on 17 September for Pearl Harbor. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 18 October and immediately began preparations for her first war patrol which would take her to waters around Formosa and Sakishima Gunto.  First war patrol, November 1943 ‚Äì January 1944  She departed Hawaii on 24 November and made a brief fuel stop at Midway Atoll on 28 November before proceeding to her assigned area. On 15 December, she spotted a Japanese convoy consisting of one tanker, two freighters, and two escorts. The submarine fired torpedoes at the tanker and claimed a hit, but apparently failed to inflict serious damage. Her next chance came on the night of 17‚Äì18 December, when she spotted a convoy of 15 Japanese ships. At 22:26, Aspro fired her stern tubes at a large tanker and an adjacent freighter. The submarine then made an end around run and attacked again. She claimed to have witnessed three vessels sinking, one severely crippled ship being taken under tow, and two other vessels having been damaged. Aspro escaped counterattack by the Japanese destroyer . With only one torpedo left, she returned to Midway on 1 January 1944, terminating her patrol after 39 days at sea. Postwar analysis failed to substantiate any of the sinkings, crediting her with damaging fleet tankers Sarawak Maru and Tenei Maru. During the course of the patrol, Stevenson had noticed his eyesight was growing progressively weaker. Therefore, after arriving at Midway, he underwent an eye examination and was disqualified for sea duty. He then suggested that his brother, Lt. Comdr. William A. Stevenson, relieve him. This recommendation was approved, and the change took place on 15 January 1944.  Second war patrol, January ‚Äì March 1944  Following a refit Aspro departed Midway on 15 January and proceeded to Pearl Harbor to undergo brief training before heading back to Midway on 3 February en route to her second patrol. This assignment took her to an area north of Truk, as part of Operation Hailstone. On 15 February at 11:21, she spotted a large Japanese submarine, which was later identified as . After a long surface pursuit, Aspro drew within range of I-43, and at 22:23 fired four torpedoes. Her crew saw and heard an explosion, followed shortly by another. They then saw her target's bow rise as the victim sank by her stern at . This was Aspros first confirmed sinking.Blair, Clay, Jr. Silent Victory (Bantam, 1976), p.647. On 17 February, she underwent a depth charge attack, but suffered no damage. Aspro torpedoed a freighter on 4 March, and the subsequent explosion shook the submarine violently. However, the Japanese vessel was merely damaged, not sunk. The rest of this patrol passed uneventfully, and Aspro retired to Pearl Harbor on 28 March after 54 days at sea.  Third war patrol, April ‚Äì June 1944  Aspro carried out her third patrol near the Palau Islands. After refitting she got underway on 22 April and headed west. Following a brief stop at Midway for supplies four days later, she continued on to waters around the Palau Islands. On 14 May, the submarine encountered a convoy of two freighters protected by three escorts. At 05:54, she fired a spread of torpedoes at one freighter and, one and one-half hours later, saw the damaged ship lying dead in the water and sinking by the stern. At the end of two hours of intermittent observation, this ship later disappeared from sight. The next day, Aspro attacked one of the escorts of the same convoy and heard one explosion. The submarine's crew watched from the bridge as the target sank. Aspro remained on patrol for another month before reaching Fremantle, Western Australia, on 16 June. There, she was officially credited with sinking one ship and assisting in destroying another for a total loss of 8,650 tons of Japanese shipping. {May 15, 1944 the Sinking ship \\"Jokuja Maru\\" 6,440 tons was sunk at 10.10N 131.25E}  Fourth war patrol, July ‚Äì August 1944  The submarine spent two weeks undergoing a refit before beginning her fourth patrol on 9 July. After pausing at Darwin, Northern Territory on 16 July to top off her fuel tanks, she proceeded to the South China Sea. Shortly thereafter, on 19 July, Aspro found a convoy of four medium-sized ships in company with five escort vessels off the west coast of Luzon and fired her torpedoes at 05:45 and heard a series of explosions. As a result of this, she claimed to have sunk one ship and damaged a second. The next day, the submarine fired torpedoes at a member of a three-ship convoy, but all apparently missed. On 28 July, Aspro sighted an anchored ship flying a Japanese flag and launched a spread of torpedoes. The submarine heard three explosions, and her target emitted heavy smoke amidships and began listing to starboard and settling by the bow. The vessel became a mass of flames, and her fires continued to rage as Aspro withdrew from the area. A week later, she encountered the moored ship again ‚Äî hard aground, listing to starboard, and completely gutted by fire. Two large holes in the hull at the waterline were visible. {This was the transport \\"Peking Maru\\" of 2,288 tons at 17.33N 120.21E} On 6 August, the submarine spotted two Japanese freighters and opened fire at 10:16. One of these ships was later seen to be listing 15 degrees to port, but still underway. The next day, Aspro attacked a 12-ship convoy. Her torpedoes hit a large freighter which sagged in the middle and started to settle. Following this action, Aspro continued her patrol uneventfully before returning to Fremantle on 18 August.  Fifth war patrol, September ‚Äì October 1944  On 10 September, Aspro sailed for her fifth patrol which took her back to the South China Sea. While still in transit to the patrol area, she found her first targets on 30 September off the northeast coast of Luzon where she met a convoy of seven or eight vessels protected by four escorts. She torpedoed and heavily damaged a freighter. Two days later, she attacked a tanker and heard breaking-up noises for 10‚Äì15 minutes. Through her periscope, she saw her victim listing to starboard with her bow high in the air. Soon Aspro lost sight of the ship and claimed to have sunk her. About an hour later, Aspro attacked another freighter in the same convoy. The ship was seen sinking in a vertical dive, stern first. {The Oct 2, 1944 credit was the cargo \\"Azuchisan Maru\\" of 6,888 tons at 18.25M 120.32E} Following this action, Aspro rendezvoused with and to form a wolf pack. On 7 October, Hoe spotted a large convoy consisting of about a dozen ships. At 04:55, Aspro fired four torpedoes at a freighter and witnessed the ship's sinking. {This was the Passenger-cargo \\"Macassar Maru\\" of 4,026 tons at 17.54N 119.57E}. Shortly thereafter, she terminated her patrol at Saipan on 14 October and then proceeded to Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 25 October.  Sixth war patrol, November 1944 ‚Äì February 1945  Aspro departed Pearl Harbor on 21 November and headed for Saipan. On 28 November, her No. 1 main generator threw a banding wire off the rotor, necessitating a replacement of the armature. Such repairs required her return to Pearl Harbor. After a week's work there, Aspro got underway on 13 December for her sixth war patrol. She was assigned lifeguard duties west of Taiwan to support carrier strikes for the week of 3 January 1945. While on her station, she attacked the amphibious assault ship Shintsu Maru. Two torpedoes hit and sank this target. Her only other torpedo attack during the patrol occurred on 6 January, when she fired on two small freighters but missed. Her most important accomplishment of the patrol ‚Äî which ended at Pearl Harbor on 11 February 1945 ‚Äî was her rescue of four downed American aviators. She was under the command of James H. Ashley, Jr. (class of 1934, USNA) who received the Navy Cross for this mission.  Seventh war patrol, June ‚Äì August 1945  Following this patrol, Aspro left Hawaii bound for the California coast. She entered Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard on 20 February and spent the next three months undergoing overhaul. This work ended on 31 May, and she sailed for Pearl Harbor to resume her combat duties. Her seventh and final patrol began on 25 June and covered waters south of the Japanese home islands. On 8 July, she was assigned lifeguard duties in support of planes that had taken off from Iwo Jima for strikes on military targets in Japan. Beginning 20 July, she shifted position to cover carrier-based strikes against southeastern Honsh≈´. Five days later, the submarine attacked and claimed to have sunk a Japanese tug with her final torpedo spread of the war. On 3 August, she carried out a daring rescue of a downed aviator. Aspro entered Sagami Wan and came within five to six miles of the Japanese mainland to retrieve the pilot. Despite repeated Japanese air attacks, she succeeded in saving the American. Henry \\"Hank\\" Freeman USN (1922-2014) jumped into the waters after shooting down one of the Japanese bombers attacking the \\"Aspro\\" realizing the submarine was in the process of submerging during Japanese bomber attacks. After 2 hours she surfaced and picked up the wounded pilot and seaman. For his \\"Conspicuous Gallantry\\" Freeman was awarded a Silver Star and a Purple Heart for wounds he received. Her patrol ended on 13 August, when she moored at Midway to commence a refit. It was here that Aspro received word of the Japanese capitulation which ended the war. On 1 September Aspro departed Midway, bound for the California coast. She arrived at San Francisco on 11 September for preservation work prior to being placed out of commission on 30 January 1946 and entering the Pacific Reserve Fleet in the Mare Island berthing area.  Post-War service  Aspro was recommissioned on 6 July 1951 and, for the next two years, operated out of San Diego, her new home port, and performed routine work along the west coast. On 9 November 1953, she was placed in a reserve status and was berthed with the Mare Island group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Aspro was decommissioned on 30 April 1954. The submarine was placed back in commission on 5 May 1957. She completed shakedown and was accepted into the active fleet on 8 June. She resumed her services to various units stationed along the west coast. This routine was broken first by the 1959 movie Battle of the Coral Sea, starring Cliff Robertson, which was shot in part aboard Aspro, then by a deployment to the western Pacific in mid-1959. Upon her return to San Diego on 22 January 1960, Aspro underwent overhaul. On 1 July 1960, Aspro was redesignated AGSS-309. She then resumed her services along the west coast. On 1 September 1962, Aspro was decommissioned, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 9 October 1962. She was later sunk as a target by off San Diego, California on 16 November 1962. Awards Aspro won seven battle stars for her World War II service.

It is a ward within the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens and forms part of the parish of Bold. Historically a part of Lancashire, the village and area is so named because of a large clock face that adorned the Inn. The name was also adopted by a colliery in the area. The Clock Face public house, although not the original building, is built close to the original location and maintains the naming tradition. Sport Clock Face is home to the amateur rugby league side Clock Face Miners, originally established in 1921 as 'Clock Face Rangers'. The club colours are yellow and blue. Industry The area was an important coal mining village with three collieries in the vicinity, including Clock Face Colliery (which was closed in 1966), Sutton Manor Colliery (which was closed in 1991), and Parkside Colliery, which was closed in 1992, following a lengthy NUM-linked sit-in protest,http://www.healeyhero.co.uk/rescue/Collection/ian/page_9.htm as the last deep mine in the Lancashire Coalfield. Clock Face Country Park is situated on the site of one of the former collieries. In the late 1990s, the site was reclaimed by St Helens Council as a public open space. It contains developing woodlands, meadow areas and a fishing pond leased to a local angling club. The former mineral railway route has been reclaimed as a pathway to Sutton Manor Woodlands. Transportation Clock Face was once served by the St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway at Clock Face station on Gartons Lane. The area is currently served by Lea Green railway station on the northern route of the Liverpool to Manchester Line. Arriva North West operate bus services in Clock Face, routes 32/32A, 30 and 33 link the area to St Helens Hospital and the Town Centre. Other bus companies serving the area include Merseytravel's 140 bus route and Halton Transport's 17/17B bus routes. Arriva have since taken over some 17 bus routes to Widnes as part of a scheme to boost travel between both Widnes and St Helens.

ŒîŒ¨ŒºœâŒΩŒøœÇ) and Pythias (; or ; or Phintias, ) is a legend in Greek historic writings illustrating the Pythagorean ideal of friendship. Pythias is accused of and charged with plotting against the tyrannical Dionysius I of Syracuse. Pythias requests of Dionysius to be allowed to settle his affairs on the condition that his friend, Damon, be held hostage and, should he, Pythias, not return, be executed in his stead. When Pythias returns, Dionysius, amazed by the love and trust in their friendship, frees them both.  Greek legend  Damon and Pythias As told by Aristoxenus, and after him Cicero (De Offic. 3.45), Diodorus Siculus (10.4), and others, Pythias and his friend Damon, both followers of the philosopher Pythagoras, traveled to Syracuse during the reign of the tyrannical Dionysius I (r. 405-367 BC). Pythias was accused of plotting against the tyrant and sentenced to death. Accepting his sentence, Pythias asked to be allowed to return home one last time to settle his affairs and bid his family farewell. Not wanting to be taken for a fool, the king refused, believing that, once released, Pythias would flee and never return. Damon offered himself as a hostage in Pythias' absence, and when the king insisted that, should Pythias not return by an appointed time, Damon would be executed in his stead, Damon agreed and Pythias was released. Dionysius was convinced that Pythias would never return, and as the day Pythias promised to return came and went, he called for Damon's execution‚Äîbut just as the executioner was about to kill Damon, Pythias returned. Apologizing to his friend for the delay, Pythias explained that on the passage back to Syracuse pirates had captured his ship and thrown him overboard, but that he swam to shore and made his way back to Syracuse as quickly as possible, arriving just in time to save his friend. So astonished by and pleased with their friendship, Dionysius pardoned both men. It was also said that the tyrant then sought to become their third friend, but was denied. Another version says that it was a test planned by Dionysius and his courtiers. The Pythagoreans were renowned for their moral strength and superiority, but some Syracusan courtiers argued the claim was false, and others disagreed, so with their king they devised a test‚Äîa crisis that would show whether two Pythagoreans lived up to that reputation.  Works based on the legend Still from the film Damon and Pythias (1914) *In 1564, the material was made into a tragicomic play by the English poet Richard Edwardes (Damon and Pythias). *The best-known modern treatment of the legend is the German ballad Die B√ºrgschaft, Die B√ºrgschaft ‚Äì Wikisource.

(In this work, Damon is sentenced to death, not Pythias.) *In 1821, the Irish poet John Banim wrote a play based on the legend (Damon and Pythias). Familiarity with this play led Justus H.

It was \\"adapted and illustrated from the photo-play conceived and produced by The Universal Film Manufacturing Company\\", referring to the 1914 film starring William Worthington and Herbert Rawlinson.

Forrest is named after Sir John Forrest, an explorer, legislator, federalist, premier of Western Australia, and one of the fathers of the Australian Constitution. Streets in Forrest are named after explorers and governors. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics Forrest is the second most Socio-Economic advantaged location in Australia after the neighbouring suburb of Barton. Forrest is one of the few suburbs in Canberra built to the original Canberra plans. It contains many circular and geometric patterns in its streets and can be quite confusing to drive in. Forrest was renamed from the earlier suburb Blandfordia (the name of the Christmas Bell) and gazetted as a suburb in 1928. South Blandfordia became part of the new suburb of Griffith at the same time. The original residents of Forrest were mostly senior public servants who were moved from Melbourne.  Demography  In the , the population of Forrest was 1,615, including 6 (0.4%) Indigenous persons and 1,090 (69.3%) Australian-born persons. 42.7% of dwellings were separate houses (compared to the Australian average of 72.9%), 17.3% were semi-detached, row or terrace houses (Australian average: 12.7%) and 38.9% were flats, units or apartments (Australian average: 13.1%). 40.7% of the population were professionals, compared to the Australian average of 22.2%. 24.1% worked in central government administration, compared to the Australian average of 1.2% and the Canberra-wide average of 20.1%. The median weekly personal income for people aged 15 years and over was $1,576, compared to the median Australian income of $662.  Education  Forrest Primary School is situated in Hobart Avenue in Forrest. It caters for students in years P-6. The students wear red and yellow.

Forrest Housing Precinct  The Forrest Housing Precinct is subject to conservation measures to preserve its character. Important values being preserved in the suburb are: *The majority of the precinct was constructed in 1926 ‚Äì 27 to meet the urgent need to provide housing for public servants prior to the opening of the provisional Parliament House in 1927. *The Melbourne firm Oakley, Parkes and Scarborough won a 1924 competition to design the housing for the precinct. *The street layout is directly derived from Griffin's 1913 plan which defined the major axes of Melbourne and Hobart Avenues radiating from Capital Hill and concentric circles. The road layout and subdivision pattern of the precinct is mirrored on the opposite side of Melbourne Avenue. *The public domain landscaping of the precinct is associated with Thomas Charles Weston, Superintendent of Parks, Gardens and Afforestation, Canberra 1913‚Äì1926. Weston's use of Australian native species was an unusual practice for this period. *The precinct is also a repository of a small number of compatible privately built dwellings designed by early local architects including Kenneth H Oliphant, one of Canberra's first independent architects. Oliphant's work has contributed notably to the character of the urban architecture of Canberra.  Street furniture  The remnants of street furniture, that is street signs, fire hydrants and footpath lighting and other elements including kerbs and gutters and examples of brick drains, are valued for their contribution to the aesthetic of a twentieth-century 'Garden City' planned subdivision. The furniture of the Garden City precincts (Blandfordia 4 and 5 and the Forrest Housing precincts) is now protected.  Forrest Fire Station Precinct  These buildings are in the block bounded by Canberra Avenue, Empire Circuit, Manuka Circle and Fitzroy Street. They were completed in 1938 and include a former fire station. The buildings are considered important examples of Australian Early Modern Architecture and illustrate a distinctive comparison with the \\"Federal Capital Architecture\\" that dominated in Canberra in the 1920s and 30s.

Although these two suras are separate entities in the Qur'an and also are written in the Mushaf under separate names, they are so deeply related with their contents closely resembling each other's that they have been designated by the common name 'al-Mu'awwidhatayn' (the two suras in which refuge with Allah has been sought). Imam Baihaqi in 'Dala'il an-Nubuwwah' has written that these suras were revealed together, and hence their combined name of al-Mu'awwidhatayn.Mu'awwidhatayn , USC MSA Compendium of Muslim Texts There is a Sunnah tradition from Muhammad of reading them over the sick or before sleeping and they are also considered a healing.Faith Healing ‚Äî Sayings of Muhammad, IQRA Islamic Publications Occasion of Revelation : Also see: Dua. Hasan Basri, 'Ikrimah, 'Ata' and JƒÅbir ibn Zayd say that these surahs are Makki. A tradition from 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas also supports the same view. However, according to another tradition from him, it is Madani and the same view is held also by 'Abdullah bin Zubair and Qatadah. One of the traditions which strengthens this second view is the Hadith which Muslim, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i and Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal have related on the authority of 'Uqbah bin 'Amir. He says that Muhammad one day said to him: \\"Do you know what kind of verses have been revealed to me tonight? ‚Äî these matchless verses are *A'udhu bi-Rabbi l-falaq* and *A'udhu bi-Rabbi n-nas*. This Hadith is used as an argument for these suras to be Madani because 'Uqbah bin 'Amir had become a Muslim in Madinah after the hijrah, as related by Abu Da'ud and Nasa'i on the basis of his own statement. Other traditions which have lent strength to this view are those related by Ibn Sa'd, Muhiyy-us-Sunnah Baghawi, Imam Nasafi, Imam Baihaqi, Hafiz Ibn Hajar, Hafiz Badr-uddin 'Ayni, 'Abd bin Humaid and others to the effect that these suras were revealed when the Jews had worked magic on Muhammad in Madinah and he had fallen ill under its effect. Ibn Sa'd has related on the authority of Waqidi that this happened in A.H. 7. On this very basis Sufyan ibn \`Uyaynah also has described these suras as Madani. But (as explained by Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi in his Tafhim-ul-Quran under the Introduction to al-Mu'awwidhatayn), when it is said about a certain sura or verse that it was revealed on this or that particular occasion, it does not necessarily mean that it was revealed for the first time on that very occasion. Rather it sometimes so happened that a sura or a verse had previously been revealed, then on the occurrence or appearance of a particular incident or situation, Muhammad's attention was drawn to it by Allah for the second time, or even again and again. In Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi's opinion the same also was the case with the Mu'awwidhatayn. The subject matter of these suras is explicit that these were sent down at Makkah in the first instance when opposition to Muhammad there had grown very intense. Later, when at Madinah storms of opposition were raised by the hypocrites, Jews and polytheists, Muhammad was instructed to recite these very suras, as has been mentioned in the above cited tradition from Uqbah bin Amir. After this, when magic was worked on him, and his illness grew intense, angel Gabriel came and instructed him by Allah's command to recite these very suras. Therefore, in the same opinion, the view held by the commentators who describe both these suras as Makki is more reliable. Regarding them as connected exclusively with the incident of magic is difficult, for to this incident related only one verse (v.4), the remaining verses of S≈´rat al-Falaq and the whole of S≈´rat An- NƒÅs have nothing to do with it directly. Theme and subject matter The conditions under which these two suras were sent down in Makkah were as follows. As soon as Muhammed began to preach the message of Islam, it seemed as though he had provoked all classes of the people around him. As his message spread the opposition of the disbelieving Quraish also became more and more intense. As long as they had any hope that they would be able to prevent him from preaching his message by throwing some temptation in his way, or striking some bargain with him, their hostility did not become very active. But when Muhammad disappointed them completely that he would not effect any kind of compromise with them in the matter of faith, and in S≈´rat Al-Kafirun they were plainly told: \\"I do not worship those who you worship nor are you worshipers of Him Whom I worship. For you is your religion and for me is mine\\", the hostility touched its extreme limits. More particularly, the families whose members (men or women, boys or girls) had accepted Islam, were burning with rage from within against Muhammad. They were cursing him, holding secret consultations to kill him quietly in the dark of the night so that the Banu Hashim could not discover the murderer and take revenge; magic and charms were being worked on him so as to cause his death, or make him fall ill, or become mad; satans from among the men and the jinn spread on every side so as to whisper one or another evil into the hearts of the people against him and the Qur'an brought by him so that they became suspicious of him and fled him. There were many people who were burning with jealousy against him, for they could not tolerate that a man from another family or clan than their own should flourish and become prominent. For instance, the reason why Abu Jahl was crossing every limit in his hostility to him has been explained by himself: \\"We and the Bani Abdi Manaf (to which the Holy Prophet belonged) were rivals of each other: they fed others, we too fed others; they provided conveyances to the people, we too did the same; they gave donations, we too gave donations, so much so that when they and we have become equal in honor and nobility, they now proclaim that they have a Prophet who is inspired from the heaven; how can we compete with them in this field? By God, we will never acknowledge him, nor affirm faith in him\\". (Source Ibn Hisham, vol. I, pp. 337‚Äì338). Such were the conditions when Muhammad was commanded to tell the people: \\"I seek refuge with the Lord of the dawn, from the evil of everything that He has created, and from the evil of the darkness of night and from the evil of magicians, men and women, and from the evil of the envious\\", and to tell them: \\"I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind, the King of mankind, and the Deity of mankind, from the evil of the whisperer, who returns over and over again, who whispers (evil) into the hearts of men, whether he be from among the jinn or men.\\" This is similar to what Moses had been told to say when Pharaoh had expressed his design before his full court to kill him: \\"I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord against every arrogant person who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.\\" (). And: \\"I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord lest you should assail me.\\" () On both occasions they were confronted with well-equipped, resourceful and powerful enemies. On both occasions they stood firm on their message against their strong opponents, whereas they had no material power on the strength of which they could fight them, and on both occasions they utterly disregarded the threats and dangerous plans and hostile devices of the enemy, saying: \\"We have taken refuge with the Lord of the universe against you.\\" Obviously, such firmness and steadfastness can be shown only by the person who has the conviction that the power of His Lord is the supreme power, that all powers of the world are insignificant against Him, and that no one can harm the one who has taken His refuge. Only such a one can say: \\"I will not give up preaching the Word of Truth. I care the least for what you may say or do, for I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord and Lord of all universe.\\"  The position of Ibn Mas\`ud concerning Al-Mu\`awwidhatayn  Imam Ahmad recorded from Zirr bin Hubaysh that Ubayy bin Ka\`b told him that Ibn Mas\`ud did not record the Mu\`awwidhatayn in his Mushaf (copy of the Qur'an). So Ubayy said, \\"I testify that the Messenger of Allah informed me that Jibril said to him, ŸÇŸèŸÑŸí ÿ£ŸéÿπŸèŸàÿ∞Ÿè ÿ®Ÿêÿ±Ÿéÿ®ŸêŸë ÿßŸÑŸíŸÅŸéŸÑŸéŸÇŸê (Arabic) _Translation:_ Say: \\"I seek refuge with the Lord of al-Falaq. (S≈´rat al-Falaq 113:1) So he said it. And Jibril said to him, ŸÇŸèŸÑŸí ÿ£ŸéÿπŸèŸàÿ∞Ÿè ÿ®Ÿêÿ±Ÿéÿ®ŸêŸë ÿßŸÑŸÜŸéŸëÿßÿ≥ (Arabic) _Translation:_ Say: \\"I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind.\\") (S≈´rat An-NƒÅs 114:1) So he said it. Therefore, we say what the Prophet said.\\"  The virtues of the Al-Mu\`awwidhatayn  * In his Sahih, Imam Muslim recorded on the authority of ‚ÄòUqbah bin ‚ÄòAmir that the Prophet Muhammad said, \\"Do you not see that there have been Ayaat revealed to me tonight the like of which has not been seen before?\\" They are Say: ‚ÄúI seek refuge with, the Lord of al- Falaq.‚Äù (S≈´rat al-Falaq 113:1) and; Say: ‚ÄúI seek refuge with the Lord of mankind.‚Äù (S≈´rat An-NƒÅs 114:1) Sahih Muslim 1:558 This Hadith was recorded by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said, ‚ÄúHasan Sahih.‚Äù Ahmad 4:144, Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi 9:303, and An-Nasa‚Äôi 8:254. * According to Tafsir ibn Kathir, it has been reported from Abu Sa'id that Muhammad used to seek protection from the evil eyes of the jinn and mankind. But when al- Mu'awwidhatayn were revealed, he used them (for protection) and abandoned all else besides them. At-Tirmidhi, An-Nisai and ibn Majah recorded this. * Narrated ‚ÄòAisha: ‚ÄúWhenever Allah‚Äôs Apostle became sick, he would recite al- Mu'awwidhatayn (S≈´rat al-Falaq and S≈´rat an-Nas) and then blow his breath over his body. When he became seriously ill, I used to recite (these two suras) and rub his hands over his body hoping for its blessings.(Sahih al-Bukhari Vol.6 Bk.6 No.535) Relation between S≈´rat Al-Fatihah and Al-Mu'awwidhatayn : Also see: al-Fatiha The last thing which is noteworthy with regard to the Mu'awwidhatayn is the relation between the beginning and the end of the Qur'an. Although the Qur'an has not been arranged chronologically, Muhammed arranged in the present order the verses and suras revealed during 23 years on different occasions to meet different needs and situations, not by himself but by the command of Allah who revealed them. According to this order, the Qur'an opens with the S≈´rat al-Fatihah and ends with the Mu'awwidhatayn. In the beginning, after praising and glorifying Allah as Lord of the worlds, Kind, Merciful and Master of the Judgment Day, the believer submits: \\"Lord, You alone I worship and to You alone I turn for help, and the most urgent help that I need from You is to be guided to the Straight Way.\\" In answer, he is given by Allah the whole Qur'an to show him the Straight Way, which is concluded thus: Man prays to Allah, Who is Lord of dawn, Lord of men, King of men, Deity of men, saying: \\"I seek refuge only with You for protection from every evil and mischief of every creature, and in particular, from the evil whisperings of devils, be they from among men or jinn, for they are the greatest obstacle in following the Straight Way.\\" Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi thus says in his Tafheemul Quran \\"The relation that the beginning bears with the end, cannot remain hidden from anyone who has understanding and insight.\\"  See also  * List of Islamic terms in Arabic * S≈´rat al-Falaq * S≈´rat An-Nas * S≈´rat al-Fatiha References Category:Quranic verses Category:Islamic terminology Category:Chapters in the Quran ","title":"Al-Mu'awwidhatayn"},{"id":"1116547","text":"The peroxide process is a method for the industrial production of hydrazine. In this process hydrogen peroxide is used as an oxidant instead of sodium hypochlorite, which is traditionally used to generate hydrazine. The main advantage of the peroxide process to hydrazine relative to the traditional Olin Raschig process is that it does not coproduce salt. In this respect, the peroxide process is an example of green chemistry. Since many millions of kilograms of hydrazine are produced annually, this method is of both commercial and environmental significance.Jean-Pierre Schirmann, Paul Bourdauducq \\"Hydrazine\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. . Production Ketazine formation In the usual implementation, hydrogen peroxide is used together with acetamide. This mixture does not react with ammonia directly but does so in the presence of methyl ethyl ketone to give the oxaziridine. :506px Balanced equations for the individual steps are as follows. Imine formation through condensation: :Me(Et)C=O + NH3 ‚Üí Me(Et)C=NH + H2O Oxidation of the imine to the oxaziridine: :Me(Et)C=NH + H2O2 ‚Üí Me(Et)CONH + H2O Condensation of the oxaziridine with a second molecule of ammonia to give the hydrazone: :Me(Et)CONH + NH3 ‚Üí Me(Et)C=NNH2 \\\\+ H2O The hydrazone then condenses with a second equivalent of ketone to give the ketazine: :Me(Et)C=O + Me(Et)C=NNH2 ‚Üí Me(Et)C=NN=C(Et)Me + H2O Typical process conditions are 50 ¬∞C and atmospheric pressure, with a feed mix of H2O2:ketone:NH3 in a molar ratio of about 1:2:4. Methyl ethyl ketone is advantageous to acetone because the resulting ketazine is immiscible in the reaction mixture and can be separated by decantation. A similar process based on benzophenone has also been described.. Ketazine to hydrazine The final stage involves hydrolysis of the purified ketazine: :Me(Et)C=NN=C(Et)Me + 2 H2O ‚Üí 2 Me(Et)C=O + N2H4 The hydrolysis of the azine is acid-catalyzed, hence the need to isolate the azine from the initial ammonia-containing reaction mixture. It is also endothermic,. and so requires an increase in temperature (and pressure) to shift the equilibrium in favour of the desired products: ketone (which is recycled) and hydrazine hydrate. The reaction is carried out by simple distillation of the azeotrope: typical conditions are a pressure of 8 bar and temperatures of 130 ¬∞C at the top of the column and 179 ¬∞C at the bottom of the column. The hydrazine hydrate (30‚Äì45% aqueous solution) is run off from the base of the column, while the methyl ethyl ketone is distilled off from the top of the column and recycled. History The peroxide process, also called the Pechiney‚ÄìUgine‚ÄìKuhlmann process, was developed in the early 1970s by Produits Chimiques Ugine Kuhlmann.. .. Originally the process used acetone instead of methyl ethyl ketone. Methyl ethyl ketone is advantageous because the resulting ketazine is immiscible in the reaction mixture and can be separated by decantation...

Dunham had one of the most successful dance careers in African- American and European theater of the 20th century, and directed her own dance company for many years. She has been called the \\"matriarch and queen mother of black dance.\\"Joyce Aschenbenner, Katherine Dunham: Dancing a Life (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2002). While a student at the University of Chicago, Dunham also performed as a dancer and ran a dance school. Receiving a fellowship, she went to the Caribbean to study dance and ethnography. She later returned to graduate and submitted a master's thesis in anthropology. She did not complete the other requirements for that degree, however. She realized that her professional calling was performance. At the height of her career in the 1940s and 1950s, Dunham was renowned throughout Europe and Latin America and was widely popular in the United States. The Washington Post called her \\"dancer Katherine the Great\\". For almost 30 years she maintained the Katherine Dunham Dance Company, the only self-supported American black dance troupe at that time. Over her long career, she choreographed more than ninety individual dances.V√®V√® A. Clark and Sara E. Johnson, editors, Kaiso!: Writings by and about Katherine Dunham (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005). This anthology of writings contains an abbreviated chronology of Dunham's life and career as well as a selected bibliography, a filmography of her commercial works, and a glossary. Dunham was an innovator in African- American modern dance as well as a leader in the field of dance anthropology, or ethnochoreology. She also developed the Dunham Technique, a method of movement to support her dance works. Early years Katherine Mary Dunham was born on June 22, 1909, in a Chicago hospital and taken as an infant to her parents' home in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, about 25 miles west of Chicago. Her father, Albert Millard Dunham, was a descendant of slaves from West Africa and Madagascar. Her mother, Fanny June Dunham (n√©e Taylor), who was of French- Canadian heritage, died when Dunham was three years old. She had an older brother, Albert Jr., with whom she had a close relationship. After her father married again a few years later, the family moved to a predominantly white neighborhood in Joliet, Illinois. There her father ran a dry-cleaning business. Dunham became interested in both writing and dance at a young age. In 1921, a short story she wrote when she was 12 years old, called \\"Come Back to Arizona\\", was published in volume 2 of The Brownies' Book. She graduated from Joliet Central High School in 1928, where she played baseball, tennis, basketball, and track; served as vice-president of the French Club, and was on the yearbook staff.Joliet Central High School Yearbook, 1928 In high school she joined the Terpsichorean Club and began to learn a kind of modern dance based on the ideas of Europeans √âmile Jaques-Dalcroze and Rudolf von Laban. At the age of 15, she organized \\"The Blue Moon Caf√©\\", a fundraising cabaret to raise money for Brown's Methodist Church in Joliet, where she gave her first public performance. While still a high school student, she opened a private dance school for young black children. Academic anthropologist After completing her studies at Joliet Junior College, Dunham moved to Chicago to join her brother Albert, who was attending the University of Chicago as a student of philosophy. In a lecture by Robert Redfield, a professor of anthropology, she learned that much of black culture in modern America had begun in Africa. She decided to major in anthropology and to study dances of the African diaspora. Besides Redfield, she studied under anthropologists such as A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, Edward Sapir, and Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski. Under their tutelage, she showed great promise in her ethnographic studies of dance.Ira E. Harrison and Faye V. Harrison, African-American Pioneers in Anthropology (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1999), p. 139. In 1935, Dunham was awarded travel fellowships from the Julius Rosenwald and Guggenheim foundations to conduct ethnographic study of the dance forms of the Caribbean, especially as manifested in Vodun practice of Haiti. Fellow anthropology student Zora Neale Hurston also did field work in the Caribbean. Dunham also received a grant to work with Professor Melville Herskovits of Northwestern University, whose ideas about retention of African culture among African Americans served as a base for her research in the Caribbean. Her field work in the Caribbean began in Jamaica, where she lived for several months in the remote Maroon village of Accompong, deep in the mountains of Cockpit Country. (She later wrote Journey to Accompong, a book describing her experiences there.) Then she traveled to Martinique and to Trinidad and Tobago for short stays, primarily to do an investigation of Shango, the African god who was still considered an important presence in West Indian religious culture. Early in 1936, she arrived in Haiti, where she remained for several months, the first of her many extended stays in that country through her life. While in Haiti, Dunham investigated Vodun rituals and made extensive research notes, particularly on the dance movements of the participants. Years later, after extensive studies and initiations, she became a mambo in the Vodun religion. She also became friends with, among others, Dumarsais Estim√©, then a high- level politician, who became president of Haiti in 1949. Somewhat later, she assisted him, at considerable risk to her life, when he was persecuted for his progressive policies and sent in exile to Jamaica after a coup d'√©tat. Dunham returned to Chicago in the late spring of 1936. In August she was awarded a bachelor's degree, a Ph.B., bachelor of philosophy, with her principal area of study named as social anthropology. She was one of the first African-American women to attend this college and to earn these degrees. In 1938, using materials collected during her research tour of the Caribbean, Dunham submitted a thesis, The Dances of Haiti: A Study of Their Material Aspect, Organization, Form, and Function, to the Department of Anthropology at the University of Chicago in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a master's degree, but she never completed her course work or took required examinations to complete the degree. Devoted to dance performance, as well as to anthropological research, she realized that she had to choose between the two. Although Dunham was offered another grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to pursue her academic studies, she chose dance, gave up her graduate studies, and departed for Broadway and Hollywood. Dancer and choreographer From 1928 to 1938 Katherine Dunham in 1940, by Carl Van Vechten Dunham‚Äôs dance career first began in Chicago when she join the Little Theater Company of Harper Avenue. In 1928, while still an undergraduate, Dunham began to study ballet with Ludmilla Speranzeva, a Russian dancer who had settled in Chicago, after having come to the United States with the Franco-Russian vaudeville troupe Le Th√©√¢tre de la Chauve-Souris, directed by impresario Nikita Balieff. Dunham also studied ballet with Mark Turbyfill and Ruth Page, who became prima ballerina of the Chicago Opera. Additionally, she worked closely with Vera Mirova who specialized in ‚ÄúOriental‚Äù dance. Through her ballet teachers, she was also exposed to Spanish, East Indian, Javanese, and Balinese dance forms.Aschenbenner, Katherine Dunham: Dancing a Life, p. 26 In 1931, at the age of 21, Dunham formed a group called Ballets N√®gres, one of the first black ballet companies in the United States. The group performed Dunham‚Äôs Negro Rhapsody at the Chicago Beaux Arts Ball. After this well-received performance in 1931, the group was disbanded. Encouraged by Speranzeva to focus on modern dance instead of ballet, Dunham opened her first dance school in 1933, calling it the Negro Dance Group. It was a venue for Dunham to teach young black dancers about their African heritage. In 1934‚Äì1936, Dunham performed as a guest artist with the ballet company of the Chicago Opera. Ruth Page had written a scenario and choreographed La Guiablesse (\\"The Devil Woman\\"), based on a Martinican folk tale in Lafcadio Hearn's Two Years in the French West Indies. It opened in Chicago in 1933, with a black cast and with Page dancing the title role. The next year the production was repeated with Katherine Dunham in the lead and with students from Dunham's Negro Dance Group in the ensemble. Her dance career was interrupted in 1935 when she received funding from the Rosenwald Foundation which allowed her to travel to Jamaica, Martinique, Trinidad, and Haiti for eighteen months to explore each country‚Äôs respective dance cultures. The result of this trip was Dunham‚Äôs Master‚Äôs these entitled ‚ÄúThe Dances of Haiti.‚Äù Having completed her undergraduate work at the University of Chicago and decided to pursue a performing career rather than academic studies, Dunham revived her dance ensemble. In 1937 she traveled with them to New York to take part in A Negro Dance Evening, organized by Edna Guy at the 92nd Street YMHA. The troupe performed a suite of West Indian dances in the first half of the program and a ballet entitled Tropic Death, with Talley Beatty, in the second half. Upon returning to Chicago, the company performed at the Goodman Theater and at the Abraham Lincoln Center. Dunham created Rara Tonga and Woman with a Cigar at this time, which became well known. With choreography characterized by exotic sexuality, both became signature works in the Dunham repertory. After her company performed successfully, Dunham was chosen as dance director of the Chicago Negro Theater Unit of the Federal Theatre Project. In this post, she choreographed the Chicago production of Run Li'l Chil'lun, performed at the Goodman Theater. She also created several other works of choreography, including The Emperor Jones (a response to the play by Eugene O'Neill) and Barrelhouse. At this time Dunham first became associated with designer John Pratt, whom she later married. Together, they produced the first version of her dance composition L'Ag'Ya, which premiered on January 27, 1938, as a part of the Federal Theater Project in Chicago. Based on her research in Martinique, this three-part performance integrated elements of a Martinique fighting dance into American ballet. From 1939 to the late 1950s In 1939, Dunham's company gave additional performances in Chicago and Cincinnati and then returned to New York. Dunham had been invited to stage a new number for the popular, long-running musical revue Pins and Needles 1940, produced by the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union. As this show continued its run at the Windsor Theater, Dunham booked her own company in the theater for a Sunday performance. This concert, billed as Tropics and Le Hot Jazz, included not only her favorite partners Archie Savage and Talley Beatty, but her principal Haitian drummer, Papa Augustin. Initially scheduled for a single performance, the show was so popular that the troupe repeated it for another ten Sundays. Based on this success, the entire company was engaged for the 1940 Broadway production Cabin in the Sky, staged by George Balanchine and starring Ethel Waters. With Dunham in the sultry role of temptress Georgia Brown, the show ran for 20 weeks in New York. It next moved to the West Coast for an extended run of performances there. The show created a minor controversy in the press. After the national tour of Cabin in the Sky, the Dunham company stayed in Los Angeles, where they appeared in the Warner Brothers short film Carnival of Rhythm (1941). The next year, after the US entered World War II, Dunham appeared in the Paramount musical film Star Spangled Rhythm (1942) in a specialty number, \\"Sharp as a Tack,\\" with Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson. Other movies she performed in as a dancer during this period included the Abbott and Costello comedy Pardon My Sarong (1942) and the black musical Stormy Weather (1943), which featured a stellar range of actors, musicians and dancers.Claude Conyers, \\"Film Choreography by Katherine Dunham, 1939‚Äì1964,\\" in Clark and Johnson, Kaiso! (2005), pp. 639‚Äì42. The company returned to New York. The company was located on the property that formerly belonged to the Isadora Duncan Dance in Caravan Hill but subsequently moved to W 43rd Street. In September 1943, under the management of the impresario Sol Hurok, her troupe opened in Tropical Review at the Martin Beck Theater. Featuring lively Latin American and Caribbean dances, plantation dances, and American social dances, the show was an immediate success. The original two- week engagement was extended by popular demand into a three-month run, after which the company embarked on an extensive tour of the United States and Canada. In Boston, then a bastion of conservatism, the show was banned in 1944 after only one performance. Although it was well received by the audience, local censors feared that the revealing costumes and provocative dances might compromise public morals. After the tour, in 1945, the Dunham company appeared in the short-lived Blue Holiday at the Belasco Theater in New York, and in the more successful Carib Song at the Adelphi Theatre. The finale to the first act of this show was Shango, a staged interpretation of a Vodun ritual, which became a permanent part of the company's repertory. In 1946, Dunham returned to Broadway for a revue entitled Bal N√®gre, which received glowing notices from theater and dance critics. Early in 1947 Dunham choreographed the musical play Windy City, which premiered at the Great Northern Theater in Chicago. Later in the year she opened a cabaret show in Las Vegas, during the first year that the city became a popular entertainment as well as gambling destination. Later that year she took her troupe to Mexico, where their performances were so popular that they stayed and performed for more than two months. After Mexico, Dunham began touring in Europe, where she was an immediate sensation. In 1948, she opened A Caribbean Rhapsody, first at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London, and then took it to the Th√©√¢tre des Champs- √âlys√©es in Paris. This was the beginning of more than 20 years during which Dunham performed with her company almost exclusively outside the United States. During these years, the Dunham company appeared in some 33 countries in Europe, North Africa, South America, Australia, and East Asia. Dunham continued to develop dozens of new productions during this period, and the company met with enthusiastic audiences in every city. Despite these successes, the company frequently ran into periods of financial difficulties, as Dunham was required to support all of the 30 to 40 dancers and musicians. Dunham and her company appeared in the Hollywood movie Casbah (1948) with Tony Martin, Yvonne De Carlo, and Peter Lorre, and in the Italian film Botta e Risposta, produced by Dino de Laurentiis. Also that year they appeared in the first ever, hour-long American spectacular televised by NBC, when television was first beginning to spread across America. This was followed by television spectaculars filmed in London, Buenos Aires, Toronto, Sydney, and Mexico City. In 1950, Sol Hurok presented Katherine Dunham and Her Company in a dance revue at the Broadway Theater in New York, with a program composed of some of Dunham's best works. It closed after only 38 performances. The company soon embarked on a tour of venues in South America, Europe, and North Africa. They had particular success in Denmark and France. In the mid-1950s, Dunham and her company appeared in three films: Mambo (1954), made in Italy; Die Grosse Starparade (1954), made in Germany; and M√∫sica en la Noche (1955), made in Mexico City. Later career The Dunham company's international tours ended in Vienna in 1960. They were stranded without money because of bad management by their impresario. Dunham saved the day by arranging for the company to be paid to appear in a German television special, Karibische Rhythmen, after which they returned to the United States. Dunham's last appearance on Broadway was in 1962 in Bamboche!, which included a few former Dunham dancers in the cast and a contingent of dancers and drummers from the Royal Troupe of Morocco. It was not a success, closing after only eight performances. A highlight of Dunham's later career was the invitation from New York's Metropolitan Opera to stage dances for a new production of Aida, starring soprano Leontyne Price. In 1963, she became the first African American to choreograph for the Met since Hemsley Winfield set the dances for The Emperor Jones in 1933. The critics acknowledged the historical research she did on dance in ancient Egypt, but they were not appreciative of her choreography as staged for this production. Subsequently, Dunham undertook various choreographic commissions at several venues in the United States and in Europe. In 1966, she served as a State Department representative for the United States to the first ever World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar, Senegal. In 1967 she officially retired, after presenting a final show at the famous Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York. Even in retirement Dunham continued to choreograph: one of her major works was directing the premiere full, posthumous production Scott Joplin's opera Treemonisha in 1972, a joint production of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Morehouse College chorus in Atlanta, conducted by Robert Shaw. This work was never produced in Joplin's lifetime, but since the 1970s, it has been successfully produced in many venues. In 1978 Dunham was featured in the PBS special, Divine Drumbeats: Katherine Dunham and Her People, narrated by James Earl Jones, as part of the Dance in America series. Alvin Ailey later produced a tribute for her in 1987‚Äì88 at Carnegie Hall with his American Dance Theater, entitled The Magic of Katherine Dunham. Educator and writer Katherine Dunham 1963 In 1945, Dunham opened and directed the Katherine Dunham School of Dance and Theatre near Times Square in New York City. Her dance company was provided with rent- free studio space for three years by an admirer and patron, Lee Shubert; it had an initial enrollment of 350 students. The program included courses in dance, drama, performing arts, applied skills, humanities, cultural studies, and Caribbean research. In 1947 it was expanded and granted a charter as the Katherine Dunham School of Cultural Arts. The school was managed in Dunham's absence by Syvilla Fort, one of her dancers, and thrived for about 10 years. It was considered one of the best learning centers of its type at the time. Schools inspired by it were later opened in Stockholm, Paris, and Rome by dancers who had been trained by Dunham. Her alumni included many future celebrities, such as Eartha Kitt. As a teenager, she won a scholarship to the Dunham school and later became a dancer with the company, before beginning her successful singing career. Dunham and Kitt collaborated again in the 1970s in an Equity Production of the musical Peg, based on the Irish play, Peg O' My Heart. Dunham Company member Dana McBroom-Manno was selected as a featured artist in the show, which played on the Music Fair Circuit. Others who attended her school included James Dean, Gregory Peck, Jose Ferrer, Jennifer Jones, Shelley Winters, Sidney Poitier, Shirley MacLaine and Warren Beatty. Marlon Brando frequently dropped in to play the bongo drums, and jazz musician Charles Mingus held regular jam sessions with the drummers. Known for her many innovations, Dunham developed a dance pedagogy, later named the Dunham Technique, a style of movement and exercises based in traditional African dances, to support her choreography. This won international acclaim and is now taught as a modern dance style in many dance schools. By 1957, Dunham was under severe personal strain, which was affecting her health. She decided to live for a year in relative isolation in Kyoto, Japan, where she worked on writing memoirs of her youth. The first work, entitled A Touch of Innocence: Memoirs of Childhood, was published in 1959. A continuation based on her experiences in Haiti, Island Possessed, was published in 1969. A fictional work based on her African experiences, Kasamance: A Fantasy, was published in 1974. Throughout her career, Dunham occasionally published articles about her anthropological research (sometimes under the pseudonym of Kaye Dunn) and sometimes lectured on anthropological topics at universities and scholarly societies.See \\"Selected Bibliography of Writings by Katherine Dunham\\" in Clark and Johnson, Kaiso! (2005), pp. 643‚Äì46. In 1963 Dunham was commissioned to choreograph Aida at New York's Metropolitan Opera Company, with Leontyne Price in the title role. Members of Dunham's last New York Company auditioned to become members of the Met Ballet Company. Among her dancers selected were Marcia McBroom, Dana McBroom, Jean Kelly, and Jesse Oliver. The Met Ballet Company dancers studied Dunham Technique at Dunham's 42nd Street dance studio for the entire summer leading up to the season opening of Aida. Lyndon B. Johnson was in the audience for opening night. Dunham's background as an anthropologist gave the dances of the opera a new authenticity. She was also consulted on costuming for the Egyptian and Ethiopian dress. Dana McBroom- Manno still teaches Dunham Technique in New York City and is a Master of Dunham Technique. In 1964, Dunham settled in East St. Louis, and took up the post of artist-in-residence at Southern Illinois University in nearby Edwardsville. There she was able to bring anthropologists, sociologists, educational specialists, scientists, writers, musicians, and theater people together to create a liberal arts curriculum that would be a foundation for further college work. One of her fellow professors, with whom she collaborated, was architect Buckminster Fuller. The following year, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Dunham to be technical cultural adviser‚Äî a sort of cultural ambassador‚Äîto the government of Senegal in West Africa. Her mission was to help train the Senegalese National Ballet and to assist President Leopold Senghor with arrangements for the First Pan-African World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar (1965‚Äì66). Later Dunham established a second home in Senegal, and she occasionally returned there to scout for talented African musicians and dancers. In 1967, Dunham opened the Performing Arts Training Center (PATC) in East St. Louis in an effort to use the arts to combat poverty and urban unrest. The restructuring of heavy industry had caused the loss of many working-class jobs, and unemployment was high in the city. After the 1968 riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Dunham encouraged gang members in the ghetto to come to the Center to use drumming and dance to vent their frustrations. The PATC teaching staff was made up of former members of Dunham's touring company, as well as local residents. While trying to help the young people in the community, Dunham was arrested. This gained international headlines and the embarrassed local police officials quickly released her. She also continued refining and teaching the Dunham Technique to transmit that knowledge to succeeding generations of dance students. She lectured every summer until her death at annual Masters' Seminars in St. Louis, which attracted dance students from around the world. She established the Katherine Dunham Centers for Arts and Humanities in East St. Louis to preserve Haitian and African instruments and artifacts from her personal collection. In 1976, Dunham was guest artist-in-residence and lecturer for Afro-American studies at the University of California, Berkeley. A photographic exhibit honoring her achievements, entitled Kaiso! Katherine Dunham, was mounted at the Women's Center on the campus. In 1978, an anthology of writings by and about her, also entitled Kaiso! Katherine Dunham, was published in a limited, numbered edition of 130 copies by the Institute for the Study of Social Change. Social activism The Katherine Dunham Company toured throughout North America in the mid-1940s, performing as well in the racially segregated South. Dunham refused to hold a show in one theater after finding out that the city's black residents had not been allowed to buy tickets for the performance. On another occasion, in October 1944, after getting a rousing standing ovation in Louisville, Kentucky, she told the all- white audience that she and her company would not return because \\"your management will not allow people like you to sit next to people like us.\\" She expressed a hope that time and the \\"war for tolerance and democracy\\" (this was during World War II) would bring a change.Clark and Johnson, Kaiso! (2005), p. 252. One historian noted that \\"during the course of the tour, Dunham and the troupe had recurrent problems with racial discrimination, leading her to a posture of militancy which was to characterize her subsequent career.\\" In Hollywood, Dunham refused to sign a lucrative studio contract when the producer said she would have to replace some of her darker-skinned company members. She and her company frequently had difficulties finding adequate accommodations while on tour because in many regions of the country, black Americans were not allowed to stay at hotels. While Dunham was recognized as \\"unofficially\\" representing American cultural life in her foreign tours, she was given very little assistance of any kind by the U.S. State Department. She had incurred the displeasure of departmental officials when her company performed Southland, a ballet that dramatized the lynching of a black man in the racist American South. Its premiere performance on December 9, 1950, at the Teatro Municipal in Santiago, Chile,\\"Hoy programa extraordinario y el s√°bado dos estamos nos ofrece Katherine Dunham,\\" El Mercurio (Santiago, Chile), Thursday, December 7, 1950.Joanna Dee Das, \\"Katherine Dunham (1909-2006)\\", Dance Heritage Coalition. generated considerable public interest in the early months of 1951.Constance Valis Hill, \\"Katherine Dunham's Southland: Protest in the Face of Repression,\\" reprinted in Clark and Johnson, Kaiso! (2005), pp. 345‚Äì63. The State Department was dismayed by the negative view of American society that the ballet presented to foreign audiences. As a result, Dunham would later experience some diplomatic \\"difficulties\\" on her tours. The State Department regularly subsidized other less well-known groups, but it consistently refused to support her company (even when it was entertaining U.S. Army troops), although at the same time it did not hesitate to take credit for them as \\"unofficial artistic and cultural representatives.\\" The Afonso Arinos Law in Brazil In 1950, while visiting Brazil, Dunham and her group were refused rooms at a first-class hotel in S√£o Paulo, the Hotel Esplanada, frequented by many American businessmen. Understanding that the fact was due to racial discrimination, she made sure the incident was publicized. The incident was widely discussed in the Brazilian press and became a hot political issue. In response, the Afonso Arinos law was passed in 1951 that made racial discrimination in public places a felony in Brazil.Edward E. Telles, Race in Another America: The Significance of Skin Color in Brazil (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2004), p. 37.Paulina L.

Whitten Jr. (eds), Blackness in Latin American and Caribbean (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1988), p. 117. Hunger strike In 1992, at age 83, Dunham went on a highly publicized hunger strike to protest the discriminatory U.S. foreign policy against Haitian boat-people. Time reported that, \\"she went on a 47-day hunger strike to protest the U.S.'s forced repatriation of Haitian refugees. \\"My job\\", she said, \\"is to create a useful legacy.\\"Time magazine article During her protest, Dick Gregory led a non-stop vigil at her home, where many disparate personalities came to show their respect, such Debbie Allen, Jonathan Demme, and Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam. This initiative drew international publicity to the plight of the Haitian boat-people and U.S. discrimination against them. Dunham ended her fast only after exiled Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Jesse Jackson came to her and personally requested that she stop risking her life for this cause. In recognition of her stance, President Aristide later awarded her a medal of Haiti's highest honor. Private life Dunham married Jordis McCoo, a black postal worker, in 1931, but he did not share her interests and they gradually drifted apart, finally divorcing in 1938. About that time Dunham met and began to work with John Thomas Pratt, a Canadian who had become one of America's most renowned costume and theatrical set designers. Pratt, who was white, shared Dunham's interests in African-Caribbean cultures and was happy to put his talents in her service. After he became her artistic collaborator, they became romantically involved. In the summer of 1941, after the national tour of Cabin in the Sky ended, they went to Mexico, where inter-racial marriages were less controversial than in the United States, and engaged in a commitment ceremony on 20 July, which thereafter they gave as the date of their wedding.Katherine Dunham, The Minefield (manuscript, c. 1980‚Äì85), book II, 122‚Äì123, Box 20, Katherine Dunham Papers, Missouri History Museum Library and Research Center, St. Louis. In fact, that ceremony was not recognized as a legal marriage in the United States, a point of law that would come to trouble them some years later. Katherine Dunham and John Pratt married in 1949 to adopt Marie-Christine, a French 14-month-old baby. From the beginning of their association, around 1938, Pratt designed the sets and every costume Dunham ever wore. He continued as her artistic collaborator until his death in 1986. When she was not performing, Dunham and Pratt often visited Haiti for extended stays. On one of these visits, during the late 1940s, she purchased a large property of more than seven hectares (approximately 17.3 acres) in the Carrefours suburban area of Port-au-Prince, known as Habitation Leclerc. Dunham used Habitation Leclerc as a private retreat for many years, frequently bringing members of her dance company to recuperate from the stress of touring and to work on developing new dance productions. After running it as a tourist spot, with Vodun dancing as entertainment, in the early 1960s, she sold it to a French entrepreneur in the early 1970s. In 1949, Dunham returned from international touring with her company for a brief stay in the United States, where she suffered a temporary nervous breakdown after the premature death of her beloved brother Albert. He had been a promising philosophy professor at Howard University and a prot√©g√© of Alfred North Whitehead. During this time, she developed a warm friendship with the psychologist and philosopher Erich Fromm, whom she had known in Europe. He was only one of a number of international celebrities who were Dunham's friends. In December 1951, a photo of Dunham dancing with Ismaili Muslim leader Prince Ali Khan at a private party he had hosted for her in Paris appeared in a popular magazine and fueled rumors that the two were romantically linked.Jet: The Weekly Negro News Magazine, vol. 1, no. 9 (December 27, 1951). Both Dunham and the prince denied the suggestion. The prince was then married to actress Rita Hayworth, and Dunham was now legally married to John Pratt; a quiet ceremony in Las Vegas had taken place earlier in the year.Katherine Dunham, The Minefield (manuscript, c. 1980-85). The couple had officially adopted their foster daughter, a 14-month-old girl they had found as an infant in a Roman Catholic convent nursery in Fresnes, France. Named Marie-Christine Dunham Pratt, she was their only child. Among Dunham's closest friends and colleagues was Julie Robinson, formerly a performer with the Katherine Dunham Company, and her husband, singer and later political activist Harry Belafonte. Both remained close friends of Dunham for many years, until her death. Glory Van Scott and Jean-L√©on Destin√© were among other former Dunham dancers who remained her lifelong friends.Anna Kisselgoff, \\"Katherine Dunham's Legacy, Visible in Youth and Age,\\" New York Times (March 3, 2003). Death On May 21, 2006, Dunham died in her sleep from natural causes in New York City. She died a month before her 97th birthday. She wished her family a happy life. Legacy Anna Kisselgoff, a dance critic for The New York Times, called Dunham \\"a major pioneer in Black theatrical dance ... ahead of her time.\\" \\"In introducing authentic African dance-movements to her company and audiences, Dunham‚Äîperhaps more than any other choreographer of the time‚Äîexploded the possibilities of modern dance expression.\\" As one of her biographers, Joyce Aschenbrenner, wrote: \\"Today, it is safe to say, there is no American black dancer who has not been influenced by the Dunham Technique, unless he or she works entirely within a classical genre\\", and the Dunham Technique is still taught to anyone who studies modern dance. The highly respected Dance magazine did a feature cover story on Dunham in August 2000 entitled \\"One-Woman Revolution.\\" As Wendy Perron wrote, \\"Jazz dance, 'fusion,' and the search for our cultural identity all have their antecedents in Dunham's work as a dancer, choreographer, and anthropologist. She was the first American dancer to present indigenous forms on a concert stage, the first to sustain a black dance company.... She created and performed in works for stage, clubs, and Hollywood films; she started a school and a technique that continue to flourish; she fought unstintingly for racial justice.\\" Scholar of the arts Harold Cruse wrote in 1964: \\"Her early and lifelong search for meaning and artistic values for black people, as well as for all peoples, has motivated, created opportunities for, and launched careers for generations of young black artists ... Afro-American dance was usually in the avant-garde of modern dance ... Dunham's entire career spans the period of the emergence of Afro-American dance as a serious art.\\" Black writer, Arthur Todd, described her as \\"one of our national treasures.\\" Regarding her impact and effect he wrote: \\"The rise of American Negro dance commenced ... when Katherine Dunham and her company skyrocketed into the Windsor Theater in New York, from Chicago in 1940, and made an indelible stamp on the dance world... Miss Dunham opened the doors that made possible the rapid upswing of this dance for the present generation.\\" \\"What Dunham gave modern dance was a coherent lexicon of African and Caribbean styles of movement‚Äîa flexible torso and spine, articulated pelvis and isolation of the limbs, a polyrhythmic strategy of moving‚Äîwhich she integrated with techniques of ballet and modern dance.\\" \\"Her mastery of body movement was considered 'phenomenal.' She was hailed for her smooth and fluent choreography and dominated a stage with what has been described as 'an unmitigating radiant force providing beauty with a feminine touch full of variety and nuance.\\" Richard Buckle, ballet historian and critic, wrote: \\"Her company of magnificent dancers and musicians ... met with the success it has and that herself as explorer, thinker, inventor, organizer, and dancer should have reached a place in the estimation of the world, has done more than a million pamphlets could for the service of her people.\\" \\"Dunham's European success led to considerable imitation of her work in European revues ... it is safe to say that the perspectives of concert-theatrical dance in Europe were profoundly affected by the performances of the Dunham troupe.\\" While in Europe, she also influenced hat styles on the continent as well as spring fashion collections, featuring the Dunham line and Caribbean Rhapsody, and the Chiroteque Fran√ßaise made a bronze cast of her feet for a museum of important personalities.\\" The Katherine Dunham Company became an incubator for many well known performers, including Archie Savage, Talley Beatty, Janet Collins, Lenwood Morris, Vanoye Aikens, Lucille Ellis, Pearl Reynolds, Camille Yarbrough, Lavinia Williams, and Tommy Gomez. Alvin Ailey, who stated that he first became interested in dance as a professional career after having seen a performance of the Katherine Dunham Company as a young teenager of 14 in Los Angeles, called the Dunham Technique \\"the closest thing to a unified Afro-American dance existing.\\" For several years, Dunham's personal assistant and press promoter was Maya Deren, who later also became interested in Vodun and wrote The Divine Horseman: The Voodoo Gods of Haiti (1953). Deren is now considered to be a pioneer of independent American filmmaking. Dunham herself was quietly involved in both the Voodoo and Orisa communities of the Caribbean and the United States, in particular with the Lucumi tradition. Not only did Dunham shed light on the cultural value of black dance, but she clearly contributed to changing perceptions of blacks in America by showing society that as a black woman, she could be an intelligent scholar, a beautiful dancer, and a skilled choreographer. As Julia Foulkes pointed out, \\"Dunham's path to success lay in making high art in the United States from African and Caribbean sources, capitalizing on a heritage of dance within the African Diaspora, and raising perceptions of African American capabilities.\\"Julia L. Foulkes, Modern Bodies: Dance and American Modernism from Martha Graham to Alvin Ailey (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 72.

It was built by and named after King Attalos II of Pergamon, who ruled between 159 BC and 138 BC. The current building was reconstructed in 1952‚Äì1956 by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and currently houses the Museum of the Ancient Agora. Description Fa√ßade of the building Typical of the Hellenistic age, the stoa was more elaborate and larger than the earlier buildings of ancient Athens and had two rather than the normal one storeys. The stoa's dimensions are and it is made of Pentelic marble and limestone. The building skillfully makes use of different architectural orders. The Doric order was used for the exterior colonnade on the ground floor with Ionic for the interior colonnade. This combination had been used in stoas since the Classical period and was by Hellenistic times quite common. On the first floor of the building, the exterior colonnade was Ionic and the interior Pergamene. Each story had two aisles and twenty-one rooms lining the western wall. The rooms of both stories were lighted and vented through doorways and small windows located on the back wall. There were stairways leading up to the second story at each end of the stoa. The building is similar in its basic design to the Stoa that Attalos' brother, and predecessor as king, Eumenes II, had erected on the south slope of the Acropolis next to the theatre of Dionysus. The main difference is that Attalos' stoa had a row of 42 closed rooms at the rear on the ground floor which served as shops.}} The spacious colonnades were used as a covered promenade. History Inside the Stoa of Attalos A dedicatory inscription engraved on the architrave states that it was built by Attalos II, who was ruler of Pergamon. The stoa was a gift to the city of Athens for the education that Attalos received there under the philosopher Carneades. His elder brother and his father had previously made substantial gifts to the city. The building was constructed on the east side of the Agora or market place of Athens and was used from approximately 150 B.C. onwards for a variety of purposes. The stoa was in frequent use until it‚Äôs woodwork was burned by the Heruli in AD 267. The ruins became part of a fortification wall, which made it easily seen in modern times. Between 1859-62 and in 1898-1902 the ruins of the Stoa were cleared and identified by the Greek Archaeological Society. Their efforts were completed by the American School of Classical Studies during the course of its excavation of the Agora which had commenced in May 1931 under the supervision of T. Leslie Shear. In 1948 Homer Thompson (who was field director of the Agora excavations from 1946‚Äì1967 being undertaken by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (ASCSA) proposed that the Stoa of Attalos be reconstructed to serve as a museum to house archaeological finds. The Stoa was a suitable size and enough architectural elements remained to assist in producing an accurate reconstruction. In particular enough of the northern end remained to allow engineers to ensure that the reconstructed building would be the same height as the original building. His proposal was accepted and so in June 1953, Ward M. Canaday (president of the Board of Trustees of ASCSA from 1949‚Äì1964) authorized the beginning of the work, and in January 1954, the landscape program was formally inaugurated. Funded by contributions from American donors (including a US$1 million financial contribution from John D. Rockefeller Jr.) the reconstruction of the Stoa was carried out by the ASCSA under the general supervision of the Department for Restoration of Ancient and Historic Monuments of the Ministry of Education, directed by Anastasios Orlandos. The plans were drawn by John Travlos, architect of the Agora excavations, while the reconstruction was supervised by the New York architecture firm of W. Stuart Thompson & Phelps Barnum. Greek civil engineer George Biris served as consulting engineer. The building was reconstructed on the original foundations but in order to facilitate it‚Äôs new role as a museum some changes were made to the basement storage area, window sizes and door positions while some internal walls were eliminated. The building incorporated as much of the original structure and materials as possible. In particular the north end, the southernmost shops, part of the south wall, and the south end of the outer steps were able to be retained. Quarries in Piraeus and on Mount Pentelicus were opened so as to provide material similar to the original. The walls were built of limestone from Piraeus, while the facade, the columns and interior trim used Pentelic marble from Mt. Pentelicus, and the roof tiles, clay from Attica. As many as 150 workmen were employed, including 50 master masons, 20 carpenters, and five steelworkers. With the exception of the reconstruction of the Panathenaic Stadium in 1895‚Äì1896 the rebuilding of the Stoa of Attalos was the most ambitious reconstruction of a freestanding ancient building carried out in Athens to that time. The reconstruction is particularly important in the study of ancient monuments because it is a faithful replica of the original building, to the degree possible within the limits of archaeological knowledge. The Stoa was formally dedicated on 3 September 1956 at an event attended by members of the royal family, the Archbishop of Athens, various politicians and members of the public. In 1957 the Greek state assumed responsibility for the administration and security of the museum and the archaeological site. The ceremony of the signing of the 2003 Treaty of Accession of 10 countries ‚Äì Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia ‚Äì to the European Union was conducted in the Stoa of Attalos on 16 April 2003. The Greek Ministry of Culture undertook further renovations in 2003 to 2004. The second floor of the building was refurbished and reopened in 2012. Museum of the Ancient Agora The Stoa of Attalos houses the Museum of the Ancient Agora. Its exhibits are mostly connected with the Athenian democracy. The collection of the museum includes clay, bronze and glass objects, sculptures, coins and inscriptions from the 7th to the 5th century BC, as well as pottery of the Byzantine period and the Turkish conquest.

Background and history The Artsruni's claimed descent from Sennacherib, King of Assyria (705 BC-681 BC). Although it mirrors the Bagratuni claim of Davidic descent and the Mamikonian claim of descent from the royal Han Dynasty, it is usually interpreted as a piece of genealogical mythology. The origin of this claim is attributed to Moses of Chorene according to whom Sennacherib's sons fled to Armenia after murdering him and founded the clans of the Artsruni and Gnuni. Chorene in turn was in all likelihood inspired by Biblical tradition: The Expansion of the House of Artsruni According to the genealogist and historian Cyril Toumanoff, as well as historian M. Chahin, the Artsruni family were an offshoot of the earlier Orontids, Professor James Russell proposed the idea that the Artsrunis derived their name from the Urartian word artsibini (eagle) which survived in Armenian as artsiv (’°÷Ä’Æ’´’æ). The eagle was a totemic animal for the Artsrunis and in a legend the progenitor of the Artsrunis is said to have been abandoned as a child but rescued by an eagle. The first attested member of the family is thought to be Mithrobarzanes in 69 B.C, the viceroy of Tigranes the Great in Sophene. During the reign of the Arsacid family over Armenia (Arshakuni), the family ruled the princely estates of Greater and Lesser Aghbak in Vaspurakan, southeast of Lake Van, gradually annexing the surrounding territory. In the middle of the 4th century the family was deposed. Chavash survived, and recovered power. In 369 the state was led by Merujan Artsruni who guided Persian troops to Armenia, exchanged Christianity for Mazdaism, and defeated the General (sparapet) Mamikonian. The latter recovered power soon after, however, and Merujan was killed. Around 772 the Artsruni presided over the families of Amatuni, Rshtuni, Teruni of Dariunq (before a possession of the Bagratuni) and ruled the regions of Maku, Artaz, Great Zab Valley and Van river. In the same 8th century, the Bagratid dynasty, re-established the monarch of Armenia, and the Artsrunis were \\"among its most powerful vassals and rivals\\". When the territory of historical Armenia was, about a century later, succeeded by several subkingdoms (each of whom were rule by \\"lesser princes\\"), the area of Vaspurakan came to be ruled in by the Artsrunis, who, in 908, received their investiture from their Abbasid suzerains. Thus, Khatc·∏•ik-Gagik II Artsruni was the first of the Artsrunis to rule Vaspurakan under Abbasid suzerainty. Gagik I of Vaspurakan claimed the title of \\"King of Armenia\\" from the Bagratuni Dynasty until his death in 936 or 943. In the beginning of the 11th century, the Artsruni settled westwards in Cappadocia, retreating from eastern invaders. In 1021, Seneqerim-Hovhannes of Vaspurakan was given Sebaste, Evdokia, and possibly Amasia as fiefdom from the Byzantine emperor Basil II in return for his entire kingdom.Arshag Alboyadjian: \\"History of the Armenians of Evdokia\\" New Star Publishing House, Kairo, 1952, p. 187, original title: ’ä’°’ø’¥’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂ ‘µ÷Ç’§’∏’Ø’´’∏’µ ’Ä’°’µ’∏÷Å. ’è’•’≤’°’£÷Ä’°’Ø’°’∂ ’ä’°’ø’¥’°’Ø’°’∂ ‘µ÷Ç ‘±’¶’£’°’£÷Ä’°’Ø’°’∂ ’è’•’≤’•’Ø’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂’∂’•÷Ä’∏’æ: He and 14,000 of his retainers settled in the Theme of Sebasteia, while the Kingdom of Vaspurakan became the Byzantine theme of Vasprakania, which lasted for fifty years until 1071. Cultural legacy The Artsrunis were patrons of the arts, which, as the Encyclopedia Iranica states, is evidenced in the \\"splendid tenth-century monuments of architecture and of fresco and miniature painting especially in the palace and the church of Akdamar\\". These two constructions were built on the order of Khachik Gagik II. Another example are the \\"literary productions\\", such as those by Thomas Artsruni (Tovma Artsruni) in the tenth century (the History of the House of Artsruni). In popular culture Umberto Eco introduced the character of Ardsruni, a nobleman and alchemist in Cilicia, in his fantastic novel Baudolino.

It is located mostly within the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, but it extends into Mato Grosso and portions of Bolivia and Paraguay. It sprawls over an area estimated at between . Various subregional ecosystems exist, each with distinct hydrological, geological and ecological characteristics; up to 12 of them have been defined.Susan Mcgrath, photos by Joel Sartore, Brazil's Wild Wet, National Geographic Magazine, August 2005 Roughly 80% of the Pantanal floodplains are submerged during the rainy seasons, nurturing a biologically diverse collection of aquatic plants and helping to support a dense array of animal species. The name \\"Pantanal\\" comes from the Portuguese word p√¢ntano, meaning wetland, bog, swamp, quagmire or marsh. By comparison, the Brazilian highlands are locally referred to as the planalto, plateau or, literally, high plain.  Geology, geography and ecology  The extent of the Pantanal in Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay The Pantanal is about , gently-sloped basin that receives runoff from the upland areas (the Planalto highlands) and slowly releases the water through the Paraguay River and tributaries. The formation is a result of the large, concave pre-Andean depression of the earth's crust, related to the Andean orogeny of the Tertiary. It constitutes an enormous internal river delta, in which several rivers flowing from the surrounding plateau merge, depositing their sediments and erosion residues, which have been filling, throughout the years, the large depression area of the Pantanal. This area is also one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the larger Parana-Paraguay Plain area, which encompasses a total of 1.5 million km2. The Pantanal is bounded by the Chiquitano dry forests to the west and northwest, by the Arid Chaco dry forests to the southwest, and the Humid Chaco to the south. The Cerrado savannas lie to the north, east and southeast. The Pantanal is a tropical wet and dry region with an average annual temperate of 21.5 ¬∞C and rainfall at 1,320 mm a year. Throughout the year, temperature varies about 6.0 ¬∞C with the warmest month being November (with an average temperature of 26 ¬∞C) and the coldest month being June (with an average temperature of 20 ¬∞C). Its wettest month is January (with an average of 340 mm) and its driest is June (with an average of 3 mm).  Hydrodynamics  Landscape Floodplain ecosystems such as the Pantanal are defined by their seasonal inundation and desiccation. They shift between phases of standing water and phases of dry soil, when the water table can be well below the root region. Soils range from high levels of sand in higher areas to higher amounts of clay and silt in riverine areas. Elevation of the Pantanal ranges from above sea level. Annual rainfall over the flood basin is between , with most rainfall occurring between November and March. Annual average precipitation ranged from 920 to 1,540 mm in the years 1968-2000. In the Paraguay River portion of the Pantanal, water levels rise between two meters to five meters seasonally; water fluctuations in other parts of the Pantanal are less than this. Flood waters tend to flow slowly ( per second) due to the low gradients and high resistance offered by the dense vegetation. When rising river waters first contact previously dry soil, the waters become oxygen-depleted, rendering the water environs anoxic. Many natural fish kills can occur if there are no oxygenated water refuges available. The reason for this remains speculative: it may be due to the growth of toxin-producing bacteria in the deoxygenated water rather than as a direct result of lack of oxygen.  Flora  The vegetation of the Pantanal, often referred to as the \\"Pantanal complex\\", is a mixture of plant communities typical of a variety of surrounding biome regions: these include moist tropical Amazonian rainforest plants, semiarid woodland plants typical of northeast Brazil, Brazilian cerrado savanna plants and plants of the Chaco savannas of Bolivia and Paraguay. Forests usually occur at higher altitudes of the region, while grasslands cover the seasonally inundated areas. The key limiting factors for growth are inundation and, even more importantly, water-stress during the dry season. According to Embrapa, approximately 2,000 different plants have been identified in the Pantanal biome and classified according to their potential, with some presenting significant medicinal promise.  Fauna  The Pantanal ecosystem is also thought to be home to 463 bird species, 269 fish species, more than 236 mammalian species, 141 reptile and amphibian species, and over 9,000 subspecies of invertebrates. The apple snail is a keystone species in Pantanal's ecosystem. When the wetlands are flooded once a year, the grass and other plants will eventually die and start to decay. During this process, decomposing microbes deplete the shallow water of all oxygen, suffocating larger decomposers. Unlike other decomposing animals, the apple snails have both gills and lungs, making it possible for them to thrive in anoxic waters where they recycle the nutrients. To get oxygen, they extend a long snorkel to the water surface, pumping air into their lungs. This ability allows them to consume all the dead plant matter and turn it into nutritious fertilizer available for the plants in the area. The snails themselves are also food for a variety of animals. Among the rarest animals to inhabit the wetland of the Pantanal are the marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) and the giant river otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). Parts of the Pantanal are also home to the following endangered or threatened species: the hyacinth macaw (Anodorhyncus hyacinthinus) (a bird endangered due to smuggling), the crowned solitary eagle, the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), the bush dog (Speothos venaticus), the South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris) and the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla). Common species in the Pantanal include the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), Ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and the yacare caiman (Caiman yacare). According to 1996 data, there were 10 million caimans in the Pantanal, making it the highest concentration of crocodilians in the World. The Pantanal is home to one of the largest and healthiest jaguar (Panthera onca) populations on Earth. There are thirteen species of herons and egrets, six species of ibises and spoonbills, and five species of kingfishers that use the Pantanal as a breeding and feeding ground. There are nineteen species of parrots documented in the Pantanal, including five species of macaws. Some migratory birds include the American golden plover, Peregrine falcon, and the Bobolink. Most fish are detritivores, primarily ingesting fine particles from sediments and plant surfaces. This is characteristic of fish living in South American flood-plains in general. Fish migration between river channels and flood-plain regions occurs seasonally. These fish have many adaptations that allow them to survive in the oxygen-depleted flood-plain waters. In addition to the caiman, some of the reptiles that inhabit the Pantanal are the yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus), the gold tegu (Tupinambis teguixin), the red-footed tortoise (Geochelone carbonaria) and the green iguana (Iguana iguana).

It is important to note that most species are not under threat due to the low deforestation rates (less than 17%) of native vegetation now in the area due to new regulations. Some of the causes which threaten the Pantanal ecosystems are: * Fishing ** Commercial fishing is focused on only a few species and is probably not sustainable. National and international sport fishing in the Paraguay river and its tributaries are the main focus for fishing activities. Local fishing communities have been under close watch by environmentalists as well. * Cattle-ranching: ** Approximately 99% of the land in the Pantanal is privately owned for the purpose of agriculture and ranching, even though there are some regulations on available land based on the extent of flooding during each wet season. ** There are 2500 fazendas in the region and up to eight million cattle. ** Erosion and sedimentation caused by this activity alter the soil and hydrological characteristics of Pantanal flood-plain ecosystems; consequently, native species are threatened by the change in ecosystem variables. * Hunting, poaching, and smuggling of endangered species: Reptile, wild cat and parrot species are particularly at risk from the smuggling industry due to their high value on the black market. * Uncontrolled tourism and overuse of natural resources * Deforestation ** Establishment of logging companies during political turmoils in the region resulted in peak deforestation rates between 1978-1989. Many livelihoods were dependent on harvesting rubber trees as new waves of migrants arrived, resulting in what is now there today. ** Silt run-off from deforested highlands alters soil hydrology and is a significant threat to the Pantanal. * Pollution from gold mining operations and agro-industry ** The Pantanal is a natural water treatment system as it removes chemicals, including pollutants, from water. Overpollution from industrial development (especially gold mining) can harm native flora and fauna. ** However, water quality in the Pantanal was not significantly degraded as of 2002. * Pollution from sewage systems and pesticides **Movement to large-scale agriculture of food crops, mainly soy- beans, has adopted the use of large quantities of chemical pesticides and fertilizers which leach into the soil or run-off to the flood plains of the Pantanal. * Infrastructure development (shipping canals, raised roads, pipelines): The proposed plan to dredge the Paraguay and Paran√° Rivers to allow oceangoing ships to travel inland is of particular concern and could affect the hydrology (flooding and drainage cycles) of the region, and therefore impact the ecosystem. * Forest Fires : In late 2020, a quarter of to the wetland was destroyed by an unprecedented fire occurred due to climate change. An area estimated of about 7681 square miles has been razed by the fire, an area slightly larger than the U.S. state of New Jersey. Experts say 2020 is the most active year on record for wildfires.   Protected areas  Hotel SESC Porto Cercado in the SESC Reserve A portion of the Pantanal in Brazil has been protected as the Pantanal Matogrossense National Park. This park, established in September 1981, is located in the municipality of Pocon√© in the State of Mato Grosso, between the mouths of the Ba√≠a de S√£o Marcos and the Gurupi Rivers. The park was designated a Ramsar Site of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention on May 24, 1993. The SESC Pantanal Private Natural Heritage Reserve (Reserva Particular do Patrimonio Natural SESC Pantanal) is a privately owned reserve in Brazil, established in 1998 and in size. It is located in the north-eastern portion, known as \\"Pocon√©\\" Pantanal, not far from the Pantanal National Park. It is a mix of permanent rivers, seasonal streams, permanent and seasonal floodplain freshwater lakes, shrub-dominated wetlands and seasonally flooded forests, all dedicated to nature preservation, and was designated a Ramsar Site of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention.

Sir William Coventry (c. 162823 June 1686) was an English statesman. Early life and Civil War William was the son of the lord keeper Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry, by his second wife Elizabeth Aldersley. Coventry matriculated at Queens College, Oxford, at the age of fourteen. Owing to the outbreak of the English Civil War he was forced to abandon his studies, but according to Sir John Bramston, the younger he had a good tutor,. and through travelling he learned to speak the French language fluently. He was young at the time of the war, yet Clarendon wrote that he joined the army and had the command of a foot company and shortly afterwards went to France. Here he remained till all hopes of obtaining foreign assistance and of raising a new army had to be laid aside, when he returned to England and kept aloof from the various royalist intrigues. When the prospect of a restoration appeared in 1660, Coventry hurried to Breda, was appointed secretary to James, Duke of York (who was Lord High Admiral of England) and headed the royal procession when Charles II entered London in triumph. Restoration of the monarchy Coventry was returned to the Restoration Parliament of 1661 for Great Yarmouth, became commissioner for the navy in May 1662 and in 1663 was made D.C.L. at Oxford. His great talents were very soon recognised in parliament, and his influence as an official was considerable. His appointment was rather that of secretary to the admiralty than of personal assistant to the duke of York, and was one of large gains. Anthony Wood states that he collected a fortune of ¬£60,000. Accusations of corruption in his naval administration, and especially during the Dutch war, were brought against him, but there is no real evidence for this. Samuel Pepys, in his diary, testifies to the excellence of Coventry's administration and to his zeal for reform and economy; his consistent praise for Coventry is in notable contrast to his strictures on his other colleagues, who are generally referred to as \\"knaves\\" or \\"old fools\\". Coventry's ability and energy did little to avert the naval collapse, owing chiefly to financial mismanagement and ill-advised appointments. 1665‚Äì1669 Coventry denied all responsibility for the Dutch War in 1665, and his repudiation is supported by Pepys; it was, moreover, contrary to his well-known political opinions. The war greatly increased his influence, and shortly after the Battle of Lowestoft, on 3 June 1665, he was knighted and made a Privy Councillor (26 June) and was subsequently admitted to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In 1667 he was appointed to the board of treasury to effect financial reforms. \\"I perceive,\\" writes Pepys on 23 August 1667, \\"Sir William Coventry is the man and nothing done till he comes\\", and on his removal in 1669 the Duke of Albemarle, no friendly or partial critic, declares that \\"nothing now would be well done.\\" His appointment came too late to ward off the naval disaster at Chatham the same year, the Raid on the Medway, and the national bankruptcy in 1672. Coventry's rising influence had been from the first the cause of increasing jealousy to the Lord Chancellor, Clarendon, who disliked and discouraged the younger generation. Coventry resented this. He became the chief mover in the successful attack on Clarendon, but refused to take any part in his impeachment, although Clarendon never forgave him for what he saw as Coventry's betrayal. Two days after Clarendon's resignation (on 31 August), Coventry announced his intention of terminating his connection with the navy. As a principal agent in effecting Clarendon's fall, he naturally acquired new power and influence, and was expected to be Clarendon's successor as first minister of the crown. Coventry retained merely his appointment at the treasury, and the brilliant but unscrupulous and incapable George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, a favourite of the king, succeeded. The relations between the two men soon became unfriendly. Buckingham ridiculed Sir William's steady attention to business, and was annoyed at his opposition to Clarendon's impeachment. Coventry rapidly lost influence and was excluded from the cabinet council. His career depended now entirely on the support of the Duke of York: but ironically by bringing down Clarendon, Coventry had helped to weaken the influence of the Duke, Clarendon's son-in-law and principal defender. Finally, in March 1669, Coventry challenged Buckingham for having written a play in which Sir William was ridiculed. Notice of the challenge reached the authorities through the duke's second, and Sir William was imprisoned in the Tower on 3 March and subsequently expelled from the privy council. He was superseded in the treasury on 11 March by Buckingham's favourite, Sir Thomas Osborne, and was at last released from the Tower on 21 March in disgrace. The real cause of his dismissal was the final adoption by Charles of the policy of subservience to France and desertion of the Netherlands and Protestant interests. Six weeks before Coventry's fall, the conference between Charles, James, Arlington, Clifford and Arundel had taken place, which resulted a year and a half later in the Treaty of Dover. To such schemes Sir William, with his steady hostility to France and active devotion to Protestantism, was doubtless a formidable opponent. He now withdrew definitely from official life, still retaining, however, his ascendancy in the House of Commons, and leading the party which condemned and criticised the reactionary and fatal policy of the government, his credit and reputation being rather enhanced than diminished by his dismissal. 1670s In 1673 a pamphlet entitled England's appeal from the Private Cabal at Whitehall to the Great Council of the Nation by a true Lover of his Country went through five editions. The anonymous work was universally ascribed to Sir William, and forcefully reflects his opinions on the French entanglement. In the great matter of the Indulgence, while refusing to discuss the limits of prerogative and liberty, he argued that the dispensing power of the crown could not be valid during the session of parliament, and criticised the manner of the declaration while approving its ostensible object. He supported the Test Act, but maintained a statesmanlike moderation amidst the tide of indignation rising against the government, and refused to take part in the personal attacks upon ministers, drawing upon himself the same unpopularity as his nephew, George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax, incurred later. In the same year he denounced the affiance with France. He showed his appreciation for the loyalty Samuel Pepys had always displayed to him by vigorously supporting Pepys' right to sit in the House of Commons (to which he was elected in 1673), and ridiculing the claims (which were entirely unfounded) that Pepys was a Roman Catholic. During the summer of 1674 he was again received at court. In 1675 he supported the bill to exclude Roman Catholics from both Houses, and also the measure to close the House of Commons to placemen; and he showed great activity in his opposition to the French connection, especially stigmatising the encouragement given by the government to the levying of troops for the French service. In May 1677 he voted for the Dutch alliance. Like most of his contemporaries he accepted the story of the Popish Plot in 1678. Coventry several times refused the highest court appointments, and he was not included in Sir W. Temple's new-modelled council in April 1679. 1680s In the exclusion question he favoured at first a policy of limitations, and on his nephew Halifax, who on his retirement became the leader of the moderate party, he enjoined prudence and patience, and greatly regretted the violence of the opposition which eventually excited a reaction and ruined everything. He refused to stand for the new parliament, and retired to his country residence at Minster Lovell near Witney, in Oxfordshire. He died unmarried on 23 June 1686, at Somerhill near Tunbridge Wells, where he had gone to take the waters, and was buried at Penshurst, where a monument was erected to his memory at St John the Baptist, Penshurst. In his will he ordered his funeral to be at small expense, and left ¬£2000 to the French Protestant refugees in England, besides ¬£3000 for the liberation of captives held by the Barbary Pirates in Algiers. He had shortly before his death already paid for the liberation of sixty slaves. He was much beloved and respected in his family circle, his nephew, Henry Savile, alluding to him in affectionate terms as \\"our dearest uncle and incomparable friend\\". Assessment Writing Coventry's biography in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, Philip Chesney Yorke stated that \\"though Sir William Coventry never filled that place in the national administration to which his merit and exceptional ability clearly entitled him, his public life together with his correspondence are sufficient to distinguish him from amongst his contemporaries as a statesman of the first rank. Lord Halifax obviously derived from his honoured mentor those principles of government which, by means of his own brilliant intellectual gifts, originality and imaginative insight, gained further force and influence. Halifax owed to him his interest in the navy and his grasp of the necessity to a country of a powerful maritime force. He drew his antagonism to France, his religious tolerance, wider religious views but firm Protestantism doubtless from the same source. Sir William was the original Trimmer\\". Writing to his nephew Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth, while denying the authorship of The Character of a Trimmer, he says, \\"I have not been ashamed to own myself to be a trimmer... one who would sit upright and not overturn the boat by swaying too much to either side.\\" He shared the Trimmers' dislike of party, urging Halifax in the exclusion contest not to be thrust by the opposition of his enemies into another party, but that he keep upon a national bottom which at length will prevail. His prudence was expressed in his perpetual unwillingness to do things which he could not undo. A singular independence of spirit, a breadth of mind which refused to be contracted by party formulas, a sanity which was proof against the contagion of national delirium, were equally characteristic of uncle and nephew. Sir William Coventry's conceptions of statesmanship, under the guiding hand of his nephew, largely inspired the future revolution settlement, and continued to be an essential condition of English political growth and progress. Bibliography Besides the tract already mentioned Coventry was the author of A Letter to Dr Burnet giving an Account of Cardinal Pools Secret Powers... (1685). The Character of a Trimmer, often ascribed to him, is now known to have been written by Lord Halifax.

A smoke ring is a visible vortex ring formed by smoke in a clear atmosphere. Smokers may blow smoke rings from the mouth, intentionally or accidentally. Smoke rings may also be formed by sudden bursts of fire (such as lighting and immediately putting out a cigarette lighter), by shaking a smoke source (such as an incense stick) up and down, by firing certain types of artillery, or by the use of special devices, such as vortex ring toys. The head of a mushroom cloud is a large smoke ring. A smoke ring is commonly formed when a puff of smoke is suddenly injected into clear air, especially through a narrow opening. The outer parts of the puff are slowed by the still air (or by edges of the opening) relative to the central part, imparting it the characteristic poloidal flow pattern. The smoke makes the ring visible, but does not significantly affect the flow. The same phenomenon occurs with any fluid, creating vortex rings which are invisible but otherwise entirely similar to smoke rings. Smoking and breathing Man blowing smoke rings A smoker may create rings by taking smoke into their mouth and expelling it with a tongue flick, by closing the jaw, tapping the cheek, or producing a sudden burst of air with the lungs and throat. The smoker may also use any of those methods to blow into a cloud of smoke outside their mouth. A trick often performed in conjunction with mouth-blown smoke rings is the French inhale. It is also possible to create a vapour ring by using the same techniques on a cold day with only one's breath. The most famous such steam rings were those produced during the mid-20th century by Douglas Leigh's billboard on the Hotel Claridge in New York City's Times Square, advertising Camel cigarettes. An automated steam chamber behind the billboard produced puffs of steam every four seconds, giving the appearance of smoke rings leaving the smoker's open mouth and drifting away. Inspired by a World War II-era prohibition on lighted advertising, the Camel smoker remained a Times Square landmark long afterward.http://theoldmotor.com/?p=11354 Some users of electronic cigarettes modify their devices to inhale large amounts of vapour at once, to exhale \\"clouds\\" in patterns like smoke rings.

Its original capital was Kuaiji (modern Shaoxing); after its conquest of Wu, the Kings of Yue moved their court north to the city of Wu (modern Suzhou) and survived until 214 BC. When the Chinese were reunified into Qin Dynasty, Yue become a vassal of the Chinese state. History A statue of a man, dating from the State of Yue era The name \\"Baiyue\\" () was applied indiscriminately to many non-Chinese peoples who had been mentioned in numerous classical texts. A specific kingdom, which had been known as the \\"Yue Guo\\" () in modern Zhejiang, was not mentioned until it began a series of wars against its northern Yue neighbor Wu during the late 6th century BC. According to the Records of the Grand Historian and Discourses of the States, the Yue are descended from Wuyu, the son of Shao Kang which as known as the sixth king of the Xia dynasty. With help from Wu's enemy Chu, Yue was able to be victorious after several decades of conflict. The famous Yue King Goujian destroyed and annexed Wu in 473 BC. During the reign of Wujiang (), six generations after Goujian, Yue was partitioned by Chu and Qi in 306 BC. During its existence, Yue was famous for the quality of its metalworking, particularly its swords. Examples include the extremely well-preserved Swords of Goujian and Zhougou. The Yue state appears to have been a largely indigenous political development in the lower Yangtze. This region corresponds with that of the old corded-ware Neolithic, and it continued to be one that shared a number of practices, such as tooth extraction, pile building, and cliff burial. Austroasiatic speakers also still lived in the region down to its conquest and sinification beginning about 240 BC. What set the Yue apart from other Sinitic states of the time was their possession of a navy. Yue culture was distinct from the Chinese in its practice of naming boats and swords. A Chinese text described the Yue as a people who used boats as their carriages and oars as their horses. Rulers of Yue family tree Theobald, Ulrich.

Aftermath A model of a warship used by the state of Yue during the Warring States period. From the Zhejiang Provincial Museum in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China. After the fall of Yue, the ruling family moved south to what is now northern Fujian and set up the Minyue kingdom. This successor state lasted until around 150 BC, when it miscalculated an alliance with the Han dynasty. Mingdi, Wujiang's second son, was appointed minister of Wucheng (present-day Huzhou's Wuxing District) by the king of Chu. He was titled Marquis of Ouyang Ting, from a pavilion on the south side of Ouyu Mountain. The first Qin dynasty emperor Qin Shi Huang abolished the title after his conquest of Chu in 223 BC, but descendants and subjects of its former rulers took up the surnames Ou, Ouyang, and Ouhou () in remembrance. When the religious leader Xu Chang launched a rebellion against the Han dynasty in 172 CE, he declared the state of Yue restored and appointed his father Xu Sheng as \\"King of Yue\\".

According to the author, these cognates are likely traces of 'old Yue language' (gu Yueyu Âè§Ë∂äË™û).

Truscott had been the last person to see her alive. He was scheduled to be hanged; however, the federal cabinet reprieved him and he was sentenced to life in prison and released on parole in 1969. Five decades later, in 2007, his conviction was overturned on the basis that key forensic evidence was weaker than had been portrayed at trial.Julian Sher, Until You Are Dead Lynne Harper Cheryl Lynne Harper was born to Leslie and Shirley Harper on August 31, 1946 in New Brunswick. She had one older brother, Barry Harper, who lived in Ohio and a younger brother, Jeffrey. Her father was a school teacher before he joined the military in 1940. They relocated to the RCAF base at Clinton in July, 1957. Lynne spent time going to Sunday school, Bible class and Girl Guides. On June 9, 1959, Lynne‚Äîthen 12 years of age‚Äîdisappeared near RCAF Station Clinton, an air force base south of Clinton, Ontario in what is now Vanastra (roughly 80 kilometers north of London). Two days later, on the afternoon of June 11, searchers discovered her body in a nearby farm woodlot. Harper had been raped and strangled with her own blouse. Steven Truscott and Harper had been classmates in a combined grades 7/8 class at the Air Vice Marshal Hugh Campbell School located on the north side of the Air Force base. In the early evening of Tuesday, June 9, 1959, Truscott had given Harper a ride on the crossbar of his bicycle and proceeded from the vicinity of the school northwards along the County Road. The timing and duration of their encounter, and what happened while they were together, have been contentious issues since 1959. In court, the Crown contended that Truscott and Harper left the County Road before reaching the bridge over the Bayfield River and, in a wooded area beside the County Road (known as Lawson's Bush), Truscott raped and murdered Lynne. Truscott has maintained since 1959 that he took Harper to the intersection of the County Road and Highway 8, where he left her unharmed. Truscott maintains that when he arrived at the bridge, he looked back toward the intersection where he had dropped Harper off and observed that a vehicle had stopped and that she was in the process of entering it. On June 10, 1959 at 9:30 a.m. Steven was interviewed by (Constable) Hobbs in a cruiser at his school. He told Hobbs that while standing on the bridge, he saw Lynne get into a \\"late model Chevrolet\\" and there \\"was a lot of chrome on the car and it could have been a Bellair [sic] version.\\"Kaufman At 11:20 that evening, Lynne's father reported her missing. Arrest and trial On June 12, shortly after 7:00 p.m., Truscott was taken into custody. At about 2:30 a.m. on June 13, he was charged with first-degree murder under the provisions of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. On June 30, Truscott was ordered to be tried as an adult; an appeal on that order was dismissed. On September 16, Truscott's trial began in the then Supreme Court of Ontario in Goderich before Mr. Justice Ferguson and a jury. Steven Truscott was represented by Frank Donnelly; Glen Hays appeared for the Crown. All the evidence presented in court against the accused was circumstantial, and centred on placing Harper's death within a narrow time frame which implicated Truscott. Key to this narrow window was the autopsy doctor's testimony that the decomposition of Lynne's body and the state of partially digested food in her stomach indicated she had died near the precise time she was acknowledged to have been with Truscott. On September 30, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, with a recommendation for mercy. Justice Ferguson then sentenced Truscott to death by hanging. On January 21, 1960, Truscott's appeal, put forth by John G. J. O'Driscoll to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed. Immediately afterwards the Government of Canada commuted Truscott's sentence to life imprisonment. An application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was denied on February 24. On that date, Truscott did not have an automatic right to appeal to this court. Incarceration and parole From his arrest until the commutation of his death sentence, Truscott was imprisoned at the Huron County Jail in Goderich. After the commutation of his sentence he was transferred to the Kingston Penitentiary for assessment and he was incarcerated at the Ontario Training School for Boys in Guelph from February 1960 to January 1963. On January 14, 1963, he was transferred to Collins Bay Penitentiary. Truscott was transferred on May 7, 1967 to the Farm Annex of Collins Bay Penitentiary. On October 21, 1969, Truscott was released on parole and lived in Kingston with his parole officer and then in Vancouver for a brief period before settling in Guelph under an assumed name. He married and raised three children. On November 12, 1974, Truscott was relieved of the terms and conditions of his parole by the National Parole Board.  At the Supreme Court: the 1960s  Truscott's case was the focus of considerable public attention. In early 1966, Isabel LeBourdais argued in The Trial of Steven Truscott that Truscott had been convicted of a crime he did not commit, rekindling public debate and interest in the case. On April 26, 1966, the Government of Canada referred the Truscott case to the Supreme Court of Canada. Five days of evidence were heard by the Supreme Court of Canada in October 1966, followed by submissions in January 1967. That evidence included the testimony of Truscott, who had not testified at the 1959 trial. British pathologist Professor Keith Simpson was invited by the Canadian government to review the forensic evidence. On May 4, 1967, the Supreme Court (Hall J. dissenting) held that, if Truscott's appeal had been heard by the court, it would have been dismissed. 1967, May 4: New forensic evidence was presented on his behalf, and Truscott testified before the Supreme Court of Canada, telling his story for the first time. Truscott and 25 other witnesses testified before the Court. After a two-week hearing before the Supreme Court, Canada‚Äôs top judges ruled 8-1 against Truscott getting a new trial, and he was returned to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. The Supreme Court stated that ‚ÄúThere were many incredibilities inherent in the evidence given by Truscott before us and we do not believe his testimony.‚Äù The joint opinion of Canada‚Äôs Supreme Court Justices was: ‚ÄúThe verdict of the jury, read in the light of the charge of the trial judge, makes it clear that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the facts, which they found to be established by the evidence which they accepted, were not only consistent with the guilt of Truscott but were inconsistent with any rational conclusion other than that Steven Truscott was the guilty person.‚Äù Judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada Re: Steven Murray Truscott, [1967] S.C.R. 309 Date: 1967-05-04  At the Ontario Court of Appeal: 2001-2007  Truscott maintained a low profile until 2000, when an interview on CBC Television's investigative news program The Fifth Estate revived interest in his case. Together with a subsequent book by journalist Julian Sher, they suggested that evidence in favour of Truscott's innocence had been ignored in the original trial. On November 28, 2001, James Lockyer led the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted to file an appeal to have the case reopened. On January 24, 2002, retired Quebec Justice Fred Kaufman was appointed by the government to review the case. On October 28, 2004, Justice Minister Irwin Cotler directed a Reference pursuant to section 693.3(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code to the Court of Appeal for Ontario to review whether new evidence would have changed the 1959 verdict. On April 6, 2006, the body of Lynne Harper was exhumed by order of the Attorney General of Ontario, in order to test for DNA evidence. There was hope that this would bring some closure to the case, but no usable DNA was recovered from the remains. Blow flies, maggots and insect activity on Harper's body were capable of raising a \\"reasonable doubt\\" whether she died before 8 p.m. ‚Äì and could suggest she died as late as the next day, although the court said there was no realistic possibility that entomology could have assisted in solving the murder in 1959. However, samples of insects and maggots were collected from the body at the time, and the science has since evolved. By knowing when insects deposit their eggs or larvae on a corpse, experts can estimate time of death. The evidence did not rule out that Lynne died at the time stated by the Crown. During the trial Justice Michael Moldaver asked retired OPP officer Harry \\"Hank\\" Sayeau (who assisted Inspector Harold Graham) why the police never considered a sexual psychopath might be responsible for Lynne's rape and murder before they narrowed their focus on a fourteen-year- old: \\"Did the thought ever cross your mind that, for someone to strangle her then sexually assault her, you might want to be looking for someone who is more of a pervert, more of a sexual psychopath?\\" \\"I don't recall that\\", said the eighty-four-year-old Harry Sayeau.Julian Sher, Until You Are Dead. Truscott's conviction was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario on June 19, 2006. The five-judge panel, headed by Ontario Chief Justice Roy McMurtry and including Justice Michael Moldaver, heard three weeks of testimony and fresh evidence. On January 31, 2007, the Court of Appeal for Ontario began hearing arguments from Truscott's defence in the appeal of Truscott's conviction. Arguments were heard by the court over a period of ten days, concluding February 10. In addition to the notoriety of the case itself, the hearing is also notable for being the first time that cameras were allowed into a hearing of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The Court of Appeal heard evidence, including earlier versions of draft autopsy reports, that contradicted the supposed narrow window for Lynne's time of death. Pathologist Dr. John Penistan had in fact provided three different estimates for this time period, the first two of which would have excluded Truscott as a suspect. Only after the police had narrowed on Truscott as the prime suspect did Penistan provide \\"forensic proof\\" that Lynne had died exactly around the time that implicated Truscott. His original estimates and draft autopsy reports were concealed from the defence and the court. On August 28, 2007, Truscott was acquitted of the charges. Truscott's defence team had originally asked for a declaration of factual innocence, which would mean that Truscott would be declared innocent, and not merely unable to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Although they issued the acquittal, the court said it was not in a position to declare Truscott innocent of the crime. \\"The appellant has not demonstrated his factual innocence,\\" the court wrote. \\"At this time, and on the totality of the record, we are in no position to make a declaration of innocence.\\" Within the Court's 2006 judgement, as they reviewed the evidence against Truscott, the Court wrote that \\"In these circumstances, we cannot say that an acquittal is the only reasonable verdict.\\" Truscott therefore remains a suspect in the killing of Lynne Harper. Attorney General of Ontario Michael Bryant apologized to Truscott on behalf of the provincial government, stating they were \\"truly sorry\\" for the miscarriage of justice.CBC.ca, Court acquits Truscott, calling conviction 'miscarriage of justice', August 28, 2008 Many including Harper's family have never thought that Truscott was innocent of the murder, and in July 2008 Harper's brother described Truscott's compensation package as \\"a real travesty\\" and indicated he would not inform their father for fear the news would upset him. Cultural aspects The 1975 film, directed by Murray Markowitz, called Recommendation for Mercy, was based fully on the Truscott case, though different names were introduced into the plot. Andrew Skidd starred. The plot of Ann-Marie MacDonald's 2003 novel The Way the Crow Flies is based on a fictionalized version of the Truscott case, and the surrounding community's reaction to the incident. MacDonald herself was raised in the same region, during the same time period as the Truscott case. In protest of the harsh sentence, notable Canadian writer Pierre Berton wrote a poem, Requiem for a Fourteen-Year- Old.Requiem for a Fourteen-Year-Old Canadian rock band Blue Rodeo recorded a song, \\"Truscott\\", which referenced the case, on their 2000 album The Days in Between. Laurier LaPierre, co-host of a CBC news show, This Hour Has Seven Days, was fired after shedding a tear in response to an interview with Truscott's mother, Doris. LaPierre's reaction ‚Äì quickly wiping away tears under one eye and speaking in a shaky voice ‚Äì infuriated CBC president Alphonse Ouimet. The president, already a critic of Seven Days, took it as proof that LaPierre was \\"unprofessional\\". The popular show was cancelled, and the other co-host, Patrick Watson, was also fired over the incident.Host's on- air tear hastens end of Seven Days, Retrieved on 2008-03-20 A play called Innocence Lost, written by Beverley Cooper and based on Truscott's conviction, was featured at the Blyth Festival Theatre in Blyth, Ontario during the summer 2008 season. It was a finalist for the Governor General's Award for English- language drama in 2008. The play was remounted again in the company's 2009 season and was again playing in 2013 in various Ontario localities including Toronto, Ottawa and at London Community Players in London. Its Western Canadian premiere was at Langara College's Studio 58 in 2014.

A Chinese Pixiu, part Chinese dragon, part lion and with feathered wings, Chaotian Palace, Nanjing. Pixiu () is a Chinese mythical hybrid creature, commonly (but incorrectly) referred to in the West by the Greek word \\"chimera\\", and considered a powerful protector of practitioners of Feng Shui. It resembles a strong, winged lion. Pixiu is an earth and sea variation, particularly an influential and auspicious creature for wealth. It is said to have a voracious appetite towards only gold, silver and jewels. Therefore, traditionally to the Chinese, Pixiu have always been regarded as auspicious creatures that possessed mystical powers capable of drawing Cai Qi ( wealth) from all directions. Because of this, according to Chinese zodiac, it is especially helpful for those who are going through a bad year. There are two different types of Pixiu, a male and a female. The physical difference is seen by their antlers. The one with two antlers is the female of the species and is called a \\"B√¨xi√©\\" and the one with one antler is the male of the species and is called a \\"TiƒÅn l√π\\". *B√¨xi√© (; lit. \\"to ward off evil spirits\\") - The female of the species; wards off evil. It is also believed that B√¨xi√© has the ability of assisting anyone who is suffering from bad Feng Shui that is due to having offended the Grand Duke Jupiter (also called Tai sui ()). *TiƒÅn l√π () - The male of the species; in charge of wealth. TiƒÅn l√π is said to go out into the world in search of gold and other forms of wealth and, bringing it home to its Master, the B√¨xi√© is then said to hold onto it, guarding it within the home of the Master. Displaying TiƒÅn l√π at home or in the office is said to prevent wealth from flowing away. Pixiu crave the smell of gold and silver and like to bring their masters money in their mouth. Statues of this creature are often used to attract wealth in feng shui. Today, Pixiu are also a popular design on jade pendants. It was also featured as a design on the sword of Fa Mulan's character in the 1998 Disney animated feature Mulan. Characteristics Pixiu A sculpture of a Chinese Pixiu \\"B√¨xi√©\\" ‚àí a female Pixiu with two antlers. Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) Fierce-looking and covered with whitish-grey fur, Pixiu are a type of auspicious, winged animal, written about in ancient Chinese history and heralded through the millennia by fantastic stories of powerful and grandiose feats of victory in battle. Their fantastic legend has been passed down through two-thousand years of Chinese lore. They have the powerful head of a Chinese dragon, the bold body of a lion, and‚Äîhistorically‚Äîsport on their heads either one antler (male) or two antlers (female). In modern times, the historical physical appearance of this legendary creature has been somewhat lost, and, as time has passed, it is now more commonly depicted with only one antler, which would be a male according to the ancient descriptions. Ancient Chinese descriptions, depictions and stone carvings of Pixiu from the Han dynasty (206 BC‚Äì220 AD) show the male with a single antler and the female with two. As with the Chinese Phoenix, the common image today is a representation of a single sex with one antler (male). Pixiu have protruding eyes and sharp teeth. Its strong body resembles a Chinese lion and its feet have paws and claws. There is one ancient, stone sculpture variation found with hooves, but all Pixiu always have wings. Many have a bifurcated (split) tail that hangs low and downward, covering their buttocks and rectums, a representative metaphor that they hold gold inside their stomachs but will not let it out. Looking at the posture of Pixiu, the creatures seem to project a sense of strength, elegance and mobility. Likewise, they have a big, opened mouth ready to gobble up gold and fortunes for its master. Because of this, a Pixiu statue is often employed in the home as a way of receiving and keeping fortunes and wealth. Imperial Pixiu used during the Qing dynasty developed the physical characteristic of a fatter, more rotund body, indicating a stomach that could be loaded with unlimited amounts of gold and all forms of wealth and good fortune. Due to their similar appearances, the Pixiu is often confused with stone lions and \\"Qilin\\", but Pixiu can easily be distinguished apart from those two animals by its pair of feathered wings with which it can fly between Heaven and Earth. Mythology Pixiu are a type of ancient mythological, guardian animal species that have feathered wings, a head like a dragon and a body like a lion (sometimes described as a body like a horse). The male Pixiu of this winged, mythological animal species is called a ‚ÄúTiƒÅn l√π\\" and he bears a single antler on his head; Pixiu females, also with wings, are called ‚ÄúB√¨xi√©‚Äù. They look exactly like their winged male counterparts, except they grow two antlers on their heads rather than one. All Pixiu fly between Earth and Heaven where they patrol and fight against demons and other evil creatures. \\"The mythological, dragon-headed, lion-bodied P√¨xi≈´ (also spelled ) were traditionally depicted in China as a male-female pair, one with a single horn (male, P√¨ ) and the other with two horns (female, Xi≈´ )\\". National Palace Museum (Taipei, Taiwan): ‚ÄúIn China during the Han dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD), the pi-hsieh (aka Bixie) were commonly represented as winged, four-legged beasts, a form that was probably transmitted from Western Asia.\\" One story of the Pixiu tells that it violated a law of Heaven by defecating on the floor of Heaven. When it was found out, it was punished by a spanking executed by the Jade Emperor. The spanking was hard enough to cause its rectum to be permanently sealed. The Jade Emperor further declared that the diet of the Pixiu would be restricted to gold, silver and jewels. This is why Pixiu can eat gold, silver and jewels but cannot expel it. This is one of the origins of the status of Pixiu statues as a symbol of the acquisition and preservation of wealth. Another story says that Pixiu was the well-behaved, youngest son of the Dragon King and was spoiled by its parents. One day, Pixiu was playing on the Dragon King's desk and accidentally broke a very important seal that represented the power of the Dragon King. The Dragon King became very angry and used magic to turn Pixiu into an animal. He then sealed his rectum and declared that from then on, Pixiu could only eat things that represented wealth, such as gold, silver and jewels. Pixiu was reputed as a very fierce creature. The large fangs, visible in the creatures' snarling mouths, are used to attack demons and evil spirits, draining their essence and converting it to wealth. Pixiu also guard against disease caused by these same evil spirits. It is written that Pixiu patrols the Heavens to keep demons at bay and to protect their owners from all harm. It was believed that the ferociously devoted Pixiu would always and constantly guard its Master, even after he passed from this life into the next world. It was also believed that Pixiu would help their Masters ascend to heaven by flying them up to Heaven while they rode on their strong backs.  History  \\"Pixiu\\" appear to have their origin in the Han dynasty (206 BC‚Äì220 AD) where they are found mentioned and were originally called \\"t√°o b√°\\" in the Book of Han, an ancient written account of the history of China. Book of Han, Tian Yi Chamber Library Collection. The Tian Yi Ge, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China is the oldest library in China; Photo supplied by Wikipedia User:Gisling The Book of Han was completed in the year 111 A.D. In Chapter 96, it is written, > \\"In the country of W≈´ Gƒì ShƒÅn L√≠ there exist creatures called \\"t√°o b√°\\" > (meaning \\"selected peach\\"), lions and rhinoceros.\\" -from the section > entitled Accounts of the Western Regions. An annotation is also found therein where the female and male \\"t√°o b√°\\" are further described as having antlers like a deer, but the male, which was referred to as ‚ÄúTiƒÅn l√π\\", has only one antler, while the female, referred to as \\"B√¨xi√©\\", has two antlers. In tribute to the legend of the ferocity and prowess of the Pixiu in battle, the Pixiu became synonymous with the army in ancient China. In fact, the word \\"pixiu\\", interpreted as meaning \\"fierce beast\\" and also \\"brave warrior\\", was used as a symbol on battle flags and banners. The Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty, in ancient China, declared that the wonderful, magnificent and devoted Pixiu, who obtained and guarded the Master's gold, would be forever known as the \\"Treasure of the Emperor\\". It is said that the Emperor declared that only Royal persons could possess a Pixiu and it was strictly forbidden for all others to own one, including officials. This law was kept through to the end of the Qing dynasty.  Chinese Architecture  Ceramic figures decorating the Hall of Supreme Harmony at the Imperial Palace Museum. The 10 mystical beasts indicate the highest status in the empire for this building. Picture taken late September 2002 by Leonard G. During China's history, Pixiu were commonly displayed in ancient architecture to ward off Yin Qi () and to harness auspicious Qi. The statues of a Pixiu are commonly found on the four corners of the roofs of houses, palaces and halls of the most important people such as the Chinese Emperor. The Pixiu sits behind the dragon, the phoenix, the winged horse, the sea horse, and other, similar creatures in a guarding manner. A very large pair of winged, stone Pixiu guarding a tomb in China. In ancient China, stone statues of Pixiu (Bixie) were also used as tomb guardians of Han dynasty emperors and other royal persons. Feng shui In Feng shui, Pixiu (aka \\"Pi Yao\\" in some modern cultural translations) is the heavenly variation of a particularly powerful and auspicious creature of good fortune. They are said to have the power to assist anyone suffering from bad Feng shui due to having offended the Grand Duke Jupiter (Tai Sui). In 2005, the Grand Duke resided in the West, so those born in the year of the Rabbit will have been in conflict with him. Practitioners of Feng shui should ensure that they display the Pixiu (Pi Yao) in the West to appease Tai Sui. The Pixiu (Pi Yao) should also be displayed in homes for those enduring a period of bad luck soon after moving into a new home or soon after undertaking renovations. In 2006, Tai Sui moved to the Northwest. His exact position in 2006 is West-Northwest. *Pixiu (aka \\"Pi Yao\\" in some modern cultural translations) - must be placed facing out of the house. *Displaying Pixiu (Pi Yao) at the affected area of the house or office can avoid misfortune and disasters. *For displaying towards openings or entrance, a pair of Pixiu (Pi Yao) is needed. *TiƒÅn l√π (male Pixiu with one antler) and B√¨xi√© (female Pixiu with two antlers) are utilized for attracting and keeping wealth; you may place them in the desired wealth area, such as an attractive wealth area or an accumulative wealth area. *Do not place Pixiu facing directly on any person like a confronting position. *Ideally, Pixiu should not be placed on the floor and they should never be placed above eye level. *One cannot touch the mouth of Pixiu because the touching of their mouths would ruin the wealth.

He is the head of Solidarity and Progress, the French arm of the LaRouche movement, and has thrice run for President of France. Education and professional life Cheminade was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. After graduating from the HEC Paris, law school, and the √âcole nationale d'administration, Cheminade became a career officer in the Directorate of Foreign Economic Relations of the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry, a position he held until 1981. Political career Discovery of LaRouche's ideas FBI document on Jacques Cheminade (1976). Cheminade met Lyndon LaRouche in early 1974 in New York, where he was a commercial attach√© to the French embassy from 1972 to 1977. He compares this encounter to Socratic midwifery. According to a 1976 FBI document, he was then a \\"rank and file member\\" in the National Caucus of Labor Committees, a political organization directed by Lyndon LaRouche which had founded its own \\"intelligence units\\" in 1971, where he \\"work[ed] in the International Intelligence Section\\" (see document, left). His return to France in 1977 was motivated by a desire to devote himself \\"full time to political activities and the advocacy of Mr. LaRouche's ideas and policies\\". 1978: Return to France In 1978, he was the Parti Ouvrier Europ√©en (POE) candidate for the legislative election in the 18th arrondissement of Paris (25th circonscription), and obtained 0.12% of the votes. His program was: * the creation of military force with beam weapons to protect Europe against the USSR; * the fight against drugs and for the promotion of moral values; * the fight against the IMF and against the economic crisis. 1981: Head of POE, support for Giscard In 1981, Cheminade became the general secretary of the European Workers Party and the president of the French section of the Schiller Institute, and took a leave from his work as a civil servant. He tried unsuccessfully to obtain the endorsements necessary to run for the presidential election of 1981, and called before the first round to vote for Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, saying: \\"I call upon all my partisans and friends to vote for Giscard d'Estaing. Three reasons prescribe that choice: his nuclear policy, his conception of d√©tente and his commitment to fight monetarism. Moreover, he is in the best position to defeat Fran√ßois Mitterrand, whose candidacy poses the gravest and most immediate danger\\". 1982‚Äì1985: Defense of SDI In 1982, Cheminade published a statement presenting the POE as a \\"pole of reference for all anti-Malthusian forces committed to reestablish economic growth and cultural morality\\" and advocating a program \\"similar to that of Lyndon LaRouche's National Democratic Policy Committee\\", which included at that time freedom from \\"British domination of American foreign policy\\", worldwide public works projects, the development of nuclear energy \\"to stop genocide\\" in undeveloped nations, a crackdown on an international drug cartel, and a return to classic education to counter \\"the genocidalists' plan for our youth\\". In 1983, Cheminade published a statement on the danger of \\"new fascism\\" posed by an alleged plot against French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand by some of his socialist ministers, including Jacques Delors and Michel Rocard. The next year, he published an article in Executive Intelligence Review, accusing French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand of being a \\"Soviet agent of influence\\", as well as \\"the servant of the \\"families\\" involved in the Swiss-promoted \\"synarchist\\" operations that launched the fascist movement back in the 1920s on an international scale\\". During the 1984 European elections, where the POE list he headed obtained 0.09% of the votes, Cheminade defended a program centered on the fight against three threats: an \\"immediate Russian threat that remains unperceived if not strongly favored\\"); an economic and financial one caused by \\"rampant Malthusianism and the role of the International Monetary Fund\\"; and a moral and intellectual decay, exemplified by the consumption of dangerous drugs. His program also made references to ideas the ideas of Lazare Carnot, a \\"Republican scientist\\", Jean Jaur√®s, the only Socialist \\"with broad ideas\\" and the only one who \\"knew Leibniz and the pre-Socratic philosophers\\", as well as Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who also \\"understood the epistemological foundations of France\\". During the period of time from 1982 to 1984, according to his own statement, Cheminade was involved in arranging a number of meetings between \\"French government, military and political leaders, and Mr. LaRouche [...] primarily on the subject of the SDI [the Strategic Defense Initiative (\\"SDI\\")] and its European complement, the Tactical Defense Initiative (\\"TDI\\")\\". During the 1985 county elections, where his party presented candidates in 50 counties, Cheminade declared the POE \\"wholeheartedly supports Reagan's SDI program, a development program for the third world and a change in economic policy away from the International Monetary Fund\\". Later the same year, he said \\"unless the policies of the IMF are reversed , the Soviets will rule Europe and most of the rest of the world within this decade\\". 1986: French PANIC proposals In 1986, while in the United States the Larouche movement presented the PANIC proposal, Cheminade, at a press conference held together with John Seale ‚Äì a British physician who claimed that HIV had been created in a Soviet laboratory as part of a plot to destroy the United States, \\"ridiculed\\" the \\"condom campaigns\\" run in many countries and claimed that AIDS could be transmitted by saliva ‚Äì presented the draft of a law providing for every resident of France to be screened for AIDS every six months, and every non-resident crossing the border into France to show an AIDS-negative test certificate dating from less than six months before, or be tested, before he could be admitted into France. Another proposition of the same draft was to quarantine \\"full-blown AIDS cases until an effective vaccine and cure are found\\". Later the same year, he contributed to a conference organized by the French section of the Fusion Energy Foundation on \\"The Importance of the Method of Louis Pasteur for Conquering AIDS and Other Pandemics\\", where Dr Whiteside developed his views on the transmission of AIDS by mosquito bites, with a speech where he called \\"upon France to defend Science in the face of the brutal irrationalist attacks on Science\\". 1986: First appearance on national TV During the campaign for the legislative election of 1986, the POE having presented more than 75 candidates in 27 departments, Cheminade was for the first time granted 8 minutes of national television time, and presented a program which included : * an abolition of the International Monetary Fund; * an industrialization of the Third World; * a French Strategic Defense Initiative in cooperation with the United States, and deployment of the neutron bomb; * a \\"Colbertist\\" approach to finance productive investments; * an elimination of EC quotas to increase farm output; * a war on drugs and terrorism; * and an introduction of a classical education curriculum. 1987‚Äì1989: The end of the POE In 1987, Cheminade, described by Daniel Carton in Le Monde as the leader of a \\"far- right small group\\", announced he would run for the 1988 presidential election with a five-point program: a Marshall plan for the third world, a reform of the international monetary system, a biological defense initiative, the relaunch of spatial programs and a European version of the SDI. He did not succeed to gather the necessary number of endorsements to back him. In 1989, Cheminade headed the POE's list for the European Parliament election, called Rassemblement pour une France libre (Movement for a Free France). Its program was to fight against \\"European financial cartels dominated by the London stock market\\" and to promote \\"the construction of Europe by means of large public works\\". Larousse's Journal of the year considered these positions were close to those expressed by the far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen. The list obtained 0.18% of the votes. He remained general secretary of the Parti Ouvrier Europ√©en until its dissolution for bankruptcy in 1989. The POE was replaced in 1991 by the F√©d√©ration pour une Nouvelle Solidarit√© (FNS, Federation for a New Solidarity). 1991‚Äì1995: The FNS replaces the POE In 1993, he was the sole candidate of his movement for the legislative election in Paris and obtained 0.32% of the votes. 1992: Theft trial In 1992, Cheminade was condemned with suspension to 15 months of imprisonment for theft. He was charged of having received, through 3 associations, 1.2 million francs from an elderly lady with Alzheimer's disease. An appellate court confirmed in 1996 the qualification of theft, but reduced the sentence to 9 months with suspension. The judgement mentioned \\"conditioning\\" by \\"professional canvassers\\". The reduced sentence allowed Cheminade to benefit from an amnesty law. 1995: Presidential candidate In 1995, Cheminade obtained 556 endorsements from mayors, allowing him to run in the presidential election. Eric Incyan and Sylvie Kaufman in Le Monde described the obtaining of these endorsements as the result of a \\"generalized phone harassment\\". According to Daniel Hourquebie in Le Monde, Cheminade's envoys targeted the mayors of small rural villages, presumed to favor small candidates and 7 out of 8 of Cheminade's endorsers in the department of Gers administered municipalities of less than 165 inhabitants. According to Renaud Dely in Lib√©ration, they pointed out to left-leaning mayors that Cheminade \\"filled a void\\" in the absence of Jacques Delors, while offering them a copy of Jean Jaur√®s doctoral thesis republished in 1994 by Cheminade's party press with a foreword by Cheminade (described as an absurd rambling by Roger-Pol Droit in Le Monde; to right-leaning mayors, the \\"need of defense against Russia\\" ; to thoses with a concern for environment, his concern for a re-emphasis of the rural world. The mayors of Ayguetinte, B√©zues-Bajon and Saint-Justin said Cheminade's envoys had been the first ones to contact them. The mayor of Ayguetinte said he wanted to express his dissatisfaction with the political class. Other mayors commented on the insistence of Cheminade's emissaries : The mayor of Thoux said he finally accepted to be left in peace. The mayor of Plan√®zes that he was constantly called, at any hour, at home or at the office. Three mayors from Creuse considered they had been \\"deceived\\" on Cheminade's program and political career. The mayor of Saint-Junien-la-Breg√®re said he was for sorry to have signed for somebody \\"who does not seem to be very honest, though I don't have a proof\\". The mayor of Sannat said on television : \\"I was told they were against racism, they seemed to be leaning to the left and he was a small candidate. But when I learned he was at the far-right and had been condemned, I jumped\\". Cheminade replied they had been harassed by journalists who told them he was a crank and his party was a sect. His speeches, invoking the patronages of Jean Jaur√®s and Charles de Gaulle, were centered on a \\"speculative cancer\\" destroying the world economy and for which Cheminade was blaming the \\"financial oligarchy\\" of the City of London, Wall Street, the Federal Reserve and the IMF, as well as their French \\"relays\\", such as the Banque de France. He advocated bankrupting agents of the international monetary and financial system, a \\"new Marshall Plan\\" and credit control. Cheminade obtained 0.27% of the votes. According to El Pais, his campaign raised little interest except for the origin of its funding. According to C√©cile Chambaud in Le Monde, LaRouche was a \\"billionaire\\" and Cheminade's POE had always benefited of \\"large financial means\\". LaRouche sent a letter to Le Monde claiming he did not own his residence and his only revenue was his salary at Executive Intelligence Review\\". Didier Micoine wrote in Le Parisien that Jacques Cheminade claimed to have a taxable income of 42,000 francs, to live with 6,000 francs a month and to own a 10-year-old Peugeot 305. Renaud Leblond and Lo√Øc Stavidr√®s reported in L'Express Cheminade owned a apartment in Paris, earned 3,000 francs a month and benefited from the remains of a family inheritance. Nevertheless, according to Le Monde, Cheminade claimed to be the largest donator of his campaign. Constitutional Court ruling over campaign finance The 1995 presidential election was the first one for which the Constitutional Council had to appreciate the regularity of campaign accounts, in application of a law passed in January 1990. The Council examined the campaign accounts with what Jean-Claude Zarka, a professor of constitutional law, called \\"obvious caution\\" and Pierre Moscovici, the campaign treasurer of the socialist Lionel Jospin, \\"eminent diplomacy\\". The campaign accounts of 8 candidates were approved, some with modifications, but those of Jacques Cheminade were rejected. According to Zarka, Cheminade was \\"financed after the vote by substantial gifts from private persons\\". The ruling of the Council said 2.3 million francs of private loans had to be qualified as gifts because of their relative importance in the accounts and the absence of interests. Moreover, 1.7 million francs, \\"over a third of the total of his declared receipts\\", was contracted after the second round. Following the rejection of his accounts, Cheminade was deprived of the lump- sum reimbursement of his campaign expenses and required to reimburse a million francs he had received from the state at the start of the campaign. In further observations, the Council recommended private loans to presidential candidates should be prohibited.This prohibition was enacted by the organic law n¬∞ 2001-100 of February 5, 2001. Notwithstanding, Cheminade claimed the Civil code did not require a loan to bear interest, an assertion later confirmed by a lawyer specialized in civil law consulted by Le Journal du Dimanche. He also claimed Roland Dumas, the president of the Council, had a conflict of interest with him, having represented his opponents in a libel case some years earlier. Cheminade appealed to the European Court of Justice, but his appeal was rejected. The Court estimated \\"the patrimonial incidence of a procedure pertaining to the conditions of practice of a right of political nature does nor confer to it a civil nature\\" and \\"the decision of the Constitutional Council has not deprived the plaintiff of property in any amount of money but has only obliged the plaintiff to reimburse to the state a million francs because he did not meet the legal conditions to claim the contractual reimbursement of the campaign expenses\\". In November 2010, in the wake of an on the financing of √âdouard Balladur's 1995 presidential campaign, Rapha√´lle Bacqu√© and Pascale Robert-Diard wrote in Le Monde the Constitutional Council had hesitated to validate his campaign accounts, as they showed 10 million francs in receipts of unknown origin. This, according to Le Parisien, was later confirmed by Jacques Robert, a member of the court. According to Les Inrockuptibles, Jacques Robert said: \\"In order to show that we were independent, we invalidated Jacques Cheminade, even though he had only committed minor errors\\". Rapha√´lle Bacqu√© commented in Le Monde this revelation provided Cheminade a new argument to bail himself out of the litigation with the tax authority which followed the rejection of his campaign accounts. Since 1996: S&P; replaces FNS Since 1996, he has been the chairman of one of LaRouche's political parties, Solidarit√© et Progr√®s (Solidarity and Progress). In 1996, Cheminade wrote an article in Executive Intelligence Review entitled \\"Time To Destroy The Mythology of Bonapartism\\". He claimed \\"the British-French 'Entente Cordiale' is, today, the main threat to world history [...] and it is Napoleon who burned the French state to ashes, and his degenerate brothers and descendants, his famiglia, who sold whatever they had to the British\\". According to this article, Napoleon had been \\"brought to madness\\" by the \\"mental control\\" of the British \\"oligarchical order\\", becoming a \\"pirate for the oligarchs\\". Cheminade added : \\"Napoleon, like Hitler, was first promoted by the British, as were the Jacobins before them, to destroy France, and to prevent a truly republican option\\". He further claimed : \\"Beyond the destruction of the French nation-state, what comes clearly to the light of day, is the second historical role assigned to Napoleon: the promotion of paganism, to destroy the humanist world liberation project. Against such a project, Napoleon was the dangerous but useful idiot of the oligarchs\\". In 1997, shortly after the death of Princess Diana, Cheminade wrote an article in Executive Intelligence Review, next to an article by Lyndon LaRouche claiming \\"officials of France's Socialist government [...] supervised the death of Princess Diana\\" and introducing Cheminade's own article as \\"an insider's view of the decadent, doomed tradition which Mitterrand's Presidency set into place\\". Cheminade's own article claimed President Mitterrand was \\"an agent of British influence\\", \\"all governments in France, since at least 1980, have continuously and persistently betrayed the sovereignty of their nation-state [...] It is uniquely in that context, that the Lady Diana case can be understood\\". In 1998, Cheminade claimed his party was the only one \\"to call for a positive alternative to the euro, with a New Bretton Woods system [and] a Eurasian Land-Bridge\\". The same year, he claimed the trial of Roland Dumas and the murder of prefect Claude Erignac were \\"connected [...]to the international financial and monetary implosion, and to the British games in Europe and beyond\\". In 1999, he wrote : \\"The cause of the war is not Iraq, or Yugoslavia, the United States, or even Britain. It is the financial oligarchy of the City of London and Wall Street which has declared war on the people, in Africa, in Russia, and elsewhere, where living standards and life expectancy are collapsing. The leading role in all cases has been played by the British.\\" In 2000, Cheminade wrote \\"the assassins of the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King [...] were the same people who tried to murder de Gaulle, for the same oligarchical reasons\\". The same year, after the crash of Air France Flight 4590, he claimed it could be due to a sabotage, as the French authorities had \\"challenged the Anglo- American oligarchy in many areas\\". In 2000, Cheminade announced he would be a candidate in the 2002 presidential election. He did not succeed to reach the necessary 500 endorsements, gathering only 406 of them. He sued , another presidential candidate, for slander and was granted damages. Cheminade filed a complaint to the Conseil constitutionnel, arguing he had been the subject of press attacks to deter mayors from endorsing him. The claim was rejected. In 2001, Cheminade proposed the issuance of a gold based euro, \\"as a measure of national emergency under the present circumstances\\", with reference to \\"initiatives taken in Russia and Malaysia going in the same direction, with for example the issuance of the Russian golden chervonets\\". This was part of what LaRouche and Cheminade called a \\"new Bretton Woods\\", defined by Cheminade in 2003 as \\"a system of stable exchanges, based on a common reference, a gold- reserve system (and not a gold standard system), gold being used among states to settle their accounts, but not as a basis for credit\\". In 2004, Cheminade and Eric Sauz√©, his party's candidate in the March 2004 Lyon county election were found guilty of slander against Dominique Perben, the minister of Justice, for the comparison in pictures of Philippe P√©tain shaking hands with Adolf Hitler in Montoire-sur-le-Loir and Perben recently doing the same with U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft. Cheminade was condemned to pay a fine of 15,000 euros. The judgement considered the leaflet made \\"a comparison between two periods of the history of France that have strictly nothing in common in terms of human and citizens‚Äô rights\\" and Cheminade had \\"the objective disposition of resources that allowed them to print 25,000 copies of [the] leaflet\\". the judgement was confirmed in appeal in 2006. In the 2004 European election, Cheminade headed list called Nouvelle solidarit√© in √éle-de-France, which obtained 0.11% of the votes. In 2004, during the restructuring of the Argentinian debt, which laRouche compared to \\"\\"transform[ing] Argentina into another Auschwitz\\", Cheminade organized protests in Paris, such as the distribution of leaflets claiming \\"that what happens in Argentina, will happen tomorrow in France, Germany, and all of Europe, and the United States, unless we take the road LaRouche has indicated, which is the New Bretton Woods\\" or organizing a demonstration in front of the headquarters of Lazard, the bank advising the Argentinian government. Cheminade opposed the European constitution proposed in the 2005 referendum, claiming it was a policy leading to fascism and to war. In November 2005, Cheminade was a panelist at the conference of Axis for Peace organized by the Voltaire network in Belgium.

Norman Cousins was the editor from 1940 to 1971. At its peak, Saturday Review was influential as the base of several widely read critics (e.g., Wilder Hobson, music critic Irving Kolodin, and theater critics John Mason Brown and Henry Hewes), and was often known by its initials as SR. It was never very profitable and eventually succumbed to the decline of general-interest magazines after restructuring and trying to reinvent itself more than once during the 1970s and 1980s. Publishing history From 1920 to 1924, Literary Review was a Saturday supplement to the New York Evening Post. Henry Seidel Canby established it as a separate publication in 1924. Bernard DeVoto was the editor in 1936‚Äì1938. In 1950, John Barkham became book reviewer there. Until 1952, it was known as The Saturday Review of Literature. The magazine was purchased by the McCall Corporation in 1961. Saturday Review reached its maximum circulation of 660,000 in 1971. Longtime editor Norman Cousins resigned when it was sold, along with McCall Books, to a group led by the two co-founders of Psychology Today, which they had recently sold to Boise Cascade. They split the magazine into four separate monthlies and renamed the publishing company Saturday Review Press, but the experiment ended in insolvency two years later. Former editor Cousins purchased it and recombined the units with World, a new magazine he had started in the meantime. Briefly it was called SR World before it reverted to Saturday Review. Saturday Review Press was sold separately to E. P. Dutton. The magazine was sold in 1977 to a group led by Carll Tucker, who sold it in 1980 to Macro Communications, the owner of the business magazine Financial World. It was insolvent again in 1982 and was sold to Missouri entrepreneur Jeffrey Gluck. A new group of investors in 1984 resurrected it briefly. According to Greg Lindsay writing for Folio twenty years later, most people consider 1982 \\"the year Saturday Review died\\". Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione acquired all properties in 1987 and used the title briefly from 1993 for an online publication at AOL. Current revival In December 2010, business columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer Joseph N. DiStefano reported in his blog that John T. Elduff of JTE Multimedia planned to \\"revive\\" both Collier's and Saturday Review as print and online magazines ‚Äî mainly print, \\"for Americans 55 to 90\\". Both would \\"have a liberal share of attention to research\\" and look like they did in the 1950s. Philly.com says the blog \\"feeds\\" his newspaper column. In 2011, JTE Multimedia made use of the Saturday Review name with its Web site, Saturday Review‚ÄìDrug Trials, to report on clinical drug research, focusing on inconclusive and adverse trial results. The site disappeared in 2016 with its home page essentially unchanged since its launch date.

Together with Futarasan Shrine and Rinn≈ç-ji, it forms the Shrines and Temples of Nikk≈ç UNESCO World Heritage Site, with 42 structures of the shrine included in the nomination. Five of them are designated as National Treasures of Japan, and three more as Important Cultural Properties.  History  T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ is dedicated to Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate. It was initially built in 1617, during the Edo period, while Ieyasu's son Hidetada was sh≈çgun. It was enlarged during the time of the third sh≈çgun, Iemitsu. Ieyasu is enshrined there, where his remains are also entombed. This shrine was built by Tokugawa retainer T≈çd≈ç Takatora. During the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate carried out stately processions from Edo to the Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ along the Nikk≈ç Kaid≈ç. The shrine's annual spring and autumn festivals reenact these occasions, and are known as \\"processions of a thousand warriors\\". Also part of the beauty is the row of majestic trees lining the roadway, termed the Cedar Avenue of Nikk≈ç. Five structures at Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ are categorized as National Treasures of Japan, and three more as Important Cultural Properties. Additionally, two swords in the possession of the shrine are National Treasures, and lots other objects are Important Cultural Properties. Famous buildings at the T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ include the richly decorated Y≈çmeimon, a gate that is also known as \\"higurashi-no-mon\\". The latter name means that one could look at it until sundown, and not tire of seeing it. Carvings in deep relief, painted in rich colors, decorate the surface of the structure. The next gate is the karamon decorated with white ornaments. Located nearby is a woodcarving of a sleepy cat, \\"Nemuri-neko\\", attributed to Hidari Jingor≈ç. Five-story pagoda at Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ Three Wise Monkeys The stable of the shrine's sacred horses bears a carving of the three wise monkeys, who hear, speak and see no evil, a traditional symbol in Chinese and Japanese culture. The original five-storey pagoda was donated by a daimy≈ç in 1650, but it was burned down during a fire, and was rebuilt in 1818. Each storey represents an element‚Äìearth, water, fire, wind and aether (or void)‚Äìin ascending order. Inside the pagoda, a central shinbashira pillar hangs from chains to minimize damage from earthquakes.

Denkinger wore uniform number 11, when the AL adopted uniform numbers in 1980. He is best remembered for an incorrect safe call he made at first base in Game 6 of the 1985 World Series, which came to be known as The Call. Career Denkinger attended Wartburg College where he was on the wrestling team. He became interested in umpiring while serving in the Army from 1957 to 1959. He began umpiring in the minor leagues in 1960, joined the AL staff in April 1969, and became an AL crew chief in 1977. In 1975, Denkinger was one of the first American League umpires to switch from the outside chest protector to the inside chest protector, which was used in the National League for decades before finally being adopted in the AL in the late 1970s. All umpires who entered the AL starting in 1977 had to use the inside protector; AL umpires on staff prior to 1977 were grandfathered and could continue to use the outside protector. Denkinger's last game using the outside protector was Game 4 of the 1974 World Series. Denkinger umpired in four World Series: 1974, 1980, 1985 and 1991, serving as crew chief the latter two years. Denkinger also umpired in the All-Star Game in 1971, 1976 and 1987, calling balls and strikes for the last game. He officiated in six American League Championship Series (1972, 1975, 1979, 1982, 1988, 1992), serving as crew chief in 1979, 1982, 1988 and 1992, and in the 1981 and 1995 AL Division Series. He was the home plate umpire for the 1978 American League East tie-breaker game that decided the AL East champion, as the New York Yankees defeated the Boston Red Sox. One of seven umpires who have worked in two perfect games, Denkinger was the second base umpire for Len Barker's perfect game on May 15, 1981, and the first base umpire for Kenny Rogers' perfect game on July 28, 1994. Denkinger was also the home plate umpire for Nolan Ryan's sixth no-hitter on June 11, 1990. 1985 World Series Denkinger was the first base umpire in Game 6 of the 1985 World Series. The St. Louis Cardinals led the Kansas City Royals by 3 games to 2 and had taken a 1‚Äì0 lead in the 8th inning. In the bottom of the ninth, Jorge Orta, the leadoff batter for the Royals, hit a slow roller to first baseman Jack Clark, who tossed the ball to the pitcher, Todd Worrell, who was covering first base. Denkinger called Orta safe, even though television replays and photographs clearly showed that he was out by half a step. The Royals went on to win Game 6 by the score of 2‚Äì1.Royals win to force Series into 7th game Denkinger believed he had made the right call until he later met with Commissioner Peter Ueberroth after the game and had the opportunity to see the replay himself. He said he was waiting to hear the ball land in Worrell's glove while watching the bag for Orta's foot and due to the crowd noise he never heard Worrell catch the ball. As crew chief of the 1985 World Series umpiring unit, Denkinger was scheduled to work behind home plate in Game 7, a fact that further upset the Cardinals and manager Whitey Herzog. The Royals won Game 7 by an 11‚Äì0 score, with Denkinger ejecting both Herzog and pitcher Joaqu√≠n And√∫jar in the fifth inning, following And√∫jar's animated displeasure with ball and strike calls. In the immediate aftermath of the 1985 World Series, Denkinger received many hateful letters, including death threats, from Cardinals fans. Two St. Louis disc jockeys went so far as to reveal Denkinger's telephone number and home address. Denkinger claimed that the letters continued on through 1987, when the Cardinals were ramping up for another World Series appearance, this time against the Minnesota Twins. Denkinger got into contact with Major League Baseball Security, who in turn contacted the FBI, when he received a particularly menacing letter with no return address, in which the writer said that if he sees Denkinger in person, he would \\"blow him away\\" with a .357 Magnum. Late career Two years later, Denkinger was behind the plate for the All-Star Game, and he was again named crew chief for the 1988 ALCS, 1991 World Series, and 1992 ALCS. He is one of only four umpires to have been selected as crew chief for the ALCS three times. Denkinger's last season as a full-time umpire was 1993; thereafter he umpired fewer than 100 games each season, umpiring his final game in June 1998. Over the course of his career, he umpired 3824 regular season MLB games. Post-umpiring More than 20 years after the 1985 series, Denkinger has regularly appeared at sports memorabilia shows (including ones in St. Louis) willing to autograph photos depicting \\"The Call.\\" Denkinger even owns a painting featuring himself, Todd Worrell, and Jorge Orta involved in the play, claiming that he keeps it to remind himself that no one is perfect and everyone makes mistakes. In September 2005, Denkinger was a guest speaker at a 20th anniversary dinner celebrating the 1985 St. Louis Cardinals season, benefiting the Whitey Herzog Youth Foundation.

She also held the world record for the 10,000 Meters for 23 years, between 1993 and 2016. Her best years lay between 1991 and 1996. Wang was coached by Ma Junren until 1995 and by Mao Dezhen from 1995 to her retirement after the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Biography Early years Born in Jiaohe, Jilin, Wang beat Ethiopian Gete Wami to win the 1992 World Junior Championships in Athletics in 10,000 m (32:29.90) in Seoul, Korea. 1993: Record-setting year In April 1993, Wang set a world-leading time and former Asian best in marathon (2:24:07). In May, she broke the Asian record of 3000 m in a fast time of 8:27.68 in the Chinese National Championships. In August, Chinese women distance runners under coach Ma Junren stunned the world and swept the world titles from 1500 m to 10,000 m in Stuttgart, Germany. Wang claimed the world title in 10,000 m (30:49.30), although she was sick before the race. In less than a month, she went on to win the 3000 m and 10,000 m in Chinese National Games with 3 world records in 3 races. On September 8, she won the 10,000 m final in a world record of 29:31.78, which bettered the former record by 42 seconds and was also the first-ever sub-30 minute performance in this event. The 10,000 record would remain on the books as the world record until the 2016 Olympics when it was smashed by Ethiopian Almaz Ayana. On September 11, she finished second in 1500 m behind her teammate, Qu Yunxia in another world record breaking race. Qu ran 3:50.46 (world record at the time) against Wang's 3:51.92. Four years later, Bo Jiang and Yinglai Lang ran slightly faster than Wang in the same race. Qu's record remained on the books until it was finally beaten by Genzebe Dibaba of Ethiopia when she ran 3:50.07 at the Herculis meet in Monaco on July 15, 2015. Wang is currently fifth on the all-time list. In 3000 m heats on September 12, Wang's teammates broke the 3000 m world record in the first heat. This world record was just briefly held, when it was erased by Wang in the second heat. The next day she claimed the 3000 m in another record time 8:06.11. She also won the World Cup Marathon Championships later in the year. In 1994, she was awarded the Jesse Owens prize on the remarkable performances in 1993. She was the first and only Chinese and Asian person to win the prize. Although she won the Asian Games in 10,000 m with a world-leading time (30:50.34) later in the year in Hiroshima, her world-record breaking form was obviously gone. In 1995, Wang and her teammates broke up with their coach Ma due to prize money and his harsh coaching style. After a short period of training on their own without a major success, Wang started to train under coach Mao Dezhen to prepare for the 1996 Olympics. In Nanjing, she announced a comeback in the Olympics Trials, where she ran quality times in both 5000 m and 10,000 m. 1996 Olympics At the 1996 Summer Olympics, Wang won the new Olympic event, women's 5000 m (14:59.88) and a silver in the 10,000 m (31:02.58) just a second behind Portuguese Fernanda Ribeiro. Ribeiro made a heroic final lap kick that surprised Wang and perhaps because she was not used to being challenged, she was unable to react to it. In fact, not only did both women's performances better the previous Olympic record in the 10,000 m, they ran it in such high temperatures that officials were handing out cups of water in the middle of the race, like a marathon. She retired after the Olympics and married Zhan Yu. After retirement The Guardian reported in 2001 that Wang was living anonymously in Beijing. In 2008 Wang and her husband Huang Tianwen moved to Denver, Colorado.Athletics Weekly, 13 December 2012, p 62 In 2012, she told the Spanish newspaper El Pais that she was writing her autobiography. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) listed Wang in its Hall of Fame. Wang was the only Chinese athlete to repeat her 1993 successes at the 1996 Olympics, under Coach Mao, though Qu had managed a bronze medal at the 1992 Olympics. However, there were doping allegations about her 1993 performances. Yuan Weimin, former Director General of the State General Administration of Sports and Chairperson of the Chinese Olympic Committee, had confirmed in 2009 in his book that six athletes by her former coach Ma Junren were dropped from the 2000 Summer Olympics because they were tested positive for doping. Coach Ma was also fired from the Chinese national team in 2000. During the 2012 Summer Olympics, a journalist even lumped Wang and compatriot Qu Yunxia into a group of so-called \\"chemical sisters\\". On February 3, 2016, Tencent Sports exclusively published a March 1995 letter reportedly from Wang and nine other athletes under Ma's tutelage. In it, they alleged Coach Ma forced them to dope. Zhao Yu, the investigative author who had received the letter, said Wang and others came forward because Coach Ma had told them to take personal responsibilities, should they get caught. The letter was initially published in 2015 in Zhao's book, but only gained traction in Feb 2016. The story raised suspicion over the legitimacy of Wang's world records. The IAAF confirmed it had reach out to the Chinese Athletics Association for verification and would investigate, but the latter has yet to respond. The IAAF was expected to discuss a proposal to wipe all pre-2005 world records in August 2017, due to it having only stored blood and urine samples since 2005.

It is long, which makes it the eighth longest river in New Zealand. For its first , the river runs in a generally southeastern direction. It then turns northeast, running down a long straight valley between the Inland and Seaward Kaikoura Ranges. At the end of the Seaward Kaikouras, the river meanders through undulating hill country before draining into the Pacific Ocean near the town of Clarence. A large part of the river is within the boundaries of Molesworth Station. Northern tributaries along the middle segment of Waiau Toa / Clarence River (e.g., Mead Stream, Dee Stream, Branch Stream, Muzzle Stream) cut through an uplifted, folded and rotated block of limestone and marl that accumulated on the seafloor from the late Cretaceous through the Paleocene and middle Eocene (75‚Äì45 million years ago). Exposures of this limestone‚Äîthe Amuri Limestone‚Äîprovide some of the most complete records for this time interval of Earth's history.

Elevation is approx 100 meters. The town was named after the Black Ball Shipping Line, which leased land in the area to mine for coal. Blackball was a centre of New Zealand radicalism and workers' militancy. It is credited as the birthplace of the New Zealand Labour Party, which followed the 1908 miners 'cribtime' strike, at ten weeks the longest in New Zealand history. In the 1913 Great Strike, Blackball miners were the last to return to work, in 1914. During the strike they had picketed miners in nearby Brunner and had burnt down the secretary of the 'arbitration' (scab) union's home. In 1925 the headquarters of the Communist Party of New Zealand moved to Blackball from Wellington. The pit closed in 1964. In the 2013 New Zealand census, the resident population was 291, a decrease of 36 from 2006. History The gold rush in the Moonlight district in 1864-65 heralded the birth of Blackball. In November 1865 a gold nugget was found in what was later called Blackball Creek but it wasn't until 1866 that gold in payable quantities was found in upper Blackball Creek. At the time, this area was known as Garden Gully but as gold continued to be found, it became known as Croesus. As the number of gold miners continued to increase, the difficulties of supplying them with food multiplied. The Plateau (later to be known as Blackball) was used as an over- night stop in the two-day journey from Greymouth. Huts and small store sheds gradually formed a small township which became known as Blackball. Blackball Workingmens Club is one of the few old community organisations left in the town. Both the Oddfellows Lodge and the Buffaloes Lodge closed long ago. In its heyday Blackball had a Lodge of the Oddfellows Order. The Oddfellows Lodge played a major role in community life offering financial aid and self- improvement in the age before TV and State Social Security. The Oddfellows Hall was a major center of community activity and social life. The Blackball lodge of the United Ancient Order of Druids was formed originally in 1906 and like most other organisations of its day has ceased to exist in Blackball. While most businesses and organisations have shut down in the town of Blackball, the hotel once named \\"The Blackball Hilton\\" still lives on. Though now known as \\"Formerly the Blackball Hilton\\" due to a lawsuit by the Hilton hotel chain, the historic hotel remains in business as a place to sleep and symbol of the towns historic background. On 7 June 1941 the Blackball Lodge No 80 of the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes was opened In the Oddfellows Lodge Hall by the Provincial Grand Primo of the West Coast Bro. T.J.Preston KoM. The founders of the lodge were Bro. T.Durkin C.P. and Bro. T Nicolson C.P. both of whom would cycle 35 Miles every fortnight just to attend lodge meetings of Blackball Lodge and thus fulfill their duties as Founders. The first officers of the Blackball Lodge No 80 were Bro. Durkin C.P.(Worthy Primo) Bro. Nicholson C.P. (Alderman of Benevolence) Bro. R. Cooke (City Chamberlain) Bro. J Moore (City Marshall) Bro. Reid (City Tyler) Bro. R Duggan (City Registrar) Bro. R Mountford (City Constable) Bro. A Ross (City Waiter) Bro. Johnston (City Minstrel) Bro. J Barry (City Treasurer) and Bro. M O'Flaherty (City Secretary)  Railway  Blackball was the terminus of the New Zealand Railways Department's Blackball Branch, a branch line from the Stillwater‚ÄìWestport Line. The line was approved in 1901, construction began in 1902 under the auspices of the Public Works Department, trains first ran in 1909, and it was officially opened on 1 August 1910. Private interests constructed a steep extension from Blackball into the Paparoa Ranges that employed the Fell mountain railway system to aid braking. This extension was later taken over by the State Mines Department and was known as the Roa Incline. Passenger services operated to Blackball until 1940, primarily for the benefit of miners. Coal was the mainstay of the railway, and when tonnages dropped to an unsustainable level the Roa Incline closed on 25 July 1960. Trains to Blackball became increasingly infrequent, and when a flood destroyed two spans of the line's bridge over the Grey River on 21 February 1966, the Railways Department viewed repairs as unjustifiably expensive and closed the line. Blackball's station building had been destroyed by fire in 1955. Restaurants, museums and recreation The Blackball Museum of Working Class History opened in the town on 1 May 2010, in order to \\"celebrate the role working people have played in creating the infrastructure and wealth of a nation, [and] the part working people have played in creating society\\".Home The 'Formerly the Blackball Hilton' was founded in 1910 as the Dominion Hotel, renaming itself after the mine manager, after whom the town's main street is also named. It was forced to change its name after objections from the international hotel chain of the same name. An annual cycle race, the Blackball Working Men's Cycling Classic, was held in the town in January for three years: 2010‚Äì12.http://www.sportsground.co.nz/clubsite.asp?siteid=15682&pageid;=56150&pagetypeid;=1 Cyclists raced between Blackball and the nearby settlement of Atarau (Moonlight).  Literature  Blackball has a unique literary inheritance: for a small town, it has managed to attract more than its share of literary representations. Bill Pearson's \\"Coal Flat\\" (1963) is a major New Zealand novel in the dated social realist tradition. Pearson had taught in the town as a probationary teacher in 1942, and had formed a friendship with the publican's family. His book caused a bit of a storm amongst the locals, as they tried to \\"spot the character\\" - who had Pearson based these people on? He died in 2002. Cover of Bill Pearson's 1963 novel, Coal Flat.

He was a pioneer in research linking smoking to health problems. With Ernst Wynder, Bradford Hill and Evarts Graham, he was credited with being the first to prove that smoking caused :lung cancer and increased the risk of :heart disease. (German studies had suggested a link as early as the 1920s but were forgotten or ignored until the 1990s.) He also carried out pioneering work on the relationship between radiation and leukaemia as well as that between asbestos and lung cancer, and alcohol and :breast cancer. On 28 June 2012 he was the subject of an episode of The New Elizabethans, a series broadcast on BBC Radio Four to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, dealing with 60 public figures from her reign. Biography Doll was born at Hampton, Middlesex (now part of south- west London) into an affluent family, though his father's work as a doctor was cut short by multiple sclerosis. Educated first at Westminster School, Doll originally then intended (against the wishes of his parents that he become a doctor like his father) to study mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge. Doll claimed to have failed the mathematics scholarship from the effects of drinking 3 pints of the College's 8% alcohol own-brewed beer the night before. He subsequently chose to study medicine at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School, King's College London from where he graduated in 1937. Doll was a socialist, and one of the significant figures in the Socialist Medical Association whose campaign helped lead to the creation of Britain's postwar National Health Service. He joined the Royal College of Physicians after the outbreak of World War II and served for much of the war as a part of the Royal Army Medical Corps on a hospital ship as a medical specialist. After the war, Doll returned to St Thomas' to research asthma. In 1948 he joined a research team under Dr Francis Avery-Jones at the Central Middlesex Hospital, run under the auspices of the statistical research unit of the Medical Research Council. Over a 21-year career in the unit, Doll rose to become its director. His research there initially focused on the role of occupational factors in causing peptic ulcers. In 1950, he then undertook with Austin Bradford Hill a study of lung cancer patients in twenty London hospitals, at first under the belief that it was due to the new material tarmac, or motor car fumes, but rapidly discovering that tobacco smoking was the only factor they had in common. Doll himself stopped smoking as a result of his findings, published in the British Medical Journal in 1950, which concluded: Four years later, in 1954 the British doctors study, a study of some 40 thousand doctors over 20 years, confirmed the suggestion, based on which the government issued advice that smoking and lung cancer rates were related. In 1955 Doll reported a case controlled study that has firmly established the relationship between asbestos and lung cancer. In 1966 Doll was elected to the Royal Society. The citation stated: In 1969 Doll moved to Oxford University, to sit as the Regius Professor of Medicine, succeeding the clinical researcher Sir George Pickering. Initially, epidemiology was held in low regard, but in his time at Oxford he helped reverse this. He was the primary agent behind the creation of Green College, which was founded in 1979. Doll was appointed the first Warden of Green College, from where he retired in 1983. Green College merged with Templeton College in 2008 to become Green Templeton College, which is located on the site that was previously Green College. Doll also helped found the National Blood Service, and was key in avoiding a system of paying donors for their blood, as had been adopted in the United States. His continued work into carcinogens at the Imperial Cancer Research Centre at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, working as part of the Clinical Trial Service Unit, notably including a study undertaken with Sir Richard Peto, in which it was estimated that tobacco, along with infections and diet, caused between them three- quarters of all cancers, which was the basis of much of the World Health Organization's conclusions on environmental pollution and cancer. Doll was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1966, knighted in 1971, and awarded the Edward Jenner Medal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1981. Also in 1981, Doll became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. In 1996 he was made a Companion of Honour (CH) for \\"services of national importance\\". International honours included the Presidential Award of the New York Academy of Sciences as well as a United Nations Award for his research into cancer. In April 2005, he was awarded the Saudi Arabian King Faisal International Prize for medicine jointly with Peto for their work on diseases related to smoking. In 2004, he was awarded the inaugural Shaw Prize for Life Sciences and Medicine for his contribution to modern cancer epidemiology. He was also awarded honorary degrees by thirteen different universities. He was a supporter of the Liberal Democrats at the 2005 general election. He died on 24 July 2005, at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford after a short illness. On 7 June 2015, a blue plaque was unveiled at his home at 12 Rawlinson Road. He was also an atheist. Building The Richard Doll Building, Oxford. The Richard Doll Building, designed by Nicholas Hare Architects in 2006, was named in his honour and opened shortly before his death. It houses the Clinical Trial Service Unit, Cancer Epidemiology Unit and National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit. The building received an RIBA Award in 2007. A plaque inside the building contains the following quotation from Doll: One of the buildings of the Institute of Cancer Research in Sutton, London is also named after Sir Richard Doll. Research funding After Richard Doll's death, some controversy arose over aspects of his research funding when his papers, held at the Wellcome Library, indicated that for many years he had received consultancy payments from chemical companies whose products he was to defend in court. These include US$1,500 per day consultancy fee from Monsanto Company for a relationship which began in 1976 and continued until 2002. During this period Doll wrote to a Royal Commission in Australia investigating whether the Monsanto-produced herbicide Agent Orange, which was used during the Vietnam War, was carcinogenic, claiming that there was no evidence that it caused cancer. He also received ¬£15,000 from the Chemical Manufacturers Association, Dow Chemicals, and ICI for a review published in 1988 that concluded that workplace exposure to vinyl chloride did not increase the chance of contracting cancer, with the exception of angiosarcoma of the liver, contradicting two previous reviews by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer. Some donations, including a ¬£50,000 gift from asbestos company Turner and Newall, were given in public ceremony to Green College, Oxford, but most fees and payments remained undisclosed to the public, Oxford University and colleagues until his death. His defenders point out that his connections to industry were widely known by those in the field, that he did his work before formal disclosure of commercial interests became commonplace and that on occasion, he came to conclusions that were unpalatable to the companies who consulted him. His own view, as reported by Richard Peto- who criticised the allegations, claiming they originated with people aiming to damage Doll's reputation- was that it was necessary to co-operate with companies for access to data which could prove their products to be dangerous. Peto said also that Doll gave all his fees from such work to Green College, Oxford, which he had founded. Some controversy arose over the fact that he did not publish a paper on 'A tentative estimate of the leukaemogenic effects of test thermonuclear explosions' in the Journal of Radiation Protection in 1955 which stated that 'there is no threshold [radiation] dose below which no effect is produced' in humans. He withdrew it on advice from the Sir Harold Himswoth, Secretary of the MRC (Medical Research Council), who in turn was advised by the Atomic Energy Authority not to publish because it would be contrary to their interests. It was only published in 1996 when this kind of view was more acceptable view to the Nuclear Industry.

Baker, (born September 4, 1942) is a Canadian politician and former member of the Senate of Canada. Baker was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1974 election as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Gander‚ÄîTwillingate, in Newfoundland and Labrador. He was re-elected in every subsequent election (representing Gander‚ÄîGrand Falls after 1988) until his appointment to the Senate by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien, in 2002. Although a popular and articulate MP, he was hurt by the tradition of appointing no more than one Canadian Cabinet minister from Newfoundland at a time, and by his reputation as a maverick who said what he thought rather than what the party leadership would like him to say. Fred Mifflin's and Brian Tobin's appointments to cabinet following the 1993 election meant Baker had to remain on the backbench. Tobin's resignation from the cabinet to become Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador opened the way for Baker to be appointed as Minister of Veterans Affairs. But when Prime Minister Chr√©tien lured Tobin back to Ottawa for the 2000 election, Baker was removed from Cabinet. He was appointed to the Senate in 2002. On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal Senators, including Baker, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents.http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-removes-senators- from-liberal-caucus-1.2515273 According to Senate Opposition leader James Cowan, the Senators refer to themselves as the Senate Liberal Caucus even though they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus.

This prompted a rebuke from the Prime Minister's office and political commentators in Toronto and Ottawa. Some Conservative MPs demanded that Michael Ignatieff kick him out of the Liberal caucus, that he refused to do. However, this action caused little outcry in his home province.

In 1969, he began a nine-year association with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi before beginning his career as an author and personal relationship counselor. In 1992 he published the book Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, which became a long term best seller and formed the central theme of all his subsequent books and career activities. His books have sold millions of copies. Early life and education Gray was born in Houston, Texas, in 1951 to a father who was an oil executive and a mother who worked at a spiritual bookshop, and grew up with five brothers. His parents were both Christians and taught him Yoga and took him to visit Indian Saint Yogananda during his childhood. The Autobiography of A Yogi inspired him greatly later in life. He received a bachelor's and master's degree in the Science of Creative Intelligence, though sources vary on whether these degrees were received from either the non-accredited Maharishi European Research University (MERU) in Switzerland or the accredited Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa. Gray received an unaccredited PhD degree by correspondence in 1982 from Columbia Pacific University (CPU), a now-defunct institution located in San Rafael, California upon completion of a correspondence course and an honorary doctorate from Governors State University in Illinois after he delivered their commencement address in 2002.

With regard to online pornography Gray stated, \\"With free internet porn, there's a massive addiction happening,\\" adding that there are \\"just millions and millions of people... experiencing their sexual satisfactions through total fantasy. The effect that porn has on the brain is like taking heroin.\\" With regard to the rise of infidelity sites like Ashley Madison and Arrangement Finders he states, \\"When you have impersonal sex.... 'It's OK, here are these cheating wives, men, they want to have sex with you'... So you go have sex with someone that you don't know and someone you don't love... impersonal sex does promote addiction to sex,\\" he adds, \\"it's along the same line of pornography.\\" Criticism In 2002, author Julia T.

He is a professor at the University of Girona and was the Minister of Territorial Policy and Public Works of the Catalan Government, the Generalitat de Catalunya, from December 2003 to December 2010.  Years as mayor of Girona (1979-2002)  In 1979, he was the first mayor of Girona democratically elected after the Spanish transition, from the PSC). He resigned in 2002, in favour of his substitute Anna Pagans i Gruartmoner, also from the PSC. During his term of office as mayor of Girona, he launched the reform of the Barri Vell (1982), together with the promotion of the Call Jueu, the ancient Jewish neighbourhood. He also put into practice the widening and improvement of the social services‚Äô infrastructures, bringing balance to the inequalities among neighbourhoods. As mayor of Girona, he also held the post of president of the Federation of Catalan Municipalities (1981‚Äì1985). He was the PSC candidate for the presidency of the Generalitat in the 1995 elections for the Catalan Parliament, of which he was member from 1984 to 2012. He is the first secretary of the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC) at Girona since 2008. Period in Catalan government (2003-2010) In the year 2003, he joined the government of Pasqual Maragall (PSC) as Councillor of Territorial Policy and Public Works, also serving as the Spokesman of the Catalan Government. He was considered the fourth-ranking member of the government. Nadal presided the Department of Territorial Policy and Public Works in 2005 during the crisis of El Carmel, when construction work to lengthen Barcelona Metro line 5 caused a building to collapse and forced the evacuation of 84 other buildings. Convergence and Union, then the opposition group in the Catalan Parliament, called on Nadal to resign, considering him the councillor responsible for the safety of public works projects, whereas the government blamed the opposition party for poor planning of the project during the last government of Jordi Pujol. As head of the department, Nadal promoted and approved the Catalan Plan for Transport Infrastructures to regulate all new road and railway infrastructures of Catalonia until 2026. The plan included a railway cross axis to link central Catalonia with the Lleida and Girona areas. When the governing three-party coalition was broken by the removal of those councillors belonging to the Republican Left of Catalonia in May 2006, Nadal became Councillor of the Presidency, a position he held until the end of the legislature later that year. In November 2006, the newly elected President of the Generalitat, Jos√© Montilla, reappointed him Councillor of Territorial Policy and Public Works. Opposition leader Nadal became the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of Catalonia in December 2012, upon constitution of the 9th Legislature, with Convergence and Union forming a minority government and the Socialists' Party of Catalonia as the opposition party with the most seats. On September 3, 2012, the executive committee of the Socialists' Party of Catalonia decided to replace the party's leadership in Parliament, including Nadal. He was also opposition leader from 1995 to 1999.  Political thought  Among his political stances, he has shown his willingness to consider the granting immigrants the right to vote in municipal elections, which must be conceived, according to his own words, as a ‚Äúlimited ruled project‚Äù, ‚Äúwith the utmost rigor‚Äù but with a series of ‚Äúcautions‚Äù as, for instance, that the only immigrants with right to vote should be those from countries with which a ‚Äúreciprocity‚Äù agreement exists.  Academic career and publications  Nadal has intermittently taught at the University of Liverpool (1970‚Äì1972), the Autonomous University of Barcelona (1972‚Äì1992) and the University of Girona (since 1992). His research work has been devoted to the 18th century in Catalonia, 19th-century Spanish economic history and local history, concentrating on various contributions to the history of Girona. Nadal did not run in the 2012 Catalan parliamentary election, announcing he planned to return to his teaching duties at the University of Girona. Nadal has also published a number of books, such as:  (1988) * (1991) * (1999) * (2003) * (2003) * Responsible for the edition of the work by Emili Grahit i Papell, Memorias de un ex-alcalde gerundense (2003). * (2005), a collection of most of his biographical articles published in the press, Dietari 2003. * (2006) * (2006) * (2006) * (2008). *.

After recording the material for their first album, Too Blind to Hear, Walworth committed suicide. Although shocked by this event, the remaining members of the band (Walworth being replaced by lead guitar Matt Parker later on) carried on with the release of the album, in tribute to their deceased partner. It appeared in September 2002 in UK, and was released in the United States in March 2004. In 2003, the band played themselves in the two-part UK TV drama Final Demand for BBC One. The movie featured English actress Tamzin Outhwaite. In August 2003, the band played at Festival Internacional de Benic√†ssim in Spain. The follow-up 2005 album, Head Towards The Dawn (on which Garrison and Pemberton were the only remaining band players), was released in Spain only. The band announced its end in the later part of 2006. After the demise of the band, John Garrison embarked on to a solo career; Chris Pemberton has been playing keyboards with John Grant.

He was an advisor to Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang (KMT) in China during the 1920s. Born in a rural part of the Russian Empire (now Belarus), to a Jewish family, Borodin joined the General Jewish Labour Bund at age sixteen, and then the Bolsheviks in 1903. After being arrested for participating in revolutionary activities, Borodin fled to America, attended Valparaiso University, started a family, and later established an English school for Russian Jewish immigrants in Chicago. Upon the success of the October Revolution in 1917, Borodin returned to Russia, and served in various capacities in the new Soviet government. From 1919, he served as an agent of the Comintern, travelling to various countries to spread the Bolshevik revolutionary cause. In 1923, Vladimir Lenin picked Borodin to lead a Comintern mission to China, where he was tasked with aiding Sun Yat-sen and his Kuomintang. Following Sun's death, Borodin assisted in the planning of the Northern Expedition, and later became an integral backer of the KMT leftist government in Wuhan. Following a purge of communists from the Kuomintang, Borodin was forced to return to the Soviet Union in 1927, where he would remain for the rest of his life. He once again served in various positions within the Soviet government, and later helped found the English-language Moscow News newspaper, of which he would become the editor-in-chief. During the Second World War, he additionally served as editor-in-chief of the Soviet Information Bureau. Amidst rising antisemitism in the Soviet Union during the late 1940s, Borodin was arrested, and deported to a prison camp. He died in 1951, and was officially rehabilitated in 1964. Early life Borodin was born Mikhail Markovich Gruzenberg () to a Jewish family in Yanovichi, Russian Empire, now part of Vitebsk Region, Belarus, on 9 July 1884. At a very young age, he began work as a boatman on the Western Dvina, traversing the stretch of the river between Vitebsk, Dvinsk, and Riga, now the capital of Latvia. He later moved to Riga, where he attended Russian-language night schools while working in the city's port. He joined the General Jewish Labour Bund at age sixteen, switching allegiance to Vladimir Lenin's Bolsheviks in 1903. He became a close associate of Lenin, making use of his knowledge of the Yiddish, German, and Latvian languages in work as a Bolshevik agent in the empire's northwest region. In mid-1904, he was ordered to travel to Switzerland to meet Lenin, who had gone into exile. Following the \\"Bloody Sunday\\" massacre of unarmed protesters by Tsarist troops in Saint Petersburg on 9 January 1905, Borodin returned to Russia, organised revolutionary activity in Riga, and was later selected to attend the Bolshevik conference at Tampere, where he met Joseph Stalin. In 1906, he attended the 4th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in Stockholm. Later that year, he was picked up by the Tsarist police in Saint Petersburg, and given the choice of either being sent to Siberia or exile in Europe. Borodin chose exile, and by October, he had arrived in London, where police took notice of his activities and promptly ordered him out of the country. In 1907, he arrived in America, first to Boston, and then on to Chicago. While there, he attended classes at Valparaiso University in Indiana, taught English to immigrant children at Jane Addams' Hull House, and then opened his own school for Russian Jewish immigrants, which later grew into a successful business venture. During his time in the United States, Borodin associated nominally with the Socialist Party of America, whilst simultaneously promoting the Russian revolutionary cause in the immigrant community. Following the October Revolution of 1917, he returned to Russia in July 1918, and began working in the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Soviet Republic. Some months later, he returned to America to relay Lenin's \\"Letter to American Workers\\", a propaganda message intended to counteract negative views of the Russian communists following the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. He also proposed a joint propaganda campaign with George Creel's Committee on Public Information, though this never came to fruition. Having become disillusioned by the intensity of American criticism of the new Soviet government, Borodin gave up hope of co- operation with the Americans, and returned to Russia. He then moved on to Stockholm, where he met American writer Carl Sandburg, with whom he discussed the Bolshevik revolution. In March 1919, Borodin participated in the first congress of the Communist International (Comintern) in Moscow. After the congress, he embarked on his first Comintern assignment, travelling with a falsified Mexican diplomatic passport. Borodin travelled through a variety of European countries, deposited Soviet funds in a Swiss bank account, and otherwise tried to raise money to finance the establishment of communist parties in the Americas. He then travelled to Santo Domingo, from which he booked passage to New York, where he arrived in August 1919. His mission was known to the American authorities, and as such he was briefly detained by the Bureau of Investigation upon arrival. After his release, he went on to his former home, Chicago, where the Socialist Party of America was embroiled in a dispute between its left wing, who wanted to establish a communist party and join the Comintern, and the \\"regulars\\", who were opposed. Borodin, conscious of the fact that his activities were being monitored, kept a low profile while in America, and on 4 October 1919, he slipped across the border into Mexico. In Mexico, he met Indian revolutionary M. N. Roy, the American writers Carleton Beals and Michael Gold, and American communist Charles Phillips. Borodin taught Roy about the Russian Revolution and communism, and it was under Borodin's influence that he took up communist beliefs. Together with the newly emboldened Roy, he helped establish the Mexican Communist Party. During his time in Mexico, Borodin sent reports of Roy's exploits to Lenin, who subsequently invited him to attend the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern in Moscow, which would take place in July‚ÄìAugust 1920. Leaving Mexico in December 1919, Borodin, Roy, and Phillips travelled to western Europe, where they intended to spread the communist cause in the lead up to the congress, specifically hoping to establish a communist party in Spain. Arriving in Moscow in the weeks before the congress, Borodin introduced Roy to Lenin, after which he went on to become a major figure in the Comintern. Borodin later returned to Britain, where he was tasked with ascertaining the cause of the revolution's failure there, and reorganising the British Communist Party. After several months of covert activities, he was jailed for six months on 29 August 1922 in Glasgow, ostensibly for breaking immigration regulations, though his political mission was known. He was then deported to Russia. Upon his arrival in Moscow, Lenin informed him that he had been chosen as the leader of a Comintern mission to China. He reached Beijing in the latter part of 1923, and arrived in Guangzhou, the seat of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary government, on 6 October. China Advisor to Sun Yat-sen (1924‚Äì1925) Following Sun Yat-sen's request for help from the Comintern, Borodin was ordered to lead a contingent of Soviet advisors to Guangzhou, where Sun had established a revolutionary government in the aftermath of the Constitutional Protection Movement. Borodin understood no Chinese; English was to be the medium of discussion between the two. He was known for speaking with a clear midwestern American accent that offered no indication of his Russian origin, allowing him to easily communicate with the largely anglophone and American- educated leadership of the Kuomintang (KMT). Greeted upon his arrival in Guangzhou by Eugene Chen, with whom he later became close, Borodin found that Sun's government was teetering on the brink of collapse. Faced with rampant corruption, anti-Bolshevik feeling in parts of the KMT, and the ever-present threat of the warlords and the Beijing-based Beiyang government, Borodin was tasked with reforming the Kuomintang into a potent revolutionary force. Borodin in Nanchang, 1926 He negotiated the First United Front between Sun's KMT and the nascent Communist Party of China (CPC), convincing that party, which consisted of only about 300 members at that time, that the alliance was in its long-term interest, as it would facilitate the organisation of both urban and rural workers. Under Borodin's tutelage, both parties were reorganised on the Leninist principle of democratic centralism, and training institutes for mass organisation were established, such as the Peasant Training Institute, where the young Mao Zedong served, and the Whampoa Military Academy, which trained officers for the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek. He arranged shipments of Soviet arms and shrewdly kept a balance between the middle-class elements of the KMT and the more radical CPC. When the forces of rebel general Chen Jiongming threatened Sun's base in Guangzhou in November 1923, Borodin proposed a mobilisation of the masses in defence of the city. To accomplish this, he suggested a promise of redistribution of landlord property to the local peasantry, an eight-hour working day for urban labourers, and a minimum wage. Sun rejected land reform because of strong opposition from some of his allies, though agreed to the proposals in principle, and offered a 25% rent reduction instead. In the event, Sun's military forces were able to drive the rebels away, and the rent reduction proposal was never implemented. In 1924, KMT leaders gradually grew weary of the influence of the Communist Party. When Borodin was confronted on this subject, he stated that continued Soviet aid was linked to co-operation with the communists. Leading figures in the CPC, including Mao Zedong, however, came to advocate an end to co-operation. Borodin made clear to them that their continued participation in the United Front was both necessary and expected. When a group of American supporters of the KMT attempted to warn Sun of the danger of the growing Soviet influence in his party, asking, in a subtle anti-semitic attack, whether Sun knew Borodin's real name, Sun replied that it was \\"Lafayette\\". In the latter part of 1924, Borodin travelled to meet the \\"Christian General\\" Feng Yuxiang, whom he attempted to bring into the Kuomintang fold. Feng and Borodin got along well, and although Feng did not join the KMT at this juncture, he did allow KMT propagandists and agitators to embed with his army, bolstering its cause. After Sun's death: the Northern Expedition (1925‚Äì1927) After Sun's death in 1925, the growth of a radical peasant and worker movement continued to be encouraged by the CPC, but was opposed by many in the KMT. The leftist wing of the KMT was strengthened by the Canton‚ÄìHong Kong strike, which broke out amidst anti-imperialist fervour after the British-run police force of the Shanghai International Settlement opened fire on Chinese protestors on 30 May 1925. Borodin wrote that: \\"[the Canton‚ÄìHong Kong strike] was really not an economic strike. It was the quintessence of the anti-imperialist movement and the most militant expression of that movement. That it concentrated on Great Britain was not a matter of specific policy. Had it been Formosa or the Philippines it would have been directed against Japan or America. It was a political strike pure and simple\\". Against this backdrop of rising leftist influence, in November 1925, a faction of anti-communist KMT members called the \\"Western Hills Group\\" met near Beijing, where they issued a declaration terminating Borodin's relationship with the KMT, and expelling all communists from the party. This pronouncement had no effect, and Chiang Kai-shek wrote an open letter defending Borodin, the communists, and the KMT's relationship with the Soviet Union. Borodin making a speech in Wuhan, 1927 The following year, however, Borodin gradually came into conflict with Chiang, who was vying for the position of Sun's successor. Borodin initially opposed Chiang's planned Northern Expedition to reunify China, and grew concerned about Chiang's growing standing in the NRA. When Borodin went north in another attempt to bring Feng Yuxiang and his Guominjun into the Kuomintang in early 1926, Chiang began preparations to consolidate his position in Guangzhou. Borodin's fears were then realised in March 1926, when Chiang launched the \\"Canton Coup\\" purge of hardline leftists who opposed the launch of the expedition. Following the purge, Borodin returned from the north on Chiang's request, began negotiations, and reached a narrow compromise to hold the First United Front together. On Joseph Stalin's suggestion, Borodin agreed to continue Soviet aid to the KMT, and to support the Northern Expedition, which began in July 1926. At a Comintern conference in November 1926, Stalin explained his continued support for the KMT, saying that \\"The exit of Chinese communists from the Kuomintang would be the gravest error\\", going on to argue that the CPC needed to work through the new government, forming a bridge between the state and the peasantry. Borodin agreed, noting that the purpose of the Northern Expedition was \\"not the establishment of a proletarian state, but the creation of conditions which would give an impetus to the mass movement\\". In Borodin's view, the goal of the China mission was to facilitate a bourgeois-democratic revolution led by an alliance of workers, peasants, petite bourgeoisie and bourgeoisie, so as to create the conditions necessary for a future proletarian revolution. With tensions between the left and right threatening to break into armed conflict in Guangzhou, Borodin became convinced that it was necessary to expand the base of the anti-imperialist movement, providing adequate space for both factions. For this reason, he had agreed to support the Northern Expedition. Borodin and a group of Soviet military advisers led by Vasily Blyukher (known by the alias \\"Galen\\") were responsible for planning the expedition. Whilst Chiang Kai-shek had been named commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army, he was not personally involved in the planning phase of the operation. Having studied the history of the mid-19th century Taiping Rebellion, Borodin decided that the expedition should head inland toward Hankou, an industrial and commercial centre with a large worker class, so as to avoid conflict with British and Japanese interests in the Shanghai area. As the expedition progressed, Borodin moved together with the KMT government from Guangzhou to Hankou, which was merged with two other cities to form Wuhan. Chiang, who refused to move his headquarters from Nanchang to Wuhan, gradually came into conflict with the Wuhan government from December 1926. In a startling turn of events, Borodin's wife Fanya was captured by White Russian mercenaries employed by warlord Zhang Zongchang whilst travelling on board the ship Pamyat Lenina between Shanghai and Wuhan on 28 February 1927, after which she was held hostage in Jinan, Shandong. Borodin's anxieties heightened even further in April 1927, when Chiang initiated a new purge of KMT leftists and communists, known as the \\"Shanghai Massacre\\". Borodin and the communists then sided with the left-wing KMT government in Wuhan led by Wang Jingwei and Eugene Chen against Chiang's rival Nanjing government. KMT attacks on communists and peasant leaders would continue, however, and even Wuhan army leader Tang Shengzhi's forces harassed local communist groups, preventing their access to Wuhan's armouries. Flight from China (1927) On 1 June 1927, Stalin sent a secret telegram to Borodin and M. N. Roy, who was also in Wuhan, ordering the mobilisation of an army of workers and peasants. The telegram was discussed at a meeting of the CPC politburo, where it was decried by both Borodin and CPC leaders as an impractical \\"fairy tale from overseas\\". Borodin, who was more familiar with Stalin's inner workings, interpreted the instructions as a ploy to relinquish blame for their inevitable failure, whilst Roy thought they signalled a long- awaited quickening of the Chinese revolution. Without consulting anyone, Roy decided to show the telegram to Wang, who was alarmed by its contents. Instead of reassuring Wang, the revelation of the telegram's message drove him to the right, upon which he decided to purge the communists from his administration and reconcile with Chiang Kai-shek. Borodin, along with all other Soviet representatives, was ordered to leave China in July 1927. He refused to leave, however, until his wife, still imprisoned in Jinan, was freed, and was in the meantime harboured by T. V. Soong in his family's house. The Japanese, who considered Shandong within their sphere of influence, bribed a judge to release Fanya on 12 July. Formally seen off by the leaders of the Wuhan government, Mikhail left Wuhan by private train on 27 July. He was accompanied on his journey by Sun Yat-sen's widow Soong Ching-ling, Eugene Chen's son Percy Chen, and other Russian and Chinese revolutionary figures. \\"The revolution extends to the Yangtze River\\", Borodin told a reporter as they began their journey, \\"if a diver were sent down to the bottom of this yellow stream he would rise again with an armful of shattered hopes\\". He went on to say \\"When the next Chinese general comes to Moscow and shouts 'Hail to the world revolution', better send at once for the GPU. All that any of them want is rifles\\". Whilst Fanya made her own way out of country, Borodin, with a bounty on his head, travelled first to Zhengzhou, where he was received by Feng Yuxiang, and then continued through Gansu and across Mongolia to Russia. Though they took different routes, both Mikhail and Fanya arrived in Moscow around the same time in October 1927. Later life Borodin and Roy were blamed for the failure of Stalin's China strategy. Upon their arrival in Moscow, Roy was refused an audience with Stalin, and later fled the USSR with Borodin's help. Borodin, on the other hand, was protected by Stalin, and worked a variety of jobs, including deputy director of the Soviet paper and lumber trust, factory inspector, and as a specialist dealing with immigrants from America at the People's Commissariat for Labour. In 1931, he reconnected with Anna Louise Strong, with whom he had travelled during his trek out of China. Strong had earlier expressed the desire to start an English-language Soviet newspaper. With Borodin's help, she founded the Moscow News in 1930. In 1932, Borodin became editor-in-chief of the newspaper. From 1941, he concurrently served as editor-in-chief of the Soviet Information Bureau. In early 1949, following Strong's attempts to publish a manuscript about the success of Maoism in China, and amidst an antisemitic fervour that had gripped the country following Israel's turn away from the Soviet Union, Borodin and Strong were arrested and the paper shut down. Borodin died two years later on 29 May 1951 at a prison camp near Yakutsk. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1964. Family Borodin married Fanya Orluk, known as \\"Fanny\\", and originally from Vilnius, in Chicago in 1908. He had two sons, Fred Borodin () and , both of whom were American-born. Fred, who rose to the rank of colonel in the Red Army, died during the Second World War, whilst Norman went on to be a Soviet journalist. Influence Borodin is one of the main characters in Andr√© Malraux's 1928 novel Les Conqu√©rants. He also appears in Kenneth Rexroth's poem Another Early Morning Exercise.

Etching by Thomas Lord Busby, ca. 1826. A guard dog or watchdog (not to be confused with an attack dog) is a dog used to guard property against, and watch for, unwanted or unexpected human or animal intruders. The dog is discerning so that it does not annoy or attack the house resident people.  History  cropped ears and docked tail) at the Archaeological Park of Lilybaeum, Marsala, Sicily The use of dogs as guardians is well known since ancient times. The Romans used to put mosaics (Cave canem mosaics) at the entrance of the houses to warn visitors and intruders of the presence of dangerous dogs at the property. One of the first dog types used as guardians were the ancestral mastiff-type landraces of the group known as Livestock guardian dogs which protected livestock against large predators such as wolves, bears and leopards. Orthrus is a famous example of a livestock guardian dog from the Greek mythology known for guarding Geryon's red cattle. Some ancient guard dogs in more urban areas, such as the extinct bandogges, were chained during the day and released at night to protect properties, camps and villages. Barking German Shepherd dog guarding property Both guard dogs and watchdogs bark loudly to alert their owners of an intruder's presence and to scare away the intruder. The watchdog's function ends here; a guard dog is then capable of attacking and/or restraining the intruder. Livestock guardian dogs are often large enough (100-200 lbs.) and strong enough to attack and drive away livestock predators. Some smaller breeds (such as Keeshonds and Tibetan Terriers) are excellent watchdogs, but not guard dogs, because they bark loudly to alert their masters of intruders, but are physically small and not given to assertive behavior. Guard dogs will bark to alert their master and to warn off an approaching animal or human threat prior to their interception of the trespasser. They are different from the smaller watchdogs in that they do not continue barking; they take action. Specifically, livestock guardian dogs such as the Kangal use loud alarm barks as a first line of defense against presumed threats; if these do not deter a perceived foe (either human or animal predators), other displays such as bluffing and charging are employed. For livestock guardians, proactive forms of defense such as bites are only used if all other forms of deterrence fail. The following breeds are the best at watchdog barking: * Doberman Pinscher * German Shepherd Dog * German Spitz (including Keeshond) * Miniature Schnauzer * Scottish Terrier * West Highland White Terrier Presa canario dog If the risk is from human intruders, a suitable dog can be simply trained to be aggressive towards unrecognized humans and then tethered or enclosed unsupervised in an area that the owner wishes to protect when he is not around (such as at night); the stereotypical \\"junkyard dog\\" is a common example of this. If the purpose of the dog is to protect against human intruders after nightfall, a large, dark-colored dog in a dark house (lights off) would give the dog an advantage over the burglar. It is claimed that female dogs tend to make better personal guardians than males, due to maternal instincts, but males are considered better for guarding property because of their greater territorial instinct. That may be true in general, but all dogs are individuals.  Breeds  Many currently prominent guard dogs started as general purpose farm dogs, but gradually developed into guard breeds. Some dog breeds such as the Dobermann and the Brazilian Dogo were carefully developed from the beginning for guard duty. Guard dogs are not restricted to mastiffs. Other dogs, like some shepherd dogs, spitz dogs, cattle dogs and some catch dogs are also great guard dogs as well as being useful as multifunctional dogs, acting as attack dogs, personal protection dogs, police dogs, sport dogs such as schutzhund dogs, etc. Guard dog breeds tend to be territorial, averse to strangers, dominant, and protective and loyal with family. The Fila brasileiro for example has a reputation for being very intolerant of strangers and guests to the home and property. Other fierce guard dogs include breeds and landraces of the Ovtcharka type and other farm guard dogs such as the Boerboel. Some breeds who make excellent guards are more commonly having breed specific legislation passed against them, banning them from some communities and whole countries. Legality The laws regarding ownership and usage of guard dogs vary from country to country. In England the main legislation relating to the use of guard dogs on commercial premises are contained within the 1975 Guard Dogs Act, The act specifies the requirements of kennels and the need to display guard dog warning signs at the entrance to sites.

Placekicker, or simply kicker (PK or K), is the player in gridiron football who is responsible for the kicking duties of field goals and extra points. In many cases, the placekicker also serves as the team's kickoff specialist or punter as well. Specialized role  The kicker initially was not a specialized role. Prior to the 1934 standardization of the prolate spheroid shape of the ball, drop kicking was the prevalent method of kicking field goals and conversions, but even after its replacement by place kicking, until the 1960s the kicker almost always doubled at another position on the roster. George Blanda, Frank Gifford and Paul Hornung are prominent examples of players who were stars at other positions as well as being known for their kicking abilities. When the one-platoon system was abolished in the 1940s, the era of \\"two-way\\" players gave way to increased specialization, teams would employ a specialist at the punter or kicker position. Ben Agajanian, who started his professional career in 1945, was the first confirmed place-kicking specialist in the NFL, kicking for ten teams. (There is some evidence that Ken Strong and Phil Martinovich, both in 1939, and Mose Kelsch, in 1933 and 1934, may have preceded Agajanian as players who spent their seasons doing nothing but kicking.) Mason Crosby playing in 2007. Because of the difference in techniques needed, to avoid leg fatigue, and to reduce the risk of injury, on the professional level most teams employ separate players to handle the jobs. The placekicker usually will only punt when the punter is injured, and vice versa. (One player often handles both jobs in the Canadian Football League, which has smaller active rosters than in the NFL.) A professional team will occasionally even have a kickoff specialist who handles only the kickoffs and serves as a backup to the kicker who handles field goals and extra points. This is typically done to further protect a premier point-scoring kicker from injury or if he, while accurate, does not have sufficient distance on kickoffs. Amateur teams (e.g., college or high school) often do not differentiate between placekickers and punters, have different players assume different placekicking duties (for example, one person handles kicking off, another kicks long field goals, and another kicks from shorter distances), or have regular position players handle kicking duties. The last option is quite common on high school teams, when the best athletes are often the best kickers. Before the modern era of pro football, this was also the case for professional teams, particularly when most placekicks were still made in the \\"straight on\\" style outlined below. Although kickers are protected from direct physical contact on field goal attempts, this is not generally true on kickoffs, and a kicker can see significant contact during a kick return. Kicker Bj√∂rn Nittmo notably suffered severe brain damage from a hit he sustained on a kickoff in 1997. Still, due to their lack of plays in games and lack of contact compared to other positions, the top kickers in the NFL have often had extremely long careers, far beyond that of a typical NFL player. Place kicker is one of the few positions where it is not uncommon for players to be beyond the age of 40. Of the eight players in NFL history who have played beyond the age of 45, six of them are kickers: Morten Andersen, Gary Anderson, John Carney, Ben Agajanian, Adam Vinatieri, and George Blanda. Blanda was the oldest player in NFL history, playing until the age of 48.http://www.oldest.org/sports/nfl-players-america/ Salary and team standing Placekickers and punters are often the lowest paid starters on professional teams, although proven placekickers sometimes earn over $1 million per year in salary. It is not uncommon for placekickers to be some of the smallest members of their team. However, The New York Times in 2011 wrote that NFL kickers had adopted year-round weight training and strict diets. Sebastian Janikowski that year was a and kicker. Kicker Rob Bironas, who was and , noted, \\"I might be bigger than some wide receivers and cornerbacks.\\" The presence of foreign born-and-raised players in the highest levels of gridiron football has largely been limited to placekickers, and more recently to punters from Australia as well. Occasionally, these players come from outside the traditional American high school or college football systems‚Äîand all but one of the women to have played men's American football at the college level were placekickers while the lone exception was a placekick holder. Notably Tom Landry recruited several soccer players from Latin America, such as Efren Herrera and Raphael Septien, to compete for the job of placekicker for the Dallas Cowboys. Cypriot Garo Yepremian was renowned as much for his kicking proficiency as he was for his complete lack of awareness of the sport early in his career. British-born kicker Mick Luckhurst was one of the first UK players in the NFL to have a long career, playing 7 seasons for the Atlanta Falcons during the 1980s and retiring as Atlanta's all time leading scorer. Mexican kicker Raul Allegre played 9 seasons in the NFL and won a Super Bowl in 1986. These anecdotes increase the perception of the placekicker as an outsider. As of 2017, only four kickers have been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame: George Blanda, Lou Groza, Jan Stenerud and Morten Andersen, and among them, Stenerud and Andersen are the only ones who did not also play another position. There is only one special teams player (including punters, return specialists and long snappers) to ever win the NFL's MVP ‚Äì Mark Moseley in 1982. Nevertheless, due to their duties in kicking both field goals and extra points placekickers are usually responsible for scoring more points than any other player on a team, and very often entire football games may come down to a single kick. The top 25 players in NFL history in career scoring are all placekickers. Numbering In the NFL, placekickers, along with punters and quarterbacks, are among the only players allowed to wear single-digit uniform numbers; kickers can also wear numbers between 10 and 19. In college and high school football, kickers can wear any number and usually wear one of an eligible receiver (1 to 49 or 80 to 99). Because kickers are generally less prominent on team rosters, and low uniform numbers are much more widely used among other positions at those levels, kickers are often given high jersey numbers that go unused by other players (such as numbers in the 40s or 90s). The two players in documented football history to have worn the uniform number 100, Chuck Kinder and Bill Bell, were both placekickers. Kicking style Rian Lindell of the Buffalo Bills prepares for a practice field goal kick Placekickers today are predominantly \\"soccer-style\\" kickers, approaching the ball from several steps to the left of it [for a right-footed kicker, or vice versa] and several steps behind, striking the ball with the instep of the foot; all current National Football League kickers use this style. This method of kicking was introduced in 1957 by Fred Bednarski and popularized in the 1960s by kickers like Pete Gogolak and his younger brother Charlie, the first placekicker to be drafted in the first round. Previously, most placekickers used a \\"straight on\\" style, which required the use of a special shoe that is extremely rigid and has a flattened and slightly upturned toe.http://www.wizardkicking.com/images/ACF2C08.jpg In the straight on style, also known as \\"straight-toe\\" style, the kicker approaches the ball from directly behind, rather than from the side, and strikes the ball with the toe. The last full-time straight on placekicker in the NFL was Mark Moseley who retired from the Cleveland Browns after the 1986 season; The last straight on kicker drafted into the NFL was Manny Matsakis from Capital University by the Philadelphia Eagles who went on to become a successful college and CFL Coach. Straight on kickers are relatively uncommon in major college football due to the control and power disadvantages, but straight-on kickers are still seen on high school, small-college, semi-pro and amateur teams. However, both of college football's top awards for kickers are named after former conventional kickers Fred Mitchell and Lou Groza even though the winners are soccer style players. There are variations between soccer style kicking in fact, many of the early soccer style NFL kickers look somewhat different then most of all today's soccer style kickers and there is a difference between the college / preps vs most of the preps taught between kicking schools. Kicking Coach Paul Assad started teaching in the early 2000s what is termed \\"The Power X System\\" method used by most all of his over 51 NFL starting Specialist students such as noteworthy, NFL greats like (Mason Crosby, Sebastian Janikowski, Matt Bryant among others) where there is a notable, differentials of leg alignment, foot position at impact, upper body positioning and sequence as well as \\"Plant Foot\\" positioning. Shoes Placekickers in the modern game usually wear specialized shoes (soccer boots), but in very rare circumstances some prefer to kick barefoot. Tony Franklin was one such barefoot kicker, who played in Super Bowls for the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots. Another was Rich Karlis, who once shared two kicking records - the record for longest field goal in Super Bowl history, kicking a 47-yard field goal in Super Bowl XXI and also for the most field goals in a game, seven for Minnesota in 1989, tying Jim Bakken's record of the time, a record since broken by Rob Bironas. Englishman Rob Hart kicked barefoot during his 7-year NFL Europe career. John Baker also used the style in the 1990s in the Canadian Football League, as did Jos√© Cort√©z in the XFL. The last person to kick barefoot in an NFL game was Jeff Wilkins in 2002. A unique shoe was worn by New Orleans Saints kicker Tom Dempsey; Dempsey had a deformed kicking foot that left him with a flat kicking surface at the front of his foot, and he wore a shoe that accommodated it. After Dempsey kicked a record-setting 63-yard field goal using the special shoe, the league instituted a rule change establishing standards for kicking shoes. This eventually ended Dempsey's kicking career. Barefoot kickers are banned in the vast majority of high school games, due to a rule by the National Federation of State High School Associations, which requires all players to wear shoes. Texas plays by NCAA rules, and therefore barefoot kickers are legal in the Lone Star State.

It is the only member of the genus Deroptyus. It dwells in Ecuador, Suriname, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, areas of northeast Peru, Venezuela, French Guiana and Guyana.  Description  The red-fan parrot possesses elongated neck feathers that can be raised to form an elaborate fan, which greatly increases the bird's apparent size, and is possibly used when threatened. It generally lives in undisturbed forest, feeding in the canopy on fruits. It has a dark brown face with white streaks, bare black patch round its brown eye, green wings, flanks and tail and red and blue barred breast.  Behavior  The bird nests in holes in trees and stumps. Two to three eggs are normally laid, hatching after approximately 26 days. The young start to fledge in the wild at approximately 10 weeks old. Only two nests have been examined in the wild, both had one chick. It is not considered threatened, but is listed on CITES Appendix II (as are most parrots not listed on Appendix I). Aviculture Red-fan parrots, although not particularly common in aviculture, are sometimes kept as aviary birds or companion parrots. While juvenile birds tend to be docile, adults can be particularly ill-tempered, stubborn, unpredictable and strong-willed birds, showing extreme aggression towards humans and other birds housed with them (including others of their own species and/or their own mates), particularly when in breeding condition. Red-fan parrots, when kept as pets tend to bond with one person and require firm handling and a patient owner, experienced in both bird-keeping and the reading of parrot body language. However, as with all parrots, temperament can vary greatly from individual to individual and some red-fan parrots make excellent companions.

Although Hanson had several albums in between, This Time Around is their first standard studio release since 1997's Middle of Nowhere. This Time Around did not achieve the commercial success of its predecessor Middle of Nowhere. The album does not feature as many bubblegum pop style tunes as Middle of Nowhere; instead, Hanson opted to focus on a more classic rock sound, or as MTV.com stated, \\"stadium rock\\". The album also features numerous ballads, with songs such as \\"Sure About It\\" and \\"A Song to Sing\\" covering the themes of teenage insecurity and loneliness, much like \\"Weird\\" from Middle of Nowhere. Critically, This Time Around received mainly positive reviews. To date, it has sold over one million copies worldwide. This Time Around is the only Hanson album to date not featured on streaming services in the US. Critical reception Critically, This Time Around received mainly positive reviews. It was given a score of 67 out of 100 by Metacritic. Billboard said, \\"It all adds up to a collection that successfully sets Hanson apart from the current teen-pop phenomenon that it helped start -- at least from a creative perspective,\\" and CDNow said \\"This Time Around scores with more sophisticated harmonies and storytelling.\\" Rolling Stone said, \\"Like a blond three-headed hydra, Hanson loom over the competition, making all other teen idols sound like Gerber-sucking clowns.\\" AllMusic said, \\"It's hard not to miss the thrilling way Middle of Nowhere leapt out of the speakers upon its first spin with giddy fun, yet with its carefully considered craft and warmly ingratiating pop songs This Time Around is winning entertainment.\\" However, not everyone was complimentary about the change in musical style, with Robert Christgau of The Village Voice stating \\"If you thought they were bad when they were cute, or even that they were cute when they were good, believe me, you don't want to hear them mature,\\" and NME with the even harsher verdict: \\"But damn those cruel hormones ‚Äì Hanson's collective balls have MmmDropped, and the giddy rush of adolescence seeks to mutate Mercury's finest investment into a trio of crack-voiced hulks.\\" Singles *\\"If Only\\" was released as the lead single outside the United States on April 3, 2000. The song features John Popper of the band Blues Traveler on harmonica. The music video features the group traveling in a desert on their tour bus, unloading their equipment to shoot the video. The song reached the top 10 in Australia, Finland, Italy, and Spain and entered the charts of other European countries. *\\"This Time Around\\" was released on April 4, 2000, as the lead single in the United States and Canada, peaking at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.

The restored lighthouse overlooks Admiralty Inlet. It was the companion to the Point Wilson Light, which sits four miles away on Admiralty Inlet's western shore. History Two lighthouses have been built on Admiralty Head. Only the second remains. Admiralty Head, the east entrance point of Admiralty Inlet, is the southeast extremity of a succession of bluffs extending northward along the western shore of Whidbey Island to Point Partridge, where the bluffs attain their highest elevation. ;Original lighthouse In 1858, the United States purchased on the headland for $400. The original lighthouse was a wooden, two-story house with tower projecting from the gable. It was completed in 1861. It had a fourth order Fresnel lens, which was visible at . In 1890, construction of Fort Casey forced the relocation of the lighthouse to a spot close to the site of the present lighthouse. It was demolished in 1928. ;Present lighhouse A second, lighthouse, constructed of brick and stucco, was built in 1903. The design by Carl Leick incorporated thick walls meant to withstand earthquakes and the concussion of Fort Casey's guns. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1922, and the lantern moved to the New Dungeness Lighthouse in 1927. During its later occupancy by the Army, the lighthouse was used as a training facility for the K-9 dog program. In 1990, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 25-cent stamp featuring the Admiralty Head Light. ;Restoration The lighthouse has been restored by Washington State Parks and is sponsored by the Lighthouse Environmental Program (LEP), a collaborative function between Washington State University's Extension Office and local environmental programs. In 2012, an historically accurate reconstruction of the lantern house was installed atop the tower. The work was done by student volunteers from three Whidbey Island high schools.

CIFOR is the forestry research center of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), a network of 15 research centers around the world that focus on agricultural research for sustainable development, working closely with governments and other partners to help develop evidence-based solutions to problems related to sustainable agriculture and natural resource management. CIFOR‚Äôs research contributes to the three CGIAR System-Level Outcomes: reduced poverty, improved food and nutrition security, and improved natural resource systems and ecosystem services. It also contributes to the new United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and commitments made by countries in the Paris agreement and other accords related to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Overview  CIFOR's headquarters in Bogor, Indonesia CIFOR's research and expert analysis help policy makers and practitioners shape policy, improve the management of tropical forests and address the needs of people who depend on forests for their livelihoods. CIFOR's multidisciplinary approach considers the underlying drivers of deforestation and degradation, which often lie outside the forestry sector: forces such as agriculture, infrastructure development, trade and investment policies, and law enforcement. CIFOR has its headquarters in Bogor, Indonesia. The current Director General is Robert Nasi. It has three regional offices: in Burkina Faso (West Africa), Cameroon (Central Africa) and Kenya (East and South Africa). It has project offices in Ethiopia and Zambia (Africa), Vietnam and Laos (Asia), and Brazil and Peru (Latin America). CIFOR is one of 15 centers within the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). In implementing its research, CIFOR collaborates with other centers within the CGIAR ‚Äî the World Agroforestry Centre, the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and Bioversity International ‚Äî to conduct the CGIAR Consortium Research Programme Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (also known as CRP6). CRP6 objective is to enhance the management and use of forests, agroforestry and tree genetic resources across the landscape, from forests to farms.  History  Although many link CIFOR‚Äôs creation to the 1992 Earth Summit because it came into existence the following year, the discussions that led to founding CIFOR predated the Earth Summit by several years. In 1991, the CGIAR appointed the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) as the implementing agency responsible for establishing CIFOR and setting up a Board of Trustees. CIFOR‚Äôs Establishment Agreement was signed by Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States; the Agreement was lodged with the United Nations and CIFOR's legal identity as an international organisation was consolidated with a Host Country Agreement between the new Board and the Government of Indonesia in May 1993. Over time, CIFOR increased the focus of its research on forest policy rather than on technical forestry or tree breeding, in order to complement the efforts of national and private-sector institutes. Instead of having laboratories, CIFOR would be a ‚Äòcenter without walls‚Äô, marshaling interdisciplinary research teams in collaboration with partners to tackle forest policy changes.  Partners  CIFOR works with government agencies and non-governmental organization in the countries where its scientists conduct research. Top partners include the CGIAR, European Union, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australian Aid), US Agency for International Development (USAID), BMZ/BMUB, Global Environment Facility (GEF), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Austrian Development Agency, British Department for International Development (DFID), French Global Environment Facility, and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.  Strategy  CIFOR‚Äôs first strategy, set out in 1996, provided the foundations and direction for research that affected the understanding and practice of forest management throughout the tropics. But the world‚Äôs forests and the way they are perceived have changed dramatically since CIFOR was established. Foremost among many changes is that forests are today centre-stage in the global debate on how to tackle climate change. Almost 20 per cent of global carbon emissions are caused by deforestation, and so curbing forest loss is a way to reduce global warming. Also the promotion of biofuels by governments concerned about global warming is driving forest clearance in some areas. To respond to these and other challenges, CIFOR devised a new strategy for a new era. Approved by the Board of Trustees in May 2008, the strategy will guide CIFOR‚Äôs work until 2018.  CGIAR Research Programme on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry  CIFOR is the leading center for the CGIAR Research Programme 'Forests, Trees and Agroforestry' (also known as CRP6). This initiative brings together four Centers who specialise in their respective subjects ‚Äî the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), CIFOR, the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and Bioversity International. The programme will convene expertise across the CGIAR system, and will partner with research and practitioner organisations around the world. Within the consortium research program, the research focus is organised into five components with the clear objective of enhancing the management and use of forests, agroforestry and tree genetic resources across the landscape from forests to farms. Component 1: Smallholder production systems and markets smallholder producers Component 1 focuses on the needs of smallholder producers, with an emphasis on enhancing the productivity of trees on farms (e.g. through domestication of wild species) and improving access for smallholders to markets for forest and tree products. Research themes *Enhancing management and production systems for smallholders (food security and nutrition) *Increasing income generation and market integration for smallholders *Improving policies and institutions to enhance social assets to secure rights in forest- and tree-dependent communities  Component 2: Management and conservation of forest and tree resources  Component 2 focuses on the needs of forest managers at the level of the forest management unit, with an emphasis on improved technical and governance approaches to conserving forest ecosystems and the genetic resources they contain. Research themes *Understanding threats to tree species and formulating genetic conservation strategies *Conserving and characterising high-quality germplasm of tree crops and their wild relatives *Developing improved silvicultural, monitoring and management practices for multiple use *Developing tools and methods to resolve conflicts over distribution of benefits and resource rights  Component 3: Environmental services and landscape management  CRP6 Component 3 has an emphasis on capturing the value of environmental services Component 3 focuses on the needs of landscape- level planners and stakeholders, with an emphasis on mechanisms (such as payments for environmental services or PES) for capturing the value of environmental services and for negotiating trade-offs among competing conservation and development objectives. Research themes *Understanding drivers of forest transition *Understanding the consequences of forest transition for environmental services and livelihoods  Component 4: Climate change adaptation and mitigation  Component 4 focuses on the needs of policymakers and land managers seeking to build forests, trees and agroforestry into climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. Research themes *Harnessing forests, trees and agroforestry for climate change mitigation *Enhancing climate change adaptation *Understanding synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation  Component 5: Impacts of trade and investment on forests and people  CRP6 Component 5 aims to manage the effect of trade and investment on forests and forest-dependent communities Component 5 focuses on the needs of policymakers and land managers seeking to ensure that the effects of globalised trade and investment flows are beneficial to forests and the communities that depend on forests for their livelihoods. Research themes *Understanding the processes and effects of forest-related trade and investment *Enhancing responses and policy options to mitigate the harm and enhance the benefits of trade and investment  Other major projects   Global Comparative Study on REDD+ Over four years, CIFOR and its partner organisations are undertaking a major global comparative study on the implementation of pilot REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) projects. The aim of the study is to compare how pilot REDD+ projects are working at national and subnational levels, and share lessons learned from these comparisons for the benefit of everyone involved in designing and implementing REDD+ projects. Essentially, by providing policy makers and communities with this information, the project aims to ensure implementation of REDD+ is as effective, cost-efficient and equitable as possible ‚Äî and ultimately reduces carbon emissions, deforestation and forest degradation across the world, while producing benefits like poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation. Research for the global comparative study is being undertaken in 11 countries ‚Äî Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Nepal, Peru, Tanzania and Vietnam. Poverty and Environment Network The Poverty and Environment Network (PEN) is an international research project and network launched by CIFOR in September 2004 and completed in 2010. PEN still exists as a database containing survey data on more than 8,000 households in more than 40 study sites in 25 developing countries. It was the largest and most comprehensive global analysis of tropical forests and poverty, and aimed to put a systematic framework of knowledge around the role tropical forests play in poverty alleviation. The project aimed to provide data on the ways that poor people depend on forest resources, in order to both inform mainstream forest policy design and to contribute to the design of policies and projects to alleviate poverty, and thereby contribute to meeting the Millennium Development Goal of 50% poverty reduction by 2015. In order for the socioeconomic data to be uniform and therefore comparable across countries and project sites, research partners (mainly PhD students) from a number of universities and research institutes collected quarterly data at the household and village level using standardised definitions, questionnaires and methods. The study sites were chosen to obtain representative coverage of geographical regions, forest types, forest tenure regimes, levels of poverty, infrastructure and market access, and population density. Preliminary results from the study‚Äôs global database showed that among those surveyed, forest income ‚Äì on average ‚Äì constituted more than one fifth of total household income, while environmental income (forest and non-forest) made up more than one fourth.  Communicating research  According to past Director General Frances Seymour, CIFOR considers bridging the gap between research, policy and practice through effective communications is one of its challenges as a research organization. The organization is committed to sharing its research and other information with others in the research community, and also with policymakers, indigenous and community groups, donor agencies, the media and the general public. Forests News Blog The Forests News Blog reports on the latest scientific research, activities and events from CIFOR. It contains news stories, analysis, features, videos and infographics. Sections of the blog include: climate change and energy, human wellbeing, forest management and restoration, food and diets, gender, justice and tenure, value chains and finance, landscapes and the Director General's column. Social Media CIFOR has a Twitter account, YouTube channel and Facebook page.  Major events   Forests Asia Summit  The Forests Asia Summit in Jakarta saw ministers from across Southeast Asia join CEOs, civil society leaders, development experts and the world‚Äôs top scientists joining to share knowledge on how the region can accelerate the shift toward a green economy by better managing its forests and landscapes. The Summit ‚Äì organized by the Center for International Forestry Research and co-hosted by the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry ‚Äì was the largest in Asia in recent years and attracted more than 1,000 leading stakeholders from Southeast Asia and across the world. Thousands more participated online or through nationwide broadcasts. There were special learning events with leading global experts on the Green Economy, the Southeast Asian haze crisis, climate change negotiations and the Sustainable Development Goals.  Forest Day  Forest Day 3 logo Forest Day is a platform for those with an interest in forests and climate change to come together with others and exchange views. Forest Day is organised by CIFOR on behalf of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests. It is held alongside the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP). More than 1,100 people from 82 countries, including 214 official climate-change negotiators and 65 media representatives, attended Forest Day 5 on 4 December 2011 in Durban, South Africa. Previous Forest Days have been held in Bali, Indonesia (2007), Pozna≈Ñ, Poland (2008), Copenhagen, Denmark (2009) and Cancun, Mexico (2010). The 2012 Forest Day (Forest Day 6) coincided with COP 18 in Doha, Qatar, in December 2012.  Forests Indonesia Conference  As part of the United Nations declaration of 2011 as the ‚ÄòInternational Year of Forests‚Äô, CIFOR convened the Forests Indonesia (Hutan Indonesia) conference on 27 September 2011 at Shangri-La Hotel in Jakarta. About 1,000 participants representing government, business/private sector, civil society and donor organisations attended the conference to discuss the future of Indonesia‚Äôs forests, which comprise the world‚Äôs third largest tropical forest area. The President of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, opened the conference and vowed to dedicate the last three years of his administration to safeguarding his nation's rainforests.  The Global Landscapes Forum  The Global Landscapes Forum is an annual conference held alongside the UN climate negotiations, to create a platform for positioning landscapes in the new international agreements on climate and sustainable development. The events bring thousands of negotiators, world leaders, researchers, civil society leaders, business leaders, practitioners and policymakers in agriculture, forestry and development, funding organizations, and media, making it the largest, most influential event outside the UNFCCC COP. Forum participants will benefit from joining the interactive process of seeking combined solutions to the complex challenges common to everyone on the planet.  Publications  Scientific results are made available to the international scientific community and policymakers through publications in international journals, policy briefs and training materials. In addition, CIFOR also disseminates its results in non-English journals, policy briefs, CD-ROMs and manuals.

It is also called the theory of irregularities of distribution. This refers to the theme of classical discrepancy theory, namely distributing points in some space such that they are evenly distributed with respect to some (mostly geometrically defined) subsets. The discrepancy (irregularity) measures how far a given distribution deviates from an ideal one. Discrepancy theory can be described as the study of inevitable irregularities of distributions, in measure-theoretic and combinatorial settings. Just as Ramsey theory elucidates the impossibility of total disorder, discrepancy theory studies the deviations from total uniformity. A significant event in the history of discrepancy theory was the 1916 paper of Weyl on the uniform distribution of sequences in the unit interval.   Theorems  Discrepancy theory is based on the following classic theorems: * The theorem of van Aardenne‚ÄìEhrenfest * Axis- parallel rectangles in the plane (Roth, Schmidt) * Discrepancy of half-planes (Alexander, Matou≈°ek) * Arithmetic progressions (Roth, Sarkozy, Beck, Matousek & Spencer) * Beck‚ÄìFiala theorem * Six Standard Deviations Suffice (Spencer)  Major open problems  The unsolved problems relating to discrepancy theory include: * Axis-parallel rectangles in dimensions three and higher (folklore) * Koml√≥s conjecture * Heilbronn triangle problem on the minimum area of a triangle determined by three points from an n-point set  Applications  Applications for discrepancy theory include: * Numerical integration: Monte Carlo methods in high dimensions. * Computational geometry: Divide-and-conquer algorithm. * Image processing: Halftoning  See also  *Discrepancy of hypergraphs  References  Further reading  * Category:Diophantine approximation Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics Category:Combinatorics Category:Measure theory ","title":"Discrepancy theory"},{"id":"1116844","text":"The Guidant John Rose Minnesota Oval (officially stylized as OVAL), formerly the John Rose Minnesota Oval, is an outdoor ice rink in Roseville, Minnesota, United States. It is claimed to be the largest artificial outdoor skating surface in North America. The facility was constructed from June to December 1993. Rink The rink consists of a concrete surface (a 400-meter track surrounding an infield ice arena) with of embedded cooling tubes and an 800-ton refrigeration system. When the temperature is above --the highest temperature at which an icy surface can be maintained--the concrete surface can be used for inline skating. History The Oval had its beginnings in 1983, when then-governor Rudy Perpich dreamed of hosting the Olympic Games. As part of the bid preparation, a task force was formed to determine locations of new facilities. After years of local efforts, Roseville was selected. The city was awarded state bonding money for the design and construction of a multi- purpose outdoor skating facility, which opened in December 1993. The facility was named after John Rose, a Roseville teacher, member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, and avid supporter of youth sports. The Guidant John Rose Minnesota Oval hosted the 1995 Bandy World Championship for men and the 2006 Women's Bandy World Championship. It has also hosted US Speedskating Championships, US Junior Speedskating Championships, American Cup Speedskating, World Cup Speedskating, National Bandy Championships, and Aggressive Skating Association competitions. The Minnesota Wild held their hockey jersey unveiling at the Oval, and notable visitors have included Dan Jansen, Bonnie Blair, Paul Wylie, and Neal Broten. The facility is the main training site for the United States national bandy team and local hockey and speedskating clubs. Leaks in the cooling system were discovered in 2004, making the season's service uncertain. In June 2005, the Guidant Foundation contributed $500,000 to allow for needed repairs to the facility's refrigeration system. The Oval's official name was changed in recognition of the Foundation's gift and continuing support. Events The Oval hosts over 100,000 guests each year. Sporting events held there include bandy, ice hockey, speed skating, and recreational ice skating. In summer the Oval becomes the largest skating park in the Midwest, as ramps are put up for BMX biking, roller hockey, and aggressive skating. The track is used for inline skating, and a summer skateboard camp is held for beginning to intermediate skateboarders aged 6‚Äì13. I.S.I.-certified ice skating lessons are given by Roseville Skating School in the connected Roseville Ice Arena during the winter months. The Oval also hosts two local speedskating clubs: the Greater Minnesota Speedskating Association and the Midway Speedskating Club. Midway Speedskating Club is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing speedskating skills in young skaters. It has produced Olympic athletes and coaches. A novice speedskating program is put on by the Midway Speedskating Club through the Roseville Parks and Recreation Department for youth aged 4‚Äì14.

It broadcasts on AM 980. CKNW is unusual in that it is a 50,000 watt, Class A station broadcasting on a regional (not clear-channel) frequency. CKNW uses a four-tower directional antenna from a site near Surrey, while its studios are located at TD Tower in Downtown Vancouver.http://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?list=0&facid;=99133 The station's content is based on news and current events. It features call-in shows with mostly Vancouver-based hosts.  History  CKNW began in New Westminster, British Columbia, on August 15, 1944 at its original frequency of 1230 AM, under the ownership of Bill Rea's International Broadcasting Company. It was Vancouver's first country music station, the first in the region to provide hourly newscasts (between 6:00 a.m. and midnight) and the first in the province to broadcast 24 hours a day, beginning in 1947. In 1947, Rea purchased a half-interest in Port Alberni radio station CJAV. Several personalities who started there would move to CKNW. These included Joe Chesney, who became morning show host until moving on to establish Langley station CJJC (now CKST in Vancouver) in 1963, and Jim Robson, who would provide play-by-play for the newly-established Vancouver Canucks of the NHL beginning in 1970. On January 2, 1949, CKNW switched frequencies to 1320 AM and increased its power from 250 watts to 1,000. The station again increased power to 5,000 watts on November 5, 1954. Jack Webster advanced talk-show radio methods during his time with CKNW in the 1960s. WIC ownership In February 1956, Bill Rea, experiencing health problems, sold CKNW to Frank Griffiths and the Allard family, who went on to form Western Broadcasting Company, which later became Western International Communications (WIC). In February 1958, long time CKNW Creative Director Tony Antonias wrote a jingle that was introduced on CKNW on April 1958, and used across western Canada for years for the famous Woodward's \\"$1.49 Day\\" sale (said aloud as \\"dollar forty- nine day\\") on the first Tuesday of every month. On November 17, 1958, the station switched to its present frequency of 980 AM. On February 22, 1960, its transmission power was increased to 10,000 watts, and it was further increased to 50,000 watts in 1965. On January 15, 1969, CKNW moved into larger studio space in a former Safeway store in New Westminster. Parent company Western Broadcasting put FM sister station CFMI on the air on March 22, 1970. CKNW founder Bill Rea died on April 15, 1983 in Santa Barbara, California at age 74. On October 3, 1983, the station began broadcasting in AM stereo. On June 18, 1984, it became the flagship station of the Western Information Network, broadcasting programs via satellite to affiliate stations throughout British Columbia. During Expo 86 CKNW moved their Holiday Inn Hotel Talk studio to a new facility in the BC Pavilion Complex. CKNW broadcast on site for the duration of the World's Fair. All CKNW Talk programming aired from the Expo Studio until 1997. During the 1990s, CKNW made a gradual transition from the mixed format of news, sports, talk shows and MOR music it had adopted in the 1960s to full-time news, talk and sports. In 1996, CKNW and CFMI moved again to their current studios in the TD Tower at Pacific Centre in Downtown Vancouver. Corus ownership In 2000, both CKNW and CFMI were purchased by Corus Entertainment as part of the splitting of WIC's broadcasting assets; Corus acquired WIC's radio stations and pay-TV assets while WIC's broadcast TV stations, including CHAN-DT (BCTV, now Global BC) in the Vancouver area, were purchased by Canwest. Canwest ultimately went bankrupt in 2010, selling the bulk of its broadcast properties including Global BC to Corus sibling company Shaw Communications, which in turn transferred them to Corus in 2016. In February 2001, Corus Entertainment launched an all-news sister station, NW2. This new station (CJNW AM730, formerly CKLG) was branded as \\"24 hour news radio, powered by CKNW.\\" NW2 shared newsroom resources with CKNW, including several anchors and reporters. However, NW2 did not achieve broad appeal, and was shut down in May 2002. Since 2001, CKNW has gone through two significant restructurings focused on reducing costs, which resulted in dozens of lay- offs. Several senior reporters have left CKNW for other opportunities. The cost-cutting decisions made by Corus, along with the increase in infomercials, has correspondingly resulted in CKNW suffering a steady erosion of its listening audience. CKNW's logo until 2010. CKNW lost the BC Lions CFL broadcast rights to Team 1040 (now TSN Radio 1040) in 2004. The station had broadcast the games continuously since 1985. In 2006, CKNW lost the rights to broadcast Vancouver Canucks games to Team 1040 as well after broadcasting every one of the club's games since 1970. The loss of the Canucks games may have resulted in the station losing nearly a third of their cumulative audience in the Fall ratings of 2006. In November 2015, CKNW was added to sister station CFMI-FM HD2 sub-channel to HD Radio service, becoming the first AM station in Vancouver and British Columbia to do so. Lineup Morning and afternoon show hosts include Jon McComb (The Jon McComb Show), Simi Sara (The Simi Sara Show), Lynda Steele and Drex (Steele & Drex), and Charles Adler (\\"Charles Adler Tonight\\"). All of these programs follow a similar format and broadcast strictly on CKNW. The station added a weekend morning show in March 2008 which follows a similar format to weekday mornings, but without traffic updates every ten minutes and news headlines at :15 and :45 (The Jill Bennett Show). Sean Leslie used to host CKNW's weekend afternoon talk program (The Sean Leslie Show). Other talk-show hosts include Drex Live. British Columbia Premier Christy Clark hosted a long-running weekday talk show on the station, before returning to politics. Her afternoon slot was taken over by Simi Sara. Guest talk-show hosts include Michael Campbell (Global BC's financial analyst and brother of former Premier Gordon Campbell). CKNW also airs the syndicated program Coast to Coast AM and on the weekends with Ted Radio Hour. The station's traffic department provides extensive reports with traffic every 10 minutes on the 4s during drive times.

Broadcast code violation In 2007, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council faulted CKNW for airing \\"potentially dangerous information\\" during the Dawson College shooting. During the incident, CKNW had simulcast content from its sister stations in Montreal which included students speaking by cellphone from inside the school. A Vancouver man complained that the content could have told the gunman where the students were. The council said that as a result of modern technology reducing geographic distance as a barrier, CKNW had breached Section 10 (coverage of violent situations) of the broadcast code. The station broadcast the decision as required, but did not air an apology and the station manager said it was a \\"one-off situation\\" that would not affect CKNW's policies.

History Ed Wynne in 2007 Nodens Ictus began life in 1986 when Ozric Tentacles guitarist Ed Wynne and keyboardist Joie Hinton were asked by the promoters of the Crypt club in Deptford, South London, to produce an ambient set for the club's \\"chillout\\" room. Essentially Ozric Tentacles minus the guitar and rhythm section, Nodens Ictus explored ethereal, Tangerine Dream-like soundscapes using synths and samples, in contrast to the driving space-rock which characterised the sound of parent band. The limited-run, independent cassette-only album The Grove of Selves was issued in 1987 - sold initially at gigs and by mail order, it has subsequently become a rare and sought-after item of Ozric memorabilia. Existing as a side-project only, Nodens Ictus played semi-frequently throughout the late '80s and early '90s, often as a support act at Ozric shows. The band occasionally ventured into electronica/dance territory following the addition of Ozric drummer Merv Pepler to the lineup, until being put on the backburner for nearly a decade as Wynne focused on the increasingly commercially successful Ozrics. Pepler and Hinton meanwhile concentrated on their techno-trance act Eat Static, which had become successful enough in its own right for them to leave the Ozrics permanently in 1994. Nodens Ictus returned in 2000 with the release of Spacelines, a collection of old and new studio tracks along with a handful of live cuts dating back as far as 1988. Released on the Ozrics' own Stretchy Records label, the album generated reasonable interest, and Nodens Ictus soon returned to the live arena, again as an occasional support act at Ozric gigs, most notably at their \\"Pongmaster's Ball\\" extravaganzas held in London in 2002, 2004 and 2006. An appearance at the Glastonbury Festival was made in 2003, and Nodens Ictus continued with a pair of small-scale headline shows in Exeter and London in 2005. 2007 saw the band play at the Solfest in Cumbria, alongside Mixmaster Morris and System 7. MantisMash joined the band as a touring member in 2014. Wynne's son, Silas Neptune, joined the band as a full time member in 2017. Nodens Ictus released their third album, The Cozmik Key, on 10 December 2017. The double CD Live at Kozfest 2018 was released in April 2019.

After Shoe had been established in papers, MacNelly created the single-panel strip Pluggers. Early life MacNelly was born in New York City in 1947 and grew up on Long Island. MacNelly's mother was a retired journalist. His father, C.L. MacNelly, ran an advertising firm, and was the publisher of the Saturday Evening Post from 1964 to 1968. MacNelly was educated in his teens at Phillips Academy in Massachusetts, where he was a class clown and decided to be an illustrator. He graduated in 1965 and went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He joined the literary society St. Anthony Hall and worked as a sports journalist and illustrator (specializing in satire) for The Daily Tar Heel. He considered himself to be a horrible sportswriter, but his illustrations for the paper were well beyond the ability of an average art student. His work for the college's newspaper led to work at the Chapel Hill Weekly. In 1969, MacNelly was commissioned to paint a representation of the Carolina Inn, which became an \\"iconic\\" image representing the Chapel Hill campus hotel and appeared on promotional brochures and menus issued by the inn in the ensuing decades. The painting mysteriously disappeared in the 1980s and resurfaced in Massachusetts in 2008, when it was returned to the Carolina Inn and presented to the public for the first time at an official unveiling in January 2009, attended by MacNelly's son Danny. MacNelly dropped out just shy of getting his bachelor's degree and married his first wife, Rita MacNelly, in 1970. He married Scottie Perry in 1985, and had a son Matt. Career MacNelly got a job at the Chapel Hill Weekly during his years at school in UNC. He worked there for the editor who became his mentor, Jim \\"Shu\\" Shumaker, who was also a professor at UNC-Chapel Hill. Shumaker's impression on the cartoonist was so profound that MacNelly created the comic strip Shoe after \\"Shu,\\" and the strip's lead character is based upon him. MacNelly considered his two years at the Chapel Hill newspaper to be what led to his \\"break\\"; his cartoons were picked up by newspapers across the state. By 1970, MacNelly had become such an accomplished artist that he was hired by Ross Mackenzie at The Richmond News Leader in Richmond, Virginia to be their main illustrator and satirist. In less than two years in 1972, MacNelly won his first Pulitzer Prize, helping to put the small paper on the map. MacNelly's first son Jake was born that same year. At this time, MacNelly was courted by various newspaper syndicates and journals to work for them, but he turned them down, preferring the slower pace of southern culture. In 1974, his second son Danny was born, and MacNelly was settling into being syndicated through the Chicago Tribune, while making the South his home. In 1977, he launched his first comic strip, Shoe, which was an immediate success. In 1981, he quit as editorial cartoonist at the News-Leader to focus on Shoe full-time, but found he needed to work in a newspaper office atmosphere to concentrate. In the 1980s, MacNelly moved to Chicago (to work for the Chicago Tribune) and eventually back to Virginia. Shoe was syndicated in 950 newspapers by 1986, with millions of readers. A line of stuffed animals based on the cartoon's characters was produced. MacNelly also illustrated a book written by former Senator Eugene McCarthy and columnist James Kilpatrick, A Political Bestiary- Viable Alternatives, Impressive Mandates, and Other Fables. MacNelly's editorial cartoons often appeared in book collections. When MacNelly represented the Irish Republican Army as a leprechaun that was a rat in one of his Chicago Tribune syndicated editorial cartoons after the IRA blew up a bus filled with schoolchildren, protesters objecting to the cartoon's contents picketed outside the Boston Globe's offices for three weeks. One of his most reprinted cartoons featured Mikhail Gorbachev with a birthmark in the shape of Afghanistan. MacNelly believed that in order to draw and write editorial cartoons, an artist had to have an opinion on the news, so he watched television news to gauge what other Americans were seeing and read the columns of Hugh Sidey, George Will and Meg Greenfield. MacNelly said: \\"Cartoons are really a negative art form. You never say anything nice. You're always criticizing and dumping on people.\\" Some of his most frequent targets were Jimmy Carter and Gorbachev. MacNelly was present when Gerald Ford fell and hit his head on a tarmac on an overseas trip in 1976: \\"I was the only cartoonist to see that, to actually see it. And all I could think of was, 'Gee, I hope he didn't hurt his head.' Meanwhile, back in the States, all my colleagues were doing Jerry Ford-falling-down jokes, and Chevy Chase started an entire career on it. I never did one. And I was the only guy that was right there. I missed the whole story, the entire point of it and everything.\\" In 1988, the Dayton Daily News reported that a cartoonist for the Ohio Republican Party named Ed Wilson drew cartoons which were \\"strikingly similar\\" and \\"virtually the same\\" to MacNelly's. The party subsequently fired Wilson. In 1992, MacNelly met Chris Cassatt, a computer expert and cartoonist who became his assistant. Cassatt helped him change the way he worked by adding digitalization to his mediums. In 1992, MacNelly hired Cassatt full-time, and they tele-commuted between Fishhawk Pass in Virginia and Cassatt's home in Aspen, Colorado. Also in 1993, on a suggestion from his wife Susie and long-time friend and Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer, David Kennerly, MacNelly launched his strip Pluggers. Awards and honors MacNelly won his second Pulitzer and a Reuben Award in 1978, and then a second Reuben in 1979. MacNelly won the Thomas Nast Award and joined the select group of journalists who have won three Pulitzers in 1985. He also won a George Polk Award. He was the first cartoonist inducted into the UNC School of Journalism Hall of Fame in 1985. He said at the time of his induction: \\"I'm afraid if my mother finds out, I'll be in big trouble. She thinks I'm running numbers in Baltimore.\\" MacNelly won \\"Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year\\" from the National Cartoonists Society in 1978 and 1979.\\"27 Years of Shoe\\" Personal life MacNelly's son Matt was born to his second wife, Scottie Perry in 1986. In 1989, MacNelly met his last wife, Susie MacNelly. They married in Washington D.C. in 1990 and soon thereafter moved to Flint Hill, Rappahannock County, Virginia.The World of Newspaper Comics Loses a True Artisan, www.thefreelibrary.com, 8 June 2000 Later career and death One of MacNelly's friends and colleagues at the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Gary Brookins, had assisted MacNelly in filling in doing finish work. Brookins was a fan of Pluggers and could replicate MacNelly's style. Exhausted after his son's death, MacNelly gave the strip to Brookins to take over in early 1997. Pluggers is still being produced by Brookins and is syndicated in more than 60 newspapers in the United States. In the late 1990s, MacNelly began to also put more concentration into fine art painting and sculpture. He did a caricature of the Louisiana cartoonist Pap Dean. By 1999, he had almost finished passing the task of creating Shoe onto Cassatt, Susie MacNelly and Brookins. Then, in December 1999, MacNelly was diagnosed with lymphoma. He continued working in spite of his illness, producing \\"Shoe\\" and editorial cartoons and Dave Barry illustrations in his Johns Hopkins Hospital bed right up to the day he died, June 8, 2000. Legacy MacNelly's editorial page editor at the Chicago Tribune, Jack Fuller, said in 1986 that MacNelly's editorial cartoons were \\"magic... I wish I could say just what combination of graphic mastery, writing skill and sheer perversity goes into Jeff's work. I can't, but when people say Jeff has a special perspective on the world, they are engaging in heroic understatement.\\" The Wall Street Journal wrote: \\"MacNelly's superb draftsmanship as well as his heightened sense of the ridiculous is in the vanguard of a new generation of American cartoonists.\\" MacNelly's legacy is continued through the work of Chris Cassatt, Gary Brookins, Susie MacNelly, his head writer Bill Linden and Doug Gamble. This team keeps alive Jeff MacNelly's work on Shoe and Dave Barry's illustrations, as well as museum shows, fine art sales, licensing and publishing.

It has an unclear etymology, but is often connected to the root nebel, meaning mist. The term in its various meanings gives its name to the Middle High German heroic epic the Nibelungenlied. The most widespread use of Nibelung is used to denote the Burgundian royal house, also known as the Gibichungs (German) or Gj√∫kings (Old Norse). A group of royal brothers led by king Gunther or Gunnar, the Gibichungs are responsible for the death of the hero Siegfried or Sigurd and are later destroyed at the court of Attila the Hun (called Etzel in German and Atli in Old Norse). This is the only use of the term attested in the Old Norse legends. In medieval German, several other uses of the term Nibelung are documented besides the reference to the Gibichungs: it refers to the king and inhabitants of a mythical land inhabited by dwarfs and giants in the first half of the Nibelungenlied, as well as to the father and one of two brothers fighting over a divided inheritance. This land and its inhabitants give their name to the \\"hoard of the Nibelungs\\" (Middle High German der Nibelunge hort). In the late medieval Lied vom H√ºrnen Seyfrid, the name, in the form Nybling or Nibling, is given to a dwarf who again gives his name to the treasure. In Richard Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (1848‚Äì1874), Nibelung denotes a dwarf, or perhaps a specific race of dwarfs. In Waltharius The earliest probable surviving mention of the name is in the Latin poem Waltharius, believed to have been composed around the year 920. In lines 555‚Äì6 of that poem Walter, seeing Guntharius (Gunther) and his men approaching says (in the Chronicon Novaliciense text, usually taken to be the oldest): > N≈çn assunt Avarƒìs hƒ´c, sed Francƒ´ Nivil≈çnƒìs, > cult≈çrƒìs regi≈çnis. The translation is: \\"These are not Avars, but Frankish Nivilons, inhabitants of the region.\\" The other texts have nebulones 'worthless fellows' instead of nivilones, a reasonable replacement for an obscure proper name. In medieval Latin names, b and v often interchange, so Nivilones is a reasonable Latinization of Germanic Nibilungos. This is the only text to connect the Nibelungs with Franks. Since Burgundy was conquered by the Franks in 534, Burgundians could loosely be considered Franks of a kind and confused with them. The name Nibelunc became a Frankish personal name in the 8th and 9th centuries, at least among the descendants of Childebrand I (who died in 752Dronke, p. 37). Yet, in this poem, the center of Gunther's supposedly Frankish kingdom is the city of Worms on the Rhine. Norse tradition In the eddic poem (see Poetic Edda) Atlakvi√∞a, the word Niflungar is applied three times to the treasure (arfr) or hoard (hodd) of Gunnar (the Norse counterpart of German Gunther). It is also applied once to Gunnar's warriors and once to Gunnar himself. It elsewhere appears unambiguously as the name of the lineage to which the brothers Gunnar and H√∂gni (H«´gni) belong and seems mostly interchangeable with Gj√∫kingar or Gj√∫kungar, meaning descendants of Gj√∫ki, Gj√∫ki being Gunnar's father. The variant form Hniflungr also occurs as the name of H√∂gni's son in the eddic poem Atlam√°l, and as a term for the children born by Gunnar's sister Gudr√∫n (Gu√∞r√∫n) to Atli (Attila the Hun). It appears to be a general term for \\"warrior\\" in Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana I. Hniflungar might be of separate origin, meaning descendants of Hnef, referring to the Hn√¶f son of Hoc who is prominent in the Old English Finnesburg Fragment. However h was early dropped initially before other consonants in Norwegian dialects which might have led to the adding of h to names in other dialects where it did not originally belong. Niblung genealogy Lex Burgundionum In the Lex Burgundionum, issued by the Burgundian king Gundobad (c. 480‚Äì516), it is decreed that those who were free under the kings Gibica, Gundomar, Gislaharius, and Gundaharius will remain free. But as will be seen below, legendary tradition often makes Gibiche or Gj√∫ki (that is Gibica) the father of Gunther/Gunnar and names Giselher (the same name as Gislaharius) as one of Gunther/Gunnar's brothers. In Norse tradition another brother is named Gutthorm (Gut√æormr) which looks like a slight garbling of Gundomar. German tradition provides instead a third brother named Gernot, which may be a substitution of a more familiar name for an unfamiliar one. In the Nibelungenlied, all three brothers are called kings. If these legends preserve authentic tradition, then historically Gibica of the Burgundian Laws might have been the father of the three kings Gundomar, Gislaharius, and Gundaharius who shared the kingdom among them, presumably with Gundaharius as the high king (the sharing of the throne between brothers was a common tradition among the Germanic tribes, see Germanic king). But if so, the order of the names here is puzzling. One would expect Gundaharius to be named immediately after Gibica. German tradition In the Waltharius King Gibicho of the Franks is father of Guntharius, that is Gunther, and both father and son are called kings of the Franks, not kings of the Burgundians, though their city is Worms on the Rhine. Another king called Heriricus rules the Burgundians and is father of Hiltgunt, the heroine of the tale. The only other kinsman of Gunther who appears here is Hagano (Hagen). But Hagano's exact familial relation to Guntharius is not given. The Old Norse √ûi√∞rekssaga is a medieval translation of German legendary material into Norwegian. Here Gunther (given the Old Norse form Gunnar) and his brothers are sons and heirs of Irung (in one place) or Aldrian (elsewhere) by Aldrian's wife Ode. The sons are named Gunnar, Gernoz, and Gisler. Ode also bears a daughter named Gr√≠mhild. One later passage adds Guthorm. But Guthorm is never mentioned again and is possibly an addition from Norse tradition by the translator or by an early copyist. H«´gni (German Hagen) appears as their maternal half-brother, fathered on Ode by an elf when Ode once fell asleep in the garden while her husband was drunk. Yet one passage names H«´gni's father as Aldrian. There are confusions and doublings in the √ûi√∞rekssaga and it may be that Aldrian was properly the name of H«´gni's elf father. Gunnar and his legitimate brothers are often called Niflungar and their country is named Niflungaland. Their sister Gr√≠mhild bore to Atli (Attila) a son named Aldrian who is slain by H«´gni. At the end of the resultant battle, H«´gni, though mortally wounded, fathered a son on Herad, one of √ûi√∞rek's relations. This son, named Aldrian, accomplished Atli's death and became Jarl of Niflungaland under Brynhild (Brynhildr). In the Faroese H«´gnat√°ttur a similar tale is told. Here Gunnar and H«´gni have two younger brothers named Gislar and Hjarnar, both slain along with their elder brothers. H«´gni, lies with a Jarl's daughter named Helvik on his deathbed and prophecies to Helvik that a son born to her will avenge him. The son in this account is named H√∂gni. On the birth of the child, Helvik, following H«´gni's advice, secretly exchanged it with a newborn child of \\"Gudr√∫n\\" and \\"Artala\\". As a result, Gudr√∫n slew the supposed child of H«´gni, thinking to have put an end to H«´gni's lineage, but in fact killed her own child and then brought up H«´gni's child as her own. This second H«´gni learned of his true parentage and took vengeance on Artala as in the √ûi√∞rekssaga. In the Nibelungenlied and its dependent poems the Klage and Biterolf, the father of Gunther, Gernot, Giselher, and Kriemhild is named Dankrat and their mother is named Uote. Hagen is their kinsman (exact relationship not given), and has a brother named Dancwart whose personality is bright and cheerful in contrast to Hagen's. Hagen also has a sister's son named Ortwin of Metz. These family relationships might seem to prohibit any elvish siring, but in the cognate story of Br√¢n the Blessed in the second branch of the Mabinogion, Hagen's counterpart Efnisien had a brother named Nisien who was similarly his opposite and Efnisien and Nisien are maternal half-brothers to Br√¢n and Manawyddan just as in the √ûi√∞rekssaga, H«´gni was maternal brother to Gunnar and Gernoz. In the second half of the Nibelungenlied both Hagen and Dankwart are called sons of Aldrian. Nothing further is told of Aldrian here. Also in the Nibelungenlied, Gunther and Brunhild had a son named Siegfried and Siegfried and Kriemhild had a son named Gunther. Kriemhild's later son born to Etzel (= Attila) who is slain by Hagen is here named Ortlieb. The Klage relates that Gunther's son Siegfried inherited the kingdom. Norse tradition The Sk√°ldskaparm√°l names the founder of the Niflung lineage as Nefi, one of the second set of nine sons of Halfdan the Old who founded many famous legendary lineages. The √Üttartolur (genealogies attached to the Hversu Noregr byggdist) call this son of Halfdan by the name N√¶fil (N√¶fill) and relate that King N√¶fil was father of Heimar, father of Eynef (Eynefr), father of Rakni, father of Gj√∫ki. The form Gj√∫ki is etymologically equatable to Gebicca of the Lex Burgundionum. According to the Sk√°ldskaparm√°l and the √Üttartolur, Gj√∫ki was father of two sons named Gunnar (Gunnarr) and H√∂gni (H«´gni) and of two daughters named Gudr√∫n (Gu√∞r√∫n) and Gullr√∂nd. Their mother was named Gr√≠mhild (Gr√≠mhildr). Gudn√Ω is mentioned in no other extant texts. A younger brother named Gutthorm (Gut√æormr) take on the role of Sigurd's slayer, after being egged on by Gunnar and H√∂gni in the eddic poems Brot af Sigur√∞arkvi√∞u (stanza 4), in Sigur√∞arkvi√∞a hin skamma (stanzas 20‚Äì23), and in the V√∂lsunga saga (as well as being mentioned in the eddic poems Gr√≠pissp√° and Gu√∞r√∫narkvi√∞a II). According to the eddic poem Hyndlulj√≥√∞, stanza 27: > > Gunnar and H√∂gni, the heirs of Gj√∫ki, > And Gudr√∫n as well, who their sister was; > But Gotthorm was not of Gj√∫ki's race, > Although the brother of both he was: > And all are thy kinsmen, √ìttar, thou fool! If Gotthorm or Gutthorm, the slayer of Sigurd in northern tradition, is brother of Gunnar and H√∂gni, but is not a son of Gj√∫ki, he must be a maternal half-brother, just as Hagen, the slayer of Siegfried in the German tradition, is a maternal half-brother in the Thidreks saga. Gudr√∫n bore to Sigurd a son named Sigmund according to the V√∂lsunga saga, presumably the same as the unnamed son mentioned in stanza 5 of Sigurdarkvida hin skamma. But nothing more is said of him. More often mentioned is Gudr√∫n's daughter named Svanhild (Svanhildr) who became the wife of J√∂rmunrek (J«´rmunrekr). By her third husband J√≥nakr, Gudr√∫n is mother of Hamdir (Ham√∞ir) and S√∂rli (S«´rli). In the eddic poems Gu√∞r√∫narhv√∂t and Ham√∞ism√°l, Erp (Erpr), a third son of J√≥nakr, was born by a different mother. But in the Sk√°ldskaparm√°l and the V√∂lsunga saga Erp is also a son of Gudr√∫n. In the Atlakvi√∞a (stanza 12), a son of H√∂gni says farewell to his father as Gunnar and H√∂gni depart to visit Atli. The Atlam√°l (stanza 28) brings in two sons of H√∂gni by his wife Kostbera, named Sn√¶var (Sn√¶varr) and S√≥lar (S√≥larr). They accompany their father and uncle on their fateful journey to Atli's court where they also meet their deaths. These sons are also mentioned in the prose introduction to the eddic poem Dr√°p Niflunga along with a third son Gj√∫ki. The Atlam√°l later introduces another son of H√∂gni (or possibly Gj√∫ki son of H√∂gni under another name) who, along with Gudr√∫n, kills Atli. In the V√∂lsunga saga this son is named Niflung (Niflungr). He may be a reflex of the posthumous son of H√∂gni who is called Aldrian in the Thidreks saga. The Danish Hven Chronicle also tells the story of H√∂gni's posthumous son begotten as H√∂gni is dying, of the switching of children so that H√∂gni is brought up as son of Atli and \\"Gremhild\\", and of how this son lures Gremhild to the cave of treasure and seals her in. Other interpretations of Nibelung A northern people Although Nibelungs refers to the royal family of the Burgundians in the second half of the Nibelunglenlied (as well as in many other texts), in the first half Nibelungenlant it is instead a kingdom on the borders of Norway of which Siegfried becomes the ruler. In Adventure 3 Hagen tells how Siegfried came by chance upon the two sons of the king of the Nibelungs who had just died. Their names were Schilbung and Nibelung and they were attempting to divide their father's hoard, the hoard of the Nibelungs. They asked Siegfried to make the division for them. For a reason not explained, Siegfried was unable to make the division, despite much effort. Fighting broke out and Siegfried slew Schilbung, Nibelung, twelve giants, and seven hundred warriors, at which point those still alive, not unreasonably, surrendered and took Siegfried as their king. In this way, Siegfried gained the Nibelung treasure, though he still had to fight the dwarf Alberich, whom he defeated and made guardian of the hoard. We are to presume that when the treasure passed to the Burgundian kings after Siegfried's death, the name Nibelung went with it. It is a common folklore motif that the protagonist comes upon two or three persons or creatures quarreling about a division of treasure or magical objects among themselves, that they ask the protagonist to make the division for them, and that in the end it is the protagonist who ends up as owner of the treasure. Schilbung and Niblung are otherwise unknown. It may be coincidence that in the √Üttartolur, Skelfir ancestor of the Skilfings and N√¶fil ancestor of the Niflungs (Nibelungs) are brothers, though there they are two of nine brothers.  Referring to dwarfs  In a later poem Das Lied vom H√ºrnen Seyfrid ('The Song of Horny-skinned Siegfried'), known only from 16th century printed versions, the original owner of the hoard is a dwarf named Nibeling (or Nyblung). Siegfried happened to find it one day and bore it away. At Worms Siegfried met King Gybich, his three sons Gunther, Hagen, and Gyrnot, and his daughter Kriemhild. When Kriemhild was abducted by a dragon, Siegfried rescued her and was given her hand in marriage. This variant usage of Niblung may arise from the identification of the hoard of the Burgundians, or at least most of it, with the hoard of treasure won by Siegfried. The German versions of the tale make much of Kriemhild's right to the \\"Nibelungen\\" treasure through her previous marriage to Siegfried. Some seemingly took Nibelung to apply primarily to Siegfried's treasure, in which case it must mean something else than the Burgundian royal family, and so another explanation was contrived. The alternate theory is that the connection with the treasure was indeed primary, and that nibel-, nifl-, meaning 'mist, cloud', referred originally to a dwarfish origin for the hoard, though this was later forgotten and the application of the name to the Burgundian royal family arose from misunderstanding. In the first half of the Nibelungenlied, Siegfried's last fight to win the treasure is against the dwarf Alberich. In Das Lied vom H√ºrnen Seyfried the treasure belonged to the dwarf Nybling. Though the kings of the Nibelungs named Schilbung and Nibelung in the first half of the Nibelungenlied are humans as far as is told, it would not be impossible that in earlier tradition they were explicitly dwarfs like Alberich. The people of the Nibelungs also have giants in their service, perhaps an indication of their earlier supernatural stature. In the Norse tales the hoard originates from a dwarf named Andvari, thence passes to Odin, and then to Hreidmar (Hrei√∞marr), and then to Hreidmar's son F√°fnir who changes into dragon form, and from him to Sigurd (Siegfried). Niflheim (\\"Mist-home\\") is a mythical region of cold and mist and darkness in the north. Niflhel is a term for part or all of Hel, the land of the dead. As dwarfs are subterranean creatures in these tales, who live in darkness, Niflung would seem a reasonable name for these beings, an old name forgotten in the north and only preserved in the garblings of some German accounts of the origin of the Niblung hoard. In \\"Silver Fir Cones\\", one of the tales found in Otmar's Volkssagen (Traditions of the Harz) (Bremen, 1800), the king of the dwarfs is named G√ºbich. It cannot be proved which meaning was primary, that of dwarf or Burgundian prince. Scholars today mostly believe that the Burgundian connection is the more original one. In the 19th century, the dwarf theory was popular and was adopted by Richard Wagner for his operatic Ring cycle which was very freely adapted from the tales surrounding Siegfried and the Burgundians. In Wagner's operas Nibelungs refers to the race of dwarfs. Theories of etymology and origins Several different etymologies of the term Nibelung have been proposed; they are usually connected to a specific theory of the original nature of the name: referring originally to mythical beings, to the Franks, or to the Burgundians. Referring to mythical beings Andreas Heusler and many other scholars have derived the name Nibelung from the root *nebula-, meaning cloud, mist, or fog, or *nibila-, meaning low, deep, or dark (cf. Niflheim). This derivation frequently assumes that the name originally referred to mythological beings and means something to the effect of \\"beings of mist\\". Heusler reasoned that the name became attached to the various possessors of the Nibelungs' treasure and thereby passed from the mythical beings, to Siegfried, and then to the Burgundians in the Nibelungenlied. Stefan Schaffner proposes another theory: again assuming that Nibelung originally referred to mythical beings, instead derives the name from a root *nibla- or *nibula- meaning \\"being below\\", which Schaffner connects to Niflheim. Whatever the actual derivation of the name Nibelung, it is clear that it was interpreted as being connected to the word nebel (mist, fog), and that the form of the word was likely altered via this association. A clear example can be seen in the name of the dwarf Nybling from Das Lied vom H√ºrnen Seyfrid, which was translated into Czech as Mhaƒçek, from Czech mha (mist). In the Nibelungenlied, the name of Nibelung's brother, Schilbung, has similarly been suggested to have a meaning \\"rock- or cave-man\\" or \\"frost-man\\", meaning that Nibelung's name may similarly have been interpreted as \\"mist-man\\". Referring to the Nibelungid branch of the Frankish Pippinid dynasty George Gillespie presents the theory that the name Nibelung originally applied to the Nibelungid cadet branch of the Pippinid dynasty of Frankish mayors of the palace, the later Carolingian emperors. The name is first recorded in 752 in Latin as Nibelungus or Nivelongus, referring to a nephew of Charles Martel. The name is also recorded as belonging to several other members of a cadet branch of the dynasty descending from Charles's brother Childebrand I; this cadet branch is known as the Nibelungids or Nibelungs. A reference to nebulones Franci (translated as \\"Nibelungian Franks\\") in the Waltharius is used as further evidence, though this translation of the epithet nebulones is disputed. Gillespie and C. W. von Sydow argue the name may derive from Nivelles in Walloon Brabant, where the Pippinids founded a monastery and maintained strong connections. The name Nivelles either derives from the Germanic *Niuwa-alha, meaning new sanctuary, or from Celtic *Nivialah, meaning new temple. According to this theory, the name Nibelung came to be attached to the Burgundian royal house after the Kingdom of Burgundy in southern France was absorbed into the Frankish kingdom in 613 and came under the rule of the Frankish Nibelungids. Rejecting a Burgundian origin for the name, Gillespie further notes that Gunther is recorded in Old English as G≈´√∞here, but is referred to as a Burgundian rather than a Nibelung, a name which is unattested in Old English. Referring to a Burgundian clan Ursula Dronke and Helmmut Rosenfeld argue that the name Nibelung originally referred to a Burgundian clan. They note the existence of several place names in Savoy, the location of the French kingdom of Burgundy, which can be derived from a reconstructed Nibilungos, including Neblens, Noblens, and Neublans. Dronke argues that after the resettlement of the Burgundians from the Rhine to the Kingdom of Burgundy in 411, the clan name Nibelung was transferred to the Burgundian royal dynasty of the Gibichings (Old Norse Gj√∫kingar). It was then afterwards adopted by the Franks, who came to identify the Gibichungs as Franks as well, as in the Waltharius. Rosenfeld, on the other hand, argues that the Burgundian clan name Nibelung was adopted by the Nibelungid cadet branch of the Frankish Pippinid dynasty once Charles Martell's brother Childebrand I and his descendants came to rule the former Burgundian kingdom as counts. The royal name Gibichung was then replaced in the heroic tradition with Nibelung in order to connect this Frankish cadet branch to the Burgundian royal dynasty. Dronke subscribes to the traditional scholarly derivation of the name Nibelung from nibel or nebel, meaning cloud or darkness. She notes that other Burgundian clan names are recorded with similar associations: Wulkingos, from wolkan, cloud; Dagilingos, deriving from day; Leuhtingos, deriving from light; and Sauilingos, deriving from sol, meaning sun. Rosenfeld derives the name instead from a name *Niwilo, which is a nickname for the name *Niuw-man (literally new-man). Nibelung would be the patronymic of this name, with the change from w to b showing Romance influence.

Kerr (November 7, 1911 - August 27, 1992), also known in Taiwan as ËëõË∂ÖÊô∫ (or ÊüØÂñ¨Ê≤ª), was a United States diplomat during World War II, and in later years he was an author and an academic. His published works and archived papers cover \\"economic and political affairs in Taiwan in the 1930s and 1940s, Taiwan's transition from Japanese rule before and during World War II to postwar Chinese rule, Taiwanese rebellion against Chinese rule in 1947, and U.S. foreign policy toward Taiwan.\\" His works also include \\"information about economic and political conditions in Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands after World War II.\\" Early life Kerr was born in Pennsylvania. He was a student in Japan during 1935 through 1937; and he was an English teacher in Taihoku, Japanese Taiwan, during 1937 through 1940. Military career As a lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve, Kerr worked for the U.S. Navy as a Taiwan expert and instructed future military government officers during the Pacific War. In 1942‚Äì1943, Kerr was an analyst and consultant on Formosa in the U.S. Department of War. In 1944‚Äì1946, he was the director of the Formosa Research Unit at the Naval School of Military Government and Administration for the U.S. Navy at Columbia University in New York. Diplomatic career After the war, Kerr returned to Taiwan in 1945 as an assistant naval attach√©, escorting the newly appointed Chinese Governor-General Chen Yi to the Japanese surrender of Taiwan on 25 October 1945 (Retrocession Day). Kerr was present in his official capacity as a civil affairs officer of the U.S. Navy Attache's Office to the Republic of China government in Chongqing. Later, he became a diplomat at the U.S. embassy in China. He was a Foreign Service staff officer and vice- consul in Taipei. He has written about his eyewitness account of the February 28 Incident in 1947. It was not till the early 1950s that he realized his wish to visit Okinawa, and with it a military commission to write a history, the purpose of which was to revive an independent Ry≈´ky≈´an identity. An able team of researcher-translators scoured Japan for historical sources on Okinawa. Then Kerr synthesized the material into the book Okinawa: Kingdom and Province (1953), and then in Japanese as Ry≈´ky≈´ no rekishi (1955). In the meantime, Kerr began a revision based on additional research as well as criticism of the first two books and published a 1958 volume, Okinawa: The History of an Island People. Academic career Kerr was a lecturer at the University of Washington during 1947‚Äì1949; and he was a lecturer at Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley in 1949‚Äì1950. For the next five years, he was a research associate at the Hoover Institution. The open sections of Kerr's papers are available at the Okinawa Prefectural Archives in Haebaru, others at the Stanford, Taipei and Ryudai libraries. Later life Kerr's publications on Taiwan are numerous. He championed the cause of Taiwan independence from China, thereby making himself a high-profile enemy to both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong. (Chiang complained and Kerr lost his job at Stanford University.) He also drafted a long book on 19th century Hawaii, thus making his life's work of a piece: the history of Pacific Ocean marine frontiers. He is an author of many books and of numerous articles concerning Japan, Okinawa and Taiwan. Among them are the Formosa: Licensed Revolution and the Home Rule Movement, 1895-1945, Formosa Betrayed (1965), Descriptive Summary: George H. Kerr papers, 1943-1951, Okinawa: The History of an Island People (1958), and The Taiwan Confrontation Crisis (1986). Formosa Betrayed was one of the most influential books about Taiwan's transition from Japanese colonial rule to the rule of the Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party) administration. George Kerr was working for the American Foreign Service at the time of the transition and was present in Taiwan for the KMT occupation and resulting aftermath. Formosa Betrayed made a sharp rebuke of the Nationalist administration and made arguments in favor of Taiwanese independence. The book was republished in 1976 by Da Capo Press. In 1992 a second edition was published by Taiwan Publishing Co. The book is now legally available online (see link below). Okinawa: The History of an Island People covers the legendary past to the Battle of Okinawa in 542 very read-able pages. Eleven years before he died, Kerr wrote that 13,000 copies had been sold. The book was out of print for a time, but Tuttle, the original publishers, reprinted it in 2000, adding a new introduction and an appendix by Okinawa history scholar Mitsugu Sakihara. He died at the age of 80 on August 27, 1992 in Honolulu, Hawaii. Selected works      reprinted in Notes References * A.P. Jenkins, 'G.H.

He was born on 19 January 1882 in a Kashmiri Pandit family settled in North India in the 15th century A.D.. Chakbast was born in Faizabad (near Lucknow) in 1882. His father Pandit Udit Narayan Chakbast, was born at Lucknow in, circa 1843, and he was also a poet. Pandit Udit Narayan was deputy collector, the highest post that any Indian could have at that time.Chakbast By Saraswati Saran, page 13 After the death of his father in 1887, the family moved to Lucknow and they started living in Kashmiri Mohalla of Lucknow. Chakbast was educated in Lucknow, and he became a successful lawyer. Chakbast married in 1905, but lost his wife and first child in 1906. He married again in 1907, and settled down as a practising lawyer at Lucknow. On 12 February 1926, he collapsed at the railway station in Rae Bareli and died a few hours later at the age of 44. Chakbast made a thorough study of Urdu poetry. He defended Daya Shankar Kaul Nasim when it was suggested that he was not the author of the epic Gul Bakawali. He was actively involved in social and political affairs, and was a strong proponent of the Home Rule and actively participated in the Home Rule Movement.Encyclopaedia of Kashmir By Suresh K. Sharma, S. R. Bakshi  Education  Chakbast's early education was in Faizabad. After his father's death his family moved to Lucknow, and it was here he completed his remaining education. He earned his degree of B.A. in 1905, and L.L.B. in 1907, from Canning College, Lucknow, which was affiliated with Allahabad University at that time. Later, he became a successful lawyer.  Works  Chakbast was primarily a poet but his prose is also considered at par with his poetry. Chakbast's premature death was a great loss for Urdu but whatever he left is exemplary and is considered among the gems of Urdu literature. He was strongly influenced by Ghalib, Mir Anis and Aatish. Chakbast was primarily a nazm poet. He began his poetic career with a nazm in 1894. He wrote nazms, mathnavi, a play, and about 50 ghazals. His Ramayan ka ek Scene is strongly remniscent of Marsiya of Mir Anis. His verses from his ghazal :Zindagi kya hai anasir mein zahur-e tarteeb, :Maut kya hai ini ajza ka pareshan hona :Zarra Zarra hai mere Kashmir ka mehmaan nawaaz, :raah mein pathar ke tukdoon ne diya pani mujhe Subh-e Watan is collected works of Chakbast as its title and many of its poems reflect about his intense patriotism, predominantly a central theme of his poetry. Khak-e-Hind Gulzar-e-Naseem a masnavi, Ramayan ka ek scene musaddas Nala-e-Dard Nala-e-Yaas, and a play named Kamla Kulliyate-Chakbast and Maqalaat-e-Chakbast is the complete collection of Chakbast's works in poetry and prose that was published posthumously on the birth centenary of the poet, compiled by Kalidas Gupta 'Raza' around 1983. Legacy The 2015 film Masaan starts with and contains various examples of poetry and shaayari by Chakbast along with the works of Basheer Badr, Akbar Allahabadi, Mirza Ghalib and Dushyant Kumar. Explaining this as a conscious tribute, the film's lyrics writer Varun Grover explained that he wanted to show Shaalu (portrayed by Shweta Tripathi) as a person whose hobby is to read Hindi poetry and shaayari, as this is a common hobby of millennial and generation x youngsters in Northern India, especially when in love, but this aspect is rarely shown in Hindi films.

He was born in Albany, New York, the son of physician Jonathan Eights and Alida Wynkoop. James also became a physician and was appointed an examiner at a local engineering school which is now known as Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Eights became an assistant to Amos Eaton and helped complete the surveys along the Erie Canal. Upon the recommendation of Amos Eaton, who called Eights \\"one of the most competent geologists in North America\\", Eights obtained the position of naturalist on the first voyage of discovery made outside the United States. He was a member of the \\"South Sea Fur Company and Exploring Expedition\\" of 1829. This was a private enterprise organized by Jeremiah N. Reynolds. The expedition included two brigs, Annawan and Seraph, commanded by Benjamin Pendleton and Nathaniel B. Palmer respectively, plus the schooner Penguin commanded by Alexander Palmer. Eights made observations of the flora and fauna in the lands reached by the expedition, which included Patagonia and Staten Island. He was the first to describe a trilobite fossil found on the South Shetland Islands in the Antarctic, a pycnogonid, and the presence of glacial erratics. Upon his return, James Eights published some of his materials in journals, but failed to obtain any further positions on exploratory voyages. He held himself out to be a geologist, mineralogist, and surveyor, obtaining some work away from Albany. Later he produced the watercolors and sketches of the Albany of his youth, by which he is now better known. He is believed to have never practiced medicine after the Antarctic expedition. Eights never married and lived his last years in the home of a sister. Eights died in Ballston, New York. The Eights Coast of Antarctica was named in his honor.

Founded in 1961, they went on to develop a number of early microprocessors and support chips, as well as the widely used 555 timer chip. They were bought by Philips in 1975 and incorporated in Philips Semiconductors (now NXP). History Signetics was started in 1961, by a group of engineers‚ÄîDavid Allison, David James, Lionel Kattner, and Mark Weissenstern‚Äîwho left Fairchild Semiconductor. At the time, Fairchild was concentrating on its component business (mostly transistors), and its management felt that by making integrated circuits (ICs) it would alienate its customers. Signetics founders believed that ICs were the future of electronics (much like another contemporary Fairchild spinoff, Amelco) and wished to commercialize them. The name came from Signal Network Electronics. The venture was financed by a group organized through Lehman Brothers, who invested $1M. The initial idea was to design and manufacture ICs for specific customers. In order to facilitate this goal, Signetics did not have a separate R&D; lab; instead, the engineering was all done in technical development department, and was closely tied to marketing. Signetics first developed a series of standard DTL ICs, which it announced in 1962. However, it was struggling to sell custom-made circuits, which was the original goal, and was quickly exhausting the initial investment money, and new investors had to be found. In November 1962, Corning Glass invested another $1.7M in Signetics, in exchange for 51% ownership. This money enabled Signetics to survive, and much of it was put into a marketing and sales campaign. In 1963, the Department of Defense made a decision to begin a shift towards microelectronics and ICs, due to their small size, higher reliability, and lower power consumption. As a result, military contractors began to explore the field, and as Signetics was one of the few firms selling custom circuits, it benefited greatly. In the fall of 1963 and throughout most of 1964, sales grew quickly, and the company finally became profitable. Signetics also grew rapidly, hiring more engineers and increasing its manufacturing space. In 1964, Signetics opened a large new fabricating plant (\\"fab\\") in Sunnyvale, California. At this time it was by far the largest manufacturer of ICs in Silicon Valley. It later expanded also to factories in Orem, Utah and Albuquerque, New Mexico, where there were two fabs, FAB22 (4-inch) and FAB23 (6-inch). In 1964, Fairchild began to push its way into the IC business. Signetics's circuits being the standard in the market, Fairchild decided to copy them. However, it used its superior cash position, marketing power, and manufacturing strength to undercut Signetics by slashing prices and flooding the market. Signetics was struggling to compete, and began losing money again. Corning saw this as proof of poor management, and used its controlling interest to drive out most of the founders and take complete control of the company. Signetics managed to stabilize and become profitable again, but it never regained its market leadership, which was firmly held by Fairchild. It continued to innovate in the IC technology, and remained a significant force. Around 1971, the Signetics Corporation introduced the 555 timer IC. It was called \\"The IC Time Machine\\". It was also the first and only commercial IC timer available at the time. In 1975 it was acquired by Philips, who continued the brand for some years. In the United States, Signetics reached its manufacturing height at around 1980. Later it was fully integrated into Philips Semiconductors (now NXP). In 1995, Philips spun off the assembly and test operation in South Korea, which was started by Signetics in 1966, as an independent subcontract service provider. They continue to use the name Signetics. Since 2000, Signetics is primarily owned by the Young Poong Group. Notable devices Perhaps the best-known device introduced by Signetics is the 555 timer IC, which is still widely manufactured and used. Also of major impact was the Phase-locked loop series based on the NE565, which along with the VCO NE566 helped advance digital communications. Other well-known devices include: * The Signetics 2650 was an 8-bit microprocessor introduced in the early 1970s and used in several video games and game systems (e.g. the Arcadia 2001). * The Signetics 8X300 was a bipolar microprocessor developed by Scientific Micro Systems but manufactured by Signetics starting in 1976. It was mostly used as a controller chip due to its limited instruction set and its speed. * The Signetics 2513 was a Character generator chip used in the Apple I and early versions of the Apple II, as well as Atari's earliest arcade games.2513 text display ROM * The Signetics 82S100 FPLA (Field Programmable Logic Array) was the first commercially successful user programmable logic device, the forerunner of the modern FPGA. Press release on Signetics 82S100 and 82S101 field programmable logic arrays. Sixteen inputs pins, 8 output pins and 48 product terms.

Records released under the name \\"Bass Communion\\" are in an ambient or electronic vein - lengthy drone- heavy compositions. They come about as experiments in texture made from processing the sound of real instruments and field recordings. Bass Communion's albums have often featured collaborations from other musicians, including Robert Fripp of King Crimson, saxophonist Theo Travis, Bryn Jones (also known as Muslimgauze), and Vidna Obmana.  History  Bass Communion has origins in Steven Wilson's earliest work as a musician. Taking influence from German experimental electronic music artist such as Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Conrad Schnitzler, Wilson, along with childhood friend Simon Vockings, formed the group Altamont in 1983. Wilson and Vockings experimented with primitive analog synthesizers, recording the performances live, without the use of multitracking. These recordings were compiled on the tape Prayer for the Soul in September 1983 and released on the Acid Tapes label, then run by future Imaginary Records boss, Alan Duffy. By the 1990s, Wilson began to notice an increasing amount of music inspired by the same experimental artists who inspired Altamont. Hearing artists such as Paul Schutze and Biosphere, Wilson felt that it was an ideal time to revisit experimental electronic music. The first self-titled Bass Communion album, often referred to as Bass Communion I, was released in April 1998.

Its work was mainly influenced by Krautrock and experimental music from the 1960s and 1970s. Background and history I.E.M. is seldom discussed in any depth by Wilson in interviews and the album packaging provides very little information. The name \\"Incredible Expanding Mindfuck\\" is an in-joke referring to early Porcupine Tree promotional material (in which Porcupine Tree was given an entirely fictional 1970s history and in which the Incredible Expanding Mindfuck was mentioned as a related project). Wilson's work with I.E.M. is in part a continuation of the experimental psychedelic sound which he initially mastered with Porcupine Tree before steering the band towards a more mainstream rock direction with the Stupid Dream album. He has also cited \\"the cosmic jazz of artists like Sun Ra\\" as an influence on the music. I.E.M.'s work is more experimental in nature than that of Porcupine Tree, and is almost entirely instrumental. Almost all instruments on I.E.M. recordings are played by Wilson (although other contributors have included former Bark Psychosis drummer Mark Simnett). The first I.E.M release was a self-titled album on Porcupine Tree's original record label Delerium Records in 1996. It was followed by a limited-edition single called An Escalator to Christmas. Further releases have occasionally followed, with little fanfare or direct promotion. I.E.M.'s most recent release of entirely new music was in 2001 (although 2005's compilation album I.E.M. 1996-1999 included some previously unreleased material). The project has increasingly taken a back seat to Wilson's other projects, most notably to Porcupine Tree, Blackfield and Bass Communion, but also to No-Man, then to Wilson's recent solo release Insurgentes (which itself contains developments of some of the ideas Wilson has previously explored with I.E.M.) and continue to another five Wilson's solo release. A 4-CD boxset featuring I.E.M., An Escalator to Christmas, Arcadia Son and I.E.M. Have Come for Your Children was released on ToneFloat records in June 2010. Limited to 2,000 copies, the boxset is described as \\"both an homage and a final farewell to I.E.M\\". Each CD is packaged in its own Japanese-style mini LP sleeve within a hardback slipcase box. It also includes a 60-page booklet designed by Carl Glover.  Discography  *1996 - I.E.M. *1999 - An Escalator to Christmas *2001 - Arcadia Son *2001 - I.E.M.

These spikes are believed to have been a defensive measure against predators.Holtz, T. R., (2000) \\"Classification and Evolution of the Dinosaur Groups\\" (pp. 140‚Äì168) in The Scientific American Book of Dinosaurs, edited by Gregory S. Paul, New York: St Martin's Press . The arrangement of spikes originally had no distinct name; the term thagomizer was coined in 1982 by cartoonist Gary Larson in his comic The Far Side, and thereafter became gradually adopted as an informal term within scientific circles, research, and education. Paleobiology A thagomizer on the tail of a Stegosaurus fossil There has been debate about whether the spikes were used simply for display, as posited by Gilmore in 1914, or used as a weapon. Robert Bakker noted that it is likely that the stegosaur tail was much more flexible than those of other ornithischian dinosaurs because it lacked ossified tendons, thus lending credence to the idea of the tail as a weapon. He also observed that Stegosaurus could have maneuvered its rear easily by keeping its large hindlimbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short forelimbs, allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack. In 2010, analysis of a digitized model of Kentrosaurus aethiopicus showed that the tail could bring the thagomizer around to the sides of the dinosaur, possibly striking an attacker beside it. In 2001, a study of tail spikes by McWhinney et al., showed a high incidence of trauma-related damage. This too supports the theory that the spikes were used in combat. There is also evidence for Stegosaurus defending itself, in the form of an Allosaurus tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a Stegosaurus tail spike. Stegosaurus stenops had four dermal spikes, each about long. Discoveries of articulated stegosaur armor show that, at least in some species, these spikes protruded horizontally from the tail, not vertically as is often depicted. Initially, Marsh described S. armatus as having eight spikes in its tail, unlike S. stenops. However, recent research re-examined this and concluded this species also had four. Mathematics A thagomizer graph In a 2017 paper, the term \\"thagomizer graph\\" (and also the associated \\"thagomizer matroid\\") has been introduced for the complete tripartite graph . Etymology Far Side cartoon is the source of the term thagomizer The term thagomizer was coined by Gary Larson in jest. In a 1982 The Far Side comic, a group of cavemen in a faux-modern lecture hall are taught by their caveman professor that the spikes on a stegosaur's tail are so named \\"after the late Thag Simmons\\". The term was picked up initially by Ken Carpenter, a paleontologist at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, who used the term when describing a fossil at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Annual Meeting in 1993. Thagomizer has since been adopted as an informal anatomical term, and is used by the Smithsonian Institution, the Dinosaur National Monument, the book The Complete Dinosaur and the BBC documentary series Planet Dinosaur. The original cartoon is intended as lighthearted farce, as stegosaurs and humans did not exist in the same era; humans evolved around 60 million years after the event that killed all non-avian dinosaurs, and some 120 million years after stegosaurids went extinct. In The Prehistory of the Far Side, Gary Larson suggests that \\"there should be cartoon confessionals where we could go and say things like, 'Father, I have sinned ‚Äì I have drawn dinosaurs and hominids together in the same cartoon.Larson, G.

These savannas were maintained historically through wildfires set by lightning, humans, grazing, low precipitation, and/or poor soil. Map of oak savanna distribution in North AmericaAlthough there are pockets of oak savanna almost anywhere in North America where oaks are present, there are three major oak savanna areas: 1) California, Washington and Oregon in the west; 2) Southwestern United States and Mexico; and 3) the prairie/forest border of the Midwest.McPherson, Guy R. 1997. Ecology and Management of North American Savannas. University of Arizona Press, Tucson.Anderson, Roger A., Fralish, James S. and Baskin, Jerry M. editors.1999. Savannas, Barrens, and Rock Outcrop Plant Communities of North America. Cambridge University Press. There are also small areas of oak savannas in other parts of the world. (See also Eastern savannas of the United States for information on pine savannas of the U.S. South.) Wisconsin bur oak savanna; mid-summer Fox River Grove, Illinois oak savanna; winter Midwestern oak savannas The oak savannas of the Midwestern United States and form a transition zone between the arid Great Plains to the west and the moist broadleaf and mixed forests to the east. Oak savannas are found in a wide belt from northern Minnesota and southern Wisconsin, down through Iowa, Illinois, northern and central Missouri, eastern Kansas, and central Oklahoma to north- central Texas, with isolated pockets further east around the Great Lakes including Ontario.Nuzzo, V.A. 1986. Extent and status of Midwest oak savanna: presettlement and 1985. Natural Areas Journal 6: 6-36. The bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) is the dominant species in northern oak savannas, although black oak (Quercus velutina), white oak (Quercus alba), and Hill's oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis)are sometimes present. The dominant tree in the south is usually the black oak (Quercus velutina), although the chinquapin oak (Quercus muhlenbergii), post oak (Quercus stellata), and black-jack oak (Quercus marilandica) are also common. The flora of the herbaceous layer generally consists of species associated with tallgrass prairies, both grasses and flowering plants, although some woodland species may be present. There are also a few species that are unique to oak savannas.Packard, Steve. Just a few oddball species: restoration and the recovery of the tallgrass savanna. 1988. Restoration and Management Notes 6:1, 13-22 Oak savannas, because of their mixture of grassland, woodland, and unique savanna species, typically have a higher plant diversity than grasslands and woodlands combined. History Before European settlement, the oak savanna, a characteristic fire ecology, was extensive and was often a dominant part of the ecosystem. Fires, set by lightning or Native Americans, ensured that the savanna areas did not turn into forests. Only trees with a high tolerance for fire, principally certain oak species, were able to survive. On sandy soils, black oak (Quercus velutina) predominated. On rich soils bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) was the major tree in Midwestern North America. These savanna areas provided habitat for many animals, including American bison, elk, and white-tailed deer. The most fire-tolerant of the oak species is the bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), which is especially common in hill-country savannas in the Midwest. Fire- tolerant bur oak savanna in Wisconsin hill country European settlers cleared much of the savanna for agricultural use. In addition, they suppressed the fire cycle. Thus surviving pockets of savanna typically became less like savannas and more like forests or thickets. Many oak savanna plant and animal species became extinct or rare. Prescribed burn; Wisconsin bur oak savanna Restoration Prescribed burn in oak savanna in Iowa With the rise in interest in environmental conservation, restoration and preservation of surviving areas of oak savanna began. Low intensity, spring prescribed burns have been used since 1964 at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in Minnesota in an attempt to restore the area to an oak savanna.Research Paper NC-266. St. Paul, MN: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service, North Central Forest Experiment Station Burned areas are now more savanna like (having greater grass and forb and lower shrub and lower tree representation) than unburned areas but still have higher overstory densities than apparently existed in presettlement times. Restoration work began in the 1970s in Illinois, followed by work in Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, and Minnesota.Stevens, William K. 1995. Miracle Under the Oaks: The Revival of Nature in America; New York. Pocket Books The Bald Hill Natural Area in Corvallis, Oregon was established in the 1990s in part to protect oak savanna remnants. Current distribution Presettlement there was approximately 50,000,000 acres of oak savanna in Midwestern United States, all of it being exclusively in a wide strip stretching from southwestern Michigan to eastern Nebraska and from southern Manitoba to central Texas. After Europeans arrived, fire suppression and settlement diminished the oak savannas to a fraction of their former expanse, which currently exist in many fragmented pockets throughout its native range. Many sites are protected and maintained by government bodies or non-profit organizations such as The Nature Conservancy, the Wisconsin and Minnesota Departments of Natural Resources, and the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation. Examples of remnant oak savanna include: * Neal Smith Wildlife Refuge near Prairie City, Iowa. * Indiana Dunes National Park in Indiana. * Hobart Nature District in Hobart, Indiana. * Numerous State Natural Areas in Wisconsin. * Lake County Forest Preserve District in Illinois. * Cook County Forest Preserve District and Iroquois County State Wildlife Area in Illinois. * Oak Openings Preserve Metropark in Ohio. * Pinery Provincial Park on Lake Huron in Ontario, Canada.

Its molecule can be described as a benzene molecule with two adjacent hydrogen atoms replaced by a lactone-like chain , forming a second six-membered heterocycle that shares two carbons with the benzene ring. It can be placed in the benzopyrone chemical class and considered as a lactone. Coumarin is a colorless crystalline solid with a sweet odor resembling the scent of vanilla and a bitter taste. It is found in many plants, where it may serve as a chemical defense against predators. By inhibiting synthesis of vitamin K, a related compound is used as the prescription drug warfarin - an anticoagulant - to inhibit formation of blood clots, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. Etymology Coumarin is derived from coumarou, the French word for the tonka bean. The word tonka for the tonka bean is taken from the Galibi (Carib) tongue spoken by natives of French Guiana (one source for the plant); it also appears in Old Tupi, another language of the same region, as the name of the tree. The old genus name, Coumarouna, was formed from another Tupi name for tree, kumar√∫.  History  Coumarin was first isolated from tonka beans in 1820 by A. Vogel of Munich, who initially mistook it for benzoic acid. Also in 1820, Nicholas Jean Baptiste Gaston Guibourt (1790‚Äì1867) of France independently isolated coumarin, but he realized that it was not benzoic acid. In a subsequent essay he presented to the pharmacy section of the Acad√©mie Royale de M√©decine, Guibourt named the new substance coumarine. In 1835, the French pharmacist A. Guillemette proved that Vogel and Guibourt had isolated the same substance. Coumarin was first synthesized in 1868 by the English chemist William Henry Perkin. Coumarin has been an integral part of the foug√®re genre of perfume since it was first used in Houbigant's Foug√®re Royale in 1882.  Synthesis  Coumarin can be prepared by a number of name reactions, with the Perkin reaction between salicylaldehyde and acetic anhydride being a popular example. The Pechmann condensation provides another route to coumarin and its derivatives, as does the Kostanecki acylation, which can also be used to produce chromones. Natural occurrence Coumarin is found naturally in many plants, notably in high concentration in the tonka bean (Dipteryx odorata). It also occurs in vanilla grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum), sweet grass (Hierochloe odorata) and sweet-clover (genus Melilotus), which are named for the sweet (i.e., pleasant) smell of the compound. Other plants with substantial coumarin content are cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia; not to be confused with true cinnamon, Cinnamomum verum, or Ceylon cinnamon Cinnamomum zeylanicum, which contain little coumarin), deertongue (Carphephorus odoratissimus), mullein (genus Verbascum), and in many cherry blossom tree varieties (of the genus Prunus). Coumarin is also found in extracts of Justicia pectoralis. Related compounds are found in some but not all specimens of genus Glycyrrhiza, from which the root and flavour licorice derives. Coumarin is found naturally also in many edible plants such as strawberries, black currants, apricots, and cherries.  Biological function  Coumarin has appetite-suppressing properties, which may discourage animals from eating plants that contain it. Though the compound has a pleasant sweet odor, it has a bitter taste, and animals tend to avoid it.  Metabolism  The biosynthesis of coumarin in plants is via hydroxylation, glycolysis, and cyclization of cinnamic acid. In humans, the enzyme encoded by the gene UGT1A8 has glucuronidase activity with many substrates, including coumarins.  Related compounds and derivatives  Coumarin and its derivatives are all considered phenylpropanoids. Some naturally occurring coumarin derivatives include umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin), aesculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin), psoralen and imperatorin. 4-Phenylcoumarin is the backbone of the neoflavones, a type of neoflavonoids. Coumarin pyrazole hybrids have been synthesized from hydrazones, carbazones and thiocarbazones via Vilsmeier Haack formylation reaction. Compounds derived from coumarin are also called coumarins or coumarinoids; this family includes: * brodifacoum * bromadiolone * difenacoum * auraptene * ensaculin * phenprocoumon (Marcoumar) * PSB-SB-487 * PSB-SB-1202 * Scopoletin can be isolated from the bark of Shorea pinanga * warfarin (Coumadin) Coumarin is transformed into the natural anticoagulant dicoumarol by a number of species of fungi. This occurs as the result of the production of 4-hydroxycoumarin, then further (in the presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde) into the actual anticoagulant dicoumarol, a fermentation product and mycotoxin. Dicoumarol was responsible for the bleeding disease known historically as \\"sweet clover disease\\" in cattle eating moldy sweet clover silage. In basic research, preliminary evidence exists for coumarin having various biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antibacterial, and antifungal properties, among others. Uses Medicine Warfarin - a coumarin - with brand name, Coumadin, is a prescription drug used as an anticoagulant to inhibit formation of blood clots, and so is a therapy for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. It may be used to prevent recurrent blood clot formation from atrial fibrillation, thrombotic stroke, and transient ischemic attacks. Coumarins have shown some evidence of biological activity and have limited approval for few medical uses as pharmaceuticals, such as in the treatment of lymphedema. Both coumarin and indandione derivatives produce a uricosuric effect, presumably by interfering with the renal tubular reabsorption of urate. Rodenticide precursor Coumarin is used in the pharmaceutical industry as a precursor reagent in the synthesis of a number of synthetic anticoagulant pharmaceuticals similar to dicoumarol. 4-hydroxycoumarins are a type of vitamin K antagonist. They block the regeneration and recycling of vitamin K. These chemicals are sometimes also incorrectly referred to as \\"coumadins\\" rather than 4-hydroxycoumarins. Some of the 4-hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant class of chemicals are designed to have high potency and long residence times in the body, and these are used specifically as rodenticides (\\"rat poison\\"). Death occurs after a period of several days to two weeks, usually from internal hemorrhaging. Laser dyes Coumarin dyes are extensively used as gain media in blue-green tunable organic dye lasers. Among the various coumarin laser dyes are coumarins 480, 490, 504, 521, 504T, and 521T. Coumarin tetramethyl laser dyes offer wide tunability and high laser gain, and they are also used as active medium in coherent OLED emitters. and as a sensitizer in older photovoltaic technologies. Perfumes and aromatizers Coumarin is often found in artificial vanilla substitutes, despite having been banned as a food additive in numerous countries since the mid-20th century. It is still used as a legal flavorant in soaps, rubber products, and the tobacco industry, particularly for sweet pipe tobacco and certain alcoholic drinks.  Toxicity  Coumarin is moderately toxic to the liver and kidneys, with a median lethal dose (LD50) of 293 mg/kg,Coumarin Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) a low toxicity compared to related compounds. Though it is only somewhat dangerous to humans, coumarin is hepatotoxic in rats, but less so in mice. Rodents metabolize it mostly to 3,4-coumarin epoxide, a toxic, unstable compound that on further differential metabolism may cause liver cancer in rats and lung tumors in mice. Humans metabolize it mainly to 7-hydroxycoumarin, a compound of lower toxicity. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment has established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.1 mg coumarin per kg body weight, but also advises that higher intake for a short time is not dangerous. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States does not classify coumarin as a carcinogen for humans. European health agencies have warned against consuming high amounts of cassia bark, one of the four main species of cinnamon, because of its coumarin content. According to the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BFR), 1 kg of (cassia) cinnamon powder contains about 2.1 to 4.4 g of coumarin. Powdered cassia cinnamon weighs 0.56 g/cm3, so a kilogram of cassia cinnamon powder equals 362.29 teaspoons. One teaspoon of cassia cinnamon powder therefore contains 5.8 to 12.1 mg of coumarin, which may be above the tolerable daily intake value for smaller individuals. However, the BFR only cautions against high daily intake of foods containing coumarin. Its report specifically states that Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) contains \\"hardly any\\" coumarin. The European Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 describes the following maximum limits for coumarin: 50 mg/kg in traditional and/or seasonal bakery ware containing a reference to cinnamon in the labeling, 20 mg/kg in breakfast cereals including muesli, 15 mg/kg in fine bakery ware, with the exception of traditional and/or seasonal bakery ware containing a reference to cinnamon in the labeling, and 5 mg/kg in desserts. An investigation from the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration in 2013 shows that bakery goods characterized as fine bakery ware exceeds the European limit (15 mg/kg) in almost 50% of the cases. The paper also mentions tea as an additional important contributor to the overall coumarin intake, especially for children with a sweet habit. Coumarin was banned as a food additive in the United States in 1954, largely because of the hepatotoxicity results in rodents. Coumarin is currently listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States among \\"Substances Generally Prohibited From Direct Addition or Use as Human Food,\\" according to 21 CFR 189.130, but some natural additives containing coumarin, such as the flavorant sweet woodruff are allowed \\"in alcoholic beverages only\\" under 21 CFR 172.510. In Europe, popular examples of such beverages are Maiwein, white wine with woodruff, and ≈ªubr√≥wka, vodka flavoured with bison grass. Coumarin is subject to restrictions on its use in perfumery, as some people may become sensitized to it, however the evidence that coumarin can cause an allergic reaction in humans is disputed. Minor neurological dysfunction was found in children exposed to the anticoagulants acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon during pregnancy. A group of 306 children were tested at ages 7‚Äì15 years to determine subtle neurological effects from anticoagulant exposure. Results showed a dose‚Äìresponse relationship between anticoagulant exposure and minor neurological dysfunction. Overall, a 1.9 (90%) increase in minor neurological dysfunction was observed for children exposed to these anticoagulants, which are collectively referred to as \\"coumarins.\\" In conclusion, researchers stated, \\"The results suggest that coumarins have an influence on the development of the brain which can lead to mild neurologic dysfunctions in children of school age.\\" Coumarin's presence in cigarette tobacco caused Brown & Williamson executive Dr. Jeffrey Wigand to contact CBS's news show 60 Minutes in 1995, charging that a ‚Äúform of rat poison‚Äù was in the tobacco. He held that from a chemist‚Äôs point of view, coumarin is an ‚Äúimmediate precursor‚Äù to the rodenticide coumadin. Dr. Wigand later stated that coumarin itself is dangerous, pointing out that the FDA had banned its addition to human food in 1954. Under his later testimony, he would repeatedly classify coumarin as a \\"lung-specific carcinogen.\\" In Germany, coumarin is banned as an additive in tobacco. Alcoholic beverages sold in the European Union are limited to a maximum of 10 mg/l coumarin by law. Cinnamon flavor is generally cassia bark steam-distilled to concentrate the cinnamaldehyde, for example, to about 93%. Clear cinnamon-flavored alcoholic beverages generally test negative for coumarin, but if whole cassia bark is used to make mulled wine, then coumarin shows up at significant levels.

OHSU (157 Or.App. 502), which required public employers to extend domestic partner benefits to same-sex couples. Supporters also argued that abolishing the state-run insurer would lead to more competition and reduce rates. Critics of the measure, which included the state's largest business lobby and the state chapters of the National Federation of Independent Business and the AFL- CIO, argued that SAIF is critical to keeping workers' compensation rates low. They also argued that Oregonians for Accountability was actually a front for Liberty Mutual, SAIF's major competitor for workers' compensation policies.

The common name aptly describes this bird, which has yellow breast feathers broadly edged with green that look like scales. Taxonomy The scaly-breasted lorikeet was first described by German zoologist Heinrich Kuhl in 1820. Other names this bird is known by include the gold and green lorikeet, greenie,Lendon, p. 12 green lorikeet, green and yellow lorikeet, green keet, green parrot, green leek, and green leaf. It is often colloquially referred to as a \\"scaly\\". Its specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek root khl≈çros 'green, yellow', and lepid≈çtos 'scaly'. Description Two adults in Australia The scaly-breasted lorikeet is about long.Forshaw (2006). plate 13. The crown and sides of head are emerald-green slightly tinged with blue, while the feathers of the back of the neck and throat and breast are yellow, broadly edged with green, giving scaly appearance. The tail is green with the base of the outer tail-feathers marked with orange-red. The lower flanks, thighs and undertail-coverts green are strongly marked with yellow, while the underwing-coverts are orange-red. They have orange-red eyes, and their bills (beaks) are dark coral-red. Their legs are generally grey-brown. Male and female are similar in external appearance. Juveniles appear similar to adults, but their tails are shorter. Eyes are pale brown or black, and bills are brown with some yellow markings or orange with brown markings. Distribution and habitat This lorikeet is common in most timbered areas of Eastern Australia from Bamaga, the tip of North Queensland, south to Illawarra district on the New South Wales south coast; also on some offshore islands. They are generally confined to coastal plains and adjacent tablelands; occasionally found along watercourses west of the Great Dividing Range.Pizzey, Graham and Doyle, Roy. (1980) A Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. Collins Publishers, Sydney. They are abundant and mostly sedentary in north; less numerous and nomadic in the south. They favour open, lightly timbered areas and melaleuca thickets. Behaviour Kobble Creek, SE Queensland The lorikeet's predominantly green plumage blends so well with foliage that the bird is hard to detect. An observer beneath a tree where scaly-breasted lorikeets are feeding may take some time to spot the birds. Their dark coral beak is often the first indications to their whereabouts. They seem to favour open, lightly timbered areas, but may be seen in melaleuca thickets when the trees are flowering. The scaly-breasted lorikeet is usually seen in small flocks, flying overhead, or feeding among the outermost branches of flowering trees. They frequent most timbered areas and are often seen in gardens and parklands ‚Äì even in large cities. Scaly-breasted lorikeets fly swiftly and in a straight path. As they pass overhead the sound of their rapid wing-beats can be heard along with their high-pitched call. Calls Pikedale, S Queensland, Australia Scaly-breasted lorikeets are extremely noisy birds and attract attention by their screeching and chattering. The contact call of these birds is a metallic, rolling, continuous screech in flight. They have a shrill chatter when feeding. While resting, they have a soft, gentle twitter. Although, these birds can be quite noisy as mating season draws nearer. These birds are often making loud tweets/squawks when looking for their food. Feeding Scaly-breasted lorikeets have similar habits to the related rainbow lorikeet, and the two species often group together in mixed flocks. Both species feed mainly on nectar, such as that from the broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia), and pollen, but they also eat blossoms, berries, other fruit, and insects and their larvae. They are very fond of cultivated fruits and often cause damage in orchards; they also raid sorghum and maize crops to feed on unripe milky grain.  Breeding  Juvenile Breeding occurs in all months except March and April though usually August‚ÄìJanuary in the southern part of its range. These birds nest in hollow trees, usually high above the ground, with a layer of wood dust serving as a mattress at the bottom. They usually lay two eggs, rarely three; they are white, oval, and about 26 X 20 mm. Incubation lasts about 25 days. Males spend time in the nest hollow, but apparently do not share in the incubation. Both parents feed the young, which leave the nest six to eight weeks after hatching. Aviculture The scaly-breasted lorikeet adapts fairly well to captivity, and is playful and quiet, although it can be aggressive.Lendon, p. 15 A blue mutation, with dark blue plumage and white breast markings, has been bred in Australia.Low, p. 90 References Cited texts  * External links *Photos, audio and video of scaly-breasted lorikeet from Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Macaulay Library scaly-breasted lorikeet Category:Birds of Queensland Category:Birds of New South Wales Category:Birds of Victoria (Australia) Category:Endemic birds of Australia scaly-breasted lorikeet Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Scaly-breasted lorikeet"},{"id":"1116955","text":"A Musical Gathering - Ottoman, 18th century Islamic music may refer to religious music, as performed in Islamic public services or private devotions, or more generally to musical traditions of the Muslim world. The classic heartland of Islam is the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Iran, Central Asia, and South Asia. Due to Islam being a multi-ethnic religion, the musical expression of its adherents is vastly diverse. Indigenous traditions of various part have influenced the musical styles popular among Muslims today. Secular and folk musical styles Middle East * Arabic music * Egyptian music * Iranian music * Turkish classical music All of these regions were connected by trade long before the Islamic conquests of the 7th century, and it is likely that musical styles travelled the same routes as trade goods. However, lacking recordings, we can only speculate as to the pre-Islamic music of these areas. Islam must have had a great influence on music, as it united vast areas under the first caliphs, and facilitated trade between distant lands. Certainly, the Sufis, brotherhoods of Muslim mystics, spread their music far and wide. North Africa The Berber and Arabic speaking countries of North Africa, such as Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, share some musical traditions with Egypt and the Arab countries of the Middle East. Popular modern styles of music such as Ra√Ø and Chaabi originated in Berber counties. In addition, West African influences can be heard in the popular music of Gnawa. * Music of Algeria * Music of Morocco Horn of Africa Somali oud player Nuruddin Ali Amaan. Most Somali music is based on the pentatonic scale. That is, the songs only use five pitches per octave in contrast to a heptatonic (seven note) scale such as the major scale. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, Sudan or Eritrea, but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between lyricists (midho), songwriters (lahan), and singers ('odka or \\"voice\\").Abdullahi, pp.170-171 Instruments prominently featured in Somali music include the kaban (oud). West Africa Islam is the largest and oldest organized religion in this region, although indigenous Sahelian and Saharan styles and genres are more prominent than those influenced by Middle- Eastern theory. West African musical genres are more varied, and tend to incorporate both native and Berber influences, rather than those of Arab origin. A long history of court griot music based on historical accounts and praise-singing exists in the region. Wind and string instruments, such as the Kora harp, xalam lute, or Tambin flute (similar to the ney) are generally preferred to percussion, although percussion instruments such as the talking drum and djembe are also widely played among Muslim populations Central Asia Many of the countries in Central Asia such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan have been heavily influenced by Turkic and Persian culture. Bowed instruments are common, as is bardic singing. * Music of Central Asia South Asia The music of the Muslim countries of South Asia (Bangladesh, Maldives and Pakistan) as well as countries with sizeable Muslim minorities (India, Nepal and Sri Lanka) merged Middle Eastern genres with indigenous classical musical modes, and is generally distinct in style and orchestration, yet due to the strong links encountered between the Middle-East, Central Asia, and South Asia, it is closer to Middle-Eastern styles than those of the periphery of the Islamic world, which tend to be purely indigenous. Folk music of Balochistan, Pakistan * Music of Bangladesh *Music of Maldives * Music of Pakistan Southeast Asia Indonesian Sundanese Gamelan Degung Muslim- majority Indonesia has been significantly less influenced by Middle Eastern traditions than South Asia. As a result, many local musical styles predate the coming of Islam, although exceptions include Malay Zapin and Joget, and the Indonesian Gambus, all of which show strong Middle Eastern influence. There are also local music genres in Muslim-majority regions in Southeast Asia that are influenced by Arabian traditions, such as the tagonian of the Sundanese people and glipang of the people of Probolinggo The music of South East Asia's Muslim-majority regions is more closely related to the musical genres of South East and East Asia. Gong chime ensembles such as Gamelan and Kulintang existed in the region before the arrival of Islam, and musical theory and method owe more to heavy Chinese influence, as well as Hindu-Buddhist principles, than to Arabic musical philosophy. Variations of one of two main scales prevail in the region among different ensembles: slendro and pelog (both of which originated in Java). In Java, use of the gamelan for Islamic devotional music was encouraged by the Muslim saint Sunan Kalijogo. Types of Muslim devotional recitation and music Nasheed Nasheeds are moral, religious songs sung in various melodies by some Muslims of today without any musical instruments. However, some nasheed groups use percussion instruments, such as the daff. Singing moral songs of this type without instrumentation is considered permissible (halal) by many Muslims. Some famous nasheed singers are Native Deen, Outlandish, UNIC and Raihan. Other well-known artists are Ahmed Bukhatir, Yusuf Islam (formerly known as Cat Stevens), Ahmed Mac, Sami Yusuf, Junaid Jamshed, Zahid Ullah Afridi, Maher Zain, Harris J, Hamood ul khuder, Hamza Namira, Raef, Jae deen (Deen squad), Mesut Kurtis, Dawud Wharnsby, Zain Bhikha. Sufi music Sufi worship services are often called dhikr or zikr. See that article for further elaboration. The dhikr of South Asian Muslims is \\"quietist\\". The Sufi services best known in the West are the chanting and rhythmic dancing of the whirling dervishes or Mevlevi Sufis of Turkey. However, Sufis may also perform devotional songs in public, for the enjoyment and edification of listeners. The mood is religious, but the gathering is not a worship service. In Turkey, once the seat of the Ottoman Empire and the Caliphate, concerts of sacred song are called \\"Mehfil-e-Sama' \\" (or \\"gathering of Sama'\\"). Song forms include ilahi and nefe. In South Asia, especially Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, a widely known style of Sufi music is qawwali. A traditional qawwali programme would include: * A hamd‚Äîa song in praise of Allah * A na\`at‚Äîa song in praise of Muhammad * Manqabats‚Äîsongs in praise of the illustrious teachers of the Sufi brotherhood to which the musicians belong * Ghazals‚Äîsongs of intoxication and yearning, which use the language of romantic love to express the soul's longing for union with the divine. Shi'a qawwali performances typically follow the naat with a manqabat in praise of Ali, and sometimes a marsiya, a lamentation over the death of much of Ali's family at the Battle of Karbala. The most well-known qawwali singer in modern times is Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Another traditional South Asian genre of Sufi music is the Kafi, which is more meditative and involves solo singing as opposed to the ensemble form seen in qawwali. The most widely known exponent of the Kafi is the Pakistani singer Abida Parveen. Sufi music has developed with the times. A Pakistani Sufi rock band, Junoon, was formed in the 1990s to bring a modern twist to suit the new younger generation. The band achieved wide popularity, in Pakistan as well as in the West. Music for public religious celebrations * Ta'zieh music‚ÄîTa'zieh is a passion play, part musical drama, part religious drama, rarely performed outside Iran. It depicts the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, venerated by Shia Muslims. * Ashurah music‚Äîperformed during the Muharram mourning period, commemorating the deaths of Imam Hussein and his followers. (Shia) * Thikiri (from the Arabic word \\"Dhikr\\" which means remembrance of God‚Äîperformed by the Qadiriyya Sufi orders of waYao or Yao people in East and Southern Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and South Africa). * Manzuma‚Äîmoral songs performed in Ethiopia. * Madih nabawi‚ÄîArabic hymns praising Muhammad. Modes * Arabic Maqam * Dastgah Instruments Some Muslims believe that only vocal music is permissible (halal) and that instruments are forbidden (haram). Hence there is a strong tradition of a cappella devotional singing. Yet some Muslims believe that any instrument is lawful as long as it is used for the permissible kinds of music. Hence there is a long tradition of instrumental accompaniment to devotional songs. A wide variety of instruments may be used, depending on local musical traditions. Traditional: * Drums (daf, bendir, zarb, rebana...) * Gongs * Lute or oud * Wind instruments (ney...) ** Reed instruments (shehnai...) Recent introductions: * Harmonium (popular in Pakistan and India) Lyrics When lyrics are not simply repeated and elaborated invocations (Yah Nabi and the like), they are usually poems in forms and meters common in the local literature. Permissibility of music The question of permissibility of music in Islamic jurisprudence is historically disputed. Imam al-Ghazzali, one of the most famous Muslim scholars, writing almost a thousand years ago, reported several hadith and came to the conclusion that music is permitted, saying: ‚ÄúAll these Ahadith are reported by al-Bukhari and singing and playing are not haram.‚Äù But majority of scholars interpret the chapters of Luqman and Al-Isra in the Quran as evidence that music is haram,Islam-QA website: \\"Ruling on so-called ‚ÄúIslamic‚Äù songs with musical instruments\\" Islam-QA retrieved June 22, 2013 although this is disputed by others who disagree.Shahbaz Center for Sufism & Islamic Studies\\" retrieved October 27, 2016 Those who do not allow music believe that Muhammad censured the use of musical instruments when he said: \\"There will be among my Ummah people who will regard as permissible adultery, silk, alcohol and musical instruments\\".Sahih al-Bukhari, 5590. Those who argue that music is halal (permitted) state that this hadith relates to usage‚Äîat the time the polytheists used music and musical instruments as part of their worship- and does not apply to all music. They also point out that in the Quran, it is stated that Hazrat Dawud was given the Psalms.The Noble Quran: \\"Surah An-Nissa\\" retrieved October 27, 2016 (an-Nisa, 4/163; al-Isra, 17/55). In other Islamic resources, it is stated that the Psalms given to Hazrat Dawud were sent down in the month of Ramadan, that it contained sermons and words of wisdom and that Hazrat Dawud usually recited it accompanied by a melody and a musical instrument;Questions on Islam: \\"Hazrat Dawud was given the Psalms\\" retrieved October 27, 2016 therefore music is permitted. Supporters of this view also point out that in classical Islamic jurisprudence and Sharia, the Quran is the higher authority on correct Islamic practice; the hadith, while important, are secondary to the Quran. Mutahhari, Morteza. \\"Jurisprudence and its Principles\\" retrieved October 27, 2016 Those who saw the permissibility of music include some of the most famous Muslim scholars, jurists, philosophers, and Sufi poets of the Muslim world, including Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi, Ibn al-Qaisarani, Ibn Sina, Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, Rumi, Ibn Rushd, and Ibn Hazm. Al-Ghazali also reports a narration from al-Khidr, where he expressed a favorable opinion of music, provided it be within the usage limitation of virtuous areas.What Does Islam Say on Music? (Islam Online - Ask The Scholar) Al-Ghazali has been referred to by some historians as the single most influential Muslim after the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Certain schools of Sunnis as well as some Shiites hold that music is forbidden with the sole exception being that women can play the Daf, a traditional one sided drum, at celebrations and festivals. However some Islamic groups and denominations deem music permissible including many Sufi orders who use music as part of their worship. According to some authorities, Islam does allow singing without musical accompaniment within prescribed circumstances‚Äînamely that the performer be of the same gender as the audience; there is a well-known hadith in which two small girls were singing to a woman, and the Prophet Muhammad instructed Abu Bakr to let them, stating, \\"Leave them Abu Bakr, for every nation has an Eid (i.e. festival) and this day is our Eid.\\".Sahih al-Bukhari, 3931 Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 5, Book of Merits of Al-Ansaar, Hadith 268 Sahih al-Bukhari, Book of Merits of Al-Ansaar, Hadith 268 Sahih Bukhari: \\"Sahih Bukhari Volume 005, Book 058, Hadith Number 268\\" retrieved October 27, 2016 Others hold that music is permitted in Islam provided that the lyrics are not obscene or vulgar.  Iran  Based upon the authentic Twelver ahadith, numerous Iranian Grand Ayatollahs; Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi, Mohammad-Reza Golpaygani, Lotfollah Safi Golpaygani, Mohammad-Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi, Ahmad Jannati and others, ruled that all music and instrument playing is haram, no matter the purpose. http://fares.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/01/iran- islam-music-taboo-debate-tv-musicians-sunni-haram.html https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/mar/13/iran-supreme-mohammad- yazdi-leader-in-waiting Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini held similar religious position, stating on 23 July 1979: ‚ÄúIf you want independence for your country, you must suppress music and not fear to be called old‚Äêfashioned.

He is a prolific songwriter, with hundreds of recorded songs across over 40 solo albums. He also has many songs that were recorded by singers from different musical genres. Internationally celebrated artists such as Nana Mouskouri (Greece), Ornella Vanoni (Italy), Katia Guerreiro (Portugal), Rosario Flores (Spain) have put their voices to Martinho‚Äôs songs and lyrics. As a singer, he is considered by critics as one of the top exponents of samba to have ever lived. Among his many national collaborations, a few notable names are Zeca Pagodinho, Arlindo Cruz, Chico Buarque, Beth Carvalho, Noel Rosa, Alcione, among others. Furthermore, Martinho composed some of the most important samba enredos (samba school themed songs) and has forged a solid partnership with the Vila Isabel samba school. In spite of being a self-taught singer / songwriter with no academic background, Martinho has a great connection with classical music. He participated in the symphonic project \\"Samba Classics\\" under the baton of the late Maestro Silvio Barbato, which went on to be performed by several classical orchestras such as the Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, and Espirito Santo Orchestras, as well as the Orquestra Petrobras and the Orfe√¥nica of Denmark. He also devised, in partnership with Maestro Bruno Leonardo, the Black Concert, a Symphonic performance that focuses on the participation of black musicians in classical music. In addition to being a celebrated singer and songwriter, Martinho is also a writer and author of 13 books: Notable works include Os Lus√≥fonos, republished in Portugal, as well as Joanna and Joanes - A Fluminense Romance, and √ìpera Negra, which was later translated into French. At the Book Fair in Paris in 2015, Martinho released his novel Os Lus√≥fonos. As a journalist, Martinho writes articles for O Globo, Folha de S√£o Paulo and O Estad√£o newspapers, several magazines, and, for two years, he was a weekly columnist of the newspaper O Dia. He is also politically active and a prominent figure and spokesperson for Afro-Brazilian issues as well as for the Brazilian Communist Party. He is the author of six books, and has been a recording artist since 1969. Apart from his own interpretations, Simone stands out as one of his greatest interpreters, with a whole album dedicated to him, entitled Caf√© com leite.  Biography  Martinho da Vila‚Äôs artistic career became public at the III Festival of Record, in 1967, when he entered the competition with the song \\"Menina Mo√ßa\\". However, success came the following year, in the fourth edition of the same festival, with the song \\"Casa de Bamba,\\" one of Martinho's classics. The first album, released in 1969, entitled Martinho da Vila, already demonstrated the extent of his talent as a composer and musician, which, in addition to \\"Casa de Bamba\\", showcased masterpieces such as \\"O Pequeno Burgu√™s,\\" \\"Quem √© do Mar n√£o enjoa\\" and \\"Pra que Dinheiro\\" among other gems such as\\" Brasil Mulato\\", \\"Amor pra que Nasceu\\" and \\"Tom Maior\\". He soon became one of the most respected Brazilian artists as well as one of the major album sellers in Brazil. He was only the second samba recording artist to exceed the mark of one million copies sold with the CD T√° Del√≠cia, T√° Gostoso released in 1995 (the first was Agep√™, which in 1984 sold a million and a half copies with his Brazilian Mix album). At the closing ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympics, Martinho performed onstage in the Maracan√£ Stadium, singing \\"\\" with his three daughters and one granddaughter.\\"Rio Olympics closing ceremony\\", Newsday, August 21, 2016.  Awards  Among the titles received are Carioca Citizen (for citizens of Rio de Janeiro), Citizen Benefactor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Commander of the official degree in Republic and the Order of Cultural Merit, for his contribution to Brazilian culture. In his musical career, in 1991 Martinho won the Shell Award for Brazilian Popular Music. In 2014, he was nominated to the Latin Grammy for Best Samba / Pagode Album.  Samba School  His dedication to the beloved GRES Unidos de Vila Isabel, began in 1965. Before that, he used to be a regular at the Aprendizes da Boca do Mato samba school. Since joining Vila Isabel, he has written dozens of songs for the school. He wrote the samba ‚ÄúKizomba: A Festa da Ra√ßa‚Äù, which secured Special Group title in 1988. After a 17-year hiatus, in 2010, Martinho won the sambas enredo contest again, providing the school‚Äôs theme - Noel Rosa, another composer of Vila Isabel, to celebrate his centenary.

The court held that charging Raymond John Carroll with perjuring himself in the earlier murder trial by swearing he did not kill the baby Deidre Kennedy was tantamount to claiming he had committed the murder and was thus a contravention of the principles of double jeopardy. The case caused widespread public outcry and prompted calls for double jeopardy law reform. Background In October 1983 Carroll was interviewed by the police in relation to the murder of Deidre, a baby whose body had been found on the roof of a toilet block in Ipswich, Queensland, in April 1973. A post-mortem at the time had determined Deidre died of strangulation. During the post-mortem bite marks and bruises were noted on the baby's legs and it was these marks which led police to charge Carroll over the murder, as odontological evidence matched the marks with Carroll's teeth. Carroll was charged with murder. The murder trial started on 18 February 1985. The prosecution's case was that the teeth marks on Deidre's body were made by Carroll, that he had a propensity for biting small children on the legs and that his alibi was false. Carroll claimed he was at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia at the time of Deidre's death. The jury found him guilty of murder, but the conviction was quashed on appeal. The court of appeal found that the prosecution had led no evidence to disprove Carroll's claim that he was not in Ipswich at the time of the death, that the evidence relating to Carroll's propensity to bite children's legs was prejudicial and inadmissible and that a jury must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the odontological evidence presented by the prosecution. Perjury trial By 1999 the police had received substantial new evidence in relation to the case. A witness had come forward who placed Carroll in Ipswich at the time of the killing, another witness claimed Carroll had admitted to him in jail that he had killed Deidre and further evidence relating to the teeth marks was obtained. Carroll was charged with perjury on 12 February 1999. The indictment presented against Carroll claimed he had perjured himself at the 1985 murder trial by swearing he did not kill Deidre Kennedy. In November 2000 a jury convicted him of perjury. Carroll appealed against this conviction. Supreme Court of Queensland - Court of Appeal The Queensland appeal court upheld Carroll's appeal. They found the perjury trial was in essence a re-trial of the original murder trial and that the prosecution case amounted to an abuse of process that contravened principles of double jeopardy. While the court applied an earlier decision by the Queensland Supreme Court, R v El-Zarw, which held that a prosecution such as this would not be an abuse of process if there was substantial new evidence, they found that the evidence presented by the prosecution in the perjury trial was not substantial. The prosecution appealed against this decision. High Court of Australia The High Court dismissed the appeal, finding that a conviction for perjury would inevitably controvert Carroll's previous acquittal for murder and was thus inconsistent with double jeopardy principles. The High Court also ruled that this principle applied whether or not substantial new evidence had come to light, overruling Queensland authority to that effect. The courts ruling in this case was due to technicality which was established to prevent double jeopardy Public response There was widespread public outcry following this decision. The general perception was that a person who had been found guilty by two juries of murdering a baby had 'got off' on a 'legal technicality.'www.theage.com.au. The Queensland premier Peter Beattie stated that 'there was an injustice done in this case',The Australian, 11 February 2003 the New South Wales premier Bob Carr began a law reform processwww.lawreform.ie and the Victorian attorney general, Rob Hulls canvassed the possibility of legislative change. The Kennedy family told their side of the story in a 2003 ABC Australian Story episode, Double Bind.www.abc.net.au The double jeopardy law has since been changed through the Criminal Code (Double Jeopardy) Amendment Act 2007 (Qld).

On May 16, 1992, after performing his last concert, he was murdered in Culiac√°n, the capital city of the Pacific coastal state of Sinaloa, Mexico. Since his death, his fame and recordings have grown in popularity. Chalino's son Ad√°n Chalino S√°nchez was born April 14, 1984, and was also a Regional Mexican singer in his own right. Chalino's son died in a suspicious automobile accident in Sinaloa. Life Chalino Sanchez was born in a small ranch known as \\"El Guayabo\\" located in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. He was the youngest of 7 children that Santos Sanchez and Senorina Felix shared. According to his sister Juana Sanchez, he was a curious and mischievous child who always dreamed of becoming a famous singer. He was born into a poor family and lived a difficult life. When he was 15, a tragedy occurred, his sister was raped by a rich man known for being powerful and dangerous. While at a party, Sanchez saw the man and took revenge into his own hands. Sanchez allegedly took the man's life by shooting him to death.http://archive.pov.org/alotrolado/el- valiente-chalino-sanchez/ After committing this act, Sanchez had to leave the small town located near Culiacan, Sinaloa. According to a family friend, Sanchez escaped to Tijuana, Mexico with nothing but his gun and Jesus Malverde chain. During his time in Tijuana, he worked as a \\"coyote\\", someone who smuggles people into the United States. In 1977, he moved to Los Angeles, California with an aunt. In 1984, he married Marisela Vallejos in a simple and intimate wedding. They first met because she was a friend of his cousin Rosalba. When they got married their first son, Adan Sanchez was already on the way. They shared two children, Adan Sanchez and Cynthia Sanchez. They were married until Chalino Sanchez's death in 1992. Music In 1984, Chalino's brother died in Tijuana, which inspired him to compose his first corrido.https://www.shazam.com/track/59656766/recordando-a-armando-sanchez Around this time, Chalino was put into jail and it is said that this is where his musical journey began.http://archive.pov.org/alotrolado/el-valiente- chalino-sanchez/ He began to compose songs for his fellow inmates and anyone that had a story worth telling. Chalino began to earn money through his compositions and would be gifted with guns and \\"presents\\" by his customers. Among his many compositions are Lucio Villareal, El Pelavacas,https://www.musica.com/letras.asp?letra=1383638 and Jorge \\"El Coquio\\" Castro. A small group known as \\"Los Cuatro de la Frontera\\" recommended Chalino to go to a recording studio in Olympic Blvd in Los Angeles. The studio was called San Angel Records and was owned by Angel Parra. Originally, another artist was meant to sing Chalino's compositions. However, when the man canceled, Chalino decided to sing his own songs. By 1989, Chalino dedicated his full time to writing, recording, and selling his corridos. He would sell cassettes on the streets as well as swap meets.

Things are deemed to have instrumental value if they help one achieve a particular end; intrinsic values, by contrast, are understood to be desirable in and of themselves. A tool or appliance, such as a hammer or washing machine, has instrumental value because it helps you pound in a nail or cleans your clothes. Happiness and pleasure are typically considered to have intrinsic value insofar as asking why someone would want them makes little sense: they are desirable for their own sake irrespective of their possible instrumental value. The classic names instrumental and intrinsic were coined by sociologist Max Weber, who spent years studying good meanings people assigned to their actions and beliefs. The Oxford Handbook of Value Theory provide three modern definitions of intrinsic and instrumental value: # They are \\"the distinction between what is good 'in itself' and what is good 'as a means'.\\" # \\"The concept of intrinsic value has been glossed variously as what is valuable for its own sake, in itself, on its own, in its own right, as an end, or as such. By contrast, extrinsic value has been characterized mainly as what is valuable as a means, or for something else's sake.\\" # \\"Among nonfinal values, instrumental value‚Äîintuitively, the value attaching a means to what is finally valuable‚Äîstands out as a bona fide example of what is not valuable for its own sake.\\" When people judge efficient means and legitimate ends at the same time, both can be considered as good. However, when ends are judged separately from means, it may result in a conflict: what works may not be right; what is right may not work. Separating the criteria contaminates reasoning about the good. Philosopher John Dewey argued that separating criteria for good ends from those for good means necessarily contaminates recognition of efficient and legitimate patterns of behavior. Economist J. Fagg Foster explained why only instrumental value is capable of correlating good ends with good means. Philosopher Jacques Ellul argued that instrumental value has become completely contaminated by inhuman technological consequences, and must be subordinated to intrinsic supernatural value. Philosopher Anjan Chakravartty argued that instrumental value is only legitimate when it produces good scientific theories compatible with the intrinsic truth of mind-independent reality. The word value is ambiguous in that it is both a verb and a noun, as well as denoting both a criterion of judgment itself and the result of applying a criterion. To reduce ambiguity, throughout this article the noun value names a criterion of judgment, as opposed to valuation which is an object that is judged valuable. The plural values identifies collections of valuations, without identifying the criterion applied. Max Weber The classic names instrumental and intrinsic were coined by sociologist Max Weber, who spent years studying good meanings people assigned to their actions and beliefs. According to Weber, \\"[s]ocial action, like all action, may be\\" judged as: # Instrumental rational (zweckrational): action \\"determined by expectations as to the behavior of objects in the environment of other human beings; these expectations are used as 'conditions' or \\"means' for the attainment of the actor's own rationally pursued and calculated ends.\\" # Value-rational (wertrational): action \\"determined by a conscious belief in the value for its own sake of some ethical, aesthetic, religious, or other form of behavior, independently of its prospects of success.\\" Weber's original definitions also include a comment showing his doubt that conditionally efficient means can achieve unconditionally legitimate ends: > [T]he more the value to which action is oriented is elevated to the status > of an absolute [intrinsic] value, the more \\"irrational\\" in this > [instrumental] sense the corresponding action is. For the more > unconditionally the actor devotes himself to this value for its own sake‚Ä¶the > less he is influenced by considerations of the [conditional] consequences of > his action. John Dewey John Dewey thought that belief in intrinsic value was a mistake. Although the application of instrumental value is easily contaminated, it is the only means humans have to coordinate group behaviour efficiently and legitimately. Every social transaction has good or bad consequences depending on prevailing conditions, which may or may not be satisfied. Continuous reasoning adjusts institutions to keep them working on the right track as conditions change. Changing conditions demand changing judgments to maintain efficient and legitimate correlation of behavior.Tool, Marc. 1994. \\"John Dewey.\\" Pp. 152‚Äì7 in Elgar Companion to Institutional and Evolutionary Economics 1, edited by G. M. Hodgson. Edward Elgar Publishing. For Dewey, \\"restoring integration and cooperation between man's beliefs about the world in which he lives and his beliefs about the values [valuations] and purposes that should direct his conduct is the deepest problem of modern life.\\" Moreover, a \\"culture which permits science to destroy traditional values [valuations] but which distrusts its power to create new ones is a culture which is destroying itself.\\" Dewey agreed with Max Weber that people talk as if they apply instrumental and intrinsic criteria. He also agreed with Weber's observation that intrinsic value is problematic in that it ignores the relationship between context and consequences of beliefs and behaviors. Both men questioned how anything valued intrinsically \\"for its own sake\\" can have operationally efficient consequences. However, Dewey rejects the common belief‚Äîshared by Weber‚Äîthat supernatural intrinsic value is necessary to show humans what is permanently \\"right.\\" He argues that both efficient and legitimate qualities must be discovered in daily life: > Man who lives in a world of hazards‚Ä¶has sought to attain [security] in two > ways. One of them began with an attempt to propitiate the [intrinsic] powers > which environ him and determine his destiny. It expressed itself in > supplication, sacrifice, ceremonial rite and magical cult.‚Ä¶ The other course > is to invent [instrumental] arts and by their means turn the powers of > nature to account.‚Ä¶ [F]or over two thousand years, the‚Ä¶most influential and > authoritatively orthodox tradition‚Ä¶has been devoted to the problem of a > purely cognitive certification (perhaps by revelation, perhaps by intuition, > perhaps by reason) of the antecedent immutable reality of truth, beauty, and > goodness.‚Ä¶ The crisis in contemporary culture, the confusions and conflicts > in it, arise from a division of authority. Scientific [instrumental] inquiry > seems to tell one thing, and traditional beliefs [intrinsic valuations] > about ends and ideals that have authority over conduct tell us something > quite different.‚Ä¶ As long as the notion persists that knowledge is a > disclosure of [intrinsic] reality‚Ä¶prior to and independent of knowing, and > that knowing is independent of a purpose to control the quality of > experienced objects, the failure of natural science to disclose significant > values [valuations] in its objects will come as a shock. Finding no evidence of \\"antecedent immutable reality of truth, beauty, and goodness,\\" Dewey argues that both efficient and legitimate goods are discovered in the continuity of human experience: > Dewey's ethics replaces the goal of identifying an ultimate end or supreme > principle that can serve as a criterion of ethical evaluation with the goal > of identifying a method for improving our value judgments. Dewey argued that > ethical inquiry is of a piece with empirical inquiry more generally.‚Ä¶ This > pragmatic approach requires that we locate the conditions of warrant for our > value judgments in human conduct itself, not in any a priori fixed reference > point outside of conduct, such as in God's commands, Platonic Forms, pure > reason, or \\"nature,\\" considered as giving humans a fixed telos [intrinsic > end]. Philosophers label a \\"fixed reference point outside of conduct' a \\"natural kind,\\" and presume it to have eternal existence knowable in itself without being experienced. Natural kinds are intrinsic valuations presumed to be \\"mind-independent\\" and \\"theory-independent.\\" Dewey grants the existence of \\"reality\\" apart from human experience, but denied that it is structured as intrinsically real natural kinds. Instead, he sees reality as functional continuity of ways-of-acting, rather than as interaction among pre-structured intrinsic kinds. Humans may intuit static kinds and qualities, but such private experience cannot warrant inferences or valuations about mind- independent reality. Reports or maps of perceptions or intuitions are never equivalent to territories mapped. People reason daily about what they ought to do and how they ought to do it. Inductively, they discover sequences of efficient means that achieve consequences. Once an end is reached‚Äîa problem solved‚Äîreasoning turns to new conditions of means-end relations. Valuations that ignore consequence-determining conditions cannot coordinate behavior to solve real problems; they contaminate rationality. > Value judgments have the form: if one acted in a particular way (or valued > this object), then certain consequences would ensue, which would be valued. > The difference between an apparent and a real good [means or end], between > an unreflectively and a reflectively valued good, is captured by its value > [valuation of goodness] not just as immediately experienced in isolation, > but in view of its wider consequences and how they are valued.‚Ä¶ So viewed, > value judgments are tools for discovering how to live a better life, just as > scientific hypotheses are tools for uncovering new information about the > world. In brief, Dewey rejects the traditional belief that judging things as good in themselves, apart from existing means-end relations, can be rational. The sole rational criterion is instrumental value. Each valuation is conditional but, cumulatively, all are developmental‚Äîand therefore socially-legitimate solutions of problems. Competent instrumental valuations treat the \\"function of consequences as necessary tests of the validity of propositions, provided these consequences are operationally instituted and are such as to resolve the specific problems evoking the operations.\\" J. Fagg Foster John Fagg Foster made John Dewey's rejection of intrinsic value more operational by showing that its competent use rejects the legitimacy of utilitarian ends‚Äîsatisfaction of whatever ends individuals adopt. It requires recognizing developmental sequences of means and ends.Miller, Edythe. 1994. \\"John Fagg Foster.\\" Pp. 256‚Äì62 in Elgar Companion to Institutional and Evolutionary Economics 1, edited by G. M. Hodgson. Edward Elgar Publishing. Utilitarians hold that individual wants cannot be rationally justified; they are intrinsically worthy subjective valuations and cannot be judged instrumentally. This belief supports philosophers who hold that facts (\\"what is\\") can serve as instrumental means for achieving ends, but cannot authorize ends (\\"what ought to be\\"). This fact-value distinction creates what philosophers label the is- ought problem: wants are intrinsically fact-free, good in themselves; whereas efficient tools are valuation-free, usable for good or bad ends. In modern North-American culture, this utilitarian belief supports the libertarian assertion that every individual's intrinsic right to satisfy wants makes it illegitimate for anyone‚Äîbut especially governments‚Äîto tell people what they ought to do. Foster finds that the is-ought problem is a useful place to attack the irrational separation of good means from good ends. He argues that want-satisfaction (\\"what ought to be\\") cannot serve as an intrinsic moral compass because 'wants' are themselves consequences of transient conditions. Since 'wants' are shaped by social conditions, they must be judged instrumentally; they arise in problematic situations when habitual patterns of behavior fail to maintain instrumental correlations.  Examples  Foster uses with homely examples to support his thesis that problematic situations (\\"what is\\") contain the means for judging legitimate ends (\\"what ought to be\\"). Rational efficient means achieve rational developmental ends. Consider the problem all infants face learning to walk. They spontaneously recognize that walking is more efficient than crawling‚Äîan instrumental valuation of a desirable end. They learn to walk by repeatedly moving and balancing, judging the efficiency with which these means achieve their instrumental goal. When they master this new way-of-acting, they experience great satisfaction, but satisfaction is never their end-in-view.  Revised definition of 'instrumental value'  To guard against contamination of instrumental value by judging means and ends independently, Foster revised his definition to embrace both. Instrumental value is the criterion of judgment which seeks instrumentally-efficient means that \\"work\\" to achieve developmentally- continuous ends. This definition stresses the condition that instrumental success is never short term; it must not lead down a dead-end street. The same point is made by the currently popular concern for sustainability‚Äîa synonym for instrumental value. Dewey's and Foster's argument that there is no intrinsic alternative to instrumental value continues to be ignored rather than refuted. Scholars continue to accept the possibility and necessity of knowing \\"what ought to be\\" independently of transient conditions that determine actual consequences of every action. Jacques Ellul and Anjan Chakravartty were prominent exponents of the truth and reality of intrinsic value as constraint on relativistic instrumental value. Jacques Ellul Jacques Ellul made scholarly contributions to many fields, but his American reputation grew out of his criticism of the autonomous authority of instrumental value, the criterion that John Dewey and J. Fagg Foster found to be the core of human rationality. He specifically criticized the valuations central to Dewey's and Foster's thesis: evolving instrumental technology. His principal work, published in 1954, bore the French title La technique and tackles the problem that Dewey addressed in 1929: a culture in which the authority of evolving technology destroys traditional valuations without creating legitimate new ones. Both men agree that conditionally-efficient valuations (\\"what is\\") become irrational when viewed as unconditionally efficient in themselves (\\"what ought to be\\"). However, while Dewey argues that contaminated instrumental valuations can be self-correcting, Ellul concludes that technology has become intrinsically destructive. The only escape from this evil is to restore authority to unconditional sacred valuations: The English edition of La technique was published in 1964, titled The Technological Society, and quickly entered ongoing disputes in the United States over the responsibility of instrumental value for destructive social consequences. The translator of Technological Society summarizes Ellul's thesis:Translator. 1964. \\"Introduction.\\" In The Technological Society. Knopf. pp. v‚Äìvi, x. Ellul opens The Technological Society by asserting that instrumental efficiency is no longer a conditional criterion. It has become autonomous and absolute: He blames instrumental valuations for destroying intrinsic meanings of human life: \\"Think of our dehumanized factories, our unsatisfied senses, our working women, our estrangement from nature. Life in such an environment has no meaning.\\" While Weber had labeled the discrediting of intrinsic valuations as disenchantment, Ellul came to label it as \\"terrorism.\\" He dates its domination to the 1800s, when centuries-old handicraft techniques were massively eliminated by inhuman industry. > When, in the 19th century, society began to elaborate an exclusively > rational technique which acknowledged only considerations of efficiency, it > was felt that not only the traditions but the deepest instincts of humankind > had been violated. Culture is necessarily humanistic or it does not exist at > all.‚Ä¶ [I]t answers questions about the meaning of life, the possibility of > reunion with ultimate being, the attempt to overcome human finitude, and all > other questions that they have to ask and handle. But technique cannot deal > with such things.‚Ä¶ Culture exists only if it raises the question of meaning > and values [valuations].‚Ä¶ Technique is not at all concerned about the > meaning of life, and it rejects any relation to values [intrinsic > valuations]. Ellul's core accusation is that instrumental efficiency has become absolute, i.e., a good-in-itself; it wraps societies in a new technological milieu with six intrinsically inhuman characteristics: # artificiality; # autonomy, \\"with respect to values [valuations], ideas, and the state;\\" # self-determinative, independent \\"of all human intervention;\\" # \\"It grows according to a process which is causal but not directed to [good] ends;\\" # \\"It is formed by an accumulation of means which have established primacy over ends;\\" # \\"All its parts are mutually implicated to such a degree that it is impossible to separate them or to settle any technical problems in isolation.\\"  Criticism  Philosophers Tiles and Oberdiek (1995) find Ellul's characterization of instrumental value inaccurate. They criticize him for anthropomorphizing and demonizing instrumental value. They counter this by examining the moral reasoning of scientists whose work led to nuclear weapons: those scientists demonstrated the capacity of instrumental judgments to provide them with a moral compass to judge nuclear technology; they were morally responsible without intrinsic rules. Tiles and Oberdiek's conclusion coincides with that of Dewey and Foster: instrumental value, when competently applied, is self- correcting and provides humans with a developmental moral compass. > For although we have defended general principles of the moral > responsibilities of professional people, it would be foolish and wrongheaded > to suggest codified [intrinsic] rules. It would be foolish because concrete > cases are more complex and nuanced than any code could capture; it would be > wrongheaded because it would suggest that our sense of moral responsibility > can be fully captured by a code.

Semi realism (Anjan Chakravartty)  Anjan Chakravartty came indirectly to question the autonomous authority of instrumental value. He viewed it as a foil for the currently dominant philosophical school labeled \\"scientific realism,\\" with which he identifies. In 2007, he published a work defending the ultimate authority of intrinsic valuations to which realists are committed. He links the pragmatic instrumental criterion to discredited anti-realist empiricist schools including logical positivism and instrumentalism. Chakravartty began his study with rough characterizations of realist and anti- realist valuations of theories. Anti-realists believe \\"that theories are merely instruments for predicting observable phenomena or systematizing observation reports;\\" they assert that theories can never report or prescribe truth or reality \\"in itself.\\" By contrast, scientific realists believe that theories can \\"correctly describe both observable and unobservable parts of the world.\\" Well-confirmed theories‚Äî\\"what ought to be\\" as the end of reasoning‚Äîare more than tools; they are maps of intrinsic properties of an unobservable and unconditional territory‚Äî\\"what is\\" as natural-but-metaphysical real kinds. Chakravartty treats criteria of judgment as ungrounded opinion, but admits that realists apply the instrumental criterion to judge theories that \\"work.\\" He restricts such criterion's scope, claiming that every instrumental judgment is inductive, heuristic, accidental. Later experience might confirm a singular judgment only if it proves to have universal validity, meaning it possesses \\"detection properties\\" of natural kinds. This inference is his fundamental ground for believing in intrinsic value. He commits modern realists to three metaphysical valuations or intrinsic kinds of knowledge of truth. Competent realists affirm that natural kinds exist in a mind-independent territory possessing 1) meaningful and 2) mappable intrinsic properties. > Ontologically, scientific realism is committed to the existence of a mind- > independent world or reality. A realist semantics implies that the > theoretical claims [valuations] about this reality have truth values, and > should be construed literally.‚Ä¶ Finally, the epistemological commitment is > to the idea that these theoretical claims give us knowledge of the world. > That is, predictively successful (mature, non-ad hoc) theories, taken > literally as describing the nature of a mind-independent reality are > (approximately) true. He labels these intrinsic valuations as semi-realist, meaning they are currently the most accurate theoretical descriptions of mind-independent natural kinds. He finds these carefully qualified statements necessary to replace earlier realist claims of intrinsic reality discredited by advancing instrumental valuations. Science has destroyed for many people the supernatural intrinsic value embraced by Weber and Ellul. But Chakravartty defended intrinsic valuations as necessary elements of all science‚Äîbelief in unobservable continuities. He advances the thesis of semi-realism, according to which well-tested theories are good maps of natural kinds, as confirmed by their instrumental success; their predictive success means they conform to mind-independent, unconditional reality. > Causal properties are the fulcrum of semirealism. Their [intrinsic] > relations compose the concrete structures that are the primary subject > matters of a tenable scientific realism. They regularly cohere to form > interesting units, and these groupings make up the particulars investigated > by the sciences and described by scientific theories. Scientific theories > describe [intrinsic] causal properties, concrete structures, and particulars > such as objects, events, and processes. Semirealism maintains that under > certain conditions it is reasonable for realists to believe that the best of > these descriptions tell us not merely about things that can be experienced > with the unaided senses, but also about some of the unobservable things > underlying them. Chakravartty argues that these semirealist valuations legitimize scientific theorizing about pragmatic kinds. The fact that theoretical kinds are frequently replaced does not mean that mind-independent reality is changing, but simply that theoretical maps are approximating intrinsic reality. > The primary motivation for thinking that there are such things as natural > kinds is the idea that carving nature according to its own divisions yields > groups of objects that are capable of supporting successful inductive > generalizations and prediction. So the story goes, one's recognition of > natural categories facilitates these practices, and thus furnishes an > excellent explanation for their success. The moral here is that however > realists choose to construct particulars out of instances of properties, > they do so on the basis of a belief in the [mind-independent] existence of > those properties. That is the bedrock of realism. Property instances lend > themselves to different forms of packaging [instrumental valuations], but as > a feature of scientific description, this does not compromise realism with > respect to the relevant [intrinsic] packages. In sum, Chakravartty argues that contingent instrumental valuations are warranted only as they approximate unchanging intrinsic valuations. Scholars continue to perfect their explanations of intrinsic value, as they deny the developmental continuity of applications of instrumental value. > Abstraction is a process in which only some of the potentially many relevant > factors present in [unobservable] reality are represented in a model or > description with some aspect of the world, such as the nature or behavior of > a specific object or process. ... Pragmatic constraints such as these play a > role in shaping how scientific investigations are conducted, and together > which and how many potentially relevant factors [intrinsic kinds] are > incorporated into models and descriptions during the process of abstraction. > The role of pragmatic constraints, however, does not undermine the idea that > putative representations of factors composing abstract models can be thought > to have counterparts in the [mind-independent] world. Realist intrinsic value as proposed by Chakravartty, is widely endorsed in modern scientific circles, while the supernatural intrinsic value endorsed by Max Weber and Jacques Ellul maintains its popularity throughout the world. Doubters about the reality of instrumental and intrinsic value are few.

Unlike the majority of Geisel's books, it is written in prose rather than rhyming and metered verse. Geisel, who collected hats, got the idea for the story on a commuter train from New York to New England, while he was sitting behind a businessman wearing a hat; the passenger was so stiff and formal that Geisel idly wondered what would happen if he took the man's hat and threw it out the window. Geisel concluded that the man was so \\"stuffy\\" that he would just grow a new one.Washington Post: \\"Dr. Seuss\\" 1979 The characters of Bartholomew and King Derwin returned a decade later in Bartholomew and the Oobleck. Plot summary Set in feudal times, the story begins in the Kingdom of Didd. Young peasant, Bartholomew Cubbins lives on the outskirts of the kingdom with his family; He wears a simple red hat with a single white feather that has remained within the family for generations. One day, Bartholomew is sent into the town to sell some berries, when he comes across King Derwin riding through a street; As per law, one is supposed to remove his or her hat when the king passes by, but Bartholomew apparently does not follow the rule, despite having a hat in his hand and is ordered to remove the hat on his head. Bartholomew does so, but another hat mysteriously appears; when he attempts to remove this one, yet another one appears. For unknown reasons, whenever Bartholomew removes one hat, another one appears on his head. The young boy is taken to the castle where numerous people attempt to remove the hat from Bartholomew's head, but all attempts end in failure; The royal hatter runs away in terror, the King's young nephew fails to shoot the hats off with arrows, A great bowman similarly fails with a long bow, Wizards attempt to curse the hat away, but claim that their spell would only work in \\"Ten Short Years\\". The King, exasperated by all the attempts, sends Bartholomew to be executed, but once again the laws get in the way; A person cannot be executed by the Executioner with his or her hat on. The King's Nephew suggests throwing Bartholomew from the highest tower as a punishment. The King, while mildly upset by the idea, agrees. Bartholomew begins to push his hats off rapidly as they climb the tower. As this continues, the hats begin to grow in extravagance and beauty from the 451st hat onwards; The 451st Hat has two feathers, while the 452nd Hat has three and the 453rd hat has three feathers and a small gem and so on. Ultimately the 500th hat, is revealed as the greatest, studded with massive gems, plumes of feathers from rare birds and gilding, although Bartholomew seems unaware of the fact. The king is stunned by the beauty of the hat, but the Nephew is more incensed than before at the sight of it. He tries to push Bartholomew off the tower, against the King's wishes which results in him being spanked as a punishment. King Derwin grants Bartholomew a reprieve, requesting for all 500 hats in exchange for 500 gold coins. Bartholomew agrees and is sent home with his massive reward, while the King keeps all of the hats in a massive chest to admire for years to come. The story ends with the narrator admitting that no one knows or ever knew what caused this strange event, but it is more than likely that it will never happen again. Reception The book received positive reviews from critics. The New York Times reviewer called the book \\"a lovely bit of tomfoolery which keeps up the suspense and surprise until the end.\\"Morgan & Morgan, p. 89 Booklist, which had criticized Geisel's previous book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, for containing only enough material for one comic strip, praised The 500 Hats as \\"a brand-new idea, developed into a complete tale, not too long, not too short, just right. Somewhere between the Sunday supplements and the Brothers Grimm, Dr. Seuss has produced a picture book combining features of both.\\" Alexander Laing, who had worked with Geisel on the Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern humor magazine, wrote in his review of the book in the Dartmouth Alumni Magazine, \\"His several other occupations, madly fascinating as they are, may have been only preludes to a discovery of his proper vocation. That he is a rare and loopy genius has been common knowledge from an early epoch of his undergrad troubles. It now becomes plain that his is the self-consistent, happy madness beloved by children. I do not see what is to prevent him from becoming the Grimm of our times.\\" Adaptations * Not long after publication, the story was adapted for an album issued by RCA Victor (Y-339). Narrated by Paul Wing, the audio adaptation had a running time of 13 minutes and 37 seconds.

The Rungrado 1st of May Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium on Rungra Island, Pyongyang, North Korea. It opened on 1 May 1989, with its first major event being the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students. It is the largest stadium in the world by seating capacity. The site occupies an area of . Uses The stadium is currently used for football matches, a few athletics events, and most often for the mass games of the Arirang Festival. Design The stadium's scalloped roof features 16 arches arranged in a ring, and resembles a magnolia blossom. It hosts events on a main pitch covering . Its total floor space is over across eight stories, and the lobes of its roof peak at more than above the ground. History After the 1988 Summer Olympics had been awarded to Seoul, North Korea doubled down its efforts to present itself as the legitimate Korean state. As part of these efforts, it successfully bid to organize the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students in Pyongyang in 1989. Massive construction projects were initiated in preparation for the festival, one of which was the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium. At the time of completion, it was the largest stadium ever built in Asia. While the stadium is used for sporting events, it is more frequently the site of massive performances and shows celebrating President Kim Il-sung and the North Korean nation. In June‚ÄìJuly 2002, it was the site of the giant Arirang Festival gymnastic and artistic performance. The extravaganza involved over 100,000 participants‚Äî double the number of spectators, and was open to foreigners. These performances are now an annual feature in Pyongyang, usually in August and September. The event was recognized by the Guinness Book of Records in 2007 as the largest gymnastics display ever, with 100,090 participants.http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest- gymnastic-display Collision in Korea, the largest professional wrestling pay- per-view event ever, was held at Rungrado Stadium on April 28-29, 1995.

Its initial list price of $795 made it the first fully programmable synthesizer that sold for less than $1000. It featured a 49 key non-velocity sensitive keyboard, two buttons for data entry, and a joystick controller, which could modulate the DCO pitch or the VCF. Though the Poly-800 had MIDI, it did not feature MIDI SysEx functionality (except EX800 - the expander-version; or by modding the Poly800 with additionally selectable EX-firmware-ROM), and patches had to be backed up to cassette tape. It had 8-voice polyphony (paraphony) with one DCO per voice. It could be switched into double mode which stacks two DCOs for a fuller sound, but reduces the polyphony to 4 voices. It featured one analog resonant low-pass VCF with 24 dB/oct which was shared for all voices. Like a monophonic synthesizer, the filter was switchable between single or multiple modes. In single mode, the first key pressed triggers the filter envelope, and unless all keys are released, the filter does not re-trigger. In multi mode, each key pressed in turn triggers the filter envelope, even if other keys are still pressed down. Further it had three digital envelope generators, a noise generator, an LFO, and a chorus effect. The Poly-800 could be run off batteries and had guitar strap pegs, allowing a performer to wear it like a guitar. It was also available with reversed-colored keys, which gave an appearance similar to a Vox Continental organ. Sequencer It also sported a simple built in 256 step sequencer. EX-800 About a year after the Poly-800 was introduced, a keyboardless, rackmount/tabletop version, called the EX-800, was released, adding limited MIDI SysEx capability. After production of the original keyboard ended in 1985, the enhanced Poly-800 MkII was released. It featured a digital delay instead of a chorus effect, and included limited MIDI SysEx functionality. It was produced until 1987. Siel produced an almost identical synthesizer, the DK-70 around the same time period.  Modifications  The low price for a used unit (in the 1990s it fell to under $200) and partial analog design of the Poly-800 made it appealing for modification by hobbyists. There is a modification that adds two knobs to the VCF, increasing the filter's range and expressiveness, known as the Moog-Slayer filter modification; the FM-800 filter modification which adds a pseudo Frequency modulation synthesis (FM) control to the filter; a modification for external audio input; and some users have added a switch to control the filter slope, adjusting it from a 4 pole (24db/oct) to a 2 pole (12db/oct). It is also possible to install an additional EPROM containing the firmware of the EX800. That way it is possible to receive MIDI-sysex data, but keyboard-functionality will then be disabled. Before powering up the synthesizer users can select the firmware of choice by using a selective switch. The most recent modification to the Poly-800 family is the Hawk-800 Firmware upgrade which is both a hardware and firmware modification, radically updating the features and capabilities of the synthesizer. There is also the AtomaHawk-800 which adds software and MIDI control to the more popular hardware modifications.

It reduces the pain associated with wearing high-heeled shoes by adjusting weight distribution back toward the heel through altering the geometry of the insole, rather than with padding. Concept Visual of weight concentration shift With ordinary high-heeled shoes, the body weight is concentrated to the toes; this can make the wearer uncomfortable. The Insolia design shifts some of this weight back to the heel in an attempt to reduce high heel foot pain. The weight shift is accomplished by altering the geometry of the insole. Technology A shoe with the Insolia insert The original commercial implementation was an insole board that combined the structural elements of a high heel insole board with the patented Insolia contours. In early 2005, HBN Shoe developed the current implementation: an insole supplement that modifies a traditional high heel to give it the Insolia weight shifting geometry. This implementation is protected in the EU by one issued patent and other patents are pending in the US, the EU, and elsewhere. Insolia now also markets an after-market version that can be easily installed in shoes by consumers via its website. Marketing The consumer version of the Insolia Insert is being carried by a variety of retailers. The technology is also marketed in Australia, Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Early in 2005, Insolia reported that Qantas, a major Australian airline, had chosen shoes containing the Insolia component as necessary footwear for its 7,000 flight attendants.

If the changes are applied then the atomic commit is said to have succeeded. If there is a failure before the atomic commit can be completed then all of the changes completed in the atomic commit are reversed. This ensures that the system is always left in a consistent state. The other key property of isolation comes from their nature as atomic operations. Isolation ensures that only one atomic commit is processed at a time. The most common uses of atomic commits are in database systems and version control systems. The problem with atomic commits is that they require coordination between multiple systems. As computer networks are unreliable services this means no algorithm can coordinate with all systems as proven in the Two Generals Problem. As databases become more and more distributed this coordination will increase the difficulty of making truly atomic commits. Usage Atomic commits are essential for multi-step updates to data. This can be clearly shown in a simple example of a money transfer between two checking accounts. This example is complicated by a transaction to check the balance of account Y during a transaction for transferring 100 dollars from account X to Y. To start, first 100 dollars is removed from account X. Second, 100 dollars is added to account Y. If the entire operation is not completed as one atomic commit, then several problems could occur. If the system fails in the middle of the operation, after removing the money from X and before adding into Y, then 100 dollars has just disappeared. Another issue is if the balance of Y is checked before the 100 dollars is added, the wrong balance for Y will be reported. With atomic commits neither of these cases can happen, in the first case of the system failure, the atomic commit would be rolled back and the money returned to X. In the second case, the request of the balance of Y cannot occur until the atomic commit is fully completed. Database systems Atomic commits in database systems fulfil two of the key properties of ACID, atomicity and consistency. Consistency is only achieved if each change in the atomic commit is consistent. As shown in the example atomic commits are critical to multistep operations in databases. Due to modern hardware design of the physical disk on which the database resides true atomic commits cannot exist. The smallest area that can be written to on disk is known as a sector. A single database entry may span several different sectors. Only one sector can be written at a time. This writing limit is why true atomic commits are not possible. After the database entries in memory have been modified they are queued up to be written to disk. This means the same problems identified in the example have reoccurred. Any algorithmic solution to this problem will still encounter the Two Generals‚Äô Problem. The two-phase commit protocol and three-phase commit protocol attempt to solve this and some of the other problems associated with atomic commits. The two-phase commit protocol requires a coordinator to maintain all the information needed to recover the original state of the database if something goes wrong. As the name indicates there are two phases, _voting_ and _commit_. During the _voting_ phase each node writes the changes in the atomic commit to its own disk. The nodes then report their status to the coordinator. If any node does not report to the coordinator or their status message is lost the coordinator assumes the node's write failed. Once all of the nodes have reported to the coordinator the second phase begins. During the _commit_ phase the coordinator sends a commit message to each of the nodes to record in their individual logs. Until this message is added to a node's log, any changes made will be recorded as incomplete. If any of the nodes reported a failure the coordinator will instead send a rollback message. This will remove any changes the nodes have written to disk. The three-phase commit protocol seeks to remove the main problem with the two phase commit protocol, which occurs if a coordinator and another node fail at the same time during the commit phase neither can tell what action should occur. To solve this problem a third phase is added to the protocol. The _prepare to commit_ phase occurs after the _voting_ phase and before the _commit_ phase. In the _voting_ phase, similar to the two-phase commit, the coordinator requests that each node is ready to commit. If any node fails the coordinator will timeout while waiting for the failed node. If this happens the coordinator sends an abort message to every node. The same action will be undertaken if any of the nodes return a failure message. Upon receiving success messages from each node in the voting phase the _prepare to commit_ phase begins. During this phase the coordinator sends a prepare message to each node. Each node must acknowledge the prepare message and reply. If any reply is missed or any node return that they are not prepared then the coordinator sends an abort message. Any node that does not receive a prepare message before the timeout expires aborts the commit. After all nodes have replied to the prepare message then the _commit_ phase begins. In this phase the coordinator sends a commit message to each node. When each node receives this message it performs the actual commit. If the commit message does not reach a node due to the message being lost or the coordinator fails they will perform the commit if the timeout expires. If the coordinator fails upon recovery it will send a commit message to each node. Revision control Atomic commits are a common feature of version control software, and crucial for maintaining a consistent state in the repository. Most version control software will not apply any part of a commit that fails. Notable exceptions are CVS, VSS and IBM Rational ClearCase (when in UCM mode). For instance, if version control software encounters a merge conflict that can not be automatically resolved, then no part of the changeset is merged. Instead, the developer is given an opportunity to either revert their changes or manually resolve the conflict. This prevents the entire project from entering a broken state due to a partially applied change set, where one file from a commit is successfully committed, but another file with dependent changes fails. Atomic commits may also refer to the ability to simultaneously make changes across multiple projects using version control software in a single operation, using a version control software development strategy known as a monorepo. Atomic commit convention When using a revision control systems a common convention is to use small commits. These are sometimes referred to as atomic commits as they (ideally) only affect a single aspect of the system. These atomic commits allow for greater understandability, less effort to roll back changes, easier bug identification. The greater understandability comes from the small size and focused nature of the commit. It is much easier to understand what is changed and reasoning behind the changes if one is only looking for one kind of change. This becomes especially important when making format changes to the source code. If format and functional changes are combined it becomes very difficult to identify useful changes. Imagine if the spacing in a file is changed from using tabs to three spaces every tab in the file will show as having been changed. This becomes critical if some functional changes are also made as a reviewer may simply not see the functional changes. If only atomic commits are made then commits that introduce errors become much simpler to identify. One need not look through every commit to see if it was the cause of the error, only the commits dealing with that functionality need to be examined. If the error is to be rolled back, atomic commits again make the job much simpler. Instead of having to revert to the offending revision and remove the changes manually before integrating any later changes; the developer can simply revert any changes in the identified commit. This also reduces the risk of a developer accidentally removing unrelated changes that happened to be in the same commit. Atomic commits also allow bug fixes to be easily reviewed if only a single bug fix is committed at a time. Instead of having to check multiple potentially unrelated files the reviewer must only check files and changes that directly impact the bug being fixed. This also means that bug fixes can be easily packaged for testing as only the changes that fix the bug are in the commit.

It was designed and built by the New South Wales Government Railways and opened on 26 September 1855. In addition to being located on the Main Suburban line, the station is also located on the Main South and Main Western railway lines. The station is also known as the Homebush Railway Station group. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station is served by Sydney Trains T2 Inner West & Leppington line services. History The Main Western line to Parramatta, via Granville station was originally completed in 1855. The line opened on 26 September 1855 and was double track from Sydney Central to Newtown station and then single track to Parramatta (but duplicated in 1856). The line was built as a direct connection to Parramatta and, subsequently, for the purpose of connecting Sydney with the major rural railways that were constructed across the Blue Mountains to Bathurst and across the Southern Highlands to Goulburn via Liverpool. There were few stops along the line between Sydney and Parramatta and it was not the original intention of the line to serve suburban development. Changes to the line were more often related to the line's long distance purpose than to the communities along it. Traffic to the west and south (and later north) of the state brought the need to amplify the line, first in 1891 when it was quadrupled and later in 1927 when it was sextupled (to Homebush) and electrified. With both of these major changes the earlier stations were usually entirely demolished and replaced with a new station. The 1927 work completed this process with the complete replacement of Strathfield and much of Newtown Stations. During this time suburban development also extended west along the line and these new stations were thus specifically designed as full-scale suburban passenger stations rather than rural \\"halts\\". The Engineer for Existing Lines, George Cowdery (appointed 1863), was a particularly strong influence on the architecture of this line, building particularly elegant stations in the late 1880s ahead of the 1891 quadruplication, in addition to replacing the original stone arch viaduct at Lewisham with iron truss bridges. Sextuplication in 1927 brought less change to most local stations (which were on the southern side), the new tracks being express ones on the northern side. Homebush station opened on 26 September 1855 when the Main Suburban line opened. In 1862 a new station building was erected on the southern side and in the 1870s stockyards were erected adjacent to the station (the station servicing the nearby NSW Government abattoirs at Homebush). The stockyards were closed and replaced by Flemington stockyards in 1883. In 1891, with quadruplication, Homebush station was completely rebuilt resulting in the present station layout being established with a centre island platform opening in late 1891. The station comprised large platform buildings, an overhead pedestrian footbridge with a booking office and an existing 1880s Station Master's Residence on the north side of the station. The station was expanded to six platforms when the line between Redfern and Homebush was sextupled in the 1920s. The existing three- storey brick signal box was built in 1892 and remained in use until 1928 when its function was replaced by a new \\"power\\" box. The 1928 signal box remained in use until 1982 when it was replaced by a simple brick and concrete building. The 1892 signal box is now the only remaining box at the station of the five built since the station opened. For many years Homebush was the terminating point for local suburban services on the Western line. A carriage shed was built at Homebush in 1890 located to the east of Homebush Road which connected to one of a number of sidings built at the station during this period. The carriage shed was later used as a store then training and education facilities until it was demolished in 2001. In 1891 a locomotive depot and locomotive watering facilities were also constructed near the carriage shed. By the late 1920s the Depot was largely redundant and was ultimately demolished . Numerous smaller buildings were also constructed at Homebush such as a telephone exchange, storage sheds, amenities buildings and a track ganger's shed. All have been demolished. The station also featured a Garden Nursery, a single storey building built in 1923 along the eastern frontage of The Crescent which was established so that other stations could be provided with a range of shrubs and flower plants to improve their landscaped appearance. Railway station gardens were created statewide from c.1890 onwards. Competitions and prizes sprang up and two nurseries (Homebush and Hamilton, near Newcastle) were opened to provide plants, in addition to those sourced from staff home gardens. Changing practices both in nursery supplies and the station gardens promotions saw the nursery close in 1974 and its staff of gardeners disbanded. Due to increased goods train traffic, two lines were built on the north side of the station in 1924 converting the side platform into an island. The footbridge was also extended over the new tracks and a two-storey office built abutting the footbridge on its western side. These changes resulted in the demolition of the 1880 station master's Residence. 1990s to date In 1992 the steel footbridge was replaced by the present pre-cast concrete bridge having part replica steel lattice balustrades imitating the original wrought iron lattice girder design. On 9 October 1994, a large fire destroyed the original heritage-listed buildings on platforms 3 and 4, they were later rebuilt as s a similar awning structure. During the Sydney 2000 Olympics, the station was closed to avoid confusion with the nearby Olympic Park station. Under the Rail Clearways Program, an additional platform (Platform 7) was built to the south, with tracks rearranged to create a turnback at platform 6. This turnback platform enabled all stations trains to be terminated clear of the running lines and create extra capacity between Homebush and Lidcombe station. On 20 October 2013, a new timetable was introduced which saw Homebush become the terminus for local T2 Inner West & South line services to and from the city. Most trains continuing beyond Homebush do not stop at the station. As a result, the only way to travel west from Homebush is to travel one stop east to Strathfield to connect with trains continuing further west. Only a few weekday services connect with Flemington and head west. An accessibility upgrade, including lift access to the station, was announced in 2015. Signalling Rail traffic in the Homebush area has been controlled from the adjacent Strathfield signal box since 1983. From 1893 to 1928, a large mechanical signal box controlled traffic through Homebush. This building, situated to the south west of the station, opposite Homebush Public School, still stands. From 1928 to 1983, a pistol grip power box situated immediately to the west of platforms 1 and 2 was in use. It was damaged by fire and demolished, some time after its closure. Platforms & services Platform 1 does not actually exist on the station's numbering system, however, behind the existing Platform 2 is the North Strathfield Junction goods line, which previously had a platform when the goods line was double track. The platform is now fenced off from the goods line. Transport links Transit Systems operates one route via Homebush station: *408 Rookwood Cemetery to Westfield Burwood via Flemington and Strathfield Homebush station is served by two NightRide routes: *N60 Fairfield station to City (Town Hall) *N61 Carlingford station to City (Town Hall)  Heritage listing  As at 26 October 2010, Homebush Railway Station has state significance as the site of three different railway stations that represent three significant historical phases in the development of the NSW railways. The site is significant as one of only four original intermediate stations on the first railway line in NSW between Sydney and Parramatta; the subsequent rebuilding of the station in the 1860s was associated with servicing the nearby Government Abattoirs at Homebush; and the existing station arrangement dating from the 1891 quadruplication of the line represents the expansion of the railways in the late 19th century to accommodate increasing rail services. Homebush Railway Station is significant for its rare collection of railway structures dating from 1891 that form a unique and cohesive group. Designed under the direction of Commissioner Edward Eddy, the platform buildings demonstrate the first use of island platforms in NSW and are one of only four extant examples of 1891 \\"Standard Eddy\\" platform buildings. The 1891 overhead booking office is also a rare structure being one of only three similar structures representing the earliest use of above-platform buildings. The station buildings including the signal box, brick store rooms and footbridge collectively demonstrate a former era of travel, communication and trade. The group remains highly intact. Homebush railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Homebush Railway Station Group has historical significance at the state level representing three significant historical phases in the development of the NSW railways. Established during the first phase of NSW railway construction in the 1850s the site is significant as one of only four original intermediate stations on the first railway line in NSW between Sydney and Parramatta. The subsequent (second) rebuilding of the station in the 1860s was associated with servicing the nearby Government Abattoirs at Homebush. The existing (third) station arrangement with its extant platforms, station buildings and signal box dates from the 1891 quadruplication of the line represents the expansion of the railways in the late 19th century to accommodate increasing rail services. The existing 1890s platform buildings are historically significant as they are able to demonstrate the first use of island platforms in NSW. In addition the signal box, footbridge and brick store rooms collectively demonstrate a former era of travel, communication and trade. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The signal box and remaining contemporary railway buildings at Homebush railway station are closely identified with Commissioner Edward Eddy under whose direction the Homebush Railway station and signal box were designed, the station buildings being the first of the new standard type of station buildings. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. As a group the form, fabric and detailing of the Homebush station buildings characterise the type of construction and architectural style employed in late 19th century railway station buildings in the Sydney region. The 1890s \\"Standard Eddy\\" platform buildings all the characteristic features of this type of station building, namely cantilevered awnings with wide fascia and most importantly the purpose- designed location on island platforms. The 1890s overhead booking office is aesthetically significant as it has characteristic features of this type of station building namely the use of brick for construction, the small size of the building and the location of the building on the footbridge. The 1890s signal box is an in-operational signal box, with no signalling equipment and deteriorated interiors but it retains a number of features which typify this type of signal box, including inverted corrugated galvanised iron awnings above the operating level windows and landing and the full building width second floor landing which has a small timber compartment for a toilet at its rear. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community's history. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Homebush Railway Station has low archaeological research potential. Any evidence pertaining to the former station master's residence, the 1890s carriage shed, locomotive depot, locomotive watering facilities, and the 1923 nursery has been removed or disturbed by subsequent developments on site. The 1920s telephone exchange building has also been demolished and the site on which it existed has been levelled and planted with vegetation. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Homebush Railway Station is significant for its rare collection of railway structures dating from 1891 that form a unique and cohesive group. Homebush Railway Station is one of the four known stations including Croydon, Katoomba and Summer Hill which have extant \\"Standard Eddy\\" platform buildings. The 1891 overhead booking office is also a rare structure being one of only three known examples of similar pre1910 overhead booking offices in the state, the others being at Newtown and Redfern. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The platform buildings at Homebush Station are in a largely intact condition externally and they are good representations of the \\"Standard Eddy\\" building. The Homebush signal box is still able externally to demonstrate the essential design qualities of a late 19th-century elevated signal box of the NSW Government Railways. The design was widely used throughout the system from 1883 until 1911, and some twenty boxes of either full timber or mostly brick load-bearing wall construction were built.

Written for a song contest in 1920, the 16-line, 2-verse song became the state's official state song in 1927. History In 1920, the Society of Oregon Composers held a competition to select a state song for Oregon. The winning entry, \\"Oregon, My Oregon,\\" was a collaboration between John Andrew Buchanan, who wrote the lyrics, and Henry Bernard Murtagh, who composed the music. Buchanan was an amateur lyricist who was an Astoria city judge, while Murtagh was a professional musician with a Broadway credit, but who was best known as a professionally trained theatre organist on the West Coast during the silent movie era. Following the song's selection, the Society promoted the song by conducting performances at public gathering spaces around the state and at schools and universities (the state Superintendent of Public Instruction had endorsed the song). On February 12, 1927, the song was officially adopted as the state song by a joint resolution of the Oregon State Legislature. In 2009, legislator Gene Whisnant proposed choosing a new official state song. In 2017, a bill proposed in the Oregon Legislative Assembly sought to update the song's lyrics, \\"to reflect cultural, historical, economic and societal evolution\\" of the state. Description Buchanan's lyrics contain two main themes: honoring the early settlers and pioneers of Oregon, and praise for the natural beauty of the state. Murtagh composed the song as a march in F major.

Commissioned in 1864, the ship spent her entire active career with the James River Flotilla covering the water approaches to the Confederate States capital of Richmond, Virginia, although her only notable engagement was the Battle of Trent's Reach. After the war, she was purchased by France where she served as a coastal defense ship in the French Navy (). Onondaga saw little active service with the French, spending most of the next four decades in reserve, although she was mobilized during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871. The monitor became a guard ship in 1898, but she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap in 1904; the ship was demolished in 1905. Description Onondaga had an overall length of and a beam of . She was overweight and her draft of was almost a foot deeper than intended. The ship had a depth of hold of , a tonnage of 1,250 tons burthen and displaced . Her crew consisted of 130 officers and enlisted men.Silverstone, p. 5 Onondaga was powered by a pair of two-cylinder horizontal back-acting steam engines, built by the Morgan Iron Works, each driving one propeller using steam generated by four vertical water-tube boilers.Canney, p. 63 The engines had a combined rating of that gave the ship a speed of . She carried of coalChesneau & Kolesnik, p. 121 which gave her a range of .Gille, p. 47 The propellers were protected from underwater obstacles by iron rings. The monitor's main battery consisted of a pair of smoothbore, muzzle-loading, Dahlgren guns and another pair of 150-pounder () Parrott rifles. One of each type was mounted in the two twin-gun turrets. Her pilothouse was built on the roof of the forward turret. Steam power to rotate each turret was provided by a two-cylinder donkey engine. The nine-caliber Dahlgren guns weighed . They could fire a shell up to a range of at an elevation of +5¬∞. The Parrott rifles were 17 calibers long and weighed . Their projectiles had a range of at the same elevation.Navy Department, p. 815 As designed the exposed area of the hull was protected by wrought-iron plates, but John Ericsson, designer of the , suggested that the side armor be reinforced with additional wood inside the armor belt in April 1863. As most of the armor had already been mounted by this time, the shipyard simply added of wood to the exterior of the armor and sheathed it with a armor plate. The weight of the wood was partially responsible for increasing Onondagas draft by almost a foot more than was designed. The armor of the turrets and the pilot house atop the forward turret consisted of layers of armor plates totaling in thickness. A soft iron band was fitted around the base of the turrets to prevent shells and fragments from jamming them as had happened during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863. Onondagas deck was protected by two layers of one-inch platesCanney, pp. 62‚Äì63 and the base of the funnel was armored as well. Construction and career Onondaga on the James River The Navy solicited bids for a twin-turret ironclad for harbor and coastal service on 20 February 1862 and accepted George W. Quintard's design that generally followed the specifications, albeit built in iron rather than wood and using Ericsson's turrets rather than those designed by Cowper Coles.Canney, pp. 58, 62 The Navy ordered Onondaga from Quintard on 25 May at a cost of $625,000; he was the manager of the Morgan Iron Works and built the engines while sub-contracting the rest of the ship to the Continental Iron Works, also in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.Canney, pp. 59, 63 Onondaga, the first U.S. Navy ship to bear the name, was launched on 29 July 1863 and was sponsored by Sally Sedgwick, daughter of former U.S. Representative Charles B. Sedgwick. She was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 24 March 1864 with Captain Melancthon Smith in command.Onondaga Construction was delayed by shortages of material, labor and the closing of the shipyard during the New York City draft riots in July 1863. The ship cost $759,673.08, a budget overrun of almost 22 percent. Escorted by the gunboat , the ship departed New York City on 21 April and arrived at Hampton Roads in Union-occupied Virginia two days later. Assigned to the James River Flotilla, she supported General Ulysses S. Grant's drive on Richmond, Virginia. Together with the other ships of the flotilla, Onondaga patrolled the river and occasionally engaged Confederate artillery batteries on the river.  Battle of Trent's Reach  Stern view of Onondaga in the James River Early in January 1865, most of the Union ironclads were withdrawn from the James River as Rear Admiral David D. Porter assembled most of his ships for the forthcoming attack on Fort Fisher, North Carolina. Onondaga was the only ironclad left to guard Union forces along the James against the Confederate James River Squadron.Coski, pp. 197‚Äì198 When the Confederate squadron steamed down river to attack the weakened Union forces, Onondaga dropped downstream to a position where she could maneuver more easily. She and her supporting gunboats awaited them only to see the attack aborted when elements of the Confederate fleet--the casemate ironclads Virginia II and Richmond, the gunboat Drewry, and the torpedo boat Scorpion--all ran aground as the tide ebbed trying to pass Union obstructions at Trent's Reach, after the casemate ironclad Fredericksburg and the gunboat Hampton had passed through the obstruction at 01:30. The latter two ships continued downriver and anchored below the Dutch Gap Canal to await the rest of the squadron.Coski, pp. 200‚Äì202 The squadron commander, Flag Officer John K. Mitchell, recalled them several hours later and ordered them to anchor further upstream under the guns of Battery Dantzler. As the Confederate ships were refloated at 10:45, Onondaga approached the Union obstructions and opened fire at an estimated range of . Her Dahlgren guns hit Virginia II twice with solid shot; the first shot penetrated her armor and badly damaged the wooden backing and its supporting beams. The second shot killed one crewman and killed two others as it penetrated the armor and its backing. Richmond was only hit by a glancing shot that damaged the armored shutter that protected the ship's stern gun port before the Confederate ships were able to withdraw upriver.Coski, pp. 203‚Äì206 The decision to move Onondaga downstream resulted in her commanding officer, Commander William Parker, being court-martialled for \\"neglect of duty in not offering battle to the Confederate ironclads\\" during this engagement. Secretary Welles set aside the guilty verdict on a technicality. Onondaga continued to support Union troops for the rest of the war and steamed north after its end on 9 April. The ship was decommissioned at New York City on 8 June and was laid up at League Island, Pennsylvania. By an Act of Congress approved on 7 March 1867, the monitor was sold to back to her builder who resold her to France for 4,330,599 francs.de Balincourt & Vincent- Br√©chignac, p. 21  French service Onondaga, at Brest, France, circa the late 1860s or the 1870s Onondaga retained her name in French service and was towed from New York City to Halifax beginning on 2 September 1867. She was towed across the Atlantic to Brest by the transport departing on 15 June 1868, escorted by the aviso . The ship began an extensive refitRoche, p. 333 after her arrival on 2 July that include the replacement of her original armament with four Mod√®le 1864 or Mod√®le 1864-66 rifled breech-loading guns. Other alterations included reworking her hull sides with teak backing the armor, a larger rudder and, probably, removal of the rings around the propellers.Canney, p. 64 The French measured her freeboard at although it is uncertain if this was before or after these modifications.Onondaga began her sea trials in May 1869 and was subsequently placed in reserve. The ship was mobilized on 17 July 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War, but saw no combat and returned to reserve afterwards. Her armament was augmented in 1878 by six Hotchkiss 5-barreled revolving cannon, two towed Harvey torpedoes and a torpedo launch. In April 1898 she became the guard ship of the Naval Reserve () at Saint-Malo and her light guns were replaced by a dozen Hotchkiss guns, half-a-dozen each of and calibers. Onondaga was stricken on 2 December 1904 and was subsequently sold for 127,550 francs.

He was born on September 20, 1888 on a farm in Jackson County, Tennessee. As a child, he attended school and worked on the farm. Longevity ran in Painter's family; his father lived to 99, and his siblings lived to ages between 87 and 105. In 1917, at age 29, he enlisted in the United States Army. As a part of Battery D in the 115th Artillery Battalion, he hauled ammunition and artillery supplies, including field guns, transporting all the supplies on horses or mules. Painter saw action at the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Eighty days after the armistice was declared on November 11, 1918, Painter received the highest French honor, the L√©gion d'honneur award. He also received the Croix de Guerre and was one of only six Tennessee World War I veterans to be awarded the Tennessee Distinguished Award. Painter had to leave his son, Sean Humphrey Painter, when he went to war. He was discharged from service on April 12, 1919, after serving in the army for two years. After his discharge, Painter pursued a career as a blacksmith and married his childhood sweetheart, Gillie Watson. The couple adopted two daughters. On November 19, 1999, Painter was recognized as the world's oldest veteran at age 111.

Named in 1835 as one of the first members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Pratt was part of the Quorum's successful mission to Great Britain from 1839 to 1841. Pratt has been called \\"the Apostle Paul of Mormonism\\" for his promotion of distinctive Mormon doctrines. Pratt explored and surveyed Parley's Canyon in Salt Lake City, Utah (named in his honor), and subsequently built and maintained the first road for public transportation in the canyon. Pratt practiced plural marriage. He was murdered in 1857 by the estranged husband of his twelfth wife. Pratt fathered thirty children. His living descendants in 2011 were estimated to number 30,000 to 50,000. He is the great-great- grandfather of Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican candidate for President of the United States, and the great-great-great-grandfather of Jon Huntsman Jr., diplomat and former Governor of Utah, who served as the U.S. Ambassador to Russia from 2017 to 2019.Horowitz, Jason (March 4, 2011). \\"Presidential hopefuls Huntsman, Romney share Mormonism and belief in themselves,\\" The Washington Post.

He married Thankful Halsey in Canaan, New York, on September 9, 1827. The young couple migrated west, where they settled near Cleveland, Ohio, where Pratt purchased land and constructed a home. In Ohio, Pratt became a member of the Reformed Baptist Society, also called \\"Disciples of Christ\\", influenced by the preaching of Sidney Rigdon. Pratt soon left his property to take up the ministry as a profession. Latter Day Saint service Pratt sometime between 1852 and 1856 While traveling to visit family in western New York, Pratt read a copy of the Book of Mormon owned by a Baptist deacon. Convinced of its authenticity, he traveled to Palmyra, and spoke to Hyrum Smith. Pratt was baptized in Seneca Lake by Oliver Cowdery on or about September 1, 1830, formally joining the church. He was also ordained to the office of an elder. Continuing on to his family's home, he introduced his younger brother, Orson Pratt, to Mormonism and baptized him on September 19, 1830. Arriving in Fayette, New York, in October 1830, Pratt met Joseph Smith and was asked to join a missionary group assigned to preach to the Native American tribes on the Missouri frontier. During the trip west, he and his companions stopped to visit Sidney Rigdon. They were instrumental in converting Rigdon and approximately 130 members of his congregation within three weeks. Pratt became close friends with the Smiths, particularly Joseph, with whom he would later experience persecution and imprisonment, including incarceration at Liberty Jail. In early 1833, Pratt served as a missionary in Illinois. He went to Jackson County, Missouri, where through the summer he headed the School of the Elders, a gathering of about 60 men who studied religious and secular subjects, similar to the School of the Prophets in Kirtland, Ohio.. In the fall of 1833, he served as president of the Mormon branch number 8 in Jackson County and as a leader in the Mormon militia. He was among those Latter Day Saints driven into Clay County, Missouri by mob violence.. In February 1834, Pratt and Lyman Wight headed back to Kirtland to report on the events in Missouri to Joseph Smith.. From Kirtland, Pratt traveled with Smith in Pennsylvania and western New York, preaching and trying to recruit people to serve in Zion's Camp.. After traveling together for three weeks, during some of this time with Pratt serving as Smith's scribe, Smith returned to Kirtland from Geneseo, New York, for a court case. Pratt continued his missionary efforts along with Henry Brown. Pratt and Brown went to eastern New York to give his family members money to move to Kirtland.. They went to Richland, New York, where Pratt convinced Wilford Woodruff, who had been baptized three months before, to join Zion's Camp.. Pratt returned to Missouri later in 1834 as a member of Zion's Camp. After Zion's Camp broke up, Pratt rejoined his wife, Thankful, who had remained in Clay County while he had been traveling. While working as a day laborer, Pratt served on the Missouri High Council. Thankful had run up large debts in Pratt's absence, and when he returned with her to Ohio, some felt he was trying to flee his creditors and criticized him for it.. Pratt settled in New Portage, Ohio (now part of Barberton), where he was the leader of a group of Latter-day Saints there.. More missionary service In 1835, after his call as an apostle, Pratt served with other apostles in a mission to New York, New England, and eastern Canada.. Pratt preached in Upper Canada, in and around Toronto, in 1836. In 1837 and 1838, he preached in New York City. Pratt later served as a missionary in the southern United States and in England, the Pacific islands, and South America. He moved to Chile to begin missionary work in Valpara√≠so. In 1852, Pratt and his family left Chile after the death of their child, Omner, without having had much success among the country's Catholic residents. In addition to having converted his brother Orson and preacher Sidney Rigdon, Parley Pratt introduced the Mormon faith to several future church leaders, including Frederick G. Williams, John Taylor and his wife, Leonora, Isaac Morley, and Joseph Fielding, along with his sisters, Mary and Mercy. Apostle In 1835, Pratt entered the leadership of the early Latter Day Saint movement when he was selected as one of the original Quorum of Twelve Apostles. While on a mission to the British Isles in 1839, Pratt edited the newly created periodical, Millennial Star. While presiding over the church's branches and interests in New England and the mid-Atlantic states, Pratt published a periodical entitled The Prophet from his headquarters in New York City.. Missouri War After serving as a missionary in New York City, Pratt returned to church headquarters in Missouri in 1838. He was arrested in November 1838, along with Joseph Smith, and was held in prison in Richmond and then Columbia until escaping on July 4, 1839. His writings during this and other imprisonments with Smith comprise many first accounts and stories preserved about Smith. Writer Pratt between 1852 and 1856 Pratt was a noted religious writer and poet. Many of Pratt's writings are the only credible or lasting accounts from important American and Mormon events, such as the Hauns Mill Massacre and the events and conditions of imprisonment with Smith at Liberty Jail. Pratt's first printed work was \\"'The Mormons' So Called\\", a 5500-word account of the persecution of Mormons in Jackson County in 1833.. Pratt wrote an autobiography, published after his death but likely his most widely read work in the 21st century.In the autobiography Pratt said that he was a good friend of Pantheist and freethinker John Shertzer Hittell, author of Evidences Against Christianity. He published a book of poetry in 1835, the first collection of poems by a Latter-day Saint.Crawley, \\"Parley P. Pratt\\", in Arnold K. Garr, Donald Q. Cannon, and Richard O. Cowan (eds), Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 2000) pp. 941‚Äì42. Some of his poems have become staple Latter Day Saint hymns, some of which are included in the current hymnal of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Pratt wrote many of these hymns in 1839 while sailing to England to serve as a missionary. He was involved in compiling a hymnal with 40 hymns of his own work while editor of the Millennial Star. In 1835, Pratt published a pamphlet about his missionary efforts in Mentor, Ohio. This work, entitled \\"A Short Account of a Shameful Outrage\\", was the first pamphlet ever published by a Mormon.. One of Pratt's most influential works was a book entitled A Voice of Warning (1837), first published in New York City. Givens and Grow say the book was \\"a work that served the church as its most powerful proselytizing tool‚Äîafter the Book of Mormon‚Äîfor more than a century.\\". Pratt made substantial revisions between the first and second editions after Joseph Smith voiced some reservations about it.. The second edition of A Voice of Warning was published in 1839. In 1837, Pratt, along with John Goodson, published the second edition of the Book of Mormon. It included Pratt's testimony, along with that of the three and eight witnesses to the golden plates.. Near the end of 1837, Pratt published Mormonism Unveiled: Zion's Watchman Unmasked, which is the earliest surviving response by a Mormon to an anti-Mormon writer. Pratt also wrote one of the earliest Mormon works of fiction. His \\"A Dialogue between Joseph Smith and the Devil\\", was published on January 1, 1844, in the New York Herald. It was a religious treatise in fictional form.Richard H. Cracroft and Neal E. Lambert (eds), A Believing People: Literature of the Latter-day Saints (Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1974) pp. 331, 333 Pratt's most well-known theological work was A Key to Science of Theology, which was published in 1855. Other works by Pratt included Late Persecutions, Millennium and Other Poems, at least ten tracts published while he served as editor of the Millennial Star, and \\"Proclamation to the People of the Coasts and Islands of the Pacific\\", written by Pratt in the summer of 1851 in San Francisco, California, and published by W. C. Wandell in Sydney, Australia. Pratt's Visions and Poetry also serve as the text for many songs now found in the Latter Day Saint Hymnal. Pratt's writings also corroborate many events and revelations which are found in a book of Latter Day Saint scripture known as the Doctrine and Covenants. In total, Pratt is known to have written 31 published works, not including his posthumous autobiography.. Journey to Utah After the death of Joseph Smith, Pratt and his family were among the Latter Day Saints who emigrated to what would become Utah Territory. They continued as members of LDS Church, under the direction of Brigham Young. Pratt helped establish the refugee settlements and fields at both Garden Grove and Mt. Pisgah, Iowa. He personally led a pioneer company along the Mormon Trail to the Salt Lake Valley. Life in Utah In 1849, Pratt was appointed one of the justices of the anticipated state of Deseret.. He later served in the legislature of the provisional state of Deseret beginning in 1849.. During this same time, as one of the seven members of the Quorum of the Twelve in Utah, he was among those who oversaw the division of Salt Lake City into wards and the organization of other wards in Utah.. Sometime in the mid-1850s, working with George D. Watt, Pratt helped develop the Deseret alphabet. In 1854, Pratt went to San Francisco, California, to preside over the LDS Church's Pacific Mission In 1856, Pratt served as chaplain of the Utah Territorial Legislature.. Death and legacy In 1856, Pratt went on a mission to the eastern United States. At that time, troubles were brewing in Pratt's life. Hector McLean was the estranged husband of one of Pratt's plural wives, Eleanor McLean. Pratt had met Eleanor in San Francisco, where he presided over a church mission. In San Francisco, Eleanor had joined the LDS Church and had also had her oldest sons baptized. Hector rejected Mormonism and opposed his wife's membership in the church. Though they did not divorce, the dispute led to the collapse of their marriage.. Fearing that Eleanor would abscond to Utah Territory with their children, Hector sent his sons and daughter to New Orleans, Louisiana, to live with their maternal grandparents.. Eleanor followed the children to New Orleans, where she lived with them for three months at her parents' house. Eventually, she and the children left for Utah Territory, via Texas; they arrived in Salt Lake City on September 11, 1855. She worked in Pratt's home as a schoolteacher. On November 14, 1855, she and Pratt underwent a \\"celestial marriage\\" sealing ceremony in the Endowment House. She was the twelfth woman to be sealed to Pratt. For religious and cultural reasons, Eleanor considered herself unmarried at the time of her sealing to Pratt, but she had not legally divorced from Hector.Millennial Star 19:432.New York World, 23 November 1869, p. 2. While Pratt was serving a mission in the eastern states, Eleanor went to New Orleans to get her children. Eleanor then took the children from her parents and headed to Texas.. This was at the same time that Pratt was serving as a missionary in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Because Eleanor took the children, Hector blamed Pratt.. Hector pressed criminal charges, accusing Pratt of assisting in the kidnapping of his children. Pratt managed to evade him and the legal charges, but was finally arrested in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) in May 1857.. Pratt and Eleanor McLean were charged with theft of the clothing of McLean's children.. (The laws of that time did not recognize the kidnapping of children by a parent as a crime.) Tried before Judge John B. Ogden, Pratt was acquitted because of a lack of evidence and Ogden's own feelings after interviewing Eleanor. Ogden sympathized with Eleanor and Pratt, because he was so disgusted by Hector's drinking and wife-beating. Shortly after being secretly released, on May 13, 1857, Pratt was shot and stabbed by Hector on a farm northeast of Van Buren, Arkansas. He died two and a half hours later from loss of blood. As Pratt was bleeding to death, a farmer asked what he had done to provoke the attack. Pratt said, \\"He accused me of taking his wife and children. I did not do it. They were oppressed, and I did for them what I would do for the oppressed any where.\\" Pratt was buried near Alma, Arkansas, despite his desire to be buried in Utah Territory. Some writers have viewed Pratt's death as the act of a jealous husband, deeply angered by a man who had \\"run off\\" with his wife. A 2008 Provo Daily Herald newspaper article characterized McLean as a man who had \\"hunted down\\" Pratt in retribution for \\"ruining his marriage\\". A 2008 Deseret News article described McLean as a man who had \\"pursued Pratt across Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas, angry that his estranged wife, Eleanor, had become Pratt's 12th wife.\\" Many Mormons viewed Pratt's death as a martyrdom; his dying words were said to be, \\"I am dying a martyr to the faith.\\" (\\"I am dying a martyr to the faith\\").John A. Peel, \\"Dying Remarks of Parley P. Pratt,\\" LDS Church Archives. \\"Peel was in Van Buren at the time of the murder, but his statement was not taken down by Frank Poneroy until 1895.\\" A 2007 article in the Deseret Morning News said that \\"Pratt was killed near Van Buren, Ark., in May 1857, by a small Arkansas band antagonistic toward his teachings\\". The historian Will Bagley reports that McLean and two friends tracked Pratt after he was released by Van Buren's magistrate. Brigham Young compared Pratt's death to those of Joseph and Hyrum Smith.\\"Reminiscences of Mrs. A. Agatha Pratt\\", January 7, F564, #16, LDS Church Archives (stating that Young said, \\"Nothing has happened so hard to reconcile my mind to since the death of Joseph.\\"). Other Mormons blamed the death on the state of Arkansas, or its people.; (\\"It was in accordance with Mormon policy to hold every Arkansan accountable for Pratt's death, just as every Missourian was hated because of the expulsion of the church from that state.\\"). Due to Pratt's personal popularity and his position in the Quorum of the Twelve, his murder was a significant blow to the Latter-day Saint community in the Rocky Mountains.LDS Church leaders learned about the death on June 23, 1857 (Wilford Woodruff Journal). The murder was first reported in the Deseret News on July 1, 1857. Pratt's violent death may also have played a part in events leading up to the Mountain Meadows massacre a few months later.. After the massacre, some Mormons circulated rumors that one or more members of the party had murdered Pratt, (identification by the widow Pratt). poisoned creek water that subsequently sickened Paiute children,. and allowed their cattle to graze on private property.. Pratt was one of the better known Mormons among other Americans; for instance, in his 1864-published visit to the Mormons, Fitz-Hugh Ludlow, in The Atlantic made a joke about \\"Mrs. Deacon Pratt\\" and referred to \\"Parley's Ca√±on (named after the celebrated Elder, Parley Pratt).\\" In 2008, Pratt's family received permission from an Arkansas judge to rebury his remains in the Salt Lake City Cemetery, but no human remains were found at what was believed his gravesite. No further search efforts for Pratt's burial site have been planned.  Family  Parley P. Pratt with his wife Elizabeth Brotherton Pratt practiced plural marriage and had 12 wives, 30 children, and 266 grandchildren. In 2011, Pratt's living descendants were estimated to number 30,000 to 50,000.. His first wife, Thankful Halsey Pratt, died following childbirth in March 1837. (Thankful was a widow ten years older than Pratt when she married him.) Pratt did, however, marry women averaging ten years younger than himself, the greatest age difference occurring with his marriage to his Ann Agatha Walker who was 18 to his 40 years. On May 14, 1837, Pratt married his second wife, Mary Ann Frost Stearns (1808‚Äì1891), a widow with a daughter. The marriage was performed by Frederick G. Williams. Mary Ann was a native of Bethel, Maine (part of Massachusetts until 1820) whose first relative to join the church was Patty Bartlett Sessions, later a prominent midwife in Utah. Mary Ann was baptized by David W. Patten. She had come to Kirtland as a widow in 1836.. Joseph Smith later condemned Latter Day Saints for \\"marrying in five or six weeks, or even in two or three months, after the death of their companion.\\". Pratt may have married Mary Ann so quickly to get back his infant son, although he remained in the care of Mary Ann Young for nearly a year after Pratt remarried. Mary Ann and Pratt at times demonstrated a deep companionship in their marriage, most fully shown by her joining her husband in prison in Missouri.. After Pratt began practicing polygyny, they became estranged. Pratt suggested his falling out with Mary Ann was \\"stung by falsehoods which are circulated in the Church\\".. Some sources state that in 1843, Mary Ann Pratt married Joseph Smith, the church's founder. This marriage, however, does not appear on most lists of Smith's marriages. That same year, Smith married at least 17 other women‚Äîincluding Mary Ann's sister, Olive Grey Frost. Olive would marry Smith's successor, Brigham Young, after Smith's death in 1844. Pratt made several attempts to get Mary Ann to join him in traveling west in 1846 and 1847, but after spending the winter of 1846‚Äì47 in an abandoned Nauvoo, she chose to return to Maine. Pratt provided her with clothes and money upon her return to Maine. She received some of the proceeds from the sale of Pratt's home to a Roman Catholic priest; the Nauvoo home is still used as a residence for Catholic priests. In 1852, Mary Ann traveled to Utah Territory, but she and Pratt did not see eye to eye on how to raise their children. Mary Ann received a divorce decree issued by Brigham Young in 1853.. Mary Ann then settled in what is now Pleasant Grove, Utah. She worked as a midwife, remained in the LDS Church and became a leading advocate for Mormon women against the attacks of those opposed to polygamy.. In the fall of 1853, Pratt had seven living wives. These wives were: *Elizabeth Brotherton (1817‚Äì1897). Married Pratt July 24, 1844. They adopted one child. *Mary Wood (1818‚Äì1898). Married Pratt September 9, 1844. Four children including Helaman Pratt. *Hannahette Snively (1812‚Äì1898). Married Pratt November 2, 1844. Three children. *Belinda Marden (1820‚Äì1894). Married Pratt November 20, 1844. Five children. *Sarah Houston (1822‚Äì1886). Married Pratt October 15, 1844. Four children. *Phoebe Elizabeth Soper (1823‚Äì1887). Married Pratt February 8, 1846. Three children. *Ann Agatha Walker (1829‚Äì1908). Married Pratt April 28, 1847. Five children. Agatha ran a millinery business in Salt Lake City.. Other wives of Pratt: *Martha Monks (1825‚Äì?). Married Pratt April 28, 1847. One child who died shortly after birth. After this Martha abandoned Pratt in early 1849 and moved to California.. *Keziah Downes (1812‚Äì1876). Married Pratt December 27, 1853. They did not have any children. She lived in the same house as five of Pratt's other wives and helped them in raising their children. *Eleanor Jane McComb (1817‚Äì1874). Married Pratt November 14, 1855. Pratt's constant missions left him little time with his family. After he started practicing plural marriage, the longest period of time he had with his family were the 18 months following his return from a mission to Chile. According to Terryl L. Givens and Matthew J. Grow, Pratt's \\"highest happiness was to be surrounded by a teeming domestic world of multiple wives and offspring.\\". They noted that he also had an \\"antisocial bent\\".. One of Pratt's grandsons, William King Driggs, was the father of the King Sisters. Mitt Romney, the Massachusetts governor (2003‚Äì07) and the 2012 Republican nominee for the U.S. presidency, is one of Pratt's great-great-grandsons.Romney is descended from Helaman Pratt, a son of Pratt's fourth wife, Mary Wood (Glasgow, 18 June 1818 ‚Äì Salt Lake City, Utah, 5 March 1898). She was the daughter of Samuel Wood (baptized Dumfries, 8 July 1798) and wife (m. Mungo, Dumfriesshire, 18 July 1816) Margaret Orr (baptized Inverchaolin, Argyllshire, 15 August 1793 ‚Äì 1852.) One of Pratt's great-great- great-grandsons is Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor and Ambassador to China, and an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.

The Orewa Speech was a speech delivered by the then-leader of the New Zealand National Party Don Brash to the Orewa Rotary Club on 27 January 2004. It addressed the theme of race relations in New Zealand and in particular the special status of MƒÅori people. Brash approached the once-taboo subject by advocating 'one rule for all' and ending what he saw as the MƒÅori's special privileges.  Content  Brash covered many aspects of MƒÅori-PƒÅkehƒÅ relations in his speech. He criticized policies he believed to be separatist, such as required levels of iwi representation on district health boards and the allocation of MƒÅori electorate seats in Parliament ‚Äì something he labelled an \\"anachronism\\". The speech made particular reference to the Labour Party's stance on the Foreshore and Seabed Act, which Brash disagreed with. He also questioned the use of MƒÅori spiritual traditions in official events and the open-ended nature of the treaty settlement process. Reaction The speech was criticised not so much for its substance but for a perceived political intent behind it. It was widely claimed that Brash was \\"playing the race card\\", winning support for his party by fuelling racist sentiment toward MƒÅoridom. The speech itself was framed in terms of equality and pragmatism, arguing for dispensing with affirmative action programmes and poorly understood references in legislation to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, and ending the alleged \\"Treaty of Waitangi Grievance Industry\\". His speech was criticised by lecturer and political writer Jon Johansson: \\"Whether intended or not, the Orewa speech reinforced the ignorant and racist stereotype that MƒÅori were 'savages' before the 'gift' of European civilisation was visited upon them.\\" The speech resulted in a major surge for the National Party, which had been languishing from an overwhelming defeat at the 2002 election. From 28% in the polls a month before the speech, the National Party jumped to 45% two weeks after it: ten points ahead of Labour. Polls showed that many MƒÅori were comfortable with Brash's speech, and the National Party threw its support behind it, but Georgina te Heuheu was removed as National's MƒÅori Affairs spokeswoman after criticising it. It was instrumental in establishing a public profile for Don Brash, who had only recently become the party's leader. Subsequent to the speech, Brash's catch- cry \\"need not race\\" was taken up by the other side of the political divide, the governing Labour-Progressive coalition. An audit of government programmes was put in place to determine whether there were race-based programmes where need-based programmes would suffice. Several former New Zealand Prime Ministers have criticized the speech in the time since its delivery. Jim Bolger said in an interview published in 2017 it was in the same \\"frame\\" as Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, and that \\"some people follow absurdities\\". Ex Prime Minister Helen Clark (Labour) said of Brash's motives that \\"he would‚Äôve done a lot of opinion polling on that, and knew it would strike a chord\\". Legacy Brash returned to Orewa on 25 January 2005, hoping to capitalise on the previous year's success, and gave a speech on social welfare and on welfare dependency. This speech, dubbed Orewa 2, failed to generate the publicity of the original. The speech also caused the removal of National's social-welfare spokesperson Katherine Rich, because she failed to endorse it. Brash has returned to make annual 'Orewa speeches' every year since, on a wide range of topics. Nicky Hager's 2006 book The Hollow Men claims that the speech was written, in part, by Michael Bassett, a claim denied by Bassett.

Education Orewa District High School was founded in 1956. In 1974, the school was split into Orewa School and Orewa College. Orewa North School was founded in 1978, and another primary school opened at Red Beach to the south in 1988. Orewa College is a secondary (years 7-13) school with a roll of students. Orewa School and Orewa North School are contributing primary (years 1-6) schools, with rolls of students and students respectively. All three schools are coeducational. Rolls are as of Puriri Park In 2005 locally famous Puriri Park, at the foot of Eaves Bush, was sold for over $2,000,000. It was being subdivided in a $450 million development to form the community of Kensington Park to provide for the rapidly rising demand for housing in Orewa and the surrounding area. This upset some elderly locals as they regarded the old park as a popular place for people to enjoy their holidays and saw the development as a sign of further development to Orewa. However the developer went into receivership in September 2008 after completing less than 10% of the 750 homes planned.

Course and features The Wollemi Creek rises below Kekeelbon Mountains on the southern slopes of Mount Mounundilla, within the Wollemi Range, in remote country within the Wollemi National Park, north northwest of the locality of Putty. The river flows generally south southeast and south southwest, generally adjacent to the Putty Road, joined by seven minor tributaries before reaching its confluence with the Colo River in the upper reaches of the Colo Gorge, about south southeast of Glen Davis. The river descends over its course. The upper Wollemi Creek has two main sources, one originating at about altitude east of Mount Monundilla, and the other due south of that mountain. Both flow through rough deep gorges at about in permanent dry weather flows, and fast flowing flood, until their confluence at about , due west of Putty, from where the creek flows eventually into the Colo. The primary inhabitants of the upper creek are yabbies, eels, and possums. Some ancient massive gums populate the lower gorges and very few signs of non-native infestations are apparent, one notable exception being mistletoe which infests the upper branches of the oldest trees.

It is part of local government area of the City of Sydney. Moore Park is also a large area of parkland that is part of Centennial Parklands, a collective of three parks being Moore Park, Centennial Park and Queen's Park. Centennial Parklands is administered by the Centennial Park & Moore Park Trust, a NSW government agency. The only exception is the land on which the Sydney Cricket Ground and Sydney Football Stadium are sited; these stadiums are managed by the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust. History  Heritage listings  Moore Park has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Driver Avenue: Sydney Cricket Ground Members' Stand and Lady Members' Stand Commercial area left Moore Park is the former location of the Royal Agricultural Society's Sydney Showground, which hosted the annual Sydney Royal Easter Show until 1998. It moved to Homebush Bay (the site of the 2000 Olympics). The old showgrounds have since been redeveloped as Fox Studios, a commercial venture designed at supporting Australia's film industry. The Entertainment Quarter is a retail, dining and entertainment precinct beside the studios. It contains cinemas, live venues, restaurants, cafes, pubs, and retailers of fashion and homewares. The Farmer's Market operates every Wednesday and Saturday in the old showground showing. The south-western corner of the suburb boasts a large shopping centre called the 'Moore Park Supa Centre', on South Dowling Street. It specialises in showrooms for home furnishings and home renovations. This was the site of the former Dowling Street depot for trams. Transport The Eastern Distributor and Anzac Parade are major arterial roads on the western border of the suburb. State Transit operate frequent bus services to Moore Park from the Sydney CBD. Special services for sporting events from Central railway station have been replaced by services on the CBD and South East Light Rail from December 2019. On 13 December 2012, the NSW Government announced a commitment to build a $1.6 billion light rail from Circular Quay down George Street to Central station, then across to Moore Park and down Anzac Parade. South of Moore Park the line splits into two branches - one continuing down Anzac Parade to the nine ways at Kensington, and the other heading to Randwick via Alison Road. Construction commenced in 2015 and services commenced on the Randwick branch to Moore Park in December 2019. Sports stadiums and facilities thumb Moore Park is the location of two of Sydney's largest sporting venues, the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) and Sydney Football Stadium (SFS). The Sydney Roosters Rugby league team in the National Rugby League, The Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League, Sydney FC A-League football team, NSW Waratahs rugby union team have their administration offices at Moore Park and Sydney Football Stadium is their home ground. The Moore Park Magpies are a local junior rugby league team. The Hordern Pavilion is a multipurpose entertainment venue, while next door the Royal Hall of Industries (fondly remembered as the old Showbag Pavilion during the Royal Easter Show days) has hosted a range of exhibitions, social and commercial events and shows. Moore Park also houses Kippax Lake, the ES Marks Athletics Field, the Moore Park Golf, the Parklands Sports Centre and a number of sports fields. In October 2018 the Swans and the New South Wales Government announced an intention to upgrade the Pavilion and Hall of Industries. The Hall was to be equipped with indoor sporting and rehabilitation facilities and an international-standard netball court, providing permanent indoor training facilities for the Swans and professional netball club the New South Wales Swifts. The Hordern Pavilion would retain its live music scene and undergo a significant restoration to improve facilities for patrons and performers. The two precincts would also be joined closer together with barriers between them removed and cafes and other community facilities installed for use by the general public. The Swans train on the Tramway Oval (previously known as Lakeside Oval), located adjacent to the Sydney Cricket Ground, during the non-football season. The oval completed an extensive redevelopment in April 2019 and has identical dimensions to Marvel Stadium in Melbourne. In April 2020 the Swans pulled out of the agreement with the Government and Swifts, citing the financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools Moore Park, served by the Department of Education, is the location of Sydney Boys High School, Sydney Girls High School (both of which are selective high schools).

Centennial Park is located south-east of the Sydney central business district, in the eastern suburbs of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Centennial park is home to a number of wild animals including a bird life, rabbits, and foxes. It is also home to a number of equestrian schools and other domestic animal endeavours such as the Centennial Park Rabbit Retreat, a boarding facility for rabbits in the centennial park and Paddington area  Geography  The western fringe of the suburb is used for residential purposes and is within the City of Sydney. It features quality houses on large blocks as well as large multi-unit buildings. The bulk of the suburb consists of the Centennial Parklands (from which the suburb takes its name) and is within the City of Randwick. The parklands extend further partly into the suburb of Queens Park, adjacent to (but separate from) the park of the same name in that suburb.  History  The Centennial Parklands started out as a reserve to protect the central ponds and swamps which formed early Sydney‚Äôs water supply. When it was superseded by the Nepean water supply system in the 1880s it was decided to create a large park, which opened as Centennial Park in 1888. Part of the funding was to come from selling off residential lots adjacent to the park, but this did not occur until 1904 when of land along the western border was subdivided. To ensure high standards of residential development, strict requirements were imposed. No wooden buildings or terrace homes were allowed; brick or stone were mandated, with tile or slate roofs. Between 1905 and 1925, a wide range of substantial, quality homes were built, featuring a mixture of Federation, Arts and Crafts, Victorian and Old English styles. The streets created were Martin Road, Robertson Road, Lang Road and Cook Road.

Gulick Biography Gulick was born April 10, 1860 in Ebon Atoll, Marshall Islands. His father was missionary Luther Halsey Gulick Sr. (1828‚Äì1891), and mother was Louisa Mitchell (Lewis) Gulick (1830‚Äì1893). He was the brother of Luther Halsey Gulick, Jr. and grandson of missionary Peter Johnson Gulick (1796‚Äì1877). He graduated from Oakland High School in 1879. He received an A.B. degree from Dartmouth College with his brother Edward Leeds Gulick in 1883, an A.M. degree in 1886 and a D.D. degree in 1903. He also held D.D. degrees from Yale and Oberlin College. He was ordained a Congregational minister in 1886, and then was a supply minister at the Willoughby Avenue Mission, Brooklyn. He married Clara May Fisher (1860?‚Äì1941) on November 7, 1887. In 1888 Gulick traveled to Japan, where he worked for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions through the following twenty-five years. He mastered the Japanese language, fluently giving sermons and writing books in it. He taught English, science, and religion at several schools and universities in Japan. In his last seven years there, he served as Professor of Theology at Doshisha University in Kyoto and as lecturer at the Kyoto Imperial University. After returning to the United States in 1913, Gulick was dismayed to find growing discrimination and resentment against Japanese Americans. He campaigned against California's anti-Asian legislation and urged equality of treatment for all nations. An ardent worker in the cause of world peace, he was a vigorous proponent of the entry of the United States into the World Court. After passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, which virtually halted immigration to the U.S. from countries seen as \\"undesirable\\", Gulick decided that the most productive way to encourage international understanding was through children. Gulick was instrumental in forming the \\"Committee on World Friendship Among Children\\". In 1927, its first project was to organize the sending of American dolls to Japan for Hinamatsuri, an annual doll festival. This project had an overwhelming response from the American public, and altogether, 12,739 of these \\"American Blue-eyed Dolls\\" were sent to Japanese schools, each with an accompanying letter professing friendship. The Japanese later sent 58 dolls back to the United States ‚Äì one for each state, plus more for states with larger populations. These Japanese friendship dolls were around three feet high, and were dressed in traditional Japanese clothing. They came with a trunk full of their belongings including equipment for the tea ceremony. After these dolls toured the United States, they went back to their state. During World War II, many of the dolls, especially the ones in Japan, were seen as the enemy and were burned or stabbed. Many people saved dolls by hiding them until the war was over. Gulick wrote many books about Japanese-American relations. He died in Boise, Idaho, on December 20, 1945. According to his grandson, Sidney Gulick III, \\"his ashes were entombed in three places: alongside his father's in Springfield, Massachusetts; in Boise, Idaho; and in Kobe.\\" He had three sons, Luther Halsey Gulick (1892‚Äì1993) who developed theories of government policy, Leeds Gulick (1894‚Äì1975), and Sidney Lewis Gulick Jr. (1902‚Äì1988), and two daughters, Mrs. Leverett Davis and Mrs. John Barrow. His grandson mathematics professor Denny Gulick (Sidney Lewis Gulick III) has tried to revive the doll exchange project.

The film is written, produced, and directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda, and it stars actors Y≈´ya Yagira, Ayu Kitaura, Hiei Kimura. Nobody Knows tells the story of four children: Akira, Ky≈çko, Shigeru and Yuki, who are aged between five and twelve years old. They are half-siblings, with each of them having different fathers. Because the three youngest children are in the apartment illegally without the landlord's knowledge or permission, they cannot go outside or be seen in the apartment, and they do not attend school. Their mother leaves them alone for weeks, and finally does not return. Forced over time to survive on their own, they can only rely on each other to face the multiple challenges in front of them. Nobody Knows was first shown at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival on 12 May 2004. It was subsequently released in Japanese cinemas on 7 August 2004. The film was well received by critics, and it grossed over US$11 million worldwide. It won several awards, most notably Best Actor at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival as well as Best Film and Best Director awards at the 47th Hochi Film Awards. At the time Y≈´ya Yagira became the youngest Best Actor winner in the history of the Cannes Film Festival. Plot Nobody Knows tells the story of four siblings and their young mother who move into a small apartment in Tokyo. The film begins when the family is moving into a small rented apartment. Only the eldest, Akira is known to the landlord, while the youngest boy and girl, Shigeru and Yuki, hide in separate suitcases. The elder sister, Ky≈çko, comes separately by train. All the children have different fathers. They are not allowed to go to school or to be seen by others, and only Akira is allowed to go outside. Yet, the family seems to be happy. Things begin to change when their mother leaves home for a few months, leaving only a small amount of money for them. Then, Akira's rank in the family shifts overnight and he becomes the surrogate head of the family. They barely manage to scrape through life, with Akira having to ask money from Yuki's possible fathers. Luckily, their mother soon returns with gifts for the children. However, their mother is not back for long. She tells Akira that she has a new boyfriend, and that after she gets married, the children can lead normal lives. She then leaves again, with the promise that she will be back for Christmas. She does not keep her promise, and Akira and Ky≈çko have to play the role of parents. Akira soon finds out that she has already married and left them forever, though he does not tell the rest. Money soon becomes short, and they cannot afford to pay their rent. Their meals consist of instant cup noodles bought from the local mini-mart. On Yuki's birthday, she asks to go to the train to wait for their mother. Her mother does not appear, but on the way back, Akira promises Yuki that one day, he will bring take her on the Tokyo Monorail to see the airplanes take off at Haneda Airport. Akira soon befriends two video- game loving boys who are his age. They frequently come to Akira's house to play video games, and Akira starts to neglect his siblings. Their ties become strained. Later, the two boys bring Akira to the mini-mart and dare him to shoplift. Akira refuses to do so and the two boys leave him. After that, Akira lets his siblings go outside and play at a park nearby. He also lets them visit the mini-mart and buy things they like. As winter turns to spring, the bills have piled up and the phone, electric, gas, and water have all been turned off. They consequently must make use of the local park's public toilet to wash themselves, and the tap for their water. It is on one of these trips that Shigeru starts a conversation with a high school student, Saki, and this soon blossoms into a friendship between all of them. Saki frequently visits them and helps take care of them. However, when she offers to earn money to give to them by visiting a Karaoke lounge with a man, Akira distances himself from her, rejects the money she offers, and runs home. Summer approaches, and money remains very tight. Suddenly, Yuki falls off a stool while trying to reach for something and dies. At that time, Akira was playing baseball. The children are shocked, and Akira has to go find Saki to borrow money in order to buy a dozen or so boxes of Yuki's favorite chocolate candies which are then placed with Yuki's dead body and stuffed bunny into a suitcase. Akira and Saki then take the Tokyo Monorail to an open field near Haneda Airport's runway and bury the suitcase containing Yuki in a hand-dug grave. The children's lives then go on as usual, and the film ends with Akira, Ky≈çko, Shigeru, and Saki still together walking home. Cast *Y≈´ya Yagira as , the eldest son of Keiko. He is twelve years old.

Hirokazu Kore-eda had drafted and revised several screenplays for over 15 years. He also spent a very long time getting to know his subjects, and wanted the young cast members to interact, grow, and express their personalities freely, with as little adult dictation as possible. He did not use the usual structuring and cueing methods, but instead uses a discreet camera to show how children really live when no one is looking. Also, when the director discovered the actress Momoko Shimizu who played Yuki liked Apollo Choco more than Strawberry Pocky as was in the script, he changed his script to suit that and made her smile brighter. He chose not to make it a \\"feel-good\\" movie even though similar Japanese dramas often are. He avoided sentiment, aiming for a more stoic picture. This is because he wanted the audience to \\"take away something\\" from the film. Pre-production The director Hirokazu Kore-eda held extensive auditions to cast the four children, and the actors were all nonprofessionals. Also, during the casting, a little girl came in with noisy sandals. The director liked it so much that he brought it over to Yuki's character when searching for her mother. He also did not give the children detailed explanations of their roles, because he wanted them to be natural. Filming The filming took over a year, lasting from autumn 2002 to summer 2003. The reel was filmed chronologically and 70% of the story was set in a cramped Tokyo apartment (with every room built specifically for the film). The apartment was specially rented for a year for the filming of this film, and the filming assistants lived in the apartment when it was not used for filming. Director Hirokazu Kore-eda said that during the long filming period, he tried to build a relationship of trust between himself and the children, and also amongst the children themselves. During the children's filming breaks, the children were asked to write in their own journal entries about what they were thinking, ranging from the film to their own everyday concerns. Post-production Nobody Knows held its first public screening at the Le Theatre in Ginza, Tokyo on June 30, 2004 after the film debuted at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Music The soundtrack for the movie was written by the Japanese guitar duo Gontiti. The ending song, \\"H≈çseki\\", was sung by Takako Tate, who also appears in the film. Release Film festivals Nobody Knows competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival on 12 May 2004. Home media A DVD of Nobody Knows was released in Japan on 11 March 2005. It was released in DVD (region 2) format, and it has both English and Japanese subtitles. Separately, the Making of Nobody Knows DVD, which contains 41 minutes' worth of film taken during the filming of Nobody Knows, was released on 23 December 2004. Reception Critical reception Nobody Knows has received widespread acclaim from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 94 reviews, with an average ratings of 7.97/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Tragic and haunting, a beautifully heart-wrenching portrait of child abandonment.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 88 out of 100, with all 31 critics giving positive reviews. The Japan Times gave the film a rating of four out of five. The reviewer Mark Schilling describes the film's young actors as \\"superb\\", and said that the film \\"faithfully reflects the fabric of the children's lives over the course of a year\\". The New York Times says that the film is \\"too naturalistic, and too disturbing, to be a movie for children, but it nonetheless engages the audience's wondering, childlike imagination as well as its worrying adult conscience\\". It further adds that \\"It is also strangely thrilling, not only because of the quiet assurance of Mr. Kore-eda's direction, but also because of his alert, humane sense of sympathy\\". Accolades Y≈´ya Yagira won the award for Best Actor at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. He was the first Japanese actor to win this category at the Cannes. The film had also won the \\"Best One\\" award for Japanese film at the 78th Kinema Junpo Ten Best awards.

The Grose River and its tributaries have eroded an extensive labyrinth of gorges and canyons through the Hawkesbury (upper) and Narrabeen (lower) group sandstones, exposing cliffs of commonly over and up to in height (Banks Wall). The Burramoko Head sandstone in the upper and middle Grose gorges possesses weathering tendencies of breakage along vertical joints and has consequently yielded some of the sheerest cliff faces in the Blue Mountains. The wilderness contains 80% of the Grose River catchment. The river flows to the Nepean- Hawkesbury through an undisturbed environment for all but its final . Consequently, the Grose has substantial wild river values, as do its major tributaries such as Wentworth Creek and Carmarthen Brook. Victoria Cascades on Victoria Falls in the Grose Valley. Flora The bulk of the vegetation in the wilderness is dry open forest and woodland, dominated by Eucalyptus sieberi and E. piperita above altitude with Eucalyptus oblonga, E. globoidea, E. agglomerata and Angophora costata becoming dominant at lower altitudes. Plateau areas have thinner or waterlogged soils and generally support heath or low open woodland communities. Within the sheltered and well watered canyon environments closed forests commonly occur, with typical species being coachwood, sassafras and possumwood. On the isolated basalt caps the fertile soils support taller eucalypt forests of E. viminalis, E. blaxlandii and E. fastigata. A small area of alluvial sediments deposited in the upper Grose Valley during the Quaternary supports a tall moist open forest dominated by E. deanei, E. oreades, E. notabilis and E. cypelocarpa. The Blue Gum Forest is included in this forest type. Fauna The river is known habitat for platypus and certain hanging swamps provide habitat for the endangered and endemic Blue Mountains water skink (Eulamprus leuraensis). The rocky sandstone complexes of the plateau provide habitat for some specialised and rare native animal species (e.g. the broad-headed snake, Hoplocephalus bungaroides). Woodland communities are habitat for mammals such as the red-necked swamp wallaby, brush-tailed rock wallaby and eastern pygmy possum. History Aboriginal history Aboriginal artefacts have been found close to the Blue Gum Forest. European history The Grose River has cut a deep gorge through the area as it makes its way east towards the Hawkesbury River. Sheer sandstone cliffs standing hundreds of metres above the river make for spectacular scenery and can be viewed extensively from the Blackheath area, where there are a number of accessible lookouts, the best known being Govetts Leap. The valley can also be viewed from lookouts near Bells Line of Road and points outside Mount Victoria. It is named after Francis Grose. Charles Darwin described the Grose Valley as \\"stupendous‚Ä¶ magnificent\\" when he visited in 1836. In 1859 some of the first photographs in Australia were taken in the valley. At various times there were proposals for rail lines and dams but these have not proceeded. In 1931, the valley was the subject of one of Australia's first forest conservation battles. Within the valley, the Blue Gum Forest is one place that stands out from the rest of the valley. It consists predominantly of towering Blue Gum trees (Eucalyptus deanei, also known as Deane's Gums, or Broad-leafed gums), with a thin understorey because the tall trees inhibit the growth of ground cover by blocking most of the sunlight. Protected by the Blue Mountains National Park, the forest can be accessed only on foot, with several trails from different parts of the Grose Valley and adjacent canyons meeting in the forest. Bushwalking trails There are a number of walks through the valley, with various entry, exit points and valley arms offering a range of permutations to explore. A moderate-grade day walk covering approximately in five hours starts at Perrys Lookdown and descends sharply to the valley floor. Crossing through a corner of the Blue Gum Forest, the track goes south through the Acacia Flat camp ground, following the Govetts Creek. Passing several abandoned campgrounds, the path forks at Junction Rock; the route to Govetts Leap was closed in October 2003, following a landslide, and was reopened in December 2007. In the other direction, along Govetts Creek, the route then starts a continuous climb towards the Grand Canyon, where it forks again; one track goes to Neates Glen, while the other is a steep climb to Evans Lookout. The general direction of travel is towards the southeast and this direction is recommended as the final climb at Evans Lookout is not as difficult as the ascent at Perrys Lookdown. Creeks in the valley are seasonal, the water is unsafe to drink. The walk is much more strenuous in summer due to the higher daily temperatures and the added risk of bushfires. The valley has been affected by bushfires at various times, notably in 1982 and in November 2006. In particular the Blue Gum Forest was damaged by back burning. Owing to the harsh bushfires in 2006, the Blue Gum forest and other walking tracks in the valley were closed to bushwalkers to allow the regrowth of vegetation. As of March 2009, all tracks in the Grose Valley are open, with the exception of the Rodriguez Pass into the valley from Evans lookout and the Grand Canyon, closed due to a landslide. Conservation The Grose Valley arguably became the cradle of the modern conservation movement in NSW when Blue Gum Forest was saved from threatened destruction in 1931-32. A group from the Sydney Bush Walkers club, led by Alan Rigby, were camped in the forest when they chanced upon a Bilpin farmer, Clarrie Hungerford. Hungerford had a lease of the forest and told the bushwalkers he planned to clear the blue gums to plant walnuts. The bushwalkers went away and started a campaign to stop him. Eventually, they raised ¬£130 which they paid Hungerford in exchange for his relinquishing the lease. It was a substantial amount at the height of the great depression. 80 pounds came in the form of an interest-free loan from James Cleary, then head of the NSW railways and subsequently chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Cleary was also a bushwalker.Macqueen, Part IV One of the key activists in the campaign was Myles Dunphy, who at the time was developing his plans for the Blue Mountains National Park. During the 1800s there were various proposals to dam the Grose Valley, and one such dam would have been at the forest. The area was also the subject of a number of proposed coal and shale mining ventures, and in the 1850s it was planned that the main western railway line would be routed up the Grose River and through the forest.Macqueen, Parts I-II In 1875 Blue Gum Forest was the scene of an artists‚Äô camp established by Eccleston Du Faur, of the Academy of Art. Several magnificent photographs by Joseph Philip Bischoff and drawings and paintings by William Piguenit resulted. Another outcome was that the whole Grose Valley and surrounds was reserved from alienation because it was ‚Äòa national spectacle‚Äô. At the time there was no national park in Australia, and indeed Australia was not even a nation‚Äîbut the reservation in essence was the country‚Äôs first national park.Macqueen, Parts III-IV Gallery Grose Valley seen from Pulpit Rock, Blackheath Major tracks The Blue Mountains National Park contains the following heritage-listed major walking tracks: * Blue Mountains walking tracks * Blue Gum Forest to Burra Korain Flat * Blue Gum Forest to Perrys Lookdown * Burra Korain Flat to Victoria Falls Lookout * Govetts Leap to Evans Lookout (Clifftop Track) * Govetts Leap to Junction Rock (Rodriguez Pass) * Junction Rock to Blue Gum Forest * Blue Gum Forest to Mount Hay Road (Lockley Track) * Mount Hay Track * Neates Glen to Evans Lookout (Grand Canyon Track) * Evans Lookout to Junction Rock (Rodriguez Pass) Major lookouts * - Anvil Rock * - Baltzer Lookout * - Evans Lookout * - Govetts Leap Lookout * - Grose Valley * - Lockley Pylon * - Mount Banks * - Perrys Lookdown * - Point Pilcher * - Pulpit Rock Lookout * - Walls Lookout * - Victoria Falls Lookout See also *List of Blue Mountains articles  References  Category:Geography of the Blue Mountains (New South Wales) Category:Hawkesbury River ","title":"Grose Valley"},{"id":"1117175","text":"Albino Blacksheep is an animation website made in Toronto, Ontario, Canada that publishes member submitted digital media.

The oral Ainu culture includes various genres, of which jhhghbn , lighthearted ballads on daily affairs and rituals often accompanied by traditional Ainu instruments, and yukar (mimicry), a form of rhythmic epic poetry often supported by light percussion, are most prominently covered in writings on this oral Ainu culture. The contents of these ballads were an important source of understanding daily life as well as various traditions and habits of the Ainu people, and today these remain an important part in protecting the Ainu cultural identity, as seen in efforts by performers such as Oki, the most famous contemporary performer of Ainu music. The most useful English-language overview of Ainu music (with recordings and transcriptions) is by Chiba Nobuhiko. Traditional Ainu music genres Woman playing traditional Ainu tonkori zither Ainu music carries spiritual resonance in almost all of its forms, and it has played an important role in both the cultural history and the cultural renaissance of the Ainu people. Almost every type of Ainu song is sacred, and even the musical instruments are said to be imbued with souls.Ohnuki-Tierney, p. 53 Traditional Ainu music can be divided into two major groups ‚Äì everyday songs and epic songs. Everyday songs in Ainu tradition were sung in many situations and on an impromptu basis. They were often accompanied by the two most prevalent Ainu musical instruments: the tonkori, a plucked zither, and the mukkuri, a jaw harp played by women.  Upopo  These everyday songs are short, fairly simple, and center on an activity like a game or work. The act of singing is itself used as a game in some instances, such as Rekuhkara (Ainu throat-singing) competitions between women. Work songs are rhythmic, with lyrics and melodies based on the work with which they are sung. However, even such everyday songs have sacred rather than mundane meanings. \\"Chants like the kar upopo (sake-making song) and the iyuta upopo (the pounding song)‚Ä¶are not labor songs; rather, they are magic- oriented, for they are sung to ward off evil spirits\\".Kazuyuki, p. 283 Short, everyday songs are also a way of praying. These prayer songs are (or were) performed regularly before meals, after a fishing trip, to ask for luck in hunting, and in many other contexts. Unfortunately, material about everyday songs is very difficult to obtain. Many have never been recorded.  Yukar  Ainu epic songs, yukar, are performed as long monologues. The singer performs the song entirely from memory, and, traditionally, in a \\"non-formal\\" setting such as a friend's house or before the hearth at a gathering. While somewhat casual, these epics are still more formal than the short prayer songs mentioned earlier. Both men and women recite Ainu epics, though the vocal *qualities* of women are considered preferable to those of men. The epic songs are fairly rhythmic melodic chants. The voice of the singer usually fluctuates within words, and phrases and sentences are distinguished by the melody. Singers strive for their audience to understand every word. The epic is unaccompanied by musical instruments, though at times both the singer and the listener might tap repni, or simple blocks of wood, against the hearth or the floor to help keep time and punctuate the epic. Certain paintings also show these epics being performed lying down, with the singer beating time on his or her abdomen with the hands, but this practice has faded into obscurity.Philippi, p. 26 Epics themselves take several different forms. Following Philippi's model and dividing them in two different ways, they can be distinguished by both subject and style. Philippi divides epic subjects into two groups: mythic narratives and heroic narratives.Phillipi, p. 23 Mythic narratives are those epics featuring origin stories and stories of deities, while heroic narratives are those narratives featuring the cultural heroes of the Ainu. Mythic narratives can be told either from the point of view of a human observer or from the point of view of the divine participant. One of the most distinctive aspects of Ainu epics is this first person god point of view. Heroic narratives feature one of several major culture heroes, or recurring protagonists of mythical origins, such as Kotan-Kor-Kamui, or the Owl God. Though these culture heroes are often presented as gods, they are more human than they seem. They are analogous to the Navajo and Apache Coyote; while he is a god, he is representative of human interests and foibles. Stylistically, epics can be divided into two more categories. Some epics are novelistic and feature a set chain of events involving gods and humans, while others, which Philippi refers to as parodies, feature abnormal situations ‚Äì unexplained phenomena and dreams, presented without a clear chronological narrative.Phillipi, p. 24 These \\"parody\\" epics are very rare. Epics, as well as a few of the more everyday songs, are regularly featured in Ainu ceremonies. For example, the most famous of Ainu cultural events, the \\"bear- sending ceremony,\\" is accompanied by a whole host of songs, not the least of which is the \\"Song of a Bear,\\" a mythic epic. This epic relates the story of the bear god, who, in saving his young son, is killed by human hunters. The song both presents the situation from the god's point of view ‚Äì he is confused when he is killed, and doesn't recognize his own dead body for what it is ‚Äì and prescribes the methods for the bear-sending ceremony. The premise for the bear-sending is that the bear god is trapped in his mortal body, and by killing the bear in a ritualized, respectful manner, humans are doing the god a favor and sending him home. The song describes the inau, or carved sticks that are used as holy objects by the Ainu, as well as the prayers and ceremonies that are used to send the bear home. In this way, the ceremony and the epic are somewhat inseparable. The activities of the ceremony are outlined by the epic, and the epic accompanies the ceremony to reinforce it. Though the epic can be performed outside of the ceremony, it cannot exist without the ceremony as context, and the ceremony cannot be performed without the epic. These epics, as well as the everyday songs, represent the cultural heritage of the Ainu and allow us to understand customs and their mythic significance, but they also act as indicators of the relative well-being of the Ainu culture.  Rekuhkara  Rekukhara, also known as rekutkar (composed from the Ainu words for throat, rekut, and produce kar), was a vocal game popular amongst Sakhalin Ainu, and used throat singing techniques comparable to katajjaq, the Inuit singing style. A game was typically played by two to ten people at a time, always in pairs. At the start of each game, players take opposite places and form with their hands a closed tube between each other's mouths. One of the players starts by making a certain rhythmical motive which then resonates in the other player's mouth. This player must then uphold this motive until the other player decides to change motive. Whoever can uphold these rules without losing breath or laughing wins. According to an interview with the daughter of the last practitioner of this style (who died in 1973), the rekukhara was often done during the iomante ritual, the slaughter of a brown bear, as the produced sounds from this game would symbolically refer to the cries of the bear.Nattiez 1999, p. 406.  Yaisama  Yaisama is a form of singing game used as an expression of certain emotions (such as expressing love) or as means of self introduction in a group. As lyrics and melody are improvised on the spot, this genre can be compared to contemporary freestyle rap.  Lullabies  The name of these Ainu lullabies differ by location: the terms Iyon'nokka or Iyonruika were commonly used in the Hidaka region, while Ihunke was the term used by Asahikawa and Tokachi Ainu. One of the characteristics of these lullabies, is the mother's production of meaningless sounds such as \\"Ohho Lulu Rurururu\\" on the rhythm of lulling baby's cradle, typically done by rolling the tip of the tongue.  Instruments  The two most prevalent Ainu musical instruments are the tonkori and the mukkari. Through the effort of Ainu cultural organizations as well as prominent musicians, both have enjoyed a certain revival. Evidence shows the existence of several other instruments attributed to the Ainu, but these are no longer in active use. As a result of the geographical dispersion of the Ainu people over various neighboring islands, some of these native instruments strongly differ in usage and construction.  Mukkuri  Mukkuri. The Mukkuri is an idiophone made out of bamboo, similar in construction to the Jaw harp. Sound is produced by manipulating a string connected to the bamboo reed, and while the instrument is unpitched, tone manipulation can be accomplished by altering the size of one's mouth, which serves as a resonance box during playing. Historically this instrument did not retain a large importance in Ainu communities and was commonly seen as a children's toy rather than a tool for supporting songs or rituals. The mukkuri's inexpensive production however has made it a popular tourist souvenir in Hokkaido.  Tonkori  The tonkori, an onomatopoeic description of the sound the instrument produces, is a plucked string instrument and generally has five strings made out of gut. Unfretted and played open, the tonkori is limited in tones by the number of strings. The tonkori is played by both men and women and commonly serves as musical accompaniment to yukar or dances and rituals, although solo-performances have been noted as well.  Kaco  The Kaco was a percussion instrument similar to the tambourine, used for accompanying yukar or shamanistic rituals. It was made by stretching animal skin over a cylindrical ring commonly made out of willow or larch, and its drumbeater was done by wrapping dogskin over a branch.Tokita 2008, p. 341.  Cirektekuttar  The cirektekuttar (referred to in Sakhalin as henyudo, ionka or pehkutu), was a cylindrical wind instrument made out of the root of a reed indigenous to northern Japan, and is thought to have been similar in style and usage as the didgeridoo developed by Indigenous Australians.  Pararayki  After cultural exchange with the Russians, Ainu living on the Kurille islands built this instrument in the image of the Russian balalaika, pronounced in Ainu as pararayki.Ainu Museum  Ainu fiddle  Missionary-anthropologist John Batchelor describes the existence of several Ainu-created fiddles no longer in use. Identity and marginalization Ainu music has been important throughout the years in both reflecting and establishing the Ainu cultural identity. Ainu music, historically, has represented the state of Ainu society. The folkloric epics of the Ainu often refer directly to the state of the Ainu as a group. For example, when the Ainu were first conquered, in the period of decline after the 16th century, the culture heroes featured in the heroic types of epics were said to have \\"departed in indignation,\\".Philippi, p. 14 In addition to this kind of direct representation of Ainu cultural identity, the variable increase and decline of Ainu music is also indicative of Ainu culture. In the peak Ainu period, the most complex and fantastic epics were created, stretching out to tens of thousands of verses and building on new and complex ideas. In the most desperate period for the Ainu, however, in late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the population declined to only 15,000 or so, Ainu music was very scarce; even the famous bear-sending ceremony was described as a \\"once-in-a-lifetime\\" experience in 1948.*Kayano, Shigeru. Our Land Was a Forest: An Ainu Memoir. Boulder: Westview Press, 1980.  Decline  The pressure on Ainu music throughout their history as a people under the rule of a dominant majority has come largely from the Japanese government. The Japanese government deliberately banned Ainu language, music, and dance (including the bear ceremony) in 1799 in an attempt to homogenize the Ainu with the larger Japanese population. In addition to this, through pressure and in governmental institutions such as schools,Siddle, p. 17 \\"on every possible occasion the Bakufu persuaded the natives to follow the Japanese way,\\".Shinichiro, p. 77 This attitude, that the Ainu should do as much as possible to become Japanese, existed in the government well into the 20th century. A railway tourism manual published in 1941 reflects not only this attitude, but also the idea that the Ainu were happy to have their culture suppressed in this way. \\"They have a special aversion to distinctive treatment, and have Japanized themselves in every respect. They have abandoned their native customs and manners, forgotten the Ainu tongue and effected a complete change in their daily life.\\" It continues, \\"They requested of the Government a census whereby they might become recognized Japanese subjects. This the Government instituted and the Ainu were accepted as common people. Consequently, they are now so Japanesque that their characteristics as an Ainu race will vanish before long,\\".*Kyosuke, Kindaiti. Ainu Life and Legends. Tokyo: Board of Tourist Industry, Japanese Government Railways, 1941. While these excerpts are indicative of the attitude of the government that the Ainu should conform to the rest of Japanese society, the pamphlet's very existence counters the idea that they fit in. The pamphlet goes on to detail the very differences that make the Ainu worth writing a tourism pamphlet on, describing their customs and ceremonies and even pointing out their racial differences. This kind of contradiction is actually characteristic of the way the Japanese government has treated the Ainu, especially in the early 20th century. Besides publications such as the aforementioned pamphlet, the government also created cultural shows featuring Ainu song and dance that acted as tourist attractions (this occurred, of course, after the ban on Ainu music had been lifted). Ainu singers and dancers could often only find an avenue for their talents, and in some cases, find any job at all, in these cultural shows. The shows featured sacred, ceremonial songs, especially those of the famous bear-sending. The songs would be repeated three or four times a day, for dozens of tourists. Kayano Shigeru, who some have called \\"Ainu personified\\",Sjoberg, p. 154 a prominent Ainu public figure, recalls the shows he participated in with shame. \\"It is beyond words for me to explain to others how miserable it made us feel to sing and dance ‚Äì albeit for money ‚Äì in front of curious tourists from throughout Japan when we weren't even happy or excited,\\".Kayano, p. 119 The government was, in effect, encouraging certain aspects of Ainu culture while concurrently suppressing it as a whole. Ceremonial songs and dances became both a viable means of making a living and a shameful badge of dishonor.  Revival  In recent years, Ainu music has begun to take part in an intense Ainu cultural revival. The Ainu began reclaiming their identity as a cultural group in the 1960s and 1970s, meeting with one another, creating organized groups, and even developing an Ainu flag. While most of this reclamation occurred by way of peaceful meetings and beneficial organizations such as Kayano Shigeru's work for a national Ainu museum, some groups, like Ainu Liberation, used terrorist tactics such as the bombing of 23 October 1972, to attract attention to their cause. As a whole, however, the movement for Ainu cultural identity has been exacted through cultural media such as art, storytelling, and music, and political tactics like voting blocs and nonviolent protests. In the 1970s and 1980s, festival and ceremonial revivals began to occur, acting as a catalyst for cultural unity.Siddle, p. 36 When Ainu ceremonies were performed regularly for the first time in years, it allowed Ainu to come together, to identify and get to know one another through the avenue of culture, and to bond through that avenue as well. In addition to the creation of community in this way, and because Ainu song is so firmly rooted in history, Ainu were able to reclaim their folkloric history through these ceremonies.Siddle, p. 37 The revival of Ainu culture, and especially music, has meant more than just the development of a cohesive group of Ainu people, however. It has, not surprisingly, also resulted in the rise of an Ainu-music pop star on the Japanese stage. Oki Kano, the most prominent player of Ainu-inspired pop music in Japan, plays songs that are based on Ainu ceremonial songs. They use indigenous Ainu instruments, Ainu language, and Ainu subject matter, but also include Western influences such as guitar and bass, and sound similar to British ska music. Oki Kano is fairly well known in Japan, and represents the idea of Ainu music to many Japanese people, even though his music is very Westernized. List of Ainu musicians and composers *Akira Ifukube was very interested in Ainu music, and often utilized it in his film scores such as the famous Farou Island chant in King Kong vs. Godzilla. *Oki Kano, a tonkori performer and singer, known for his fusion group, Oki Dub Ainu Band. *Marewrew *IMERUAT (meaning \\"lightning\\" in the Ainu language) is a music group formed in 2011 by composer and pianist Masashi Hamauzu (ÊµúÊ∏¶Ê≠£Âøó) and vocalist Mina (Mina Sakai, born in Obihiro, Hokkaido, Japan) of Ainu ancestry.

Although the melody is based on a traditional mode of Japanese court music, it is composed in a mixed style derived from Western hymns. Some elements of the Fenton arrangement are retained.Gottschewski, Herman. \\"Hoiku sh≈çka and the melody of the Japanese national anthem Kimi ga yo,\\" Archived 11 June 2011 at the Wayback Machine Journal of the Society for Research in Asiatic Music Archived 6 July 2010 at the Wayback Machine (Êù±Ê¥ãÈü≥Ê•ΩÁ†îÁ©∂ Archived 11 February 2009 at the Wayback Machine), No. 68 (2003), pp. (1)-(17). Eckert rearranged the existing anthem per the Gregorian mode for Western instrumentation, making suitable modifications for playability at sea, including a four-part vocal arrangement. The new national anthem was first performed in the imperial palace on Emperor Meiji's birthday, 3 November 1880. Between 1883 and 1886 he worked in the Ministry of Education for the Music Examination Board in the area of wind and string music. However, his most important task was the publication of the books of songs for use in Japanese elementary schools. In March 1888, Eckert joined the Department of Classical Music of the Imperial Household Ministry, established the military band of the Imperial Guards, and founded the military band of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. He was active in composing ceremonial music for both the Court and for the military, while introducing a variety of Western musical instruments and musical theories on melody and harmony. In 1897, he was invited to compose a special song, which he titled Kanashimi no kiwami, for the funeral of Empress Dowager Eish≈ç (widow of Emperor K≈çmei). Eckert returned to Germany in 1899 due to ill health, and obtained a posting at the Berlin Philharmonic, but was soon appointed music director to Kaiser Wilhelm II. However, his stay in Germany was short, and soon after his health had improved, he accepted an invitation extended by the Korean Empire to build a court orchestra and to train musicians in European musical instruments and techniques. Eckert arrived in Seoul on 19 February 1901. His duties in Korea were similar to those he had previously executed in Japan. He soon had a small court orchestra of two dozen musicians established, which he subsequently built up to 70 members. The orchestra performed regularly at the court, but played every Thursday in Pagoda Park for the general public and for the Seoul-based expatriate community, during which performances, Eckert took the opportunity to publicize his own compositions, as well as those of Richard Wagner. Eckert was soon called upon to supply the harmony for the national anthem of Korea, the Daehan jeguk Aegukga which premiered on 9 September 1902. The new anthem had elements from the works of Wagner, and was played before Emperor Gojong, who was himself a Prussian enthusiast. However, only a few years later, in 1910, Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan, and the anthem was banned in favor of Eckert's earlier creation, the Kimigayo. Later life and death Eckert remained in Korea, but in much reduced circumstances due to loss of his royal patrons. His situation was complicated by renewed ill health, and the outbreak of World War I and, in 1916, he resigned as conductor of his orchestra in favor of his first flautist, whom he had trained as his successor. Eckert died in Seoul from stomach cancer at age 65. His grave is located at Yanghwajin, Hapjeong-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul. He was survived by his son Heinz Eckert.

Participants in the financial industry need a common representation of the financial transactions they perform and this standard defines general message schema, which in turn are used by organizations to define messages in a complete and unambiguous way. This results in efficiency, lower costs, and the avoidance of errors. Prior to standardization in this area, there were overlapping standards, or ad hoc approaches where there was a functional gap and no standard.  Transition from ISO 7775 to ISO 15022  ISO 15022 replaces the previous securities messaging standard ISO 7775. It provides two syntaxes: one compatible with the preceding standards, and one fairly compatible with EDIFACT. ISO 20022 is the successor to ISO 15022. SWIFT is the registration authority for ISO 15022. In SWIFT financial messages, the standard is applied to variety of message types. ISO 15022 was developed in 1995 to provide the securities industry with a better tool to create message standards. The previous standard ISO 7775 contained the actual message standards themselves (like the SWIFT message types MT 520 or MT 534), which did not make it easy to make changes to these standards (because each time one needs to pass a number of time-consuming standard cycles). To avoid this, ISO 15022 does not contain the actual messages, but contains a set of rules and guidelines to build messages. If these rules and guidelines are adhered to (checked by the registration authority) the resulting message (format) is automatically an ISO 15022-compliant standard. Examples are the MT103, MT202 Cov, MT540, MT542, MT548, etc. Parts ISO 15022 is split into two parts: *ISO 15022-1:1999 Securities -- Scheme for messages (Data Field Dictionary) -- Part 1: Data field and message design rules and guidelines *ISO 15022-2:1999 Securities -- Scheme for messages (Data Field Dictionary) -- Part 2: Maintenance of the Data Field Dictionary and Catalogue of Messages  See also  * ISO 20022 * SWIFT Notes #15022 Category:Financial regulation Category:Financial routing standards ","title":"ISO 15022"},{"id":"1117203","text":"James Whitman McLamore (May 30, 1926 ‚Äì August 8, 1996) was creator and first CEO of the Burger King fast food franchise along with David Edgerton. He also created the Whopper sandwich. After selling Burger King to the Pillsbury Company in 1967, he remained CEO for 5 years. After retiring, he served on the board of several large corporations, was Chairman of the University of Miami, chaired the United Way and was a member and Chairman of the Orange Bowl Committee. He invested in the Miami Dolphins for several years and reinvested in the educational institutions that impacted him at Northfield Mount Hermon and Cornell University. He was also a gardener, and Chairman at Fairchild Tropical Gardens. Early Life McLamore was born in 1926 in New York City. After the Stock Market crash of 1929, his father moved them to the country to his grandmother's. He lost his mother soon after and his family struggled during that time. McLamore went to Northfield Mount Hermon School before attending Cornell University at the School of Hotel Management. He arrived at Cornell with only $11 in his pocket but graduated in 1947. During his time at Cornell, he served in the United States Navy. Upon graduating from Cornell, McLamore married Nancy Nichol of Miami, Florida. McLamore's first job in the restaurant business was at a YMCA cafeteria in Wilmington, Delaware before branching out to start his 24/7 fast service restaurant, the Colonial Inn. He left and started a third concept in Miami, Florida called the Brickell Bridge Restaurant in downtown at 550 Brickell Avenue. The Burger King Years Jim McLamore at the counter in a Burger King Edgerton originally opened Insta Burger King in Miami, Florida on March 1, 1954. Three months later, on June 1, he met McLamore and they formed the Burger King Corporation. The corporation opened Burger King stores and went on to introduce the Whopper burger in 1957, when it also dropped \\"Insta\\" from the name. At this same time, Edgerton, frustrated with the issue-prone Insta machines, created the flame broiler that would provide the signature for Burger King. In 1961, McLamore negotiated the national rights to Burger King and began growth across the country. McLamore and Edgerton created two supporting businesses in 1962: Distron and Davmor Industries. Distron became the food distribution center for all the stores. Davmor Industries was the manufacturing plant that produced all kitchen equipment for each new store. Burger King was expanding, but as McDonald's went public in 1965, organic growth became difficult in keeping up. The pair sold the 274 store business to Pillsbury in 1967 in an attempt to grow under the brand. McLamore served as Burger King's CEO until 1972, when he stepped down as Pillsbury was taking the business in a different direction. He remained chairman of the company until 1976. Hotel and Restaurant Greats from 1979 (left to right): Patrick O‚ÄôMalley (Canteen Corp.), Barron Hilton (Hilton Hotels), J. Willard Marriott (Marriott Corp.), Col. Harland Sanders (Kentucky Fried Chicken), Jim McLamore (Burger King), Kemmons Wilson (Holiday Inns) Retirement After his early retirement, McLamore, with four other businessmen, invested in the Miami Dolphins in the early 1970s from Joe Robbie that led to their resurgence under Don Shula. In 1980, he was elected as Chairman of the University of Miami and worked with Tad Foote to fund raise the third largest campaign to date, resulting in $517.5 million raised for the university. He pursued his passion in gardening, both at home and with Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden. After Hurricane Andrew destroyed much of Miami, he helped raise $5 million to rebuild the gardens. In 1988, Grand Metropolitan bought Burger King in a hostile takeover. In the early 1990s, McLamore was asked by Jim Adamson, then CEO of Burger King, to come back to support the company with his advice and consulting, particularly with the Franchise community. He returned and gave speeches at the National Franchisee Association conference's in San Francisco and Orlando. While re-engaging with Burger King, Jim wrote his autobiography, The Burger King: Jim McLamore and The Building of an Empire published by McGraw Hill posthumously in 1998. The book was later edited and republished as The Burger King: A Whopper of a Story on Life and Leadership by the McLamore Family in 2020. McLamore died of cancer in Coral Gables, Florida on August 8, 1996, at the age of 70.

He was notably the first recipient of the Jules L√©ger Prize in 1978. Biography In his memoirs, My Life on Earth and Elsewhere, Schafer described serving as a novice deckhand aboard the oil tanker Imperial Windsor in 1955. Born in Sarnia, Ontario, he studied at the Royal Schools of Music in London, the Royal Conservatory of Music, and the University of Toronto. At the last institution he was a pupil of Richard Johnston. His music education theories are followed around the world. He started soundscape studies at Simon Fraser University in the 1960s. In addition to introducing the concept of soundscape, he also coined the term schizophonia in 1969, the splitting of a sound from its source or the condition caused by this split: \\"We have split the sound from the maker of the sound. Sounds have been torn from their natural sockets and given an amplified and independent existence. Vocal sound, for instance, is no longer tied to a hole in the head but is free to issue from anywhere in the landscape.\\" Steven Feld, borrowing a term from Gregory Bateson, calls the recombination and recontextualization of sounds split from their sources schismogenesis. In 1987 Schafer was awarded the first Glenn Gould Prize in recognition of his contributions. He has also won two JUNO Awards for Classical Composition of the Year: in 2004 for his \\"String Quartet No. 8\\", and in 2011 for his \\"Duo for Violin and Piano\\". In 2005 Schafer was awarded the Walter Carsen Prize, by the Canada Council for the Arts, one of the top honours for lifetime achievement by a Canadian artist. In 2009, Schafer received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts. In 2013, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada \\"for his contributions as an internationally renowned composer of contemporary music, and for his groundbreaking work in acoustic ecology\\". Schafer is a practitioner of graphic notation.R. Murray Schafer at National Arts Centre ArtsAlive web site. Retrieved 2011-11-17.

The site was selected as the location of the Capitol in Walter Burley Griffin's Canberra design in 1912, which he envisaged to be \\"either a general administration structure for popular receptions and ceremony or for housing archives and commemorating Australian Achievements\\"., p12 The proposed building is commemorated in the name of the Capitol Theatre, Manuka. However, Griffin's name for the hill was subsequently changed to Capital Hill. The Parliament buildings were to be located a little further down the hill towards Lake Burley Griffin at Camp Hill, between Capital Hill and the Provisional Parliament House. Griffin opposed the plan to build a Provisional Parliament House on the lower slopes of Camp Hill, because he considered that it would make it difficult to build the permanent Parliament House on Camp Hill, as the provisional building would have to be demolished.Parliamentary Zone Development Plan, p18 In fact, in the 1958 and 1964 Holford plans for the Parliamentary Triangle, the site for the New Parliament House was moved to the lake shore, partly for this reason. Holford also reportedly said that a lakeside site would discourage politicians from seeing themselves as superior to ordinary people. However, in 1974 Parliament voted to move the Parliament to its permanent location on Capital Hill, which it saw as befitting the eminence of the institution. Construction of the new parliament buildings commenced in 1981 and the new building was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1988, when the Parliament relocated from the old building. Capital Hill was previously named Kurrajong Hill and is around 2.5 km¬≤, surrounded by a circular road (Capital Circle). Until the construction of the current Parliament House, the hill was covered with scrubby native bushland. Parliament House Canberra: the hill recreated over the buildingThe construction of the current parliament building required removing much of the top half of the hill, and after construction, much of the earth was replaced on top of the building. The surrounding hill is landscaped with native plants, while the soil on top of Parliament House is planted with lawn. However, on the western side of the Hill, a small area of the original native bushland has been preserved. The streets that go out from Capital Hill are named after Australian capitals, and some of their direction roughly corresponds to the direction of that capital city, Melbourne Avenue, Adelaide Avenue, Perth Avenue, Hobart Avenue and Darwin Avenue with Brisbane Avenue, Sydney Avenue not even being close. The streets which surround the hill in concentric circles are named after increasing spheres of influence with the inner-most circle called Parliament drive and then spanning out to Capital Circle, State Circle, National Circuit, Dominion Circuit and Empire Circuit. Parliament House Canberra: The main entrance and the flag When Griffin drew up his plans in 1912, there was still some optimism that New Zealand might join the Federation of Australia. Griffin's plans included eight avenues radiating out from Capital Hill named after the capitals of the six states, the capital of the Northern Territory and the capital of New Zealand. Before the name Wellington Avenue was gazetted, it was realised that New Zealand was not going to become part of a Confederation of Australasia and the name was replaced by Canberra Avenue. Griffin planned that the state capital city avenues were terminated with a park named after the generic botanical name for a native plant from that particular site; for example, Telopea Park is named after the waratah, the floral emblem of New South Wales, and is at the end of Sydney Avenue, named after the capital of New South Wales. The name of the precinct of Manuka is a remnant of Griffin's naming scheme. Another remnant of Griffin's nomenclature was the Wellington Hotel, formerly on the corner of Canberra Avenue and National Circuit, which was demolished and replaced by the hotel known as of 2007 as Rydges Capital Hill Canberra. Geology The geology of Capital Hill has been studied in great detail. Canberra Formation, calcareous Shale is found in the south west and north east. This overlies middle Silurian Camp Hill Sandstone. The sandstone unconformably overlies the early Silurian Black Mountain Sandstone and State Circle Shale. State Circle Shale is Late Llandovery in a more finely divided time scale and has been dated to 445.7 million years old. The State Circle Shale is composed of laminated shales and siltstone. Black Mountain Sandstone is composed of a white quartz sandstone. The Deakin Fault cuts the south west of state circle. Mount Painter acid volcanoes are to the south west of this fault.

It depicts the hours of the day through solo and ensemble dances. The opera was first performed in 1876 and was revised in 1880. Later performed on its own, the Dance of the Hours was at one time one of the best known and most frequently performed ballets.Dance of the Hours Flutetunes.com, 2010-08-04. Accessed October 2010]New Jersey Symphony Orchestra Program notes. January 2010. It became even more widely known after its inclusion in the 1940 Walt Disney animated film Fantasia where it is depicted as a comic ballet featuring ostriches, hippopotamuses, elephants and alligators. Description The ballet, accompanied by an orchestra, appears at the end of the third act of the opera, in which the character Alvise, who heads the Inquisition, receives his guests in a large and elegant ballroom adjoining the death chamber. The music and choreography represent the hours of dawn, day (morning), twilight and night. Costume changes and lighting effects reinforce the progression. The dance is intended to symbolize the eternal struggle between the forces of light and darkness. It is about 10 minutes long. Structure The piece begins with an introduction in G major, with vocal assistance in the form of a recitative which is omitted in the symphonic version. Then follows in sequence: the dance of the hours of dawn, the hours of day, the hours of the night and the morning. The episode devoted to dawn (in E major) merges with the extensive introduction to the episode dedicated to daytime hours, anticipating the rhythmic structure of four notes, which characterizes the episode. The transition point between the two episodes, where it marks the birth of the day, coincides with the intervention in fortissimo of the chorus (\\"\\"), which follows a slow chromatic passage, typical of Ponchielli's style. After a brief episode in C minor devoted to the night, based on figuration in staccato, a connected and expressive melody in E minor, played by cellos, introduces the morning. A new pathetic melody in A minor extends to a broad phrase with initial tone in E minor. A brief diminuendo precedes the attacca of the final coda in A major, a vigorous can-can in the manner of Romualdo Marenco's ' (1881), introduced by an abrupt change of tempo to allegro vivacissimo.

He officiated several major bouts, such as Muhammad Ali vs. Larry Holmes in 1980. He was the referee for the lightweight world title fight between defending champion Ray Mancini and challenger Duk Koo Kim, which caused Kim's death four days after the fight ended. Green took his own life several months later. Background Green was a native of Louisiana and a Golden Gloves boxer in the 1960s. Career as referee Green presided over several notable fights. One of these was Muhammad Ali's loss to Larry Holmes in 1980. Green officiated two high-profile fights in 1982. Early in the year he refereed Wilfred Benitez's fight against Roberto Dur√°n for Benitez's super welterweight title. Later he was the referee in the Ray Mancini's first-round knockout of Arturo Frias, a win that gave Mancini the WBA lightweight championship. On November 13, 1982, Green was assigned to work Mancini's second defense of that title, a match against the Korean contender Duk-Koo Kim that was televised across the nation by CBS. The fight ended when Green stopped it after Kim was knocked down early in the fourteenth round, but Kim had taken a severe beating from Mancini throughout the fight and collapsed in the ring shortly thereafter. Four days after the fight Kim died of massive brain injuries. The Kim-Mancini bout proved to be a watershed in boxing, triggering a series of major changes to the sport. Championship bouts were reduced from 15 to 12 rounds, the standing eight count was introduced, and fighters had to undergo more stringent medical tests before a match. Green's last fight was a USBA Heavyweight Championship fight on May 20, 1983, that saw Greg Page defeat Renaldo Snipes in a 12-round decision. Forty-two days later Green was found dead in his North Las Vegas home. The coroner ruled the death a suicide via self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The simplest example is stilbene, which has two geometric isomers, E and Z. Under the influence of light, these compounds can generally perform two kinds of reversible isomerizations:H. G√∂rner, J. Kuhn, Advances in Photochemistry 19, 1-117 (1995). *E to Z isomerizations, most common for stilbenes (and azobenzenes). This process goes through an excited state energy minimum where the aromatic rings lie at 90¬∞ to each other. This conformation drops to the ground state and generally relaxes to trans and cis forms in a 1:1 ratio, thus the quantum yield for E-Z isomerization is very rarely greater than 0.5. *6œÄ electrocyclizations of the Z form, leading to an additional bond between the two aryl functionalities and a disruption of the aromatic character of these groups.J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th ed. (1992). The quantum yield of this reaction is generally less than 0.1, and in most diarylethenes the close-ring form is thermally unstable, reverting to the cis-form in a matter of seconds or minutes under ambient conditions. Thermal isomerization is also possible. In E-Z isomerization, the thermal equilibrium lies well towards the trans-form because of its lower energy (~15 kJ mol‚àí1 in stilbene).S. P. Kwasniewski, L. Claes, J.-P. Fran√ßois, M. S. Deleuze, J. Chem. Phys. 118:7823-7836 (2003) The activation energy for thermal E-Z isomerization is 150‚Äì190 kJ mol‚àí1 for stilbene, meaning that temperatures above 200¬∞C are required to isomerize stilbene at a reasonable rate, but most derivatives have lower energy barriers (e.g. 65 kJ mol‚àí1 for 4-aminostilbene). The activation energy of the electrocyclization is 73 kJ mol‚àí1 for stilbene. Stilbene isomerizations under the influence of light Both processes are often applied in molecular switches and for photochromism (reversible state changes from exposure to light).V. Balzani, A. Credi, F. M. Raymo, J. F. Stoddart, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2000, 39, 3348 .B. L. Feringa (ed.), Molecular Switches, Wiley- VCH, 2001, Weinheim.May 2000 issue of Chem. Rev.: Memories and Switches. After the 6œÄ electrocyclization of the Z form to the \\"close-ring\\" form, most unsubstituted diarylethenes are prone to oxidation, leading to a re- aromatization of the œÄ-system. The most common example is E-stilbene, which upon irradiation undergoes an E to Z isomerization, which can be followed by a 6œÄ electrocyclization. Reaction of the product of this reaction with molecular oxygen affords phenanthrene, and it has been suggested by some studies that dehydrogenation may even occur spontaneously. The dihydrophenanthrene intermediate has never been isolated, but it has been detected spectroscopically in pump-probe experiments by virtue of its long wavelength optical absorption band. Although both the E-Z isomerization and the 6œÄ electrocyclization are reversible processes, this oxidation renders the entire sequence irreversible. Stabilization of the closed-ring form to oxidation One solution to the problem of oxidation is to replace the hydrogens ortho to the carbon-carbon double bond by groups that can not be removed during the oxidation. Following the Woodward‚ÄìHoffmann rules, the photochemical 6œÄ cyclization takes place in a conrotatory fashion, leading to products with an anti configuration of the methyl substituents. As both methyl groups are attached to a stereogenic center, two enantiomers (R,R and S,S) are formed, normally as a racemic mixture.M. Irie, Chem. Rev. 2000, 100, 1685. This approach also has the advantage that the thermal (disrotatory) ring closure can not take place because of steric hindrance between the substitution groups. Dithienylethenes Dithienylethene molecular switch. Ortho- substitution of the aromatic units results in a stabilization against oxidation, but the closed-ring form still has a low thermodynamic stability in most cases (e.g. 2,3-dimesityl-2-butene has a half-life of 90 seconds at 20¬∞C). This problem can be addressed by lowering the aromaticity of the system. The most commonly used example are the dithienylethenes, i.e. alkenes with a thiophene ring on either side. Dithienylethene derivatives have shown different types of photochemical side reactions, e.g., oxidation or elimination reactions of the ring-closed isomer and formation of an annulated ring isomer as a byproduct of the photochromic reaction.M. Irie, T. Lifka, K. Uchida, S. Kobatake and Y. Shindo, Chem. Commun. 747‚Äì750 (1999) In order to overcome the first, the 2-position of the thiophenes is substituted with a methyl group, preventing oxidation of the ring closed form. Also often the two free Œ±-positions on the double bond are connected in a 5 or 6-membered ring in order to lock the double bond into the cis-form. This makes the dithienylethene undergo only open-closed ring isomerization, unconfused by E-Z isomerization. More recently, based on recent findings showing that by-product formation most likely occurs exclusively from the lowest singlet excited state,D. Mendive-Tapia, A. Perrier, M. J. Bearpark, M. A. Robb, B. Lasorne, D. Jacquemin, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 16:18463-18471 (2014) M. Herder, B. Schmidt, L. Grubert, M. P√§tzel, J. Schwarz, S. Hecht, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 137 (7):2738‚Äì2747 (2015) a superior fatigue resistance of dithienylethenes upon visible-light excitation has been achieved by attaching small triplet- sensitizing moieties to the diarylethene core via a -conjugated linkage.S. Fredrich, R. G√∂stl, M. Herder, L. Grubert, S. Hecht, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 55: 1208 (2016) The dithienylethenes are also of interest for the fact that their isomerization requires very little change of shape. This means that their isomerization in a solid matrix can take place much more quickly than with most other photochromic molecules. In the case of some analogs, photochromic behavior can even be carried out in single crystals without disrupting the crystal structure. Applications Typically, the open-ring isomers are colorless compounds, whereas the closed-ring isomers have colors dependent on their chemical structure, due to the extended conjugation along the molecular backbone. Therefore, many diarylethenes have photochromic behavior both in solution and in solid state. Moreover, these two isomers differ from one another not only in their absorption spectra but also in various physical and chemical properties, such as their refractive indices, dielectric constants, and oxidation-reduction potentials. These properties can be readily controlled by reversible isomerization between the open- and closed-ring states using photoirradiation, and thus they have been suggested for use in optical data storage and 3D optical data storage in particular.M. Irie, Chem. Rev. 2000 , 100, 1685. The closed form has a conjugated path from one end of the molecule to the other, whereas the open form has not. This allows for the electronic communication between functional groups attached to the far ends of the diarylethene to be switched on and off using UV and visible light.N. Katsonis, T. Kudernac, M. Walko, S. J. van der Molen, B. J. van Wees, B. L. Feringa, Advanced Materials 2006, 18, 1397‚Äì1400.

He served as a member of the United States House of Representatives. Biography Marsh was born in Lebanon, Connecticut, to Joseph Marsh and Dorothy Mason. He settled with his parents in Vermont before the Revolutionary War. After graduating from Dartmouth College in 1786, he studied law and was admitted to the bar. He began the practice of law in Woodstock, Vermont, where he continued to practice law for about fifty years. He became the senior member of the profession in Vermont, and among those who studied in his office in preparation to become attorneys was Nicholas Baylies, who served as a Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. He was appointed by George Washington to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont, and served from 1797 until 1801. Marsh was elected as a Federalist candidate to the Fourteenth United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1815 until March 3, 1817. He founded the American Colonization Society while in Washington. He was prominent in the Dartmouth College controversy and was a trustee of Dartmouth College from 1809 until 1849. Marsh became a member of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in 1809. Marsh received the degree of LL.D. from Dartmouth College in 1828. He was a liberal benefactor of various missionary and Bible societies, president of the Vermont Bible Society, vice president of the American Bible Society, and vice president of the American Education Society. Family life Marsh married Anna Collins in 1789. They had two children, Charles Marsh and Anna Marsh. Marsh married Susan Perkins on June 3, 1798. They had five children together; Lyndon Arnold Marsh, George Perkins Marsh, Joseph Marsh, Sarah Marsh, and Charles Marsh. Marsh's father, Joseph Marsh, was a Vermont officer in the American Revolution, a member of the Vermont House of Representatives, and the first Lieutenant Governor of Vermont. His son George Perkins Marsh (1801‚Äì1882) was an environmentalist, a member of the United States Congress, and a diplomat. His nephew James Marsh (1794‚Äì1842) was a noted Congregational clergyman and writer. Death Marsh died on January 11, 1849, in Woodstock, Vermont. He is interred in River Street Cemetery in Woodstock. His early 19th-century house, now much altered with Victorian features, is the centerpiece of Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park and is a National Historic Landmark (primarily for its association with his son George Perkins Marsh), and his c. 1797 law office building (now a private residence and moved from its original location) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Mostly written in southwest Wales in the middle of the 14th century (c. 1350) it is the earliest collection of Welsh prose texts, though it also contains some examples of early Welsh poetry. It is now part of the collection of the National Library of Wales, having been preserved in the library at Hengwrt, near Dolgellau, Gwynedd, of the 17th century antiquary Robert Vaughan, who inherited it from the calligrapher John Jones and passed it to his descendants. The collection later passed to the newly established National Library of Wales as the Peniarth or Hengwrt-Peniarth Manuscripts. What was one manuscript was divided into two in the medieval period and has been bound as two separate volumes, known as Peniarth MS 4 and Peniarth MS 5. Peniarth MS 4 contains the most important material: medieval Welsh tales now collectively known as the Mabinogion. Peniarth MS 5 (the first part of the original manuscript) contains Christian religious texts in Welsh, mostly translated from Latin and French, including Lives of various saints and a tale of Charlemagne. The White Book was copied in the mid 14th century, most probably for Rhydderch ab Ieuan Llwyd (c. 1325‚Äì1400) from Parcrhydderch in the parish of Llangeitho in Ceredigion. Rhydderch, who came from a family with a long tradition of literary patronage, held posts under the English Crown but was also an authority on native Welsh law. The hands of five scribes have been identified in the manuscripts, very likely working in Strata Florida Abbey, not far from Rhydderch's home, and certainly in South Wales based on the dialect used by the scribes. The remainder of the name refers to the book being bound in white. The contents of the manuscript are very similar to the Red Book of Hergest, and may have been its exemplar; but it is more likely that the two descend from a lost common ancestor. The White Book is no longer complete, but it was copied in 1573 by Richard Langford, before some of the text was lost. Langford's copy is itself now lost, but two copies descending from it do survive: Peniarth 111 (made by John Jones of Gellillyfdy in 1607), whose spelling is very close to the White Book's, and London, British Library, Add.

It was named by the Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington, which was the local authority when the park was established. The park is 22.57 hectares (55.8 acres) in extent. Its facilities include children's playgrounds, sports fields, an unkempt bowling green, a skatepark bowl , tennis courts, the caf√© and other attractions including an aviary with assorted captive species, captive deer and goats, and two small lakes hosting wild ducks, geese, swans and other water birds. The park also comprises remains of the New River, and the Capital Ring has some of its paths running through a small section of the park. History Clissold Park Caf√© is at the late-18th century villa; the spire of St Mary's Church, Stoke Newington can be seen in the background Clissold House (formerly Paradise House) was built, in the latter half of the 18th century, for Jonathan Hoare,Quaker history page a City of London merchant, Quaker, philanthropist and anti-slavery campaigner. (His brother, Samuel, half-brother of Sir Joseph Hoare Bt, was one of the founders of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade.) The park was created to be his idyll, and the stretch of water which wends its way around the house was once part of the New River, an artificial waterway that supplied London with clean water from Hertfordshire. Hoare, in financial difficulties, mortgaged the estate, and then lost it by foreclosure to a Robert Pryor. It was sold by Pryor's executors to Thomas Gudgeon, a merchant, who owned it around the beginning of the 19th century.A P Baggs, Diane K Bolton and Patricia E C Croot, Stoke Newington: Other estates, in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 8, Islington and Stoke Newington Parishes, ed.

Gudgeon sold it in 1811, to William Crawshay I. Subsequently the estate passed, through a Crawshay family connection, to Augustus Clissold. When he died in 1882 the Ecclesiastical Commissioners bought the property, intending to profit from development.

It is a white or colourless solid that is soluble in water, producing a mildly alkaline solution. In chemistry, it is an aromatic heterocycle, classified as a diazole, and has non-adjacent nitrogen atoms. Many natural products, especially alkaloids, contain the imidazole ring. These imidazoles share the 1,3-C3N2 ring but feature varied substituents. This ring system is present in important biological building blocks, such as histidine and the related hormone histamine. Many drugs contain an imidazole ring, such as certain antifungal drugs, the nitroimidazole series of antibiotics, and the sedative midazolam. When fused to a pyrimidine ring, it forms a purine, which is the most widely occurring nitrogen-containing heterocycle in nature. The name \\"imidazole\\" was coined in 1887 by the German chemist Arthur Rudolf Hantzsch (1857‚Äì1935).Hantzsch, A. and Weber, J. H. (1887) \\"Ueber Verbindungen des Thiazols (Pyridins der Thiophenreihe)\\" (On compounds of thiazole (pyridines of the thiophene series), Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft, 20 : 3118‚Äì3132, see p. 3119. See also: Hantzsch, A. (1888) \\"Allegemeine Bemerkungen √ºber Azole\\" (General observations about azoles), Annalen der Chemie, 249 : 1‚Äì6. Hantzsch proposed a reform of the nomenclature of azole compounds, including a proposal to call the heterocyclic ring C3H3(NH)N \\"imidazole\\" ; see pp. 2 and 4. Structure and properties Imidazole is a planar 5-membered ring. It exists in two equivalent tautomeric forms, because hydrogen can be bound to one or the other nitrogen atom. Imidazole is a highly polar compound, as evidenced by its electric dipole moment of 3.67 D. It is highly soluble in water. The compound is classified as aromatic due to the presence of a planar ring containing 6 œÄ-electrons (a pair of electrons from the protonated nitrogen atom and one from each of the remaining four atoms of the ring). Some resonance structures of imidazole are shown below: :550px Amphoterism Imidazole is amphoteric. That is, it can function as both an acid and as a base. As an acid, the pKa of imidazole is 14.5, making it less acidic than carboxylic acids, phenols, and imides, but slightly more acidic than alcohols. The acidic proton is the one bound to nitrogen. Deprotonation gives the imidazole anion, which is symmetrical. As a base, the pKa of the conjugate acid (cited as pKBH+ to avoid confusion between the two) is approximately 7, making imidazole approximately sixty times more basic than pyridine. The basic site is the nitrogen with the lone pair (and not bound to hydrogen). Protonation gives the imidazolium cation, which is symmetrical. Preparation Imidazole was first reported in 1858 by the German chemist Heinrich Debus, although various imidazole derivatives had been discovered as early as the 1840s. It was shown that glyoxal, formaldehyde, and ammonia condense to form imidazole (glyoxaline, as it was originally named). From p. 205: \\"Die gereinigte Substanz stellt das oxalsaure Salz einer Basis dar, die ich mit Glyoxalin bezeichenen werde.\\" (The purified substance constitutes the oxalic salt of a base, which I will designate as \\"glyoxaline\\".) This synthesis, while producing relatively low yields, is still used for generating C-substituted imidazoles. :250px In one microwave modification, the reactants are benzil, benzaldehyde and ammonia in glacial acetic acid, forming 2,4,5-triphenylimidazole (\\"lophine\\"). Imidazole can be synthesized by numerous methods besides the Debus method. Many of these syntheses can also be applied to substituted imidazoles by varying the functional groups on the reactants. These methods are commonly categorized by the number of reacting components. ;One component The (1,5) or (3,4) bond can be formed by the reaction of an imidate and an Œ±-aminoaldehyde or Œ±-aminoacetal. The example below applies to imidazole when R1 = R2 = hydrogen. ::Formation of one bond ;Two component The (1,2) and (2,3) bonds can be formed by treating a 1,2-diaminoalkane, at high temperatures, with an alcohol, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. A dehydrogenating catalyst, such as platinum on alumina, is required. :Formation of two bonds The (1,2) and (3,4) bonds can also be formed from N-substituted Œ±-aminoketones and formamide with heat. The product will be a 1,4-disubstituted imidazole, but here since R1 = R2 = hydrogen, imidazole itself is the product. The yield of this reaction is moderate, but it seems to be the most effective method of making the 1,4 substitution. ::Formation of three bonds ;Three component This method proceeds in good yields for substituted imidazoles. An adaptation of the Debus method, it is called the Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis. The starting materials are substituted glyoxal, aldehyde, amine, and ammonia or an ammonium salt. :Arduengo imidazoles ;Formation from other heterocycles Imidazole can be synthesized by the photolysis of 1-vinyltetrazole. This reaction will give substantial yields only if the 1-vinyltetrazole is made efficiently from an organotin compound, such as 2-tributylstannyltetrazole. The reaction, shown below, produces imidazole when R1 = R2 = R3 = hydrogen. :500px Imidazole can also be formed in a vapor-phase reaction. The reaction occurs with formamide, ethylenediamine, and hydrogen over platinum on alumina, and it must take place between 340 and 480 ¬∞C. This forms a very pure imidazole product. ;Van Leusen reaction The Van Leusen reaction can also be employed to form imidazoles starting from TosMIC and an aldimine. The Van Leusen Imidazole Synthesis allows the preparation of imidazoles from aldimines by reaction with tosylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC). The reaction has later been expanded to a two-step synthesis in which the aldimine is generated in situ: the Van Leusen Three-Component Reaction (vL-3CR). Biological significance and applications Imidazole is incorporated into many important biological compounds. The most pervasive is the amino acid histidine, which has an imidazole side-chain. Histidine is present in many proteins and enzymes and plays a vital part in the structure and binding functions of hemoglobin. Imidazole-based histidine compounds play a very important role in intracellular buffering. Histidine can be decarboxylated to histamine, which is also a common biological compound. Histamine can cause urticaria (hives) when it is produced during allergic reaction. The relationship between histidine and histamine is shown below: :none One of the applications of imidazole is in the purification of His-tagged proteins in immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Imidazole is used to elute tagged proteins bound to nickel ions attached to the surface of beads in the chromatography column. An excess of imidazole is passed through the column, which displaces the His-tag from nickel coordination, freeing the His-tagged proteins. Imidazole has become an important part of many pharmaceuticals. Synthetic imidazoles are present in many fungicides and antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antihypertensive medications. Imidazole is part of the theophylline molecule, found in tea leaves and coffee beans, that stimulates the central nervous system. It is present in the anticancer medication mercaptopurine, which combats leukemia by interfering with DNA activities. A number of substituted imidazoles, including clotrimazole, are selective inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, which makes them interesting drug targets in inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and tumors of the nervous system. Other biological activities of the imidazole pharmacophore relate to the downregulation of intracellular Ca2+ and K+ fluxes, and interference with translation initiation. Pharmaceutical derivatives The substituted imidazole derivatives are valuable in treatment of many systemic fungal infections. Imidazoles belong to the class of azole antifungals, which includes ketoconazole, miconazole, and clotrimazole. For comparison, another group of azoles is the triazoles, which includes fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole. The difference between the imidazoles and the triazoles involves the mechanism of inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme. The N3 of the imidazole compound binds to the heme iron atom of ferric cytochrome P450, whereas the N4 of the triazoles bind to the heme group. The triazoles have been shown to have a higher specificity for the cytochrome P450 than imidazoles, thereby making them more potent than the imidazoles. Some imidazole derivatives show effects on insects, for example sulconazole nitrate exhibits a strong anti-feeding effect on the keratin-digesting Australian carpet beetle larvae Anthrenocerus australis, as does econazole nitrate with the common clothes moth Tineola bisselliella. Industrial applications Imidazole itself has few direct applications. It is instead a precursor to a variety of agrichemicals, including enilconazole, climbazole, clotrimazole, prochloraz, and bifonazole. Prochloraz is one of several imidazole-derived agrichemicals. Salts of imidazole Simple imidazolium cation Salts of imidazole where the imidazole ring is the cation are known as imidazolium salts (for example, imidazolium chloride or nitrate). These salts are formed from the protonation or substitution at nitrogen of imidazole. These salts have been used as ionic liquids and precursors to stable carbenes. Salts where a deprotonated imidazole is an anion are also well known; these salts are known as imidazolates (for example, sodium imidazolate, NaC3H3N2).

Proposed structure of an imidazolium-based ionic liquid. An ionic liquid (IL) is a salt in the liquid state. In some contexts, the term has been restricted to salts whose melting point is below some arbitrary temperature, such as . While ordinary liquids such as water and gasoline are predominantly made of electrically neutral molecules, ionic liquids are largely made of ions and short-lived ion pairs. These substances are variously called liquid electrolytes, ionic melts, ionic fluids, fused salts, liquid salts, or ionic glasses. Ionic liquids have many potential applications. They are powerful solvents and can be used as electrolytes. Salts that are liquid at near- ambient temperature are important for electric battery applications, and have been considered as sealants due to their very low vapor pressure. Any salt that melts without decomposing or vaporizing usually yields an ionic liquid. Sodium chloride (NaCl), for example, melts at into a liquid that consists largely of sodium cations () and chloride anions (). Conversely, when an ionic liquid is cooled, it often forms an ionic solid--which may be either crystalline or glassy. The ionic bond is usually stronger than the Van der Waals forces between the molecules of ordinary liquids. For that reason, common salts tend to melt at higher temperatures than other solid molecules. Some salts are liquid at or below room temperature. Examples include compounds based on the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMIM) cation and include: EMIM:Cl, EMIM dicyanamide, ()()¬∑, that melts at ; and 1-butyl-3,5-dimethylpyridinium bromide which becomes a glass below . Low-temperature ionic liquids can be compared to ionic solutions, liquids that contain both ions and neutral molecules, and in particular to the so-called deep eutectic solvents, mixtures of ionic and non-ionic solid substances which have much lower melting points than the pure compounds. Certain mixtures of nitrate salts can have melting points below 100 ¬∞C.Mixture of nitrate salts with m.p. below 100 deg C The term \\"ionic liquid\\" in the general sense was used as early as 1943. History The discovery date of the \\"first\\" ionic liquid is disputed, along with the identity of its discoverer. Ethanolammonium nitrate (m.p. 52‚Äì55 ¬∞C) was reported in 1888 by S. Gabriel and J. Weiner. One of the earliest truly room temperature ionic liquids was ethylammonium nitrate ()¬∑ (m.p. 12 ¬∞C), reported in 1914 by Paul Walden.Paul Walden (1914), Bull. Acad. Sci. St. Petersburg, pages 405-422. In the 1970s and 1980s, ionic liquids based on alkyl-substituted imidazolium and pyridinium cations, with halide or tetrahalogenoaluminate anions, were developed as potential electrolytes in batteries. For the imidazolium halogenoaluminate salts, their physical properties--such as viscosity, melting point, and acidity--could be adjusted by changing the alkyl substituents and the imidazolium/pyridinium and halide/halogenoaluminate ratios. Two major drawbacks for some applications were moisture sensitivity and acidity or basicity. In 1992, Wilkes and Zawarotko obtained ionic liquids with 'neutral' weakly coordinating anions such as hexafluorophosphate () and tetrafluoroborate (), allowing a much wider range of applications. Although many classical ILs are hexafluorophosphate and tetrafluoroborate salts, bistriflimide are also popular. Characteristics Ionic liquids are often moderate to poor conductors of electricity, non- ionizing, highly viscous and frequently exhibit low vapor pressure. Their other properties are diverse: many have low combustibility, are thermally stable, with wide liquid regions, and favorable solvating properties for a range of polar and non-polar compounds. Many classes of chemical reactions, such as Diels-Alder reactions and Friedel-Crafts reactions, can be performed using ionic liquids as solvents. ILs can serve as solvents for biocatalysis. The miscibility of ionic liquids with water or organic solvents varies with side chain lengths on the cation and with choice of anion. They can be functionalized to act as acids, bases, or ligands, and are precursors salts in the preparation of stable carbenes. They have been found to hydrolyse. Because of their distinctive properties, ionic liquids have been investigated for many applications. Cations commonly found in ionic liquids Some ionic liquids can be distilled under vacuum conditions at temperatures near 300 ¬∞C. In the original work by Martyn Earle, et al., the authors wrongly concluded that the vapor was made up of individual, separated ions, but was later proven that the vapors formed consisted of ion pairs. Some ionic liquids (such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate) generate flammable gases on thermal decomposition. Thermal stability and melting point depend on the liquid's components. The thermal stability of a task-specific ionic liquid, protonated betaine bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide is of about and N-butyl-N-methyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide was thermally stable up to 640 K.Ch. Jagadeeswara Rao, R. Venkata krishnan, K. A. Venkatesan, K. Nagarajan, 332 - 334, Feb. 4-6, Sixteenth national symposium on thermal analysis(Thermans 2008) The upper limits of thermal stability of ionic liquids reported in the literature are usually based upon fast (about 10 K/min) TGA scans, and they do not imply long-term (several hours) thermal stability of ionic liquids, which is limited to less than 500 K for most ionic liquids. The solubility properties of ILs are diverse. Saturated aliphatic compounds are generally only sparingly soluble in ionic liquids, whereas alkenes show somewhat greater solubility, and aldehydes can be completely miscible. Solubility differences can be exploited in biphasic catalysis, such as hydrogenation and hydrocarbonylation processes, allowing for relatively easy separation of products and/or unreacted substrate(s). Gas solubility follows the same trend, with carbon dioxide gas showing good solubility in many ionic liquids. Carbon monoxide is less soluble in ionic liquids than in many popular organic solvents, and hydrogen is only slightly soluble (similar to the solubility in water) and may vary relatively little between the more common ionic liquids. Room-temperature varieties Table salt NaCl and ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide at 27 ¬∞–° Room- temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) consist of bulky and asymmetric organic cations such as 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium, 1-alkylpyridinium, N-methyl-N- alkylpyrrolidinium and ammonium ions. Phosphonium cations are less common, but offer some advantageous properties., https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225089857_Phosphonium- Based_Ionic_Liquids_An_Overview A wide range of anions are employed, ranging from simple halides, which generally suffer high melting points, to inorganic anions such as tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate, and to large organic anions like bistriflimide, triflate or tosylate. There are also many potential uses of ionic liquids with simple non-halogenated organic anions such as formate, alkylsulfate, alkylphosphate or glycolate. The melting point of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate is about and it is a colorless liquid with high viscosity at room temperature. If a highly asymmetric cation is combined with a highly asymmetric anion, formed ionic liquid may not freeze down to very low temperatures (down to ‚àí150 ¬∞C), and the glass transition temperature was detected below ‚àí100 ¬∞C in the case of ionic liquids with N-methyl-N-alkylpyrrolidinium cations and fluorosulfonyl- trifluoromethanesulfonylimide (FTFSI). Water is a common impurity in ionic liquids, as it can be absorbed from the atmosphere and influences the transport properties of RTILs, even at relatively low concentrations. In many synthetic processes using transition-metal catalysts, metal nanoparticles play an important role as the actual catalyst or as a catalyst reservoir. ILs are an appealing medium for the formation and stabilization of catalytically active transition metal nanoparticles. More importantly, ILs can be made that incorporate coordinating groups, for example, with nitrile groups on either the cation or anion (CN-IL). In various C-C coupling reactions catalyzed by a palladium catalyst, it has been found that palladium nanoparticles are better stabilized in CN-IL compared to non-functionalized ionic liquids; thus enhanced catalytic activity and recyclability are realized. Low-temperature varieties Low-temperature ionic liquids (below 130 K) have been proposed as the fluid base for an extremely large diameter spinning liquid-mirror telescope to be based on the Moon. Low temperature is advantageous in imaging long-wave infrared light, which is the form of light (extremely red-shifted) that arrives from the most distant parts of the visible universe. Such a liquid base would be covered by a thin metallic film that forms the reflective surface. Low volatility is important in lunar vacuum conditions to prevent evaporation. Protic ionic liquids Protic ionic liquids are formed via a proton transfer from an acid to a base. In contrast to other ionic liquids, which generally are formed through a sequence of synthesis steps, protic ionic liquids can be created more easily by simply mixing the acid and base. Poly(ionic liquid)s Polymerized ionic liquids, poly(ionic liquid)s or polymeric ionic liquids, all abbreviated as PIL is the polymeric form of ionic liquids. They have half of the ionicity of ionic liquids since one ion is fixed as the polymer moiety to form a polymeric chain. PILs have a similar range of applications, comparable with those of ionic liquids but the polymer architecture provides a better chance for controlling the ionic conductivity. They have extended the applications of ionic liquids for designing smart materials or solid electrolytes.Ionic Liquid Devices, Editor: Ali Eftekhari, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2018, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-78801-183-9Polymerized Ionic Liquids, Editor: Ali Eftekhari, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2018, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-78801-053-5  Magnetic ionic liquids  Magnetic ionic liquids can be synthesized by incorporating paramagnetic elements into ionic liquid molecules. One example is 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroferrate. Commercial applications Many applications have been considered, some commercialized briefly, and others remain under development. Organic synthesis A liquid tetraalkylphosphonium iodide is a solvent for tributyltin iodide, which functions as a catalyst to rearrange the monoepoxide of butadiene. This process was commercialized as a route to 2,5-dihydrofuran, but later discontinued.G. Wytze Meindersma, Matthias Maase and Andr√© B. Haan \\"Ionic Liquids\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2007, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Pharmaceuticals Recognizing that approximately 50% of commercial pharmaceuticals are organic salts, ionic liquid forms of a number of pharmaceuticals have been investigated. Combining a pharmaceutically active cation with a pharmaceutically active anion leads to a Dual Active ionic liquid in which the actions of two drugs are combined. ILs can extract specific compounds from plants for pharmaceutical, nutritional and cosmetic applications, such as the antimalarial drug artemisinin from the plant Artemisia annua. Cellulose processing The dissolution of cellulose by ILs has attracted interest. A patent application from 1930 showed that 1-alkylpyridinium chlorides dissolve cellulose.Charles Graenacher, Manufacture and Application of New Cellulose Solutions and Cellulose Derivatives Produced therefrom, US 1934/1943176. Following in the footsteps of the lyocell process, which uses hydrated N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide, as a non-aqueous solvent for the dissolution of the pulp and paper. The dissolution of cellulose-based materials like tissue paper waste, generated in chemical industries and at research laboratories, in room temperature IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, bmimCl and the recovery of valuable compounds by electrodeposition from this cellulose matrix was studied. The \\"valorization\\" of cellulose, i.e. its conversion to more valuable chemicals, has been achieved by the use of ionic liquids. Representative products are glucose esters, sorbitol, and alkylgycosides. IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride dissolves freeze dried banana pulp and with an additional 15% dimethyl sulfoxide, lends itself to Carbon-13 NMR analysis. In this way the entire complex of starch, sucrose, glucose, and fructose can be monitored as a function of banana ripening. Nuclear fuel reprocessing The IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride has been investigated for the recovery of uranium and other metals from spent nuclear fuel and other sources.P. Giridhar, K.A. Venkatesan, T.G. Srinivasan and P.R. Vasudeva Rao (2007), Electrochemical behavior of uranium(VI) in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and thermal characterization of uranium oxide deposit, Electrochimica Acta, Volume 52, Issue 9, Pages 3006-3012, Protonated betaine bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide has been investigated as a solvent for uranium oxides. Ionic liquids, N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and N-methyl-N-propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, have been investigated for the electrodeposition of europium and uranium metals respectively.Ch. Jagadeeswara Rao, K.A. Venkatesan, K. Nagarajan, T.G. Srinivasan and P. R. Vasudeva Rao, Electrodeposition of metallic uranium at near ambient conditions from room temperature ionic liquid, Journal of Nuclear Materials, 408 (2011) 25‚Äì29. Solar thermal energy ILs are potential heat transfer and storage media in solar thermal energy systems. Concentrating solar thermal facilities such as parabolic troughs and solar power towers focus the sun's energy onto a receiver, which can generate temperatures of around . This heat can then generate electricity in a steam or other cycle. For buffering during cloudy periods or to enable generation overnight, energy can be stored by heating an intermediate fluid. Although nitrate salts have been the medium of choice since the early 1980s, they freeze at and thus require heating to prevent solidification. Ionic liquids such as [] have more favorable liquid-phase temperature ranges (-75 to 459 ¬∞C) and could therefore be excellent liquid thermal storage media and heat transfer fluids. Waste recycling ILs can aid the recycling of synthetic goods, plastics, and metals. They offer the specificity required to separate similar compounds from each other, such as separating polymers in plastic waste streams. This has been achieved using lower temperature extraction processes than current approaches and could help avoid incinerating plastics or dumping them in landfill. Batteries ILs can replace water as the electrolyte in metal-air batteries. ILs are attractive because of their low vapor pressure, increasing battery life by drying more slowly. Furthermore, ILs have an electrochemical window of up to six volts (versus 1.23 for water) supporting more energy-dense metals. Energy densities from 900-1600 watt-hours per kilogram appear possible. Dispersing agent ILs can act as dispersing agents in paints to enhance finish, appearance and drying properties.Examples are the TEGO brand dispersers by Evonik, used in their Pliolite brand paints. ILs are used for dispersing nanomaterials at IOLITEC. Carbon capture ILs and amines have been investigated for capturing carbon dioxide and purifying natural gas.C&E; News  Tribology  Some ionic liquids have been shown to reduce friction and wear in basic tribological testing, and their polar nature makes them candidate lubricants for tribotronic applications. While the comparatively high cost of ionic liquids currently prevents their use as neat lubricants, adding ionic liquids in concentrations as low as 0.5 wt% may significantly alter the lubricating performance of conventional base oils. Thus, the current focus of research is on using ionic liquids as additives to lubricating oils, often with the motivation to replace widely used, ecologically harmful lubricant additives. However, the claimed ecological advantage of ionic liquids has been questioned repeatedly and is yet to be demonstrated from a lifecycle perspective. Safety Ionic liquids' low volatility effectively eliminates a major pathway for environmental release and contamination. Ionic liquids' aquatic toxicity is as severe as or more so than many current solvents. Mortality isn't necessarily the most important metric for measuring impacts in aquatic environments, as sub-lethal concentrations change organisms' life histories in meaningful ways. Balancing VOC reductions against waterway spills (via waste ponds/streams, etc.) requires further research. Ionic liquids' substituent diversity simplifies the process of identifying compounds that meet safety requirements. Ultrasound can degrade solutions of imidazolium-based ionic liquids with hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid to relatively innocuous compounds. Despite low vapor pressure many ionic liquids are combustible and therefore require careful handling. Brief exposure (5 to 7 seconds) to a flame torch can ignite some Ionic liquids. Complete combustion is possible for some Ionic liquids.

Hoppe ‚Äì 2000 Views of different madhabs can vary significantly regarding what is or is not haram.The Palgrave Handbook of Spirituality and Business ‚Äì p. 142, Professor Luk Bouckaert, Professor Laszlo Zsolnai ‚Äì 2011 Overview Actions that are haram result in harm one way or another and are therefore considered a sin if carried out by a Muslim. By bringing up the word \\"benefit\\" as an opposite to \\"sin\\" verse 2:219 of the Quran clarifies that haram is that which is harmful. In fact, everything becomes meaningful with their opposite; e.g. if there is no cold we never understand what heat is. So sin is that which hurts us. When God says \\"Do not\\", he means \\"do not hurt yourself\\". An Islamic principle related to haram is that if something is prohibited or forbidden, then anything that leads to it is also considered a haram act. A similar principle is that the sin of haram is not limited to the person who engages in the prohibited activity, but the sin also extends to others who support the person in the activity, whether it be material or moral support. The five categories of , al- æA·∏•kƒÅm al-·∏¥amsa or the hierarchy of acts from permitted to non- permitted are: # (far·∏ç/) ‚Äì \\"Compulsory\\"/\\"duty\\" # () ‚Äì Recommended, \\"desirable\\" # () ‚Äì Neutral, \\"permissible\\" # () ‚Äì Disliked, \\"discouraged\\" # () ‚Äì Sinful, \\"prohibited\\" The two types of haram are: # () ‚Äì Prohibited because of its essence and harm it causes to an individual #* Adultery, murder, theft # () ‚Äì Prohibited because of external reasons that are not fundamentally harmful but are associated to something that is prohibited #* Ill-gotten wealth obtained through sin. Examples include money earned through cheating, stealing, corruption, murder, and Interest or any means that involve harm to another human being. Also, a deal or sale during Friday's prayers salat al-jumu'ah. It is prohibited in Islam for a Muslim to profit from such haram actions. Any believer who benefits from or lives off wealth obtained through haram is a sinner. #* Prayer in a house taken illegally. The religious term haram, based on the Quran, is applied to: * Actions, such as cursing, fornication, murder, and disrespecting your parents. * Policies, such as riba (usury, interest). * Certain food and drink, such as pork and alcohol. * Some ·∏•alƒÅl objects, foods or actions that are normally halal but under some conditions become haram. For example, halal food and drinks at noon-time during Ramadan or a cow or another halal animal that is not slaughtered in the Islamic way and in the name of Allah (God). * Certain inaction, such as abandoning the salah.  Culture  Linguistically, the root of the term haram [compare Ancient Hebrew herem, meaning 'devoted to God', 'forbidden for profane use'] is used to form a wide range of other terms that have legal implications, such as hariim (a harem) and ihraam (a state of purity). In addition, the same word (haram) is used in the Quran to denote the sacred nature of the Ka'ba and the areas of Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem. This category of sacred, holy, and inviolable also includes spouses and university campuses. As such, the legal use of the root ÿ≠-ÿ±-ŸÖ is based on an idea of boundaries between the profane and the sacred, as opposed to prohibitions, as is normally assumed. Colloquially, the word haram takes on different meanings and operates more closely as a dichotomy with halal, which denotes the permissible. In Arabic-speaking countries, saying \\"haram\\" can mean 'what a shame' or 'what a pity' (this meaning has been adopted by Modern Hebrew slang as well, and is alike to the Italian use of peccato). The term can be used formally as a method for chastising strangers who behave inappropriately, or between friends as a form of teasing. The word is also used to instruct children in how to behave by telling them that harming other children or animals is haram, among other things. The binary concepts of halal and haram are used in a number of cultural phrases, most notably ibn (boy) al-halal and bint (girl) al-halal. These phrases are often used to refer to appropriate spouses in marriage, and stand in contrast to ibn al-haram or bint al-haram, which are used as insults. In this case, the term haram is used to mean ill-mannered or indecent, instead of strictly meaning 'unlawful'. Halal and haram are also used in regards to money (mal). Mal al- haram means ill-gotten money, and brings destruction on those who make their living through such means. These cultural interpretations of what is haram influence and are influenced by the legal definitions used at the local level. This means that popular conceptions of haram are partly based on formal Islamic Jurisprudence and partly on regional culture, and the popular conceptions in turn change how the legal system defines and punishes haram actions. Forbidden categories of action Food and intoxicants In Islam, prohibitions on illegal acts or objects are observed by Muslims in accordance to their obedience to the Quranic commands. In Islamic law, dietary prohibitions are said to help with the understanding of divine will. Regarding haram meat, Muslims are prohibited from consuming flowing blood. Meats that are considered haram, such as pork, dog, cat, monkey, or any other haram animals, can only be considered lawful in emergencies when a person is facing starvation and his life has to be saved through the consumption of this meat. However, necessity does not exist if the society possesses excess food. Haram foods do not become permissible when a person is in a society with excess food because the Islamic community is like a single body supporting its members, and should offer halal foods to the fellow Muslim. Certain meats are deemed haram if the animal is not properly slaughtered. A halal slaughter involves a sharp knife that the animal does not see before it is slaughtered; the animal must be well rested and fed before the slaughtering, and the slaughtering may not take place in front of other animals. This preparation is done in order to serve the Muslim population. The proper slaughtering process involves a single cut across the throat, quick and as painless for the animal as possible. During the slaughtering process, Allah's name should be recited, by saying \\"Bismillah\\" in order to take the animal's life to meet the lawful need of food. Animals that are slaughtered in a name other than Allah are prohibited because this goes against the belief in the oneness of Allah. There are a number of Quranic verses regarding the prohibition of meat in Islam: Alcoholic intoxicants are prohibited in Islam. Khamr is the Arabic word for alcoholic drinks that cause intoxication. According to Salafi theologians and their puritanical interpretations, the Prophet declared that the prohibition was not only placed on wine, but the prohibition also included beer and other alcoholic beverages that intoxicate a person. The Prophet also forbade the trading of these intoxicants, even with non-Muslims. It is not permissible for a Muslim to import or export alcoholic beverages, or to work in or own a place that sells these intoxicants. Giving intoxicants as a gift is also considered haram. Other intoxicants, such as tobacco, paan, dokha, and khat have been deemed forbidden by some scholars. Regarding foods vanilla extract and gelatin and some soy sauce are also forbidden either due to being an intoxicant themselves, containing certain percentages of alcohol or other forbidden items such as pig parts. There are also a number of hadith regarding the prohibition of meat and intoxicants in Islam: In an incident narrated by Rafi ibn Khadij, Muhammad told Muslims who wanted to slaughter some animals using reeds, Marriage and family life Islam is very strict in prohibiting zina, whether it be adultery or sexual intercourse between two unmarried individuals. Zina is considered to lead to confusion of lineage, leniency in morals, the disconnection among families, and unstable relationships. It is also considered haram to look at members of the opposite sex with desire. There are Quranic verses on the prohibition of fornication: In terms of marriage proposals, it is considered haram for a Muslim man to propose to a divorced or widowed woman during her Iddah (the waiting period during which she is not allowed to marry again). The man is able to express his desire for marriage, but cannot execute an actual proposal. It is also forbidden for a Muslim man to propose to a woman who is engaged to another man. It is considered haram for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man. This is due to the idea that the man is the head of the household, the one who supports the family, and the man is considered responsible for his wife. Muslims do not believe in giving women to the hands of those who do not practice Islam and having them responsible over Muslim women because they are not concerned with protecting the rites of the religion. Divorce According to Yusuf Al- Qaradawi, implementing a divorce during a woman's menstrual period is prohibited because during such a period, sexual relations are considered haram, so it is possible that the idea of divorce came to a man's mind due to sexual frustration or nervous tension. It is also not considered permissible for a Muslim to take an oath of divorce, which involves stating that if a particular event does not occur, then there will be a divorce. This also includes threatening a spouse if they do not do something, then they will be divorced. According to the shariah, the most suitable time for a divorce is when the woman is clean following her menstrual period. Business ethics Riba, any excessive addition over and above the principal, such as usury and interest, is prohibited in Islam in all forms. Interest goes against the Islamic pillar of Zakat which allows wealth to flow from the rich to the poor. Riba is prohibited because it keeps wealth in the hands of the wealthy and keeps it away from the poor. It is also believed that riba makes a man selfish and greedy.. All business and trade practices that do not result in free and fair exchange of goods and services are considered haram, such as bribery, stealing, and gambling. Therefore, all forms of deceit and dishonesty in business are prohibited in Islam. There are a number of Quranic verses that relate to the prohibition of unethical business practices: Inheritance It is considered haram for a father to deprive his children of an inheritance. It is also haram for a father to deprive the females or the children of a wife who is not favourable to him an inheritance. Additionally, it is haram for one relative to deprive another relative of his inheritance through tricks. Clothing and adornment In Islam, both gold adornments and silk cloths are prohibited for men to wear, but are permissible for women as long as they are not used to sexually attract men (other than their husbands). The prohibition of these adornments is part of a broader Islamic principle of avoiding luxurious lifestyles. It is considered haram for both men and women to wear clothing that fails to cover the body properly (which stated in clothing guidance, the term \\"aurat/awrah\\") and clothes that are transparent. Additionally, Islam prohibits excess beautifying that involves the altering of one's physical appearance. Physical alterations that are considered haram such as tattoos, shortening of teeth, cosmetic surgery etc. Islam also prohibits the use of gold and silver utensils and pure silk spreads in the household in order to avoid luxurious lifestyles in the home. Statues are also prohibited in homes, and Muslims are prohibited from participating in making statues because of the idea of negating the Oneness of God. Shirk It is considered a sin for a Muslim to worship anyone other than God, which is known as shirk. The following is a Quranic verse on shirk: The following is a Hadith relating to the practice of shirk: See also * Outline of Islam * Glossary of Islam * Index of Islam-related articles * Ahkam * Al-Jamia, Shi ªah text which contains all the details of haram things. * Christian dietary laws * ·∏§-R-M (triconsonantal root of these words in Arabic) * Halal * Haram (site) (linguistically related Arabic word for \\"protected place\\") * Kashrut, Jewish dietary rules * Makruh * Mitzvah in Judaism incorporates similar notions * Sharia * Treif, the Yiddish word for non-kosher * Taboo * Word of Wisdom, the LDS dietary rules * Ja'fari jurisprudence References External links * Laws of Islam concerning food Category:Arabic words and phrases in Sharia Category:Islamic terminology Category:Sharia legal terminology ","title":"Haram"},{"id":"1117304","text":"Haupapa / Tasman Glacier. is the largest glacier in New Zealand, and one of several large glaciers which flow south and east towards the Mackenzie Basin from the Southern Alps in New Zealand's South Island. Geography At in length, Tasman Glacier is still New Zealand's longest glacier, despite shrinking considerably from the 1990s onwards. It is as much as wide and thick, and lies entirely within the borders of Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park. The glacier covers an area of and starts at a height of above sea level. Snowfall during the winter and spring seasons may accumulate up to . After the summer melt, may remain in the high altitude glacier head. Lower Tasman Glacier The Tasman flows south west from Hochstetter Dome and Mount Elie De Beaumont alongside the southern slopes of the Minarets peak and south along the eastern flank of New Zealand's two highest mountains, Mount Tasman and its higher southern neighbour Aoraki / Mount Cook. Although its upper reaches are snow-covered, rocks carried by the glacier are exposed by ablation along its course, and the lower glacier is entirely rock-covered. The rock cover helps insulate the ice from the sunlight and slows down the melting process. Tributaries in the lower parts are the Rudolf Glacier, Forrest Ross Glacier, Kaufmann Glacier, Haast Glacier, Hochstetter Glacier, and Ball Glacier. The glacial terminal lake is met by the meltwater of the Murchison Glacier, which approaches from the northeast and flows alongside the Tasman Glacier outside the moraine wall. The waters of Tasman Lake flow into the Tasman River and flow south joining the Hooker River draining the proglacial lakes on the Hooker and Mueller Glaciers. The Tasman River exhibits a braided characteristic, and flows south into Lake Pukaki. They eventually flow into the Waitaki River and to the Pacific Ocean north of Oamaru. Recent retreat Mueller, Hooker and Tasman Glaciers in the Southern Alps, showing major retreat in the ~10 years circa 1990 to 2000. Notice the larger terminal lakes, the retreat of the white ice (ice free of moraine cover, high up on the glaciers), and (more subtly) the increase in height of the moraine walls due to ice thinning. The glacier remained at a constant in length for all of its recorded history in the 20th century before starting its current period of rapid melting in the 1990s. Between 2000 and 2008 alone, the glacier terminus receded 3.7 km. Since the 1990s the terminus has retreated about a year on average. The glacier is now in a period of faster retreat where the rate of retreat is calculated to be between each year. It is estimated that the Tasman Glacier will eventually disappear and the terminal Tasman Lake will reach a maximum size in 10 to 19 years time. In 1973 Tasman Glacier had no terminal lake and by 2008 Tasman Lake was long, wide, and deep. A large calving event was possibly triggered, or at least contributed to, by the 2011 Christchurch earthquake on 22 February 2011. On this day 30 to 40 million metric tons (33 to 44 million short tons) of ice dropped from the terminal face of the Tasman Glacier and fell into the Tasman Lake. Boats were hit with tsunami waves of up to as the ice fell into the Tasman Lake under the glacier. Similar events in the past have been attributed to buoyancy effects, a result of high basal water pressures and increased lake level following heavy rainfall events. Access and tourism Tasman Glacier terminal face Tasman Glacier has a long history of tourism, with heli skiing tours offered on the upper glacier since the early 1970s. The tributary Ball Glacier was also popular for skiing, with national championships being held there in the 1930s. It has since diminished too far to be safely accessed. Similarly, Tasman Glacier's significant ice loss over the past decades has impacted tourism, with an increasing number of crevasses being exposed and not filled in by snow any more, requiring guided tours to avoid these areas, and restricting the heli skiing season to July, August and September. The proglacial Tasman Lake is a popular destination for boat tours among the icebergs often floating in the lake. Boats are not allowed closer than to the tall terminal face of Tasman Glacier for safety reasons. The Ball Shelter Track, part of the Ball Hut Route, leads along the western side of the glacier, separated from Tasman Lake by a tall moraine wall until about 6 kilometres in, where it climbs high enough for the view to open up. At that point, the rock-covered lower Tasman Glacier in the valley between the moraine walls is wide.

Being situated inside a National Park, it is not possible to own property in Mount Cook Village; however, because of the year-round operation of the hotel and motels, the village has a small permanent population of around 250. All buildings and facilities operate on concessions and leases from the government. The village has no grocery stores apart from a small in-hotel convenience store. The nearest supermarket is away in Twizel, the closest town. There is a self-service petrol pump behind the hotel complex; however, the fuel price reflects the remote location. Mount Cook Village operates a small school with a roll as low as a dozen children, the only school in New Zealand inside a national park. Tourism Mount Cook Village caters to a steady flow of around 250,000 visitors per year\\"Aoraki / Mount Cook Village: Long-term Community Plan\\", Department of Conservation with a wide range of facilities and accommodation. An international style hotel, The Hermitage,\\"The Hermitage\\" official website the name of which dates back to the original hotel built in 1884, is the only prominent larger building in the village and a popular location, especially for international tourists. The Hermitage is sometimes used as an alternative name for the settlement. The hotel also owns and operates chalets and a lodge & motel with options ranging from backpacker accommodation through to family units. There are two more motels in the village, and a total of four restaurants or pubs, two of which are inside the main hotel complex. The buildings and motel units are connected via paved footpaths. The small White Horse Hill camping ground is located about outside the village, connected via a walking track. Commercial operations run guided walks, 4WD safaris, boating on the Tasman glacier lake, horse treks, fishing, and scenic flights including landing on the glaciers. These are based at the hotel, departing and returning to the hotel's main entrance. A number of nearby walks and climbs ranging from 10 minute bush walks to multi-day tramping tracks and routes can be explored from Mount Cook Village. There are three short walking tracks through forest areas within the village and on its outskirts, as well as the starting points of longer walking tracks ranging from the popular and easy Hooker Valley Track to more strenuous walks such as the steep track to Sealy Tarns.

The 1960s and 1970s saw significant extensions to the hotel and Mount Cook Village, including water mains, sewerage treatment, local streets, and the sealing of State Highway 80, which greatly improved access. A local fire brigade was established in 1976. The official name of the settlement was amended to become a dual name, Aoraki / Mount Cook, by the NgƒÅi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.

Actual celluloid (consisting of cellulose nitrate and camphor) was used during the first half of the 20th century, but since it was flammable and dimensionally unstable it was largely replaced by cellulose acetate. With the advent of computer-assisted animation production, the use of cels has been all but abandoned in major productions. Disney studios stopped using cels in 1990 when Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) replaced this element in their animation process, and in the next decade and a half, the other major animation studios phased cels out as well.  Technique  Painting with acrylic paint on the reverse side of an already inked cel. Generally, the characters are drawn on cels and laid over a static background drawing. This reduces the number of times an image has to be redrawn and enables studios to split up the production process to different specialised teams. Using this assembly line way to animate has made it possible to produce films much more cost-effectively. The invention of the technique is generally attributed to Earl Hurd, who patented the process in 1914. The outline of the images are drawn on the front of the cel while colors are painted on the back to eliminate brushstrokes. Traditionally, the outlines were hand-inked but since the 1960s they are almost exclusively xerographed on. Another important breakthrough in cel animation was the development of the Animation Photo Transfer Process, first seen in The Black Cauldron, released in 1985. Typically, an animated feature would require over 100,000 hand- painted cels.  Collector's items  Production cels were sometimes sold after the animation process completed. More popular shows and movies demanded higher prices for the cels, with some selling for thousands of dollars. Some cels are not used for actual production work, but may be a \\"special\\" or \\"limited edition\\" version of the artwork, sometimes even printed (\\"lithographed\\") instead of hand-painted. These normally do not fetch as high a price as original \\"under-the-camera\\" cels, which are true collector's items. Some unique cels have fetched record prices at art auctions. For example, a large \\"pan\\" cel depicting numerous characters from the finale of Who Framed Roger Rabbit sold for $50,600 at Sotheby's in 1989, including its original background. Disney Stores sold production cels from The Little Mermaid (their last film to use cels) at prices from $2,500 to $3,500, without the original backgrounds.

Common names include common bird's-foot trefoil, eggs and bacon, birdsfoot deervetch, and just bird's-foot trefoil, though the latter name is often also applied to other members of the genus. It is a perennial herbaceous plant, similar in appearance to some clovers. The name 'bird's foot' refers to the appearance of the seed pods on their stalk. Five leaflets are present, but with the central three held conspicuously above the others, hence the use of the name 'trefoil'. It is often used as forage and is widely used as food for livestock due to its nonbloating properties. Description The height of the plant is variable, from , occasionally more where supported by other plants; the stems can reach up to long. It is typically sprawling at the height of the surrounding grassland. It can survive fairly close grazing, trampling, and mowing. It is most often found in sandy soils. It flowers from June to September. The flowers develop into small pea-like pods or legumes. The plant had many common English names in Britain, which are now mostly out of use. These names were often connected with the yellow and orange colour of the flowers, e.g. 'butter and eggs'. One name that is still used is eggs and bacon (or bacon and eggs).Collins English Dictionary Lotus corniculatus flowers in southeastern Minnesota (late July 2016) Distribution and habitat Lotus corniculatus has a broad distribution worldwide.

It may be used as an alternative to alfalfa in poor soils. A double-flowered variety is grown as an ornamental plant. It is regularly included as a component of wildflower mixes in Europe. It can also prevent soil erosion and provide a good habitat for wildlife. Fresh bird's-foot trefoil contains cyanogenic glycosides, which release small amounts of hydrogen cyanide when macerated. This is not normally poisonous to humans, though, as the dose is very low, and the metabolization of cyanide is relatively quick. Condensed tannins are also present in L. corniculatus, which has been known to increase the protein absorption of the small intestine.http://www.grassland.org.nz/publications/nzgrassland_publication_492.pdf Used in an infusion to avoid the creation of hydrogen cyanide, this plant can be used as a sedative  Medicine uses  The flowers are used mainly as a sedative and for other aspects of the nervous and cardiac systems. They have an antispasmodic effect on the digestive tract. In the Sannio region, Italy, the diluted infusions were used to calm anxiety, insomnia and exhaustion. Ecology The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees. In the Chicago Region, mostly non-native bees have been observed visiting the flowers, including Andrena wilkella, Anthidium oblongatum, Apis mellifera and Megachile rotundata. The native bees Bombus impatiens and Megachile relativa have also been observed visiting birdsfoot trefoil flowers, though the latter only rarely. The plant is an important nectar source for many insects and is also used as a larval food plant by many species of Lepidoptera such as six-spot burnet and the silver-studded blue. It is a host plant for the wood white butterfly, Leptidea sinapis.Clarke, S. A.; Green, D. G.; Joy, J.; Wollen, K.; Butler, I.

Invasive species Birdsfoot trefoil is an invasive species in many parts of North America and Australia. It has been commonly planted along roadsides for erosion control or pastures for forage and then spreads into natural areas. Once it has established in an area, it can outcompete native species. The use of prescribed fire is not an effective management tool against Lotus corniculatus and herbicide is recommended to control it.

Geography It lies in the southern sector of the central Catalan depression, near the zone watered by the Urgell canal. The high plateaus are covered by olive groves. The economy is agricultural, and Les Borges Blanques is a major producer of olives, in particular a variety known as arbequina which produces a highly prized oil. The cooperative movement has strong roots in the area. There is little or no tourist infrastructure. The municipality is split into two parts, separated by Juneda municipality, the bigger eastern part having almost all the population. The traditional symbol of this city is an ox, which appears on a widely used but unofficial coat of arms.

Its head is typically metal, attached perpendicularly to a longer handle, traditionally made of wood, occasionally metal, and increasingly fiberglass. A standard pickaxe, similar to a \\"pick mattock\\", has a pointed end on one side of its head and a broad flat \\"axe\\" blade opposite. A gradual curve characteristically spans the length of the head. The next most common configuration features two spikes, one slightly longer than the other. The pointed end is used both for breaking and prying, the axe for hoeing, skimming, and chopping through roots. Developed as agricultural tools in prehistoric times, picks have evolved into other tools such as the plough and the mattock. They also have been used in general construction and mining, and adapted to warfare. Etymology The Oxford Dictionary of English states that both \\"pick\\" and \\"pickaxe\\" have the same meaning, that being a tool with a long handle at right angles to a curved iron or steel bar with a point at one end and a chisel or point at the other, used for breaking up hard ground or rock. The term \\"pickaxe\\" is a folk etymology alteration of Middle-English picas via Anglo-French piceis, Old French pocois, and directly from Medieval Latin picosa \\"pick\\", related to Latin picus \\"woodpecker\\".< Though modern picks usually feature a head with both a pointed end and an adze-like flattened blade on the other end, current spelling is influenced by \\"axe\\", and \\"pickaxe\\", \\"pick-axe\\", or sometimes just \\"pick\\" cover any and all versions of the tool. History In prehistoric times a large shed deer antler from a suitable species (e.g. red deer) was often cut down to its shaft and its lowest tine and used as a one-pointed pick, and with it sometimes a large animal's shoulder blade as a crude shovel. During war in medieval times, the pickaxe was used as a weapon. As a weapon Illustration of pickaxe handles being combined with riot shields The historic pickaxe was readily adapted to a weapon for hand-to-hand combat in ancient times. Over the centuries aspects of it were incorporated in various battle axes. A pickaxe handle (sometimes called a \\"pickhandle\\" or \\"pick helve\\") is sometimes used on its own as a club for bludgeoning. In The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, pick handles were used against migrant farmers, and Georgia governor Lester Maddox famously threatened to use a similar, more slender axe handle to bar blacks from entering a \\"white\\" restaurant in the heated days of the American civil rights movement of the 1960s. A pick handle is officially used as a baton in the British Army. Pickaxes are commonly carried by Pioneer Sergeants in the British Army. A normal pickaxe handle is made of ash or hickory wood and is about three feet long and weighs about 2.5 pounds. British Army pickaxe handles must, by regulation, be exactly three feet long, for use in measuring in the field.

Traven. Originally published in German in 1926, and in English in 1934, it was Traven's first major success and is still the author's second best known work after The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Owing to its scathing criticism of bureaucratic authority, nationalism, and abusive labor practices, it is often described as an anarchist novel. Plot summary Set just after World War I, The Death Ship describes the predicament of merchant seamen who lack documentation of citizenship and cannot find legal residence or employment in any nation. The narrator is Gerard Gales, a US sailor who claims to be from New Orleans, and who is stranded in Antwerp without passport or working papers. Unable to prove his identity or his eligibility for employment, Gales is repeatedly arrested and deported from one country to the next, by government officials who do not want to be bothered with either assisting or prosecuting him. When he finally manages to find work, it is on the Yorikke, (possibly a reference to the Shakespeare play Hamlet) the dangerous and decrepit ship of the title, where undocumented workers from around the world are treated as expendable slaves. The term death ship refers to any boat so decrepit that it is worth more to its owners overinsured and sunk than it would be worth afloat. The title of the book is translated directly from the German Das Totenschiff; in English, they are called coffin ships. Publication history There are several versions of the novel: after the original German text (possibly written in English first) was translated in the United Kingdom, Traven wrote a slightly longer version in English. Just before the German version went to press, the publisher wrote to Traven asking for publicity information and photographs. The author replied: > My personal history would not be disappointing to readers, but it is my own > affair which I want to keep to myself. I am in fact in no way more important > than is the typesetter for my books, the man who works the mill; ... no more > important than the man who binds my books and the woman who wraps them and > the scrubwoman who cleans up the office.Nelson, Randy F.

Its 3,991 acres (1615 ha) cover Penn village and the hamlets of Beacon Hill, Penn Street, Knotty Green and Forty Green, plus Winchmore Hill. History The name is Brythonic in origin and comparable with the modern Welsh typonym pen, which may be translated as hill top or end. The village stands on a well- defined promontory of the Chiltern Hills. From the tower of Holy Trinity Parish Church, it is supposed to be possible to see into eight other counties. The parish also contains a beacon hill with a signal post on it. The Penn Family Segraves Manor, the principal seat in Penn, belonged to the Penn family. Sybil Penn, wife of David, was dry nurse and foster mother to King Edward VI and Lady of the Bed Chamber to his sister, Queen Elizabeth I. The Penn family of Penn were unrelated to William Penn (after whose father, Admiral Sir William Penn, Pennsylvania is named), whose family came from Wiltshire. In 1735 the manor of Penn, passed from the unmarried Roger Penn to his sole heir and sister, who was married to the 3rd Baronet Scarsdale, an ancestor of the Lords Curzon. Penbury Grove Penbury Grove House was built in 1902 by the American engineer Horace Field Parshall, as a replica of Pennsbury Manor, William Penn's house in Pennsylvania, wrongly thinking that Penn had a connection with Pennsylvania. Myths and legends Penn is reputedly haunted by the ghost of an 18th-century farm labourer, who appears, laughing, on a phantom horse. Penn Street, Knotty Green and Forty Green Penn Street, Knotty Green and Forty Green are hamlets of the parish, each within a mile of the main village. Penn Street and Knotty Green have village commons, where the Penn Street and Knotty Green cricket clubs play.Penn Street Cricket Club; The local pubs, The Squirrel in Penn Street and The Red Lion in Knotty Green, face their respective commons. Penn today The area is part of the Chiltern Hills and popular with people who work in London due to its proximity to road (junction 3 of the M40 motorway at Loudwater) and rail (Mainline rail at Beaconsfield and London Underground at Amersham) links into the city. Penn remains home to Earl Howe of the Penn-Curzon-Howe dynasty, which gained more wealth through the Inclosure Acts, which gave legal property rights to land previously in communal use. In 1855, ownership of Common Wood and Penn Wood passed to the 1st Earl Howe, forcing many local people and their livestock off the land. This caused general unrest within the community. For centuries, villagers had sustained themselves by grazing their animals on the common and gathering what they could from the land. When the woods became private property, many were plunged further into poverty. Years of unlawful protest followed, when poaching was rife and fences were pulled down as local people tried to retrieve what they deemed legitimately theirs. Penn Street churchyard contains items from Gopsall, Lord Howe's other country house in Leicestershire. The lychgate and Countess Howe memorial were moved from Congerstone in 1919, when the family sold the Gopsall Estate. The Cottage Bookshop in Penn was one of the locations for A Tale of Two Hamlets, an episode of the ITV television programme, Midsomer Murders. In addition, it was used to film an episode called \\"Bookshop Chuckles\\" in the children's television show ChuckleVision. The three-acre set for Nanny McPhee was also constructed there. Penn has a non-League football club, Penn & Tylers Green F.C., which plays at Elm Road. Notable people The novelist Elizabeth Taylor died in Penn in 1975. Medical pioneers Dr Louisa Garrett Anderson and Dr Flora Murray and the children's writer Alison Uttley, author of the Little Grey Rabbit stories, are buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity. In 1983, the ashes of the British spy Donald Maclean were scattered in the churchyard. Canadian author Margaret Laurence (1926‚Äì1987) lived on Beacon Hill, Penn, between 1963 and 1973, in a house previously owned by the politician Sir Donald Maclean and Lady Maclean, parents of the British spy. The actor and singer Stanley Holloway lived in Penn with his wife and son for many years in the 1950s and 1960s. p. 322. Chef and television personality Mary Berry also lives in Penn. Gabby Logan the TV presenter and her husband Kenny Logan, a former Scotland rugby union international, live in the village. The countertenor Michael Chance was born in the village. The renowned Scots preacher Alexander Whyte spent his last months in the village and preached his last sermon at the Free Methodist Chapel on Church Road. Thomas Horder, 1st Baron Horder, physician to the Royal Family (as was Bertrand Dawson, 1st Viscount Dawson of Penn, who chose the village for the territorial designation of his peerage) lived in the village for several years. David Blakely, murdered by Ruth Ellis, lived with his parents in the village and brought Ellis there, although never to meet them. As a result of his murder, Ellis became the last woman judicially executed in Britain.

It was first published in the United States, by Harper & Row in 1966, as a picture book illustrated by William P√®ne du Bois. Allen & Unwin published a P√®ne du Bois edition in the U.K. in 1968. Later editions have been illustrated by Pat Marriott, Tony Ross, and Quentin Blake. The novel was adapted into a 1990 TV special.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8112524/ Synopsis The Magic Finger is narrated by an eight-year-old girl (voiced by Anne Clements in the United Kingdom) growing up on a farm in the English countryside, next door to the Gregg family who have a passion for hunting. The titular \\"Magic Finger\\" is an ability she has that activates inadvertently whenever she gets intensely angry: the finger shoots out a beam of energy that apparently seeks out whoever has angered the girl, with unpredictable consequences. One day, the girl sees Mr. Gregg and his two sons returning home from a hunt with a deer they have killed, and they make fun of her when she admonishes them. In a rage, she puts the Magic Finger on the entire family: they wake up the following morning to find that they have shrunk to the size of birds and developed wings in place of their arms. While trying their wings, the Greggs fly out of their house, which is promptly occupied by a family of human-sized ducks with human hands, and they are forced to make a nest in an old tree for the night. The following morning, the Greggs find that, in a major reversal of their habits, the ducks are holding hunting guns on them. Desperately, Mr. and Mrs. Gregg plead with the ducks not to shoot them, but when one of the ducks taunts them about their own fondness for shooting, Mr. Gregg promises to give up shooting and destroy his guns, swearing never to hurt another animal again: the ducks let them leave, and the Greggs find themselves returned to normal. The girl comes by the farm to see that the Gregg family (now changing their surname to Egg) have fully changed their ways and are now feeding and caring for the birds. As they tell her their story, the sound of gunfire in the distance attracts the girl's attention, and she feels the Magic Finger charging again. The story ends as the girl runs off towards the sound that she can hear in the distance.

Retrieved 3 June 2012 Overview The idea of The Twits was triggered by Dahl's desire to 'do something against beards', because he had an acute hatred of them. The first sentence of the story is, 'What a lot of hairy-faced men there are around nowadays!' Plot A hideous, vindictive, spiteful couple known as the Twits live together in a brick house without windows. They continuously play nasty practical jokes on each other out of hatred for one another, ranging from Mr. Twit hiding a frog in his wife's bed that he claims is a monster, to Mrs. Twit tricking her husband into eating worms in his spaghetti. They also keep a family of pet monkeys from Africa, the Muggle- Wumps. The Twits, who are retired circus trainers, are trying to create the first upside-down monkey circus, leaving the monkeys to stand on their heads for hours on end. If they fail to do what Mr. Twit says, Mrs. Twit beats them with her cane. Mr. Twit also coats tree limbs with a strong sticky glue Hugtight in hopes of catching birds for Mrs. Twit to make into a bird pie. The monkeys try to warn the birds before they land on the tree, but the English- speaking birds do not understand the monkeys' African language. One week, the Roly-Poly bird flies in from Africa to visit the monkeys and, acting as an interpreter of languages, saves the birds from sitting anywhere Mr. Twit has spread glue. Mr. Twit tries several times to catch the birds, spreading the glue on an increasing number of perches, but the Roly-Poly bird changes his warning to reflect the new traps. Tired of chasing the birds, the Twits decide to buy guns to kill them. The Muggle-Wumps, tired of being forced to stand on their heads, with the help of the birds use Mr. Twit's powerful glue to attach the couple's furniture to their ceiling while they are away to trick them into thinking that they are upside down and that their ceiling is actually their floor. The birds also smear glue on the Twits' heads, which permanently fixes them to the ground when a panicked Mr. Twit suggests that they stand on their heads so that they are 'the right way up' after they first walk into the upside down living room. Stuck on their heads with all their weight pressing down on them, they catch the 'Dreaded Shrinks' (a disease that Mr. Twit had convinced Mrs. Twit that she had earlier in the book as one of the aforementioned pranks), their bodies compressing 'downwards' so that they eventually shrink away into nothing, leaving the Muggle-Wumps free to escape. Mr. Twit Mr. Twit is a wicked person, having hair that covers his entire face, with the exception of his forehead, eyes, and nose. His hair (which he falsely believes makes him appear 'wise and grand' but is widely agreed by everyone else makes him look like a twit), is spiky and hard. Because he never washes it, his moustache holds scraps of food stuck there while he ate, including tinned sardines, Stilton cheese, and corn flakes. Occasionally, he licks these scraps out and eats them when he is hungry. Instead of wiping his mouth with a cloth, Mr. Twit simply wipes it on his sleeve. Mr. Twit is a drinker with a fondness for beer; he even drinks alcohol at breakfast. He is known to be very quiet when he is plotting. He and his wife mistreat their monkeys, the Muggle-Wumps. They have kept Muggle-Wump and his family locked up in a cage in the garden. The dreaded shrinks demolished Mr. Twit into nothing. Mrs. Twit Mrs. Twit is the hideously ugly, menacing wife of Mr. Twit. She is said to have had quite a nice face once, but her ugly thoughts began to show on her face until she was so ugly, you couldn‚Äôt bear to look upon her. She takes advantage of her glass eye to play practical jokes in revenge against her husband, and demonstrates multiple acts of cruelty and viciousness throughout the story: the main reason behind her use of a walking cane was as a weapon against innocent children and animals, she participates in the torment of the couple's pet monkeys the Muggle-Wumps, and she once served Mr. Twit a lunch of worms disguised as spaghetti. Albeit, while she frequently demonstrates acts of stupidity, she has also exhibited intelligence: she managed to manoeuvre her way out of being carried off into the sky by balloons by chewing through several of the strings and landing safely on the ground. Aside from this, she is portrayed as being hideous, cruel, and unhygienic. The Tricks A series of pranks advance the plot of the story. Brief descriptions appear below: The Glass Eye Mrs. Twit removes her glass eye and drops it in her husband's beer mug while he isn't looking. It isn't until he empties the mug that he sees the eye sitting in there, startling him something awful. Mrs. Twit laughs, gloating that this proves she is always watching him. The Frog In revenge for the glass eye trick, Mr. Twit places a frog in Mrs. Twit's bed, and frightens Mrs. Twit by claiming the item in her bed is a 'Giant Skillywiggler', with 'teeth like screwdrivers' with which it would bite off her toes. Mrs. Twit then faints, at which point Mr. Twit splashes a jugful of cold water onto her face. She soon recovers, as the frog hops onto her face to get near the water. Mr. Twit then claims the 'Giant Skillywiggler' will soon bite off her nose. Mrs. Twit then flees. The Wormy Spaghetti Seeking revenge for the Frog Trick, Mrs. Twit places worms from the garden in cooked spaghetti, which Mr. Twit eats, being re assured by Mrs. Twit that it is merely a new kind called 'Squiggly Spaghetti' she has recently bought. When he has eaten it, Mrs. Twit joyfully reveals the truth, to Mr. Twit's horror and disgust. The Shrinks In revenge for the Wormy Spaghetti, Mr. Twit glues pieces of wood no thicker than a penny onto Mrs. Twit's cane each night, as well as onto the legs of her chair, making Mrs. Twit believe that she is slowly shrinking. Mr. Twit then frightens her by claiming that she has contracted an illness called the 'shrinks', by which she will be caused to disappear. Mr. Twit then claims that to cure the shrinks, Mrs. Twit will have to be 'stretched'. Mr. Twit then ties Mrs. Twit up in the garden to 60 gas balloons intending to leave her there for a while to teach her a lesson. However, once Mrs. Twit makes the mistake of saying that if the strings break, it's goodbye for her, Mr. Twit pretends to tie some more strings to her ankles, before cutting through the strings and sending her skywards. Mrs. Twit eventually returns by biting through several of the balloon strings so she sinks slowly down, eventually collapsing on Mr. Twit in the garden and beating him senseless with her long walking stick immediately afterwards. The Sticky Tree There is a 'Big Dead Tree' in the Twits' garden, which Mr. Twit uses to trap birds by spreading Hug-Tight Sticky Glue on the branches. Captive birds are then made into a pie by Mrs. Twit. During the story four schoolboys are caught instead of birds, but escape by unfastening their trousers and falling to the ground outside the Twits' garden after Mr. Twit said that he will make boy pie instead of bird pie. It is this use of glue that gives the captive monkey Muggle-Wump and his family the idea of using it against the Twits. Rescuing the Animals Using their friend the Roly-Poly Bird as an interpreter of languages, Muggle-Wump and his wife and children convey the warning that any bird landing on the Big Dead Tree will be cooked into Mrs. Twit's Bird Pie. When Mr. Twit, in retaliation, spreads glue on the monkeys' cage (which serves as a substitute perch), the monkeys alter the warning. The birds end up landing on the Twits' roof. This enrages Mr. Twit, who doesn't want to keep waiting for his pie, so the Twits decide to go to the shop and buy a gun each. During their absence on this errand, Muggle-Wump plots a final trick: to turn the Twits' house upside down. With the help of the birds, Muggle-Wump removes the carpet from the floor, as well as all of the tables, chairs, and other objects in the house, and uses Mr. Twit's glue to stick the objects upside down to the ceiling, leaving the floor absolutely bare. By doing this, the Twits will believe that they have been turned upside down, as they will be standing on what looks like the ceiling of their house and will stand on their heads to be the right way up. To keep their heads glued to the ground, two birds will put a small amount of glue on the Twits heads right before they enter the house so that when they stand on their heads, they will be stuck. Just as the preparations for this trick are finished, the twits return home. Everything goes as planned, the Twits believed they've been turned upside down and so stand on their heads to counter it, only to be stuck to the bare floor. However, heads are not made to be stood upon. With so much weight on it from above, the Twits literally get 'the shrinks', as was mentioned earlier in the book. However, this time it's not a trick; it's the real thing. After a week or so, the Twits disappear, and everyone who knew of them shouts 'hooray!'. Meanwhile, The Muggle-wumps and Roly-Poly bird escape to their native African land. Film Since February 2003, a feature film adaptation of the book has been in development by Vanguard Animation and its founder John H. Williams. As part of multi picture deal with Walt Disney Pictures, Vanguard was set to produce a CG animated/live action film, with John Cleese and Kirk DeMicco writing the screenplay. In November 2004, it was reported that Mark Mylod signed up to direct the feature, and that Cleese may star in the film. In October 2006, after the executive/regime changes at Disney, the project moved to Working Title and Universal. By January 2012, the official site of Vanguard Animation stated that Conrad Vernon, the director of Shrek 2 and Monsters vs. Aliens, would direct the film.

The population of the Wolverhampton Ward taken at the 2011 census was 12,718. Originally, it was a village in the historic county of Staffordshire. There is considerable confusion about exactly which areas fall within Penn. In 19th century censuses, Merry Hill, Bradmore are understood to form part of Penn, although these areas are generally understood to be separate today. However, there has never been any doubt that the two historic settlements of Upper and Lower Penn form the core of the area. Etymology \\"Penn\\" is probably derived from the Welsh language, signifying a hill or promontory, and is believed to refer to the hill on which St Bartholomew's Church stands. The pre-Anglo-Saxon name may indicate relatively late survival of Celtic-speaking settlement. The area to the east of Penn Road (A449) and around St Bartholomew's church is referred to as Upper Penn, historically also as Penn Over. The village within South Staffordshire, and around St Anne's church is Lower Penn or Penn Under. These historic usages tend to confirm that the name has long been considered to refer to the ridge to the east, which is ascended via Church Hill, Wakeley Hill or Mount Road. History Base of a Saxon Cross at St Bartholomew's Church, Penn at the time owned by Lady Godiva There was settlement and possibly a church in Anglo-Saxon times: Domesday Book records Lower Penn as having belonged to Countess Godiva of Mercia and Upper Penn to her son, Earl Algar. In 1912, the base of an Anglo-Saxon preaching cross was discovered close to St Bartholomew's church. In fact, the name Penn suggests (but does not prove) that there was a pre-Anglo-Saxon settlement, with possible survival of Celtic language and culture locally into the Anglo-Saxon period. The Norman conquest of England brought a major shift in land ownership. The Penn area, along with a wide tract of Mercia, was assigned by William the Conqueror to Ansculf de Picquigny, who built a motte and bailey fortress at Dudley. By 1087, the time of Domesday Book, the Penn area belonged to Ansculf's son, William Fitz-Ansculf. He had installed in Upper Penn a tenant called Robert, who also held lands from him in Bushbury, Ettingshall, Moseley and Oxley. The settlement had eight villagers and two smallholders. In Lower Penn, which had only 6 villagers with one freeman, he had another tenant, called Gilbert. Clearly both places were still mere hamlets. Penn has had a church since at least around 1200 when St. John the Baptist's Church was first established by Sir Hugh de Bushbury,St Bartholomew's Church: Archaeological report - Section 1.3.1 apparently a descendant of the tenant Robert. The provision of a sizeable church suggests that Upper Penn, at least, had expanded considerably by this time, in line with a general growth of population and prosperity that began in the late 12th century. Hugh gave all the tithes from Upper Penn to the support of the church, making the holder of the living a Rector. The first incumbent was John of Wolverhampton. Around 1228, the founder's son, also Sir Hugh de Bushbury, married his cousin. As this match fell within the bounds of consanguinity he was forced to bribe the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield with the living of Penn. This did not stop the Bushbury family trying to reassert their control in later generations, although the bishops ultimately managed to retain their authority over appointments. The dedication of the church was later changed to St Bartholomew, but it is unclear when the name was changed: it is not attested before the 19th century. Some of the original fabric survives, but the present, mainly brick, building is largely the result of major restorations and enlargements in 1765, 1799 and 1845. By the mid-12th century, Lower Penn was in the hands of the Buffery or Buffor family, who held it until the mid-15th century. It was sometimes called Penn Buffor. Penn's growth in the Middle Ages was probably driven by its position on a major route, connecting not just the local towns of Wolverhampton, Stourbridge and Kidderminster, but the county towns of Stafford and Worcester, and forming part of the main north-south route of Western England. Traffic struggled up and along the ridge, past the hamlet of Ryecroft to Upper Penn. The present route of the A449/Penn Road evolved only in the modern period, with an 18th- century toll road providing a more convenient thoroughfare and bypassing Upper Penn village. A guidebook of 1851William White, History, Gazetteer and Directory of Staffordshire, Sheffield, 1851 says: > Penn is a large parish, comprising 3890 acres, and the two townships and > villages of Upper and Lower Penn, the former of which has 716 and the latter > 226 inhabitants. The Duke of Sutherland is lord of the manor, and owner of a > large portion of the soil. The rest belongs to the following resident > freeholders, JW Sparrow, Esq, of Penn Hall; the Rev William Dalton, of Lloyd > House; Robert Thacker, Esq, of Muchall Hall; Sidney Cartwright, Esq, of the > Leasowes, and a few smaller owners. A large part of Penn has been absorbed progressively into Wolverhampton, which became a County Borough in 1930 and a Metropolitan borough in 1974, thus detaching much of Penn from the administrative county of Staffordshire. This gradual expansion of the boundaries of Wolverhampton was accompanied by a rapid development of suburban housing, particularly from the Edwardian period, with many residents depending on the Sunbeam works for employment. Despite the depression of the 1930s, a further surge in housebuilding occurred, with much post-war infill. As a result, the area to the north and west of St. Bartholomew's church is almost entirely occupied by Wolverhampton's suburban housing. Ecclesiastical divisions Nowadays, the Parish of Penn contains part of suburban Wolverhampton and part of rural South Staffordshire, where the village of Lower Penn is situated about one mile (1.6 km) to the west, within South Staffordshire and containing the parish's other church, St Anne's. However a large part of Penn in suburban Wolverhampton now falls within other parishes, in particular the Parish of Penn Fields, served by the churches of St Philip, St Joseph and St Aidan. Penn ward within Wolverhampton Penn (population 12,392) is a formal ward of Wolverhampton, West Midlands. Penn ward borders the wards of Merry Hill, Graiseley and Blakenhall as well as South Staffordshire. It forms part of the Wolverhampton South West constituency. There are three focal points where shops and other facilities are located, all situated on the A449 Penn Road, which runs south- west from Wolverhampton City Centre: Upper Penn (which is closest to Wolverhampton and contains a hospital), Penn itself, and Springhill (which is adjacent to the city's boundary with Staffordshire). There are four primary schools within Penn: Springdale, St Bartholomew's C of E, Warstones and Woodfield, all of which have nursery schools included. There is one secondary school: Highfields located on the edge of Waratones housing estate. There is also a community special school called Penn Hall School.Penn Hall School in Vicarage Road. A secondary school also existed in Manor Road (Penn Secondary Modern School) which was later used by Colton Hills Secondary School for the first two years of senior school prior to expansion of the main Colton Hills site. Shortly after closure, the school buildings were demolished to make way for the present Penn Manor Medical Centre with housing built on the remaining site. Penn Library is situated in Upper Penn.. The library was slated for closure under council cutbacks but was ultimately retained. In addition to St. Bartholomew's Church (Anglican), there is St Michael's Roman Catholic Church, Penn United Reformed Church and Springdale Methodist Church.Springdale Methodist Church and Community Centre. A further smaller Anglican church is St. Aidans located in Mount Road. Penn is a generally advantaged area with many upmarket houses that are mostly situated in the south of the area on land bordering the extensive South Staffordshire countryside.  Penn Common  Penn Common is a substantial area of countryside which juts into the urban area between Penn, Wolverhampton and Sedgley (part of Dudley). An important amenity for local people, it is occupied by a golf course and farmland. It is overlooked from the east by St Bartholomew's church, descends to a hamlet centred on the old Lloyd's brewery, and rises again to the village of Gospel End. Most of its area falls within South Staffordshire.

First published in 1981, it was praised for its humour, but was also criticised for its underdeveloped plot and offbeat ending. It is one of Dahl's shorter children's books. Being a medical expert was one of what Dahl called his ‚Äúdreams of glory‚Äù: he had huge respect for doctors and particularly those who pioneered new treatments. He dedicated the book to ‚Äúdoctors everywhere‚Äù. An audio reading of it was released with the actor Richard E. Grant narrating. In 2003, the book was listed at number 134 on the BBC's The Big Read poll. Plot While 8-year old George Kranky's parents are out grocery shopping, his maternal grandmother bosses him around and bullies him. She intimidates George by saying that she likes to eat insects and he wonders briefly if she's a witch. To punish her for her regular abuse, George decides to make a magic medicine to replace her old one. He collects a variety of ingredients from around the family farm including deodorant and shampoo from the bathroom, floor polish from the laundry room, horseradish sauce and gin from the kitchen, animal medicines, engine oil and anti-freeze from the garage, and brown paint to mimic the colour of the original medicine. After cooking the ingredients in the kitchen, George gives it as medicine to his grandmother, who grows as tall as the house, bursting through the roof. When his grandmother doesn't believe it was George who made her grow so tall, he proves it by feeding the medicine to one of his father's chickens, which grows ten times its original size. As they return home, George's parents can't believe their eyes when they see the fattest chicken ever and the grandmother. George's father grows very excited at the thought of rearing giant animals so that they can end world hunger, which makes his family rich and famous. He has George feed the medicine to the rest of the farm's animals, causing them to become giants as well. However, his grandmother begins complaining about being ignored and stuck in the roof, so Mr. Kranky hires a crane to remove her from the house. Her extreme height has her sleeping in the barn for the next few nights. The following morning, Mr. Kranky is still excited about George's medicine and announces that he and George shall make gallons of it to sell to farmers around the world. George attempts to recreate it, but is unable to remember all the ingredients. The second version makes a chicken's legs grow extremely long, and the third elongates a chicken's neck to bizarre proportions. The fourth has the opposite effect of the first and makes animals shrink. George's grandmother, now even more angry she's sleeping in the barn, storms over and starts complaining loudly that she's once again sick of being ignored. She sees the cup of medicine in George's hand and erroneously mistakes it for tea. Much to his and Mrs. Kranky's horror, and Mr. Kranky's delight, she drinks the entire cup and shrinks so much that she vanishes completely. At first, Mrs. Kranky is shocked, confused and distraught about the sudden, and very strange disappearance of her mother, but soon accepts that she was becoming a nuisance anyway. In the last page, George is left to think about the implications of his actions, feeling as though they had granted him access to the edge of a magic world. Safety concerns A popular book for reading to children in primary school, great care was taken by teachers to warn children to not try and recreate the medicine at home due to the hazardous nature of some of its ingredients. There is a disclaimer warning before the story stating \\"Warning to Readers: Do not try to make George's Marvellous Medicine yourselves at home. It could be dangerous.\\" Influence Dahl was influenced by Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, with the ‚ÄúDrink Me‚Äù episode in Alice inspiring a scene in George's Marvellous Medicine where the tyrannical grandmother drinks a potion concocted by George and is blown up to the size of a farmhouse. Television version Rik Mayall read this story for the BBC's Jackanory programme, in a widely acclaimed performance.

The plot follows a young boy named Billy who meets a giraffe, a pelican, and a monkey, who work as window cleaners. Although the story is narrated in first-person by Billy, the word 'me' in the title refers to the monkey, who concludes every verse of his signature song with the phrase 'the giraffe and the pelly and me'. Plot The story is told from the point of view of Billy, a young boy who has always dreamed of owning a sweet shop. His ambition is strengthened by the fact that there is an abandoned building named The Grubber, an old English word for a sweet shop, near where he lives. One day, he finds that the old building has been renovated and has become the head office for The Ladder less Window-Cleaning Company. Billy then meets its workers: A Giraffe with an extendable neck; a Pelican, or \\"Pelly\\" as he is called by the others, who has a flexible upper beak; and a singing and dancing Monkey, all of whom he quickly befriends. Having only recently arrived in England, all the animals are finding it hard to acquire the right food to feed themselves. This includes fish for the Pelican, especially his favourite salmon; walnuts for the Monkey; and pink and purple tinkle-tinkle tree flowers for the Giraffe, who happens to be a \\"Generous Giraffe\\" and therefore can eat no food other than these flowers. Billy and the animals all band together when they receive a letter from the Duke of Hampshire asking them to clean the 677 windows of Hampshire House. Things go smoothly when they get there until, while cleaning the windows of the Duchess's bedroom, the Giraffe and the Monkey spot a burglar attempting to steal the Duchess's jewels. The Pelican then flies in and catches the burglar, holding him prisoner in his beak despite the burglar's attempt to shoot his way out. Soon the police arrive to arrest the burglar, whom the Chief of Police identifies as \\"The Cobra\\", one of the world's most dangerous cat burglars. As a reward for retrieving the Duchess's jewels, the Duke invites The Ladder less Window-Cleaning Company to live on his estate as his personal helpers. Since he is the owner of the only tinkle- tinkle tree plantation in England, as well as thousands of walnut trees and an enormous salmon river, all three starving animals have found the answer to their prayers. Billy's dreams also come true because the Giraffe, Pelican, and Monkey will no longer need the Grubber building; with a little help from the Duke, the Grubber is revived into the most fantastic sweet shop for miles around, and the story ends with Billy running the shop and The Ladder less Window-Cleaning Company continuing their business.

Genealogy According to ancestral story, which tells us Movses Khorenatsi, the dynasty of Bznunis originates from Baz forefather. Baz was Manavaz Haykazuni's grandson. He inherited the north-western part of Lake Van. The sea was named after his name Bznunyac and the province Bznuniq. According to other historical evidence, in the northern part of Armenia-Lori, Baz founded the Bazakert province with Bazaberd castle about which there had been numerous references at medieval Armenian historians.  History The tribe of Bznunis at prior period chaired the position of a royal Leader then a military chief of stuff position. The tribal emblem of the Bznunis was the Hawk, which later had become the tribe's blazon. At the time of Trdat III the Great they were entrusted the Dzora border mountain pass. The Bznuni nakharars were military commanders and boundary governors. The Bznunis are mentioned in Royal and Military letters. At the times of Khosrov Kotak, the tribe householder Databen Bznuni disobeying the centripetal authorities rebelled against the king. In Arest battle Vache Mamikonyan breaks some of the rebels and the rest escape. Afterwards, Databen Bznuni was brought to the king in chains, and according to the time punishment means he was condemned to death as a traitor, by stoning. However, manorial elite of Bznunis still existed and that loyal house of patriarchal orders still retained the former disobedient and the sovereign lifestyle, so Vache Mamikonyan was given a command to destroy the entire household council which was the part of conspiracy, subsequently the Bznuni possessions were confiscated and joined to the royal estates. Later on, as an occupied province, it had been given to Aghbianos bishop with conferring order, for the church was limited to the pagan architectural lands and with the acquisitions of confiscated domains. Despite the elimination of the elite tribe, the dynasty of Bznunis was able to maintain their existence in feudal order. In manuscripts from the 6th and 7th centuries Bznuni bishops had been mentioned, we can meet a customer and recipient Bznuni archimandrites, which is indicative of the protection and maintenance of their manorial and aristocratic degrees. Permanently the description of the tribal property location names had been vivid, for example in the 13th century. Khlat is mentioned as ¬´a city of Bznuni Khlat¬ª and speaking about the destruction of the tribe is definitely understood the elimination of the tribal council of elders and household authorities, because the numerous members of the tribe were connected with relative and other acting ties and were coalesced around all places in the state from centuries. Therefore, the Bznuni nakharars family assignees were rarely mentioned. In the manuscript, records of the 16th and 17th centuries (there) are mentioned as a customer, recipient or a master. Nerses Archimandrite Bznuni (born in 1839 Karin ), Simon Bznuni bishop of St. Thaddeus Monastery, late 19th-century religious leaders Nerses and Hovhannes archimandrites of Balu province, a participant of Sardarapat battle in 1918 from May 21 to 29, ARF Haroutyun Bznuni, 20th-century Persian-Armenian poet Levon Bznuni and others also come from the Bznuni tribe.

As a community radio station, 4ZZZ is a member of the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia (CBAA). The station broadcasts to much of South East Queensland, parts of northern New South Wales and web streams from its website. History 4ZZZ was established to provide a radical alternative to mainstream news, to promote a sense of engagement and activism in community life and to promote Australian music.4ZZZ - 'About' The station began transmission on 8 December 1975 as 4ZZ at 105.7 MHz, the first FM community broadcaster in Brisbane transmitting in stereo. The station's first studios were constructed by announcing staff and volunteers, using second-hand building materials and furniture. The first transmitter was hand built by the station engineer Ross Dannecker with help from Dave Aberdeen. Founders included activist, Jim Beatson, journalist Marian Wilkinson, Arts Administrator, John Stanwell and academic Alan Knight. Announcer John Woods launched the station with The Who's \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" at Midday 8 December 1975 (a month after The Dismissal). Along with 2JJJ and 3RRR, 4ZZZ has been a major promoter of independent and alternative music providing exposure for many Australian and international artists. Through the late 1970s and early 1980s the station also produced many groundbreaking and award- winning features and documentaries. 4ZZZ pushed the boundaries by broadcasting illegal obscenities. In 1981 an organisation called \\"The Society to Outlaw Pornography\\" reported them to the Australian Broadcasting Authority. 4ZZZ successfully defended themselves, leading to changes which make it legal to swear on Australian TV and radio under certain circumstances. On 14 December 1988, as part of a conservative backlash to the ousting of Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, 4ZZZ was taken off air and forcibly evicted from its University of Queensland premises by the then UQ Union ALSF and Young Nationals student union executive. While university students rallied to support the station, 4ZZZ moved to alternative premises on Coronation Drive in the suburb of Toowong. In 1992 the station was able to obtain a loan to buy the former headquarters of the Communist Party of Australia. 4ZZZ still broadcasts from these premises on Barry Parade in Fortitude Valley. Station philosophy and funding The motto for the station is agitate, educate, organise. They aim to \\"Provide a voice for marginalised communities\\" -It's All About Community - Documentary film, 2016 (In production, as of 29/09/16) 4ZZZ aims to challenge the mainstream media by providing access for the community to radio, by supporting local bands, artists and events, by providing training for station volunteers, and by disseminating alternative news and current affairs. All fundraising is run by the station. The main sources of income are subscriptions, sponsorship, promotions and 4ZZZ events. 4ZZZ collaborates with local businesses, gig promoters, etc. to provide incentives such as discounts for subscribers. The station's volunteers have won many awards including Community Broadcasting Association of Australia awards and national media awards. In 2015 4ZZZ won the Tony Staley Award for excellence in community broadcasting for its efforts to include more people with a disability via the Ability Radio Project and appointed the first Station Advocate for People with a Disability in 2017.4ZZZ appoints advocate for people with a disability to increase inclusion Programming As a community radio station, 4ZZZ broadcasts a wide variety of music, information and news. Presenters do not have to follow a playlist. Announcers personally choose the on-air musical content, or station subscribers request tracks. Unlike other radio stations, there is no music or program director. There are coordinators for those departments, however the ultimate decision rests with the program makers who must abide by the station policy of playing a minimum of 30% Australian or New Zealand based content, 30% new music (released in the previous four months), 30% female content (not just female vocal, including all female contribution to the work) and 15% local (broadcast area - South-East Qld). In 2018, after extensive consultation, 4ZZZ increased its female content quota to an aspirational 50%. All 4ZZZ announcers are current financial subscribers to the station as well as dedicated volunteers who have completed the station's In House Announcer Training. Programming is divided into two types of shifts, 'strip' shifts that broadcast a wide variety of music and information, news programs and 'block' shifts that cater to specific genres of music. Magazine shows (combination of music, host chat & banter and interviews) cross both formats.

During the night, a large police presence was seen patrolling the area outside the fence around the Park. There were several arrests for alleged drug possession and other minor street offences. At around 8:20 p.m. a severe storm hit without warning and organisers were forced to close the event. Within 10 minutes more than half of the crowd had left and police began to appear in larger numbers. It is estimated that more than 100 police were mobilised, including mounted police and police from the Public Safety Response Team equipped with riot gear. The arrival of such large numbers of police at less than 10 minutes notice indicated that police were on stand-by for the event. Crowds sheltering in tents were physically forced from the park, people attending the event were beaten with batons and arrested. Complaints were made to the Criminal Justice Commission but no police were ever reprimanded. References Sources  Knight,A. 2000.

Published in 3 September 1990, it was the last of Dahl's books to be published in his lifetime. Unlike other Dahl works (which often feature tyrannical adults and heroic/magical children), Esio Trot is the story of an old, lonely man (Mr Hoppy), trying to make a connection with a person that he has loved from afar (a widow named Mrs Silver). In 1994, Monty Python member Michael Palin provided the English language audiobook recording of the book. In 2015 it was adapted by Richard Curtis into a BBC television film, Roald Dahl's Esio Trot, featuring Dustin Hoffman and Judi Dench as the couple, with James Corden narrating. Story Mr Hoppy is a shy old man who lives alone in an apartment, tending to his many plants. For many years, he has had a crush on Mrs Silver, who lives in the flat below his. Mr Hoppy frequently leans over his balcony and exchanges polite conversation with Mrs Silver, but he is too shy to disclose how he feels. Mr Hoppy longs to express his feelings to Mrs Silver, but he can never bring his lips to form the words. Mrs Silver has a small pet tortoise, Alfie, whom she loves very much. One morning, Mrs Silver mentions to Mr Hoppy that even though she has had Alfie for many years, her pet has only grown a tiny bit and has gained only 13 ounces in weight. She confesses that she wishes she knew of some way to make her little Alfie grow into a larger, more dignified tortoise. Mr Hoppy suddenly thinks of a way to give Mrs Silver her wish and win her affection. Mr Hoppy tells Mrs Silver that he ‚Äî in fact ‚Äî does know of a way to make a tortoise grow bigger. He writes the following words on a slip of paper, and lowers it down to Mrs Silver: > ESIO TROT, ESIO TROT, TEG REGGIB REGGIB, EMOC NO, ESIO TROT, WORG PU, FFUP > PU, TOOHS PU, GNIRPS PU, WOLB PU, LLEWS PU! EGROG! ELZZUG! FFUTS! PLUG, TUP > NO TAF, ESIO TROT, TUP NO TAF, TEG NO, TEG NO, ELBBOG DOOF. Mr Hoppy explains that these magic words, when whispered in Alfie's ear three times a day, will cause Alfie to grow bigger and bigger. Mrs Silver is doubtful, but agrees to try. (The words are, reversed, Tortoise, tortoise, get bigger bigger! Come on, tortoise, grow up, puff up, shoot up! Spring up, blow up, swell up! Gorge! Guzzle! Stuff! Gulp! Put on fat, tortoise, put on fat! Get on, get on, gobble food!) Over the next few days, Mr Hoppy carries out the second part of his plan. He visits every pet shop in the city, and buys many tortoises of various sizes, but none that weigh less than 13 ounces. Mr Hoppy brings all the tortoises back to his apartment and installs them in a makeshift corral in his living room. Next, Mr Hoppy builds a special tool to help him snatch the tortoise from Mrs Silver's balcony. He fastens a handle to the end of a long metal tube, and a tiny claw at the bottom. By pulling the handle, the arms of the claw gently open and close. The following day, when Mrs Silver leaves for work, Mr Hoppy selects a tortoise from his living room that weighs exactly 15 ounces. He carefully picks Alfie up from the lower balcony, and exchanges him with the new tortoise. When Mrs Silver returns home, she faithfully whispers the magic words in Alfie's ear, but does not notice that an exchange has been made. Over the next 8 weeks, Mr Hoppy continues to switch Mrs Silver's current pet with a slightly larger tortoise, but she still does not perceive that her pet is growing in size. One afternoon, Mrs Silver comments to Mr Hoppy that Alfie seems a bit bigger, but cannot tell for sure. Suddenly, Mrs Silver notices that Alfie can no longer fit through the door to his house, and exclaims to Mr Hoppy that his spell is sure to be working. Mrs Silver runs inside and weighs her pet, and is surprised to find that Alfie now weighs 27 ounces, more than double the weight he was before. Mr Hoppy summons his courage and asks Mrs Silver if he can come down and see the effect for himself. Mrs Silver, in raptures over her pet's transformation, gladly grants his request. Mr Hoppy races down the stairs, nervous and excited to be on the brink of winning Mrs Silver's heart. Mrs Silver flings open the door, embraces Mr Hoppy, and expresses her admiration for Mr Hoppy's magical spell. However, the tortoise cannot fit in the house now, so Mr Hoppy tells Mrs Silver to say a magic spell that night and the next night, secretly replacing this tortoise with one slightly smaller during the day. His part works splendidly, and Mr Hoppy, suddenly emboldened by Mrs Silver's warm smile, asks Mrs Silver for her hand in marriage. Mrs Silver delightedly accepts Mr Hoppy's proposal, then adds that she thought he would never get around to asking. Mr Hoppy secretly returns all the tortoises in his living room back to their respective pet shops, and Mr Hoppy and Mrs Silver are happily married a few weeks later. The \\"original\\" Alfie is bought by a girl named Roberta Squibb after he is returned to a pet shop, and after many years, does indeed grow to double his size. Adaptation The book was adapted by Richard Curtis and Paul Mayhew-Archer into a BBC comedy television film, Roald Dahl's Esio Trot. It features Dustin Hoffman, a retired bachelor who falls in love with his neighbour, a widow, played by Judi Dench, who keeps a tortoise as a companion, with James Corden as the narrator. Filming took place in May 2014 in London. Receiving widespread acclaim, it was screened on 1 January 2015.

In the most simple context, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. The two most common forms of filing cabinets are vertical files and lateral files. A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15 inches) of the cabinet. A lateral file cabinet has drawers that extend from the long side (various lengths) of the cabinet. These are also called side filers in Great Britain. There are also shelf files, which go on shelves. In the United States, file cabinets are usually built to accommodate 8.5 √ó 11 paper, and in other countries, filing cabinets are often designed to hold other sizes of paper, such as A4 paper. Construction Office filing cabinets are typically made of sheet metal or wood. The drawers usually use a drawer slide to facilitate opening the drawer which includes an \\"outstop\\" to prevent the drawer from being pulled completely out of the cabinet. To open a drawer on most metal filing cabinets, a small sliding mechanism known as a \\"thumblatch\\" must be pressed to release and open the drawer. Each drawer has a handle to grip and pull the drawer with. On the front face of each drawer, there is usually a label holder to allow the user to identify the contents of the drawer. Many file cabinets incorporate a keyed lock to prevent unauthorized access to the documents being stored. There are two types of locks. A \\"cam lock\\" is activated with a key that rotates the lock. A \\"plunger lock\\" is opened with a key but can be closed by merely depressing the body of the lock. The plunger lock allows a user to quickly close and lock several cabinets in a short amount of time. Some file cabinets have a metal plate or wire structure at the back of each drawer which is known as a follower block. The follower block can be adjusted forward to reduce the length of the drawer so that the file folders contained within remain upright and at the front of the drawer for easier access. Horizontal file Henry Brown, an American inventor, patented a \\"receptacle for storing and preserving papers\\" on November 2, 1886. This was a fire and accident safe container made of forged metal, which could be sealed with a lock. It was special in that it kept the papers separated. Vertical file A wooden Filing Cabinet with drawer open DNC filing cabinet from the Watergate office building, damaged by the burglars The invention of the vertical file remains an unsolved mystery. The Vertical Filing Cabinet section in the Early Office Museum websitehttp://www.officemuseum.com/ begins with a discussion of the erroneous conclusions by highly credentialed ‚Äúsecondary sources\\", concerning the origin of vertical filing. The secondary sources claimed that a gold medal was presented at the World‚Äôs Fair of 1893 for a vertical file. The Early Office Museum found no evidence to substantiate those claims. However, the information presented in the Early Office Museum‚Äôs discussion of vertical filing cabinets suggests that the commercial introduction of vertical filing may have occurred in 1900 when a company named the Library Bureau (founded in 1876, later a division of Remington Rand) published a catalog that included a vertical filing cabinet. A US patent was filed in 1902 by the Library Bureau that credited David E. Hunter as the inventor. Research by Ester Ellen- PoeChapter 3, \\"Get Organized at Home! How to Always Find What You are Looking For\\", Kindle edition validated The Early Office Museum's findings, and suggests that the most credible claim to the invention of vertical filing, as we know it today, appears to have been by the Library Bureau. The Library Bureau‚Äôs 1903 pamphlet titled \\"Library Bureau Systems of Vertical Filing with Interchangeable Unit Cabinets\\", begins with: \\"Vertical filing, as originated [emphasis added] and perfected by the Library Bureau, is the most complete, accurate and practical method ever invented [emphasis added] for taking care of correspondence, catalogs, reports, invoices, orders, duplicate bills, and loose sheets, or papers of any kind for any business‚Äîlarge, small or peculiar.\\"Library Bureau Systems of Vertical Filing with Interchangeable Unit Cabinets\\", Library Bureau, 1903, pp. 1-7). In addition to the Library Bureau, early manufacturers of vertical filing cabinets included Globe- Wernicke,\\"Globe-Wernicke Filing Cabinets,‚Äù Catalog No. 803 ‚ÄìX in effect June 10th, 1903, pp. 38, 45 Yawman and Erbe Manufacturing Company,‚ÄúHandbook on Vertical Filing,‚Äù Yawman and Erbe Mfg. Co., 1908 and the Art Metal Construction Company.Steel Filing Cabinets ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt Burn,‚Äù No. 542E, Art Metal Construction Co., Jamestown, NY, 1908, p. 12 Prior to the introduction of commercial vertical filing cabinets businesses kept papers in envelopes in turn stored in arrays of pigeonholes often lining a wall. Finding and opening envelopes and unfolding papers was troublesome and inefficient. However, the concept of vertical filing was clearly practiced as early as 1895 when a U.S. patent (533053) was issued to W.A. Cooke, Jr. for A Receptacle for Letters or Other Papers.Chapter 3, \\"Get Organized at Home! How to Always Find What You are Looking For,\\" Kindle edition) After World War II, the Home-O-Nize Company was established in Muscatine, Iowa to provide returning veterans with jobs. Founded to produce steel kitchen cabinets, the company soon encountered the reality of the limited availability of steel. So the company began to make products for others. Finally a small amount of steel was secured and the company started manufacturing steel index card boxes. Soon after, larger cabinets began to be produced including filing cabinets. By designing to minimize the amount of steel, the product was an extremely cost-effective design and had huge commercial success. Home-O-Nize never did make kitchen cabinets and in 1961, the company name was changed to HON. Today, The HON Company, a division of HNI Corporation is the predominant North American manufacturer and marketer of filing cabinets. The demand for filing cabinets was greatly expanded as a result of the commercial distribution of Xerography machines starting in 1950. This event enabled office workers to \\"have their own copy\\" of printed materials. Another influence is the expansion of government regulations that require businesses to create and keep forms and other documents. Some prognosticators have suggested the future of the filing cabinet is in doubt as electronic filing systems proliferate and become lower in cost. Nevertheless, most businesses are still purchasing computer systems with printing capabilities. Unless this trend is reversed, filing of paper is still a viable practice. In the US, these come in two sizes: for letter-size paper and legal-size paper. Most modern commercially oriented vertical filing cabinets in the US are manufactured in two-, three-, four-, and five-drawer versions in depths of 25, 26¬Ω, and 28 inches. The drawers are typically supported on a three-member suspension system that allows the drawer to be fully extended for complete access. The four-drawer vertical file, letter width, is the version purchased by most businesses. The two-drawer file is sold mostly for use alongside a desk. The five-drawer file is mostly purchased by Federal, State, and Local governments (in a version), as it typically provides the lowest cost per filing inch. Three drawer files, the least popular version, have the advantage of being at \\"countertop\\" height so end users can easily retrieve files and use the top of the cabinet as a work area to examine file contents. The drawers of most vertical filing cabinets are engineered to accept hanging file folders, as these have come to dominate the way most users store information. Some files still have a \\"follower block\\" in each drawer. This is a device that adjusts the apparent depth of the drawer interior so that files are kept upright in the drawer. These are the legacy of a time when most filing was done with manila folders rather than hanging files. For home offices or lighter use applications, vertical files are manufactured in versions. These typically have two-member suspensions and the drawers do not fully extend. Lateral file Files Lateral files are typically 20 inches deep and manufactured in 30-, 36-, and 42-inch widths and 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-drawer versions. The , two-drawer version is popular for use inside cubicle workstations, as it is engineered to fit under or alongside the cubicle work surfaces. Logic for the use of 3-, 4-, and 5-drawer files is similar to that of vertical files. Unlike vertical files, most lateral files allow for side-to-side or front-to-back filing. For letter-size files arranged front-to-back, the 30- and 42-inch-wide files are the most effective, as the maximum amount of filing per cabinet is enabled. A file, with letter-width filing front-to-back has no more capacity than a corresponding file, as the additional space would be wasted. Some users prefer side-to-side filing, as they can search index tabs from a seated position. All-width lateral files can accommodate this configuration, though the capacity of the file is somewhat diminished. An advantage for lateral files is that access and view of all files can be easier than with a vertical file because the drawers do not extend as far. In most instances, the top \\"5th drawer\\" of a five-drawer lateral file is a flipper door with pull-out shelf, as most people would not be able to access the top of a drawer at this height. Shelf file A shelf file is a cabinet designed to accommodate folders with tabs on the side rather than on the top. The cabinet has no drawers, only shelves. Some shelf files come with doors that recede into the cabinet. These cabinets are typically 12\\" or 18\\" deep, for letter or legal size folders respectively. Like lateral files, they are made in 30\\", 36\\", 42\\" and 45\\" widths but are usually only installed in 5-high and 6-high applications. Side tabbed files often use color codes that represent an alpha-numeric filing system. This methodology is a way to ensure files which are frequently retrieved and returned are easy to find and do not get lost. Finding a file is easy as to color-coded tabs easily lead the human eye to the appropriate location in the filing system. Similarly, a misfiled folder is obvious as an out-of-sequence color code is obvious to the user. Businesses such as doctors, dentists, veterinarians, police, and government agencies use shelf files and end-tabbed folders to manage large filing systems. Variations on traditional shelf files, designed to offer increased capacity for a given floor area, include Rotary Storage systems.  Specifications  Within the United States, the primary standard for vertical filing cabinets is the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA) Standard X5.3. BIFMA used to maintain a separate Standard X5.2 for lateral filing cabinets, but that standard has been withdrawn. The standards provide requirements for cabinet stability, durability, and strength, among others. The General Services Administration (GSA) also maintains standards for vertical and lateral steel filing cabinets, A-A-3186 and A-A-3187 respectively. The GSA standards define two grades of filing cabinets, medium- and heavy-duty. They reference the BIFMA standard for the medium-duty cabinets, and provide additional performance requirements for the heavy-duty cabinets. The GSA is also responsible for maintaining the standards for filing cabinets and security containers for storing classified materials; more information on that subject may be found in the article on classified information in the United States. In the United Kingdom the dimensions and certain aspects of rigidity, construction, and safety are covered by BS 4438:1969 and BS EN 14073-2:2004. The safety standards revolve particularly against stability with drawers fully open. Interlocking mechanisms to prevent opening two drawers at once are not mandatory, but the employer's responsibility under the Health and Safety at Work Act makes them advisable. In other EU states the EN 14073-2:2004 harmonised standard will be endorsed by the relevant standards agency, such as DIN in Germany. In Australia filing cabinets should be to AS 5079 a modified version of ANSI BIFMA X5.2-1997. Filing outside the US Non-US firms offer filing cabinets that permit A4 paper to be used in addition to letter-size. Double file cabinets have drawers which can each accommodate two racks for folders side by side. Many European companies engineer filing systems that accommodate hanging folders only; there are no drawer bottoms. In the US, most file drawers still have bottoms in the drawers so materials of any sort can be stored. UK filing cabinets are slightly different from US in the width of the rails which support the suspension files, the US ones being narrower; the UK sizes are known as A4, foolscap and A3. Decline As some offices have tended towards paperless operation - i.e. storing more and more information on computers, rather than on paper - filing cabinets, and indeed other office furniture for long-term archival storage, have been less in demand.

The code was developed by the recording industry in conjunction with the ISO technical committee 46, subcommittee 9 (TC 46/SC 9), which codified the standard as ISO 3901 in 1986, and updated it in 2001. An ISRC identifies a particular recording, not the work (composition and lyrical content) itself. Therefore, different recordings, edits, and remixes of the same work should each have their own ISRC. Works are identified by ISWC. Recordings remastered or revised in other ways should be assigned a new ISRC. https://isrc.ifpi.org/en/faq  History  ISO 3901 was completed in 1986. In 1988, the IFPI recommended that its member companies adopt ISRCs for music videos. In 1989, the ISO designated the IFPI as the registration authority for ISRCs. The IFPI, in turn, delegated part of the administration of ISRCs to several dozen national agencies, which allocate ISRCs to both record companies and individuals. The national agencies began assigning ISRCs for music videos in August 1989. The Japanese recording industry began encoding ISRCs on audio CDs in November 1989. The IFPI and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) then developed detailed recommendations for this practice, and for ISRC assignment in general. The IFPI adopted the recommendations in March 1991 and they went into effect for IFPI members on 1 January 1992.  Format  ISRC Code Example ISRC codes are always 12 characters long, in the form \\"CC-XXX-YY-NNNNN\\". The hyphens are not part of the ISRC code itself, but codes are often presented that way in print to make them easier to read. The four parts are as followsISRC Bulletin 2015/01 ‚Äì Validating an ISRC: * \\"CC\\" is the appropriate two-character country code for the ISRC issuer. The code is assigned according to the ISO 3166-1-Alpha-2 standard. (High demand for ISRCs within the United States has caused the supply of available registrant codes to become exhausted; after December 6, 2010, new registrants in the US use country code \\"QM\\".http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/isrc_bulletin-2010-02.pdf The codes \\"CP\\" and \\"DG\\" are reserved for further overflow, and \\"ZZ\\" is reserved for codes assigned by the International ISRC Agency.http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/isrc_bulletin-2012-01.pdf Further additions continue to be made.) * \\"XXX\\" is a three character alphanumeric registrant code of the ISRC issuer. This number by itself does NOT uniquely identify the ISRC issuer as the same 3-digit number may be used in various countries for different issuers. To uniquely identify an issuer, the country code and registrant code should be used together. * \\"YY\\" represent the last two digits of the reference year ‚Äì the year that the ISRC was assigned to the recording. This is not necessarily the date the recording was made. * \\"NNNNN\\" is a 5-digit number that identifies the particular sound or video recording, unique within the scope of the reference year. Example: A recording of the song \\"Crazy Eyes\\" by American duo Daryl Hall & John Oates has been allocated the ISRC code USRC17607839: * US for United States * RC1 for RCA * 76 for 1976 * 07839 as the unique id identifying this particular recording  Embedding ISRC in files  The most common file formats that ISRC codes can be embedded into presently are MP3, M4A, AAC, FLAC, and WAV for audio. For video ISRCs, embedding is generally performed on MP4 or M4V files. Embedding ISRCs into individual files for online distribution differs from embedding ISRCs onto a CD. The Red Book standard recommends to embed ISRCs onto CDs. The two types of ISRC embedding are not generally interchangeable and should be done separately. The standard for the ID3v2.2 tag that was designed for use in MP3 files, was published on March 2019 and defined a way to embed ISRCs in a 'TSRC' frame. On August 2020, the European Broadcasting Union published a specification for embedding ISRCs in Broadcast Wave Format. Obtaining ISRCs The provision of ISRCs is overseen by appointed national ISRC agencies. These national ISRC agencies issue codes directly to the public and may also utilize authorized ISRC Managers to issue ISRCs. In the United States, the appointed agency is RIAA. ISRC codes can be obtained in large blocks directly from RIAA for an administrative fee ($95 at time of this publication), in quantities as little as 1 from ISRC.com ($2-$5), or in conjunction with other music-related services from other authorized ISRC managers. In territories where there is no national ISRC agency, users can obtain ISRC codes directly from IFPI or from ISRC.com and Quansic.

Apparently, starting from 336 A.D. princes Amatuni was in charge of the tax service of the Armenian kingdom, when the Arshakids bestowed on them the fortress and possession of Oshakan in the heart of their Ayrarat royal domain, not far from the capital of the kingdom Dvin(Moses of Chorene 2.57). Historians described the battle that took place in 336 near Oshakan, between Armenians and Persians, in which Armenians won. For his valor in the liberation wars, in 336, the Armenian king Khosrov III presented Oshakan to Vahan Amatuni. During the wars, Amatuni sent their Suzerain (overlord), the king of Armenia, 500 horses and cavalry soldiers, which shows the political weight and military potential of this grand princely family . At the initiative of the princes Amatuni, creator of the Armenian alphabet Mesrop Mashtots was buried here. Nakharars Amatuni owned Oshakan until 773, after which these lands came under the control of the Bagratids.C. Toumanoff, Introduction to Christian Caucasian History II: Status and Dynasties of the Formative Period, Traditio, Vol. XVII, pp.1‚Äì107, 1961, Fordham University Press, New York. After the Sassanids of Iran abolished the Arsacid monarchy in Armenia in 428, Vahan (II) Amatuni was appointed by the Great King as assistant governor to the Iranian marzpan. However, the Sassanid propagation of Zoroastrianism among the Christian Armenian caused the reversal of Amatuni's loyalty and, in 451, Vahan revolted, only to be banished to Gorgan. In 451, the famous Battle of Avarayr between Armenians and Persians took place here in Artaz, south of Maku. Ironically, when preparations were underway for another insurrection in 482, it was an Amatuni, Varaz Sapuh, who revealed the plan to the Iranians. During the Roman-Iranian war of 572-91, Kotit Amatuni, together with other Armenian princes exasperated by the bureaucratic oppression of the emperor Maurice, fought on the Iranian side, but Amatuni fell into disgrace c. 596 at Ctesiphon, and the king of Iran had him executed. The transfer of regional power from the Sassanids to Muslim Arab rule provoked a large-scale aristocratic insurrection of 774-75. The revolt's failure forced many of its leaders to flee to Lazica or the Byzantine Empire. Sapuh Amatuni, his son Haman, and some 12,000 followers moved to Byzantium and established the Principality of Hamamshen in the Black Sea region of Lazistan. In the 9th century, Amatuni still remained in the possession of Artaz, but under the suzerainty of the Artsruni of Vaspurakan. In the 13th and 14th centuries, this house, under the name of Vachutean, once more came to prominence in the Georgian sphere of influence; under the suzerainty of the Mkhargrdzeli (Zakarid) princes, they ruled again over Aragatsotn, as well as a portion of Shirak and Nig, a key fortress in Amberd. The Vachutean genealogy, based on epigraphic data, was reconstructed by Marie Brosset and can be found in his Rapports sur un voyage arch√©ologique dans la G√©orgie et dans l'Arm√©nie (St. Petersburg 1849-1851) III: 99-100. The Artazian branch of Amatuni family was ruling castle of Maku (Shavarshan) stil in XVth century and successfully defend it during Timurleng invasion, when he besieged castle of Maku, as was stated in his book by castilian diplomat don Ruy Gonz√°lez de Clavijo, when he was traveling to the imperial court of emir Timurleng in Samarkand.http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/vida-y-hazanas-del-gran- tamorlan-con-la-descripcion-de-las-tierras-de-su-imperio-y-senorio-- 0/html/feed4b6c-82b1-11df-acc7-002185ce6064_1.htm#1 A branch of the family still controlled a fiefdom of Artaz in Maku down to the 1500s when Ottomans and Kurdish tribes toppled Armenian rule in the region.Maku, Iran while the branch which ruled Hamamshen was overthrown in the 15th century after the Ottomans invaded the empire of Trebizond and exiled its last prince Baron David II to Ispir.  Later family  After the Middle Ages the Amatuni family disappeared from history, though in 1784 a family of the same name () was recognized as descended from it, and therefore as princely, in the kingdom of Georgia. In the 17th century, one of the representatives of the Amatuni clan, a certain Azarbek I Amatuni, son of Prince George Amatuni, was a melik of the city of Nakhichevan-on-Arax. Melik Azarbek I had sons George, Petros (Peter) and Vahan, who faithfully served with their father the Iranian shah. The children and grandchildren of one of the sons, Peter Azarbekyan Amatuni, moved to the city of Tiflis, where on January 1, 1784, King Irakli II confirmed Sarkis (Sergey) Azaryan Petrovich Amatuni with his sons Stepan, Karapet, Gregory and his nephew Yakov Ivanovich Amatuni, they were in charge of the dignity of their ancestors, \\"who were at the time of the Armenian kings, the resplendent princes.\\" At the same time, the coat of arms was approved by the charter of the Georgian king Heraclius II of January 1, 1784. Another branch of the Amatuni clan, descendants of Allahverdi khan Amatuni, were meliks in Karadagh(Arasbaran) until 1918, and also they were on the board of directors of oil companies of Baku until 1917. After the Russian annexation of Georgia, the family was confirmed in the dignity of knyaz on March 25, 1826.–ê–º–∞—Ç—É–Ω–∏. Russian Biographic Lexicon. Retrieved on November 28, 2007.

In DOS, this may be referred to as an errorlevel. When computer programs are executed, the operating system creates an abstract entity called a process in which the book-keeping for that program is maintained. In multitasking operating systems such as Unix or Linux, new processes can be created by active processes. The process that spawns another is called a parent process, while those created are child processes. Child processes run concurrently with the parent process. The technique of spawning child processes is used to delegate some work to a child process when there is no reason to stop the execution of the parent. When the child finishes executing, it exits by calling the exit system call. This system call facilitates passing the exit status code back to the parent, which can retrieve this value using the wait system call. Semantics The parent and the child can have an understanding about the meaning of the exit statuses. For example, it is common programming practice for a child process to return (exit with) zero to the parent signifying success. Apart from this return value from the child, other information like how the process exited, either normally or by a signal may also be available to the parent process. The specific set of codes returned is unique to the program that sets it. Typically it indicates success or failure. The value of the code returned by the function or program may indicate a specific cause of failure. On many systems, the higher the value, the more severe the cause of the error. Alternatively, each bit may indicate a different condition, which are then evaluated by the or operator together to give the final value; for example, fsck does this. Sometimes, if the codes are designed with this purpose in mind, they can be used directly as a branch index upon return to the initiating program to avoid additional tests. AmigaOS In AmigaOS, MorphOS and AROS, four levels are defined: * OK 0 * WARN 5 * ERROR 10 * FAILURE 20 Shell and scripts Shell scripts typically execute commands and capture their exit statuses. For the shell‚Äôs purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded. A nonzero exit status indicates failure. This seemingly counter-intuitive scheme is used so there is one well- defined way to indicate success and a variety of ways to indicate various failure modes. When a command is terminated by a signal whose number is N, a shell sets the variable $? to a value greater than 128. Most shells use 128+N, while ksh93 uses 256+N. If a command is not found, the shell should return a status of 127. If a command is found but is not executable, the return status should be 126. Note that this is not the case for all shells. If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection, the exit status is greater than zero. C language The C programming language allows programs exiting or returning from the main function to signal success or failure by returning an integer, or returning the macros \`EXIT_SUCCESS\` and \`EXIT_FAILURE\`. On Unix-like systems these are equal to 0 and 1 respectively. A C program may also use the \`exit()\` function specifying the integer status or exit macro as the first parameter. The return value from \`main\` is passed to the \`exit\` function, which for values zero, \`EXIT_SUCCESS\` or \`EXIT_FAILURE\` may translate it to \\"an implementation defined form\\" of successful termination or unsuccessful termination. Apart from zero and the macros \`EXIT_SUCCESS\` and \`EXIT_FAILURE\`, the C standard does not define the meaning of return codes. Rules for the use of return codes vary on different platforms (see the platform-specific sections). DOS In DOS terminology, an errorlevel is an integer exit code returned by an executable program or subroutine. Errorlevels typically range from 0 to 255. In DOS there are only 256 error codes available. Exit statuses are often captured by batch programs. Java In Java, any method can call \`System.exit(int status)\`, unless a security manager does not permit it. This will terminate the currently running Java Virtual Machine. \\"The argument serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status code indicates abnormal termination.\\" OpenVMS In OpenVMS, success is indicated by odd values and failure by even values. The value is a 32 bit integer with sub-fields: control bits, facility number, message number and severity. Severity values are divided between success (Success, Informational) and failure (Warning, Error, Fatal). POSIX In Unix and other POSIX-compatible systems, the parent process can retrieve the exit status of a child process using the \`wait()\` family of system calls defined in wait.h. . Of these, the \`waitid()\` call retrieves the full 32-bit exit status, but the older \`wait()\` and \`waitpid()\` calls retrieve only the least significant 8 bits of the exit status. The \`wait()\` and \`waitpid()\` interfaces set a status value of type \`int\` packed as a bitfield with various types of child termination information. If the child terminated by exiting (as determined by the \`WIFEXITED()\` macro; the usual alternative being that it died from an uncaught signal), SUS specifies that the low-order 8 bits of the exit status can be retrieved from the status value using the \`WEXITSTATUS()\` macro. In the \`waitid()\` system call (added with SUSv1), the child exit status and other information are no longer in a bitfield but in the structure of type \`siginfo_t\`. POSIX-compatible systems typically use a convention of zero for success and nonzero for error. Some conventions have developed as to the relative meanings of various error codes; for example GNU recommend that codes with the high bit set be reserved for serious errors,. BSD-derived OS's have defined an extensive set of preferred interpretations: Meanings for 15 status codes 64 through 78 are defined in sysexits.h. These historically derive from sendmail and other message transfer agents, but they have since found use in many other programs.Google search for ¬´\\"sysexits.h\\" site:github.com¬ª reports ¬´About 3,540 results¬ª; retrieved 21 Feb 2013 01:30 UTC For portability reasons, glibc defines the macros EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE. The Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide and /usr/include/sysexits.h have some information on the meaning of non-0 exit status codes.http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html Windows Windows uses 32-bit unsigned integers as exit codes, although the command interpreter treats them as signed. If a process fails initialization, a Windows system error code may be returned. Exit codes are directly referenced, for example, by the command line interpreter CMD.exe in the \`errorlevel\` terminology inherited from DOS. .NET Framework processes and the Windows PowerShell refer to it as the \`ExitCode\` property of the \`Process\` object.

It was first published in London in 1991, after Dahl's death, by Century. The protagonist is a dyslexic vicar, and the book was written to benefit the Dyslexia Institute in London (now Dyslexia Action), with Dahl and Blake donating their rights. Summary The Reverend Robert Lee, the new vicar of Nibbleswicke, is suffering from a rare and acutely embarrassing condition: Back-to-Front Dyslexia, a fictional type of dyslexia that causes the sufferer to say the most important word (often being the verb) in a sentence backwards, creating comedic situations. For example, instead of saying knits, he will say stink; god would be dog etc. It affects only his speech, and he doesn't realize he's doing it, but the parishioners of Nibbleswicke are shocked and confused by his seemingly outrageous comments, especially the church's most generous benefactor, Miss Arabella Prewt, who does not take kindly to being called 'Miss Twerp'. However, thanks to the local doctor, a cure is found (walking backwards everywhere for the rest of his life), and the mild-mannered vicar can resume normal service. The book contains a reference to Dahl's previous novel Esio Trot, noting that its title is tortoise backwards.

Specimens can grow up to in length from snout to vent, and weigh up to . This species has a relatively small habitat range in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. Its numbers are dwindling due to habitat destruction and its collection for food and the pet trade.  Description  The sexes of the goliath frog are similar. In a sample of 15 individuals, weights ranged between , and snout-vent lengths were between . Their eyes can be nearly in diameter. The conspicuous tympanum has a diameter around and is separated from the eye by about in adults. Goliath frog eggs and tadpoles are about the same size as other frogs despite their very large adult form. A lateral fold extends from the eye to the posterior portion of the tympanum. Toes are fully webbed, with large interdigital membranes extending down to the toe tips. The second toe is the longest. The skin on the dorsum and on top of the limbs is granular. Dorsal coloration is green sienna, while the abdomen and ventral part of the limbs are yellow/orange. They have acute hearing, but no vocal sac, and also lack nuptial pads.  Distribution and habitat  The goliath frog is normally found in and near fast-flowing rivers with sandy bottoms in the Middle African countries of Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. These rivers are usually clear and highly oxygenated. Their actual range spans from the last of the Sanaga basin in Cameroon to the north to the last of the Benito River basin in Equatorial Guinea to the south. The river systems in which these frogs live are often found in dense, extremely humid areas with relatively high temperatures. Although generally staying in the rivers during the day, they often emerge on land during the night.  Ecology and behavior   Reproduction  Like most amphibians, water is vital for their reproduction. Because the goliath frog lacks a vocal sac, it does not produce mating calls, a behavior generally present in frogs and toads. The egg masses consist of several hundred to a few thousand eggs, approximately each, and often attached to aquatic vegetation. There are three main nest types, all semi-circular in shape and located in or near a river: In the first they clear a section in a river pool. In the second they expand an already existing pool, daming it off from the river. In the final they dig a pool, roughly wide and deep, sometimes moving quite large stones in the process. This may partially explain the goliath frog's large size, as larger frogs may be more successful at moving heavy objects when constructing their nests. Adults have also been shown to guard the nests at night. Although not confirmed, there are indications that the nest is constructed by the male, while the female guards the nest with the eggs. Larval development takes between 85 and 95 days.  Diet  Goliath tadpoles are herbivorous and feed on a single aquatic plant, Dicraeia warmingii (Podostemaceae), found only near waterfalls and rapids, which may help explain their restricted range. Adult goliath frogs feed on spiders, worms, and insects, such as dragonflies and locusts. They also eat smaller frogs, crabs, baby turtles, and young snakes. A bat reportedly was found in a goliath frog's stomach.  Longevity  The goliath frog can live up to 15 years in the wild. In captivity, they can live up to 21 years. It is preyed upon by snakes, Nile crocodiles, Nile monitors, and humans, among other predators. Conservation Preserved specimen at the Harvard Museum of Natural History The primary threat to the goliath frog is hunting, as it is considered a food source in its native range. The IUCN has highlighted the need for conservation measures, in cooperation with local communities, to make sure the hunting is at sustainable levels. To a lesser extent they are also threatened by habitat loss and degradation. They were extensively exported to zoos and the pet trade, but have proven shy and nervous in captivity. Although captives may live longer than their wild counterparts, the species has not been bred in captivity. Due to their classification as an endangered species, the Equatorial Guinean government has declared that no more than 300 goliaths may be exported per year for the pet trade, but few now seem to be exported from this country.

It contains about 250 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia. Verbena officinalis, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe. Description The leaves are usually opposite, simple, and in many species hairy, often densely so. The flowers are small, with five petals, and borne in dense spikes. Typically some shade of blue, they may also be white, pink, or purple, especially in cultivars. The genus can be divided into a diploid North American and a polyploid South American lineage, both with a base chromosome number of seven. The European species is derived from the North American lineage. It seems that verbena as well as the related mock vervains (Glandularia) evolved from the assemblage provisionally treated under the genus name Junellia; both other genera were usually included in the Verbenaceae until the 1990s. Intergeneric chloroplast gene transfer by an undetermined mechanism ‚Äì though probably not hybridization ‚Äì has occurred at least twice from vervains to Glandularia, between the ancestors of the present-day South American lineages and once more recently, between V. orcuttiana or V. hastata and G. bipinnatifida. In addition, several species of verbena are of natural hybrid origin; the well-known garden vervain has an entirely muddy history. The relationships of this close-knit group are therefore hard to resolve with standard methods of computational phylogenetics. Cultivation Purpletop vervain (V. bonariensis) as an ornamental plant Some species, hybrids and cultivars of verbena are used as ornamental plants. They are drought-resistant, tolerating full to partial sun, and enjoy well-drained, average soils. Plants are usually grown from seed. Some species and hybrids are not hardy and are treated as half-hardy annuals in bedding schemes. They are valued in butterfly gardening in suitable climates, attracting Lepidoptera such as the Hummingbird hawk-moth, Chocolate albatross, or the Pipevine swallowtail, and also hummingbirds, especially V. officinalis, which is also grown as a honey plant. The hybrid cultivars \\"Silver Anne\\" and \\"Sissinghurst\\" have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Pests and diseases For some verbena pathogens, see List of verbena diseases. Cultivated verbenas are sometimes parasitized by Sweet potato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) and spread this pest to other crops. Uses Although verbena (\\"vervain\\") has been used in herbalism and traditional medicine, usually as an herbal tonic, there is no high-quality evidence for its effectiveness. Verbena has been listed as one of the 38 plants used to prepare Bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its effect on health. According to Cancer Research UK, \\"essence therapists believe that using essences can help to increase your mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. However, essences are not used to prevent, control, or cure cancer or any other physical condition.\\" The essential oil of various species, mainly common vervain, is traded as \\"Spanish verbena oil\\". Considered inferior to oil of lemon verbena (Aloysia citrodora) in perfumery, it is of some commercial importance for herbalism. In culture common vervain (V. officinalis) from Deutschlands Flora in Abbildungen by Johann Georg Sturm and Jacob Sturm, 1796 Verbena has long been associated with divine and other supernatural forces. It was called \\"tears of Isis\\" in ancient Egypt, and later called \\"Hera's tears\\". In ancient Greece it was dedicated to Eos Erigineia. The generic name is the Latin term for a plant sacred to the ancient Romans. Pliny the Elder describes verbena presented on Jupiter altars; it is not entirely clear if this referred to a verbena rather than the general term for prime sacrificial herbs. Pliny the Elder notes \\"the Magi especially make the maddest statements about the plant: that [among other things] a circle must be drawn with iron round the plant\\". The common names of verbena in many Central and Eastern European languages often associate it with iron. These include for example the Dutch ' (\\"iron-hard\\"), Danish ' (\\"medical ironwort\\"), German ' (\\"true ironherb\\"), Slovak ' (\\"medical ironherb\\"), and Hungarian ' (\\"iron grass\\"). In the early Christian era, folk legend stated that V. officinalis was used to staunch Jesus' wounds after his removal from the cross. It was consequently called \\"holy herb\\" or (e.g. in Wales) \\"Devil's bane\\". Vervain flowers are engraved on cimaruta, Italian anti-stregheria charms. In the 1870 The History and Practice of Magic by \\"Paul Christian\\" (Jean-Baptiste Pitois) it is employed in the preparation of a mandragora charm.Pitois, Christian (1952). The History and Practice of Magic, Volume 2, Forge Press. p. 402. The book also describes its antiseptic capabilities (p. 336), and use as a protection against spells (pp. 339, 414).Pitois, (1952) pp. 336, 339, 414 While common vervain is not native to North America, it has been introduced there and for example the Pawnee have adopted it as an entheogen enhancer and in oneiromancy (dream divination), much as Calea zacatechichi is used in Mexico. An indeterminate vervain is among the plants on the eighth panel of the New World Tapestry (Expedition to Cape Cod).

The Karens were one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran and were of Parthian origin. In the Byzantine-Sasanian era, the Kamsarakan were mostly known for following a pro-Byzantine policy. In the late 8th century, they met their downfall as a result of participating in an uprising against Arab rule. After the 8th century, a branch of the Kamsarakan, the Pahlavuni, rose to prominence. According to Cyril Toumanoff the Pahlavunis in turn had two branches: the Mkhargrdzeli, associated with the Kingdom of Georgia; and the Hethumids, associated with the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Background and history The Kamsarakan family A branch of the House of Karen (Karen-Pahlav), one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran, the name of Kamsarakan is derived from Prince Kamsar, who died in 325. The Kamsarakans had their base in the \\"two princely states\\", which were both located in the historic region of Ayrarat-Arsharunik. The city of Yervandashat, in present-day eastern Turkey, was their capital. The fortresses of Bagaran, Artagers, Shirak and Ani (which later became a city) were also associated with the Kamsarakan. From their establishment the Kamsarakans enjoyed prestige due to being the cousins of the Parthian Karens. Following the demise of the last Arsacid branch (the Armenian branch) in 428 they acquired a large amount of political power due to their position as important border lords; or, as Toumanoff puts it \\"to their quasi-margravial position on the northern frontier of the realm\\". The Kamsarakans had a high rank in the order of precedence of the Armenian princes; they supposedly ranked second \\"of the four broad classes\\". As such they had a feudal obligation to supply 600 horses to their suzerain, the King of Armenia. According to Cyril Toumanoff / Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, due to the geographical location of their principalities, the Kamsarakan were not involved \\"in any special way in Armino-Iranian relations\\". However, according to Parvaneh Pourshariati / Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, the Kamsarakan \\"were directly involved in the history of the Byzantines and the Sasanians\\". When the Roman Empire annexed the western part of historic Armenia, GazavonII Kamsarak and other family members moved to Sasanian Armenia, at the time ruled by an Armenian vassal. Prior to this GazavonII had been the leader of the pro-Roman Armenian princes. Later another Kamsarakan family member, ArshavirII, is recorded as having participated in the anti-Sasanian revolt led by Vardan Mamikonian. ArshavirII also took part in the insurrection of 482‚Äì484, together with his son and successor Narses. The Kamsarakans were known for following a broadly pro-Byzantine policy, and they were actively involved in the political life of the empire as well. For example, three brothers from the Kamsarakan family served as generals for Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565); Narses, Isaac the Armenian (Sahak), and another Isaac (Sahak), who was executed by the king of the Ostrogoths, Totila, in 546. A later Kamsarakan, NarsesII Kamsarakan, served as presiding prince of Armenia for the Byzantine emperor in the late 7th century, and also held the high- ranking Byzantine office of curopalates. Another individual, presumably a Kamsarak, was the patrician Arsaber (Arshavir), noted for revolting against the Byzantine emperor in 808. The Kamsarakans took part in the revolt against Arab rule in Armenia in 771‚Äì772. When the insurrection failed, the Kamsarakan were amongst the \\"victims of the disaster\\", and they had no choice but to sell their \\"double princedom\\" to the Bagratids. The Pahlavuni family In the Bagratid era, the Kamsarakan rose to prominence once again, now represented by its cadet branch the Pahlavunis, led by the princes Bdjni and Nig. Cyril Toumanoff notes: When the Bagratids were destroyed and Prince Gregory II abdicated in 1045‚Äì1046 to allow the Byzantine emperor to assume control over his lands, the Pahlavunis moved to Cilicia, where they were known as the Hethumids. They dominated this \\"last phase of Armenia‚Äôs political history\\", first as princes of Lambrun, and after 1226, as kings of Armenia. When the Hethumids died out in the 14th century the Armenian crown passed, through inheritance, to the Lusignan dynasty of Cyprus, and afterwards to the House of Savoy. The Mkhargrdzeli, another branch of the Pahlavunis, were a dominant force in the Kingdom of Georgia in the 12th14th centuries, and \\"has survived to this day\\". Patrons of architecture The Kamsarakans and their Pahlavuni branch, and in turn the Mkhargrdzelis, were known for being patrons of Armenian architecture. Notable examples of structures built by the family include castles and palaces, as well as \\"splendid churches\\", such as the Church of St. Gregory (commissioned by AbughamrI Pahlavuni).

This includes head lice, scabies, river blindness (onchocerciasis), strongyloidiasis, trichuriasis, ascariasis, and lymphatic filariasis. It can be taken by mouth or applied to the skin for external infestations. Use in the eyes should be avoided. Common side effects include red eyes, dry skin, and burning skin. It is unclear if it is safe for use during pregnancy, but is probably acceptable for use during breastfeeding. It belongs to the avermectin family of medications. It works by causing the parasite's cell membrane to increase in permeability, resulting in paralysis and death. Ivermectin was discovered in 1975 and came into medical use in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In other animals, it is used to prevent and treat heartworm and acariasis, among other indications.  Medical uses  Pinworms Ivermectin is as effective as albendazole or alternative antinematode drugs for treatment of pinworm infection (enterobiasis). River blindness Ivermectin is used for prevention, treatment, and control of river blindness (onchocerciasis) in populations where the disease is common. However, ivermectin is contraindicated in persons with a high burden of loiasis (e.g., >20,000 Loa loa microfilariae per mL), due to risk of ivermectin-associated severe inflammatory events. A single dose of ivermectin reduces microfilaridermia by 98‚Äì99% after 1‚Äì2 months. Ivermectin does not kill adult worms. A single oral dose of ivermectin, taken once or twice a year for the 1015-year lifespan of the adult worms, is required to protect the individual from river blindness. A 2012 Cochrane review found weak evidence suggesting that ivermectin could result in the reduction of chorioretinal lesions and prevent loss of vision in people with river blindness. Moxidectin has been approved by the FDA for use in people with river blindness, has a longer half-life than ivermectin, and may eventually supplant ivermectin, as it is a more potent microfilaricide, but there is a need for additional clinical trials, with long-term follow-up, to assess whether moxidectin is safe and effective for treatment of nematode infection in children and women of childbearing potential. Loa loa filariasis A single dose of ivermectin gives a rapid and durable decrease in body burden of eyeworm (Loa loa). The risk of ivermectin-associated severe adverse drug events is very low in persons with less than 20,000 microfilariae per mL of blood. Threadworm Ivermectin is more effective than albendazole and equally as effective as thiabendazole for treatment of threadworm (strongyloidiasis). Ivermectin has fewer adverse effects than does thiabendazole and is at least as well tolerated as albendazole. An analysis based on an economic model suggests that it is cost effective for people moving to Europe from areas where threadworm is common to be given a single- dose of ivermectin on arrival so as to cure presumptive infection with threadworm. Persons who are immunocompromised or who will receive immunosuppressive treatment and who have confirmed or presumptive threadworm infestation are likely to benefit from treatment with ivermectin. Whipworm Combination therapy with ivermectin plus albendazole is effective for treatment of whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) and the rate of Mazzotti reaction is no higher than for albendazole alone. Lymphatic filariasis Combination therapy with ivermectin plus albendazole is effective for treatment of Lymphatic filariasis due to Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, or Brugia timori.  Arthropod  Evidence supports its use against parasitic arthropods and insects: * Mites such as scabies: It is usually limited to cases that prove to be resistant to topical treatments or that present in an advanced state (such as Norwegian scabies). One review found that the efficacy of permethrin is similar to that of systemic or topical ivermectin. A separate review found that although oral ivermectin is usually effective for treatment of scabies, it does have a higher treatment failure rate than topical permethrin. Another review found that oral ivermectin provided a reasonable balance between efficacy and safety. Since ivermectin is more convenient than permethrin, many have turned to veterinary sources of the drug to obtain assurance of a cure at an affordable price. * Lice: Ivermectin lotion (0.5%) is FDA-approved for patients six months of age and older. After a single, 10-minute application of this formulation on dry hair, 78% of subjects were found to be free of lice after two weeks. This level of effectiveness is equivalent to other pediculicide treatments requiring two applications. * Bedbugs: There is tentative evidence that ivermectin kills bedbugs, as part of integrated pest management for bedbug infestations. Such use however may require a prolonged course of treatment which is of unclear safety. * Malaria-bearing mosquitos, such as Anopheles gambiae: Mass drug administration of a population with ivermectin for purposes of treating/preventing nematode infestation is effective for eliminating malaria-bearing mosquitos and thereby reducing infection with residual malaria parasites.  Rosacea  A review found that ivermectin was effective for treatment of rosacea. An ivermectin cream has been approved by the FDA, as well as in Europe, for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea. The treatment is based upon the hypothesis that parasitic mites of the genus Demodex play a role in rosacea. In a clinical study, ivermectin reduced lesions by 83% over 4 months, as compared to 74% under a metronidazole standard therapy.\\"  Contraindications  Ivermectin is contraindicated in children under the age of five or those who weigh less than , and individuals with liver or kidney disease. Ivermectin is secreted in very low concentration in breast milk. It remains unclear if ivermectin is safe during pregnancy.  Adverse effects  The main concern is neurotoxicity, which in most mammalian species may manifest as central nervous system depression, and consequent ataxia, as might be expected from potentiation of inhibitory GABA-ergic synapses. Since drugs that inhibit the enzyme CYP3A4 often also inhibit P-glycoprotein transport, the risk of increased absorption past the blood- brain barrier exists when ivermectin is administered along with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. These drugs include statins, HIV protease inhibitors, many calcium channel blockers, lidocaine, the benzodiazepines, and glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone.Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11th edition, pages 122, 1084‚Äì1087. For dogs, the insecticide spinosad may have the effect of increasing the toxicity of ivermectin.  Pharmacology   Pharmacodynamics  Ivermectin and other avermectins (insecticides most frequently used in home-use ant baits) are macrocyclic lactones derived from the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis. Ivermectin kills by interfering with nervous system and muscle function, in particular by enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission. The drug binds to glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) in the membranes of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells, causing increased permeability to chloride ions, resulting in cellular hyper- polarization, followed by paralysis and death. GluCls are invertebrate- specific members of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels present in neurons and myocytes.  Pharmacokinetics  Ivermectin can be given by mouth, topically, or via injection. It does not readily cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier of mammals due to the presence of P-glycoprotein, (the MDR1 gene mutation affects function of this protein). Crossing may still become significant if ivermectin is given at high doses (in which case, brain levels peak 2‚Äì5 hours after administration). In contrast to mammals, ivermectin can cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier in tortoises, often with fatal consequences.  Ecotoxicity  Field studies have demonstrated the dung of animals treated with ivermectin supports a significantly reduced diversity of invertebrates, and the dung persists longer.  History  The discovery of the avermectin family of compounds, from which ivermectin is chemically derived, was made by Satoshi ≈åmura of Kitasato University, Tokyo and William C. Campbell of the Merck Institute for Therapeutic research. ≈åmura identified avermectin from the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis. Campbell purified avermectin from cultures obtained from ≈åmura and led efforts leading to the discovery of ivermectin, a derivative of greater potency and lower toxicity. Ivermectin was introduced in 1981. Half of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to Campbell and ≈åmura for discovering avermectin, \\"the derivatives of which have radically lowered the incidence of river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, as well as showing efficacy against an expanding number of other parasitic diseases\\". Society and culture Cost The initial price, proposed by Merck in 1987, was US$6. The company donated hundreds of millions of courses of treatments since 1988 in more than 30 countries. Between 1995 and 2010 the program using donated ivermectin to prevent river blindness is estimated to have prevented 7 million years of disability well costing US$257 million. , the cost effectiveness of treating scabies and lice with ivermectin has not been studied. As of 2019 ivermectin tablets in the United States were the least expensive treatment option for lice in children at about US$10. The hair lotion, however, costs about US$300 for a course of treatment.  Brand names  Ivermectin is available as a generic prescription drug in the U.S. in a 3 mg tablet formulation. It is also sold under the brand names Heartgard, Sklice and Stromectol in the United States, Ivomec worldwide by Merial Animal Health, Mectizan in Canada by Merck, Iver-DT in Nepal by Alive Pharmaceutical and Ivexterm in Mexico by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. In Southeast Asian countries, it is marketed by Delta Pharma Ltd. under the trade name Scabo 6. The formulation for rosacea treatment is sold as Soolantra. While in development, it was assigned the code MK-933 by Merck.  Veterinary use  Ivermectin is routinely used to control parasitic worms in the gastrointestinal tract of ruminant animals. These parasites normally enter the animal when it is grazing, pass the bowel and set and mature in the intestines, after which they produce eggs which leave the animal via its droppings and can infest new pastures. Ivermectin is effective in killing some, but not all, of these parasites. In dogs it is routinely used as prophylaxis against heartworm. Dogs with defects in the P-glycoprotein gene (MDR1), often collie-like herding dogs, can be severely poisoned by ivermectin. The mnemonic \\"white feet, don't treat\\" refers to Scotch collies that are vulnerable to ivermectin. Some other dog breeds (especially the Rough Collie, the Smooth Collie, the Shetland Sheepdog, and the Australian Shepherd), also have a high incidence of mutation within the MDR1 gene (coding for P-glycoprotein) and are sensitive to the toxic effects of ivermectin. Clinical evidence suggests kittens are susceptible to ivermectin toxicity. A 0.01% ivermectin topical preparation for treating ear mites in cats is available. Ivermectin is sometimes used as an acaricide in reptiles, both by injection and as a diluted spray. While this works well in some cases, care must be taken, as several species of reptiles are very sensitive to ivermectin. Use in turtles is particularly contraindicated.  Research  Ivermectin is being studied as a potential antiviral agent against chikungunya and yellow fever. In 2013, this antiparasitic drug was demonstrated as a novel ligand of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a therapeutic target for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. Ivermectin is also of interest in the prevention of malaria, as it is toxic to both the malaria plasmodium itself, and the mosquitos that carry it. Use of ivermectin at higher doses necessary to control malaria is probably safe, though large clinical trials have not yet been done to definitively establish the efficacy and safety of ivermectin for prophylaxis or treatment of malaria. SARS-CoV-2 Ivermectin has antiviral effects against several distinct positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Ivermectin inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in monkey kidney cell culture with an IC50 of 2.2 - 2.8 ¬µM, making it a possible candidate for COVID-19 drug repurposing research. The doses used in cell culture would require 10 larger doses in humans based on this data, which does not look promising as an effective treatment for COVID-19. Such high doses of ivermectin are not covered by the current human-use approvals of the drug and could be dangerous, as the likely antiviral mechanism of action is the suppression of a host cellular process, specifically the inhibition of nuclear transport by importin Œ±/Œ≤1. Moreover, cell culture experiments also showed promise for ivermectin treating Dengue, but later failed in animal models. On 10 April 2020, the FDA issued guidance to not use ivermectin intended for animals as treatment for COVID-19 in humans. A preprint published in early April 2020 claimed benefits of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19, but it was a retrospective study based on questionable hospital data from Surgisphere and was withdrawn at the end of May. The preprint led to several government agencies in Latin America recommending ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment; these recommendations were later denounced by the regional WHO office. As of July, ivermectin was being studied in 19 ongoing and 18 planned clinical trials. A preprint published on 10 June 2020 reported on an observational retrospective study of COVID-19 patients at four Florida hospitals and found a significantly lower mortality in those who had received ivermectin.

It gained mainstream exposure when it was featured in Madonna's song and video \\"Vogue\\" (1990), and when showcased in the 1990 documentary Paris Is Burning (which went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at the 1991 Sundance Film Festival). In its modern form, this dance has become a global phenomenon that continues to evolve both stylistically and demographically.  History  This style of dance arose from Harlem ballroom cultures, as danced by African- American and Latino gay/trans people, from the early 1960s through the 1980s. The Harlem Renaissance shaped a distinctly black LGBTQ culture in Harlem from 1920 to 1935, which included advancement in literature, arts and music and demonstration that aspects of identity like race, gender and sexuality can be fluid and intersecting. The drag competitions that began during this time eventually shifted from elaborate pageantry to vogue dance battles. Inspired by the style of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs and the famous images of models in Vogue magazine, voguing is characterized by striking a series of poses as if one is modeling for a photo shoot. Arm and leg movements are angular, linear, rigid, and move swiftly from one static position to another. Dance competitions often involved throwing \\"shade,\\" or subtle insults directed at one another in order to impress the judges and the audience. The competition style was originally called \\"presentation\\" and later \\"performance.\\" Over the years, the dance evolved into the more intricate and acrobatic form that is now called \\"vogue\\". Vogue dance presents gender as a performance. Drag queens pretend to apply makeup (\\"beat face\\"), style hair and don extravagant clothing through the dance moves. Depending on the competition category, participants may perform the traditional behaviors of their assigned sex to demonstrate \\"realness,\\" or passing as straight. Although there are varying gender and sexuality classifications and categories, each fits into either Female Figure (FF) or Male Figure (MF). Female Figure includes trans women, cisgender women and drag queens, while Male Figure includes butch queens, butch women and cisgender men. No matter the category, performances and competitions are camp (style), which embodies the spirit of extravagance and is exaggerated and artificial. The precise origins of voguing are disputed. Although many cite the story in which Paris Dupree takes out a Vogue magazine and mimics the poses to the beat of the music (and other queens subsequently followed), there are other accounts that note voguing may have originated from black gay prison inmates at Rikers Island, performed for the attention of other men as well as throwing shade. Voguing is continually being developed further as an established dance form that is practiced in the Black and Latino gay ballroom scene, and clubs in major cities throughout the United States and around the globe ‚Äî mainly New York City and Paris.  Styles  There are currently three distinct styles of vogue: Old Way (pre-1990); New Way (post-1990); and Vogue Fem (circa 1995).  Old way  Old way is characterized by the formation of lines, symmetry, and precision in the execution of formations with graceful, fluid-like action. Egyptian hieroglyphs and fashion poses serve as the original inspirations for old way voguing. In its purest, historical form, old way vogue is a duel between two rivals. Traditionally, old way rules dictated that one rival must \\"pin\\" the other to win the contest. Pinning involved the trapping of an opponent so that they could not execute any movements while the adversary was still in motion (usually voguing movements with the arms and hands called \\"hand performance\\" while the opponent was \\"pinned\\" against the floor doing \\"floor exercises\\" or against a wall).  New way  New way is characterized by rigid movements coupled with \\"clicks\\" (limb contortions at the joints) and \\"arms control\\" (hand and wrist illusions, which sometimes includes tutting and locking). New way can also be described as a modified form of mime in which imaginary geometric shapes, such as a box, are introduced during motion and moved progressively around the dancer's body to display the dancer's dexterity and memory. New way involves incredible flexibility.  Vogue Fem  Vogue Fem (\\"Fem\\" is derived from the French word ', meaning \\"woman\\") is fluidity at its most extreme with exaggerated feminine movements influenced by ballet, jazz and modern dance. Styles of Vogue Fem performances range from Dramatics (which emphasizes stunts, tricks, and speed) to Soft (which emphasizes a graceful, beautiful, and easy flow continuations between the five elements). There are currently five elements of Vogue Fem: * Duckwalk: The duck walk receives its name from the appearance the name references (a duck walking) that involves squatting on your heels and kicking your feet out as you move forward on the beat. * Catwalk: Catwalking is an exaggerated feminine walk where the legs are crossed over each other, the hips are thrust from side to side, and the hands are thrown forward in opposition to the legs. * Hands: In performance, the hands of the performer often told a story. This is the component of performing used to throw shade. For example, miming an expression of horror at the way the opponents face looks. * Floorwork: This component demonstrates the competitors' sensuality as they roll, twist, and otherwise move on the ground in such a way as to capture the attention of the judges. * Spins and Dips: This is the showiest component of vogue. These are the turns on beat, and the drops to the floor. A spin or dip is only done correctly when executed with the climax happening on the beat.

New York State continues to be the mecca of the ballroom scene as well as the dance style, but regional voguing \\"capitals\\" exist‚ÄîChicago and Detroit for the Midwest. Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Miami for the South. Los Angeles and Las Vegas for the West Coast. Baltimore, D.C, Connecticut, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh. and Virginia for the East Coast. International cities in Western Europe (the U.K., France, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Sweden), Eastern Europe, Latin America (Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama) and Asia Pacific (Japan and New Zealand) have sprouted and held competitions inspired by voguing from the original balls of New York City.  Influences  Madonna and her dancers vogueing on the 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour. The singer brought global exposure to the then-underground dance. Several notable pop celebrities and artists were influenced by Voguing. Madonna, Teyana Taylor, Rihanna, Willow Smith, FKA Twigs, Ariana Grande, and Azealia Banks have all taken inspiration from voguing from dances of past and contemporary voguers, while also incorporating the beats traditionally attached to the dance. One of the most recent influences of voguing (and Ball culture) comes from the documentary film Kiki, in which contemporary Balls and Voguing is represented through the scenes and styles that now exist. When the dance culture of New York travelled to Berlin, many people went to clubs to show off their best moves. At a time when discrimination was very severe especially for those exploring their identities, these clubs offered people a space to avoid those struggles. People focused on their dance and outdoing their peers and competitors rather than society's rejection of minority groups. The House of Melody was the first German voguing house. It brought together people passionate for voguing. They emphasized ignoring people's backgrounds and instead understanding everyone's shared belief in love for all. These clubs were important for people who might have been looking for a place to escape the challenges that they faced on the streets or at home. The empowerment that was generated in these spaces transferred into contributing to a broader movement that would tend to the struggles of minorities in Germany. Although Madonna's song 'Vogue' brought popularity and awareness to the dance style, the pop singer still received criticism from those who believe she exploited and appropriated the ballroom culture. Cultural appropriation involves the adoption of certain aspects of a minority or disadvantaged culture by a member of the majority culture without proper acknowledgement of the origin. The 1990 music video was choreographed by Jose Gutierrez Xtravaganza and Luis Camacho (dancer) of the House of Xtravaganza and featured Willi Ninja as a dancer. However, all of the celebrities mentioned in the song are white, and Madonna herself is a white woman. Even though Madonna referenced the Harlem ballroom culture by including members of the community in the production of the video, critics still say that she erased the originating culture since she is the primary mainstream association with the style.

The name \\"Kosovo\\" is derived from the Kosovo Plain, where the Battle of Kosovo was fought between a coalition of Balkan states and the Ottoman Empire. Kosovo's modern history can be traced to the Ottoman Sanjak of Prizren, of which parts were organised into Kosovo Vilayet in 1877. In antiquity, Dardania covered the area, which formed part of the larger Roman province of Moesia in the 1st century AD. In the Middle Ages, the region became part of the Bulgarian Empire, the Byzantine Empire and the Serbian medieval states. It was then conquered by the Ottoman Empire an exact 70 years after the Battle of Kosovo. In 1913 the Kosovo Vilayet was incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbia, which in 1918 formed Yugoslavia. Kosovo gained autonomy in 1963 under Josip Broz Tito's direction, an autonomy which was significantly extended by Yugoslavia's 1974 Constitution, but lost its autonomous institutions in 1990. In 1999 UNMIK stepped in. On 17 February 2008 Kosovo's Parliament declared independence, as the Republic of Kosovo, with partial recognition of that declaration. Prehistory In prehistory, the succeeding Starƒçevo culture, Vinƒça culture, Bubanj-Hum culture, Baden culture were active in the region. The area in and around Kosovo has been inhabited for nearly 10,000 years. During the Neolithic age, Kosovo lay within the areal of the Vinƒça-Turda≈ü culture which is characterised by West Balkan black and grey pottery.

A Short History\\" and Real Facts The favourable Geo-strategic position, as well as abundant natural resources, were ideal for the development of life since the prehistoric periods, proven by hundreds of archaeological sites discovered and identified throughout Kosovo, which proudly present its rich archaeological heritage.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo, Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, p. 7. The number of sites with archaeological potential is increasing, this as a result of findings and investigations that are carried out throughout Kosovo but also from many superficial traces which offer a new overview of antiquity of Kosovo. The earliest traces documented in the territory of Kosovo belong to the Stone Age Period, namely there are indications that cave dwellings might have existed like for example the Radivojce Cave set near the spring of the Drin river, then there are some indications at Grnƒçar Cave in the Vitina municipality, Dema and Karamakaz Caves of Peƒá and others. However, life during the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age is not confirmed yet and not scientifically proven. Therefore, until arguments of Paleolithic and Mesolithic man are confirmed, Neolithic man, respectively the Neolithic sites are considered as the chronological beginning of population in Kosovo. From this period until today Kosovo has been inhabited, and traces of activities of societies from prehistoric, ancient and up to medieval time are visible throughout its territory. Whereas, in some archaeological sites, multilayer settlements clearly reflect the continuity of life through centuries.Milot Berisha, Archaeological Guide of Kosovo, Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, p. 8. Vlashnj√´ and Runik are two Neolithic sites which have found and excavated in a series of expeditions. Vlashnj√´ is a multi-layered settlement and site area. Archaeological excavations have identified habitation and use of the area since the Neolithic era. The rock art paintings at Mrrizi i Kobaj√´s (late Neolithic-early Bronze Age) are the first find of prehistoric rock art in Kosovo. In late antiquity, Vlashnja was a fortified settlement part of the fortification network which Justinian I rebuilt along the White Drin in Dardania. Antiquity During the Neolithic age, Kosovo lay within the areal of the Vinƒça-Turda≈ü culture, Starƒçevo and Baden culture, which is characterised by West Balkan black and grey pottery. Bronze and Iron Age tombs have been found only in Rrafshi i Dukagjinit which is located in Kosovo. In classical antiquity, the area of Kosovo was part of Dardania. The name comes from the Dardani, a tribe that lived in the region and formed the Kingdom of Dardania in the 4th century BC. In archaeological research, Illyrian names are predominant in western Dardania (present-day Kosovo), while Thracian names are mostly found in eastern Dardania (present-day south-eastern Serbia). The eastern parts of the region were at the Thraco-Illyrian contact zone. Thracian names are absent in western Dardania; some Illyrian names appear in the eastern parts. The correspondence of Illyrian names - including those of the ruling elite - in Dardania with those of the southern Illyrians suggests a \\"thracianization\\" of parts of Dardania. The Dardani became one of the most powerful Illyrian states of their time under their king Bardylis.Hammond, Nicholas Geoffrey Lempri√®re (1967). Epirus: the Geography, the Ancient Remains, the History and Topography of Epirus and Adjacent Areas. Clarendon Press. . Under the leadership of Bardylis, the Dardani defeated the Macedonians and Molossians several times, reigning over upper Macedonia and Lynkestis. Bardylis also led raids against Epirus. Along with the Ardiaei and Autariatae, the Dardani are mentioned in Roman times by ancient Greek and Roman sources as one of the three strongest \\"Illyrian\\" peoplesHammond, Nicholas Geoffrey Lempri√®re (1966). \\"The Kingdoms in Illyria circa 400-167 B.C.\\". The Annual of the British School at Athens. British School at Athens. 61: 239‚Äì253. JSTOR 30103175. In 1854, Johann Georg von Hahn was the first to propose that the names Dardanoi and Dardania were related to the Albanian word dardh√´ (\\"pear, pear-tree\\"), stemming from Proto- Albanian *dardƒÅ, itself a derivative of derdh, \\"to tip out, pour\\", or *derda in Proto-Albanian.Orel, Vladimir E. (1998). Albanian Etymological Dictionary. Brill. p. 56. . A common Albanian toponym with the same root is Dardha, found in various parts of Albania, including Dardha in Berat, Dardha in Kor√ßa, Dardha in Librazhd, Dardha in Puka, Dardhas in Pogradec, Dardhaj in Mirdita, and Dardh√´s in P√´rmet. Dardha in Puka is recorded as Darda in a 1671 ecclesiastical report and on a 1688 map by a Venetian cartographer. Dardha is also the name of an Albanian tribe in the northern part of the District of Dibra.Elsie, Robert (2015). The Tribes of Albania: History, Society and Culture. I.B.Tauris. . The region of Illyria was conquered by Rome in 168 BC, and made into the Roman province of Illyricum in 59 BC. The Kosovo region probably became part of Moesia Superior in AD 87, although archaeological evidence suggests that it may have been divided between Dalmatia and Moesia. Dardania and its environs in pre-Roman times. After 284 Diocletian further divided Upper Moesia into the smaller provinces of Dardania, Moesia Prima, Dacia Ripensis, and Dacia Mediterranea. Dardania's capital was Naissus, previously a Celts settlement. The Roman province of Dardania included eastern parts of modern Kosovo, while its western part belonged to the newly formed Roman province of Prevalitana with its capital Doclea. The Romans colonised the region and founded several cities. Roman province of Dardania in the 4th century AD Forts and settlements in late antiquity and medieval Kosovo The Hunnic invasions of 441 and 447‚Äì49 were the first barbarian invasions that were able to take Eastern Roman fortified centers and cities. Most Balkan cities were sacked by Attila, and recovered only partially if at all. While there is no direct written evidence of Hunnic invasion of Kosovo, its economic hinterland will anyway have been affected for centuries.Peter Heather, The Fall of the Roman Empire, 2005, pp. 325‚Äì350Justinian I, who assumed the throne of the Byzantine Empire in 527, oversaw a period of Byzantine expansion into former Roman territories, and re-absorbed the area of Kosovo into the empire. Slavic Invasions and migrations Slavic migrations to the Balkans took place between the 6th to 7th centuries. The region had been part of the Roman and the Byzantium until the first major Slav raids took place in the middle of Justinian's reign. In 547 and 548 the Slavs invaded the territory of modern Kosovo, and then got as far as Durres on the Northern Albanian coast and reached all the way down to Greece.Kosovo: A Short History - p. 23, Origins: Serbs, Albanians and Vlachs According to Byzantium sources at the time such as Procopius, the Slavs pillaged the whole Balkans, enslaving its native population and finally assimilated it.By Procopius of Caesarea 500 - 554 AD History of the Wars, Book VII https://books.google.no/books/about/Procopius_History_of_the_wars_Books_VII.html?id=kTgjAQAAMAAJ&redir;_esc=y According to other sources, the plague of Justinian had killed millions of native Balkan people and as a result many regions had become depopulated and neglected by the government, this gave the Slavs a chance into raiding and settling in the Balkans.The plague pandemic and Slavic expansion in the 6th-8th centuries According to De Administrando Imperio, the ancestors of Serbs and Croats were part of the Slavic migrations into the Balkans, the Croats settled in modern Croatia and Western Bosnia whereas the Serbs in the rest of Bosnia, Travunija, Zahumlje and Duklja, lands situated North-West of Kosovo. Middle Ages Bulgarian Period Kosovo in the 10th century The region of Kosovo was incorporated into the Bulgarian Empire during the reign of Khan Presian (836‚Äì852). Numerous churches and monasteries were constructed after the Christianization in 864. It remained within the borders of Bulgaria for 150 years until 1018, when the country was overrun by the Byzantines after half-century bitter struggle. According to De Administrando Imperio of the 10th century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, the Serbian-populated lands lay to the north-west of Kosovo and the region was Bulgarian. During the Uprising of Peter Delyan (1040‚Äì1041), Kosovo was briefly liberated and during the Uprising of Georgi Voiteh in 1072, Peter III was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria in Prizren from where the Bulgarian army marched to Skopje. In the beginning of the 13th century, Kosovo was reincorporated in the restored Bulgarian Empire but the Bulgarian control faded after the death of Emperor Ivan Asen II (1218‚Äì1241). Byzantine Period Around the 11th century, after the Byzantine Empire fully re-established itself, the region became part of the Byzantine Empire again and stayed under Byzantine rule until the 12th centuryNoel Malcolm - Kosovo: A Short History, page 28. Serbian Period \\"Kosovo: History of a Balkan Hot Spot\\" Stefan Du≈°an assigned the city of Prizren as the capital of the Serbian Empire. Kosovo was fully conquered by the Serbian state of Rascia in the late 12th and early 13th centuries,Noel Malcolm, A Short History of Kosovo, p.44 and was part of the Serbian Empire from 1346 to 1371. In 1389, in the Battle of Kosovo occurred, which ended in a stalemate (both rulers, Murad I and Lazar Hrebeljanoviƒá, were killed). During the rule of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty (c. 1160‚Äì1355), many Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries were built throughout Serbian territory. From the mid-13th century to the end of the century, the Nemanjiƒá rulers had their main residences in Kosovo.Noel Malcolm, A Short History of the Balkans, p.50 Large estates were given to the monasteries in Western Kosovo (Metohija). The most prominent churches in Kosovo ‚Äì the Patriarchate at Peƒá, the church at Graƒçanica and the monastery at Visoki Deƒçani near Deƒçani ‚Äì were all founded during this period. Kosovo was economically important, as the modern Kosovo capital Pri≈°tina was a major trading centre on routes leading to ports on the Adriatic Sea. Also, mining was an important industry in Novo Brdo and Janjevo which had its communities of √©migr√© Saxon miners and Ragusan merchants. In 1450 the mines of Novo Brdo were producing about 6,000 kg of silver per year. The ethnic composition of Kosovo's population during this period included Serbs, Albanians, and Vlachs along with a token number of Greeks, Croats, Armenians, Saxons, and Bulgarians, according to Serbian monastic charters or chrysobulls. In the 14th century in two chrysobulls or decrees by Serbian rulers, in the villages of modern-day Kosovo area, find Serbs living alongside Albanians and Vlachs, who are cited in the first as being between the White Drin and Lim rivers (1330). In the second Serbian golden bull (1348) a total of nine Albanian villages are cited within the vicinity of Prizren.Malcolm, Noel (1998). Kosovo: A short history. p.54Wilkinson, Henry Robert (1955). \\"Jugoslav Kosmet: The evolution of a frontier province and its landscape\\". Transactions and Papers (Institute of British Geographers). 21 (21): 183. JSTOR 621279. According to scholars, during this period one can see a process of Serbianization, including Albanians bearing Serbian names or mixed Albanian-Serbian namesKosovo: A Short History - Kosovo under Serb rule Kosovo: A Short History Another valid point is that personal names - which are all the evidence we have - are not very reliable guides to ethnic identity. This was demonstrated by the Serbian scholar Stojan Stanojevic as long ago as 1929. Sifting through the names in the Decani charters, he found many cases where the father had an Albanian name, and the son a Serbian one; or vice-versa; or stranger combinations involving three generations. Thus we have a father called Tanush (Alb), whose son is called Boljko (Srb); a father called Bogdan (Srb), with a son called Progon (Alb) and several pairs of brothers such as Gon (Alb) and Drajko (Srb). Stanojevics explanation is twofold: Intermarriage and sheer fashion. Some features of the evidence he collected - particularly, the case of Serb named fathers producing Albanian named sons, which are slightly more numerous than the converse - weigh against any simplistic explanation in terms of a rapid one way process of assimilation, from Albanian to Serb. And yet, given the dominance of Orthodoxy and the Serb language in medieval Kosovo, it is reasonable to think that the overal flow of assimilation must of been in that direction, whatever the minor swirls and eddies. The main conclusion has to be that, whatever quantity of assimilation was involved, it worked: many of the people who underwent this process must have lost the Albanian language and become Serbs. Kosovo: A Short History: Certainly, a tabulation of all the personal names mentioned by these medieval charters shows a majority of Slav Orthodox names. In the earliest charters, the majority is strong, but not overwhelming: Stefan the First-crowned's charter for Zica, of c.1210, gives 154 Serb names and fifty-four non-Serb, most of which are clearly either Albanian or Vlach (such as Mik, Doda, Bukor and Sarban). This ratio gradually changes: in the Banjska charter of 1313-14, for example, it is 444 Serb to 117 non-Serb names. The scholar who first presented this evidence drew the natural conclusion that it represented a steady process of Serbianization. While Serbian scholars may have come to the conclusion that the defter from 1455 indicates an overwhelmingly Serbian local population, other scholars have other views. Madgearu instead argues that the series of defters from 1455 onward \\"shows that Kosovo... was a mosaic of Serbian and Albanian villages\\", while Prishtina and Prizren already had significant Albanian Muslim populations, and that the same defter of 1455 indicates the presence of Albanians in Tetovo[35] (just across the border in North Macedonia).Madgearu, Alexandru; Gordon, Martin (2008). The Wars of the Balkan Peninsula: Their Medieval Origins. Scarecrow Press. p. 27. . Since there are many examples of both Slavic and Albanian names occurring within the same family, name evidence must be treated with caution;Noel Malcolm, A Short History of Kosovo p.56 giving children \\"foreign\\" names can occur through inter-marriage, through imitation of a socially superior class from a different ethnic group, or simply through fashion. Ethnic identity in the Middle Ages was somewhat fluid throughout Europe, and most people at that time do not appear to have defined themselves rigidly by ethnicity. Serbian- speakers were the major linguistic group in this period. In 1355, the Serbian state fell apart on the death of Tsar Stefan Du≈°an and dissolved into squabbling fiefdoms. The timing fell perfectly within the Ottoman expansion. This enabled Albanian chieftains to create small principalities who had revolted several times with the aid of the Catholic Western powers. This was however shortlived as the Ottoman Empire took the opportunity of this vacuum to expand its power, just as the Nemanjiƒás had exploited periods of Byzantine weakness or division in their major expansions. Battle of Kosovo First Battle of Kosovo Battle of Kosovo in 1389 determined the future of central Balkans and marked the beginning of the disintegration of the Serbian Empire The First Battle of Kosovo occurred on the field of Kosovo Polje on June 28, 1389, when the ruling knez (prince) of Serbia, Lazar Hrebeljanoviƒá, marshalled a coalition of Christian soldiers, made up of Serbs, but in small numbers also of Bosnians, Albanians, Bulgarians, Magyars and a troop of Saxon mercenaries. Sultan Murad I also gathered a coalition of soldiers and volunteers from neighbouring countries in Anatolia and Rumelia. Exact numbers are difficult to come by, but most reliable historical accounts suggest that the Christian army was heavily outnumbered by the Ottomans. The combined numbers of the two armies are believed to be less than 100,000. The Serbian army was defeated and Lazar was slain, although Murad I was killed, according to tradition by Milo≈° Obiliƒá, or Kobiliƒá as he was always called until the 18th century; according to Noel Malcolm he has been variously described as a Serb, an Albanian, and a Hungarian.Noel Malcolm, A Short History of Kosovo pp.68‚Äì74 but most sources recognise him as a Serbian knight.https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of- Kosovo-1389-Balkans#ref1244047 Although the battle has been mythologised as a great Serbian defeat, at the time opinion was divided as to whether it was a Serbian defeat, a stalemate or possibly even a Serbian victory. Serbian principalities continued their existence, usually as vassals of the Ottomans, and maintained sporadic control of Kosovo, until the final extinction of the Despotate of Serbia in 1459, following which Serbia became part of the Ottoman Empire. The fortress of Novo Brdo, important at the time due to its rich silver mines, came under siege for forty days by the Ottomans during that year, capitulating and becoming occupied by the Ottomans on June 1, 1455.Noel Malcolm, A Short History of Kosovo pp. 81‚Äì92. Second Battle of Kosovo The Second Battle of Kosovo was fought over two days in October 1448, between a Hungarian force led by John Hunyadi and an Ottoman army led by Murad II. Significantly larger than the first battle, with both armies numbering twice that of the first battle, the ending was the same, and the Hungarian army was defeated in the battle and pushed from the field. Although the loss of the battle was a setback for those resisting the Ottoman invasion of Europe at that time, it was not a 'crushing blow to the cause'. Hunyadi was able to maintain Hungarian resistance to the Ottomans during his lifetime. Significance The overall significance of these battles (within their medieval context) remains disputed,Noel Malcolm, A Short History of Kosovo pp. 55‚Äì80 although the First Battle of Kosovo has become, for Serbians since their independence at least, a national symbol for heroism and an admirable 'fight against all odds', and may therefore have assumed a significance that it lacked. It seems unlikely that single battles could seriously have affected the rise of Ottoman power. In the First Battle of Kosovo, Sultan Murat I was the first Ottoman ruler to lose his life in combat; his successor Sultan Bayazid I went on to expand Ottoman territories significantly despite defeats in Wallachia, in his siege of Constantinople, and his crushing defeat in the battle of Ankara, in which he was captured and which resulted in a civil war for the succession. Despite these defeats, Ottoman power continued to expand. The Second Battle of Kosovo might have had more significanceNoel Malcolm A Short History of Kosovo, pp. 87‚Äì91 in that there were two powers simultaneously resisting the Ottomans (the Hungarians under Hunyadi and the Albanians under Skanderbeg), with Skanderbeg only narrowly missed joining Hunyadi for the battle. While the resistance of the Byzantines, Serbians, Hungarians, Albanians and Wallachians should have given the Austrians (and Italians) more time to prepare for an Ottoman threat against them, it is by no means clear that they believed the threat to be serious or consciously prepared for it. Albanian period and rule The Battle of Kosovo of 1389 had completely disorganized the Serb state, and left the field open to the most dynamic local lords, including among them the Albanian princes of the North and the Northeast. One of them was Jon Kastriot, the father of Skanderbeg, from the high region of Mati. At the end of the fourteenth and the start of the fifteenth century he managed to carve a principality from Ishmi to Prizren at the heart of region of Kosovo.The case for Kosova p.33 Around the 15th century, the region of modern Kosovo became also part of the Albanian principality of Dukagjini. Leke Dukagjini ruled what is today large parts of Northern Albania and Kosovo, with Lezha in Northern Albania as its capital city and Ulpiana near modern Prishtina in Kosovo as its second capital.The Rule of Law in Comparative perspective by Mortimer Sellers - https://books.google.no/books?id=9Rx7_KyUp7cC&pg;=PA207&dq;=leke+dukagjini+ulpiana&hl;=no&sa;=X&redir;_esc=y#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Together with these periods, and with the collapse of the Serbian Empire earlier, and with later Ottoman occupation, it allowed Albanians to play a more important role in the region.The case for Kosova p.35 From the 17th century and on wards, Kosovo received the influx of Albanian Catholics from Northern Albania. Many of these families escaped blood feuds or punishments from the Kanun of Leke Dukagjin and to find better land. In Kosovo, many of these families became Muslims. However, a large part of the Albanian demographic growth in Kosovo was also the expansion of a native Albanian population within the Kosovo region itself.Noel Malcolm, Kosovo a Short history Part of the Albanian population in Kosovo, especially in the Rrafshi i Dukagjinit, constituted an ancient Albanian component in the region.A.Hanzic - Nekoliko vijesti o Arbanasima na Kosovu I Metohiji v sredinom XV vijeka pp.201-9Milan Sufflay: Povijest Sjevernih Arbanasa pp. 61-2The case for KosovaSelami Pulaha - Defteri I Regjistrimit te Sanxhakut te Shkodres I vitit 1485 Western Kosovo had a significant reservoir of a native Albanian population by the time of the full Ottoman take over. Kosovo: A Short History Most of these were Catholics and a minority Orthodox. Many of these became Muslims during the Ottoman period. By the 1600's, Kosovo had a large Albanian population and most of Western Kosovo was Albanian speaking while the Eastern part Serbo-Croat. A large part of this demographic growth is credited to an expansion of an indigenous Albanian population within Kosovo itself rather than a sudden mass immigration from northern Albania. Kosovo: A Short HistoryThe Ottomans recorded people coming into Kosovo and most of the new arrivals in the early Ottoman period had Slavic names rather than Albanian, many of these Slavs coming from Bosnia. Kosovo: A Short History The population of northern Albania and central Albania was also smaller than that of Kosovo during this period and it's rate of growth higher. Up until the 17th century there is a lack of evidence of any large Albanian migrations from northern Albania into Kosovo. Kosovo: A Short History In the 18th century, Kosovo received Catholic migrants from northern Albania, many of these escaping blood feuds, to make room for a growing population or to find better land. As Malsor Albanians migrated into the region during this period so did many Serb Orthodox families from Montenegro and other regions. Kosovo: A Short History It became also later an important region in where the Albanian National Awakening took place and the Albanian revolt of 1912 and where the League of Prizren was formed. Ottoman Period Vilayet of Kosovo, 1875‚Äì1878 Vilayet of Kosovo, 1881‚Äì1912 Ethnographic map of the Balkans in the end of the 19th century The Ottomans brought Islam with them and later also created the Vilayet of Kosovo as one of the Ottoman territorial entities. Ottoman rule lasted for about 500 years, in which time the Ottomans were the absolute power in the region. Many Slavs converted to Islam and served under Ottomans. Kosovo was taken temporarily by the Austrian forces during the War of 1683‚Äì1699 with help of Serbs but were defeated and retreated shortly thereafter. In 1690, the Serbian Patriarch of Peƒá Arsenije III, who had previously escaped a certain death, fled to Austria as did 30‚Äì40,000 people (according to the Patriarch).Noel Malcolm, A Short History of Kosovo, p. 161 He was probably referring only to Serbs; numbers of Albanians also fled. Due to the oppression from the Ottomans, other migrations of Orthodox people from the Kosovo area continued throughout the 18th century. Most Albanians eventually adopted Islam, while most Serbs did not.Noel Malcolm, A Short History of Kosovo, pp.104‚Äì138 In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá and the position of Christians in Kosovo was greatly reduced. Modern The territory of today's Kosovo was for centuries ruled by the Ottoman Empire. During this period several administrative districts known as sanjaks (\\"banners\\" or districts) each ruled by a sanjakbey (roughly equivalent to \\"district lord\\") have included parts of the territory as parts of their territories. Despite the imposition of Muslim rule, large numbers of Christians continued to live and sometimes even prosper under the Ottomans. A process of Islamisation began shortly after the beginning of Ottoman rule but it took a considerable amount of time ‚Äì at least a century ‚Äì and was concentrated at first on the towns. A large part of the reason for the conversion was probably economic and social, as Muslims had considerably more rights and privileges than Christian subjects. Christian religious life nonetheless continued, while churches were largely left alone by the Ottomans, but both the Serbian Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches and their congregations suffered from high levels of taxation. Around the 17th century, there is a mention of some Catholic Albanians moving from the mountains of Northern Albania and into the plains of Kosovo. These Catholic Albanians moved because they had fled blood feuds or they had been punished under the Kanun of Lek Dukagjin. In Kosovo many of them became Muslims. However, the number of these people migrating into the area was, compared to the already existing Albanian population in Kosovo, extremely small.Kosovo: A Short History - p. 138 In 1689 Kosovo was greatly disrupted in the course of the Great Turkish War (1683‚Äì1699), in one of the pivotal events. In October 1689, a small Habsburg force under Margrave Ludwig of Baden breached the Ottoman Empire and reached as far as Kosovo, following their earlier capture of Belgrade. Many Serbs and Albanians pledged their loyalty to the Austrians, some joining Ludwig's army. This was by no means a universal reaction; many other Albanians fought alongside the Ottomans to resist the Austrian advance. A massive Ottoman counter-attack the following summer drove the Austrians back to their fortress at Ni≈°, then back to Belgrade, then finally back across the Danube into Austria. In 1878, one of the four vilayets with Albanian inhabitants that formed the League of Prizren was Vilayet of Kosovo. The League's purpose was to resist both Ottoman rule and incursions by the newly emerging Balkan nations. Ethnic map of Balkans ‚Äì Heinrich Kiepert 1882 In 1910, an Albanian insurrection, which was possibly aided surreptitiously by the Young Turks to put pressure on the Sublime Porte, broke out in Pristina and soon spread to the entire vilayet of Kosovo, lasting for three months. The Sultan visited Kosovo in June 1911 during peace settlement talks covering all Albanian- inhabited areas. Albanian National Movement The Albanian national movement was inspired by various factors. Besides the National Renaissance that had been promoted by Albanian activists, political reasons were a contributing factor. In the 1870s the Ottoman Empire experienced a tremendous contraction in territory and defeats in wars against the Slavic monarchies of Europe. During and after the Serbian‚ÄìOttoman War of 1876‚Äì78, between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, were expelled by the Serb army from the Sanjak of Ni»ô and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet.Pllana, Emin (1985). \\"Les raisons de la mani√®re de l'exode des refugies albanais du territoire du sandjak de Nish a Kosove (1878‚Äì1878) [The reasons for the manner of the exodus of Albanian refugees from the territory of the Sanjak of Ni≈° to Kosovo (1878‚Äì1878)] \\".

Though the League was founded with the support of the Sultan who hoped for the preservation of Ottoman territories, the Albanian leaders were quick and effective enough to turn it into a national organisation and eventually into a government. The League had the backing of the Italo-Albanian community and had well developed into a unifying factor for the religiously diverse Albanian people. During its three years of existence the League sought the creation of an Albanian vilayet within the Ottoman Empire, raised an army and fought a defensive war. In 1881 a provisional government was formed to administer Albania under the presidency of Ymer Prizreni, assisted by prominent ministers such as Abdyl Frash√´ri and Sulejman Vokshi. Nevertheless, military intervention from the Balkan states, the Great Powers as well as Turkey divided the Albanian troops in three fronts, which brought about the end of the League.Hysni Myzyri, \\"Kreu VIII: Lidhja Shqiptare e Prizrenit (1878‚Äì1881),\\" Historia e popullit shqiptar: p√´r shkollat e mesme (Libri Shkollor: Prishtin√´, 2002) 149‚Äì172. Kosovo was yet home to other Albanian organisations, the most important being the League of Peja, named after the city in which it was founded in 1899. It was led by Haxhi Zeka, a former member of the League of Prizren and shared a similar platform in quest for an autonomous Albanian vilayet. The League ended its activity in 1900 after an armed conflict with the Ottoman forces.

In 1908, 20,000 armed Albanian peasants gathered in Ferizaj to prevent any foreign intervention, while their leaders, Bajram Curri and Isa Boletini, sent a telegram to the sultan demanding the promulgation of a constitution and the opening of the parliament. The Albanians did not receive any of the promised benefits from the Young Turkish victory. Considering this, an unsuccessful uprising was organised by Albanian highlanders in Kosovo in February 1909. The adversity escalated after the takeover of the Turkish government by an oligarchic group later that year. In April 1910, armies led by Idriz Seferi and Isa Boletini rebelled against the Turkish troops, but were finally forced to withdraw after having caused many casualties amongst the enemy.Hysni Myzyri, \\"Kryengritjet shqiptare t√´ viteve 1909‚Äì1911,\\" Historia e popullit shqiptar: p√´r shkollat e mesme (Libri Shkollor: Prishtin√´, 2002) 195‚Äì198. A further Albanian rebellion in 1912 was the pretext for Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria beginning the First Balkan War against the Ottoman Empire. Most of Kosovo was incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbia, while the region of Metohija () was taken by the Kingdom of Montenegro. Kosovo was split into four counties: three being a part of the entity of Serbia (Zveƒçan, Kosovo and southern Metohija); one of Montenegro (Northern Metohija). The Albanian rebellion, led by Isa Boletini and Idriz Seferi, had weakened the Ottomans so much that the Ottoman Empire in Kosovo had been practically defeated. This further persuaded other Balkan states that it was time for an anti-Ottoman war. The Ottomans had been so fatally weakened by the Albanian rebellion of 1912 that the war was quickly won.Noel Malcolm: Kosovo: A Short History , page. 248 Serbia took advantage of the Albanian rebellion after seeing a weakened Ottoman Empire and annexed Kosovo. The Albanians organised a resistance under the leadership of Isa Boletini. Serbia eventually managed to fight through ans surpress the rebels. During the conflicts a number of massacres took place by the Serbian army and paramilitaries. Almost half of Albanian inhabited lands, including Kosovo, were left outside of what then formed as Albania and which were annexed by Montenegro and Serbia.Kosovo: A Short History . page 251 During this period, the majority of the population of Kosovo was Albanian and did not welcome Serb rule.Is Kosovo Serbia ? We ask a historian Many Albanians still kept resisting Serbian army and fought for the unification of Kosovo with Albania. Both Isa Boletini and Idriz Seferi continued fighting.Noel Malcolm: Kosovo A Short History . p 252 Other well known rebels at the time were Azem Galica, also known as Azem Bejta, and his wife Shote Galica.Histroical dictionary of Kosova - Robert Elsie Interbellum Period Kosovo in 1941 The 1918‚Äì1929 period of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians witnessed a rise of the Serbian population in the region and a decline in the non-Serbian. In 1929, Kosovo was split between the Zeta Banovina in the west with the capital in Cetinje, Vardar Banovina in the southeast with the capital in Skopje and the Morava Banovina in the northeast with the capital in Ni≈°. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, with the rest being controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations, with the first being most important. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years, with one Serb historian estimating that 3,000 Albanians and 4,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed, and two others estimating war dead at 12,000 Albanians and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins.Malcolm, Noel Kosovo: A Short History, p.312 Most sources put the numbers of Serbs killed during WWII in Kosovo at anywhere from 10,000-40,000, with 250,000 forcibly expelled. \\"We should endeavor to ensure that the Serb population of Kosovo should be removed as soon as possible ... All indigenous Serbs who have been living here for centuries should be termed colonialists and as such, via the Albanian and Italian governments, should be sent to concentration camps in Albania. Serbian settlers should be killed.\\" Mustafa Kruja, the then Prime Minister of Albania, June 1942 During the New Year's Eve between 1943 and 1944, Albanian and Yugoslav partisans gathered at the town of Bujan, near Kuk√´s in northern Albania, where they held a conference in which they discussed the fate of Kosovo after the war. Both Albanian and Yugoslav communists signed the agreement, according to which Kosovo would have the right to democratically decide whether it wants to remain in Albania or become part of Serbia. This was seen as the marxist solution for Kosovo. The agreement was not respected by Yugoslavia, since Tito knew that Serbia would not accept it. Some Albanians, especially in the region in and around Drenica in central Kosovo revolted against the Yugoslav communists for not respecting the agreement. In response, the Yugoslavs called the rebels Nazi and Fascist collaborators and responded with violence. The Albanian Kosovar military leader Shaban Polluzha, who first fought with Yugoslav partisans but then refused to collaborate further, was attacked and killed. Between 400 and 2,000 Kosovar Albanian recruits of the Yugoslav Army were shot in Bar. Yugoslavian Period Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo of Socialist Serbia inside Socialist Yugoslavia, 1974‚Äì1990 Following the end of the war and the establishment Communist Yugoslavia, Kosovo was granted the status of an autonomous region of Serbia in 1946 and became an autonomous province in 1963. The Communist government did not permit the return of all of the refugees. With the passing of the 1974 Yugoslavia constitution, Kosovo gained virtual self-government. The province's government has applied Albanian curriculum to Kosovo's schools: surplus and obsolete textbooks from Enver Hoxha's Albania were obtained and put into use. Throughout the 1980s tensions between the Albanian and Serb communities in the province escalated.Reuters 1986-05-27, \\"Kosovo Province Revives Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare\\"Christian Science Monitor 1986-07-28, \\"Tensions among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia begin to boil over\\" The Albanian community favoured greater autonomy for Kosovo, whilst Serbs favoured closer ties with the rest of Serbia. There was little appetite for unification with Albania itself, which was ruled by a Stalinist government and had considerably worse living standards than Kosovo. Beginning in March 1981, Kosovar Albanian students organised protests seeking thatm Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia. Those protests rapidly escalated into violent riots \\"involving 20,000 people in six cities\\"New York Times 1981-04-19, \\"One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia\\" that were harshly contained by the Yugoslav government. The demonstrations of March and April 1981 were started by Albanian students in Pri≈°tina, protesting against poor living conditions and the lack of prospects (unemployment was rampant in the province and most of the university educated ended up as the unemployed). In addition, calls for a separate Albanian republic within Yugoslavia were voiced. National Library in Pristina. Serbs living in Kosovo were discriminated against by the provincial government, notably by the local law enforcement authorities failing to punish reported crimes against Serbs.New York Times 1982-07-12, \\"Exodus of Serbians Stirs Province in Yugoslavia\\" The increasingly bitter atmosphere in Kosovo meant that even the most farcical incidents could become causes c√©l√®bres. When a Serbian farmer, ƒêorƒëe Martinoviƒá, turned up at a Kosovo hospital with a bottle in his rectum after claiming to have been assaulted in his field by masked men (he later admitted the bottle ended up in his rectum through a mishap during masturbationSabrina P. Ramet, Angelo Georgakis. Thinking about Yugoslavia: Scholarly Debates about the Yugoslav Breakup and the Wars in Bosnia and Kosovo, pp. 153, 201. Cambridge University Press, 2005; Louis Sell, Slobodan Milosevic and the Destruction of Yugoslavia, pp. 78‚Äì79. Duke University Press, 2003; ), 216 prominent Serbian intellectuals signed a petition declaring that \\"the case of ƒêorƒëe Martinoviƒá has come to symbolize the predicament of all Serbs in Kosovo.\\" Perhaps the most politically explosive complaint levelled by the Kosovo Serbs was that they were being neglected by the Communist authorities in Belgrade.New York Times 1987-06-27, \\"Belgrade Battles Kosovo Serbs\\" In August 1987, Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, then a rising politician, visited Kosovo. He appealed to Serb nationalism to further his career. Having drawn huge crowds to a rally commemorating the Battle of Kosovo, he pledged to Kosovo Serbs that \\"No one should dare to beat you\\", and became an instant hero of Kosovo's Serbs. By the end of the year Milo≈°eviƒá was in control of the Serbian government. Through 1988 and 1989, dominant forces in Serbian politics engaged in a series of moves that became known as the anti-bureaucratic revolution. The leading politicians of Kosovo and the northern province of Vojvodina were sacked and replaced, and the level of autonomy of the provinces started to be unilaterally reduced by the Serbian federal authority. In protest, the Kosovo Albanians engaged in mass demonstrations, and Trepƒça miners began a hunger strike. The new constitution significantly reduced the provinces' rights, permitting the government of Serbia to exert direct control over many previously autonomous areas of governance. In particular, the constitutional changes handed control of the police, the court system, the economy, the education system and language policies to the Serbian government. It was strongly opposed by many of Serbia's national minorities, who saw it as a means of imposing ethnically based centralised rule on the provinces.Yugoslavia The Old Demons Arise, Time Magazine, August 06, 1990 The Albanian representatives in provincial government largely opposed the constitutional changes and abstained from ratification in the Kosovo assembly. In March 1989, preceding a final push for ratification, the Yugoslav police rounded up around 240 prominent Kosovo Albanians, apparently selected based on their anti-ratification sentiment, and detained them with complete disregard for due process. When the assembly met to discuss the proposals, tanks and armoured cars surrounded the meeting place. Though the final vote failed to reach the required two-thirds majority threshold, it was declared as having passed. Kosovo War After the constitutional changes, the parliaments of all Yugoslavian republics and provinces, which until then had MPs only from the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, were dissolved and multi-party elections were held for them. Kosovo Albanians refused to participate in the elections and held their own, unsanctioned elections instead. As election laws required turnout higher than 50%, the parliament of Kosovo could not be established. The new constitution abolished the individual provinces' official media, integrating them within the official media of Serbia while still retaining some programs in the Albanian language. The Albanian-language media in Kosovo was suppressed. Funding was withdrawn from state-owned media, including that in the Albanian language in Kosovo. The constitution made creating privately owned media possible, however their functioning was very difficult because of high rents and restricting laws. State-owned Albanian language television or radio was also banned from broadcasting from Kosovo. However, privately owned Albanian media outlets appeared; of these, probably the most famous is \\"Koha Ditore\\", which was allowed to operate until late 1998 when it was closed after it published a calendar which was claimed to be a glorification of ethnic Albanian separatists. The constitution also transferred control over state- owned companies to the Serbian government (at the time, most of the companies were state-owned). In September 1990, up to 12,000 Albanian workers were fired from their positions in government and the media, as were teachers, doctors, and workers in government-controlled industries, provoking a general strike and mass unrest. Some of those who were not sacked quit in sympathy, refusing to work for the Serbian government. Although the sackings were widely seen as a purge of ethnic Albanians, the government maintained that it was simply getting rid of old communist directors. insurgency (1995‚Äì98) The old Albanian educational curriculum and textbooks were revoked and new ones were created. The curriculum was basically the same as Serbian and that of all other nationalities in Serbia except that it had education on and in Albanian language. Education in Albanian was withdrawn in 1992 and re-established in 1994. At the Pristina University, which was seen as a centre of Kosovo Albanian cultural identity, education in the Albanian language was abolished and Albanian teachers were also sacked en masse. Albanians responded by boycotting state schools and setting up an unofficial parallel system of Albanian-language education.Clark, Howard. Civil Resistance in Kosovo. London: Pluto Press, 2000. Kosovo Albanians were outraged by what they saw as an attack on their rights. Following mass rioting and unrest from Albanians as well as outbreaks of inter-communal violence, in February 1990, a state of emergency was declared, and the presence of the Yugoslav Army and police was significantly increased to quell the unrest. Unsanctioned elections were held in 1992, which overwhelmingly elected Ibrahim Rugova as \\"president\\" of a self- declared Republic of Kosovo; however these elections were not recognised by Serbian nor any foreign government. In 1995, thousands of Serb refugees from Croatia settled in Kosovo, which further worsened relations between the two communities. Albanian opposition to sovereignty of Yugoslavia and especially Serbia had surfaced in rioting (1968 and March 1981) in the capital Pristina. Ibrahim Rugova initially advocated non-violent resistance, but later opposition took the form of separatist agitation by opposition political groups and armed action from 1996 by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA; Alb. Ushtria √álirimtare e Kosov√´s or U√áK). The KLA launched a guerrilla war and terror campaign, characterised by regular bomb and gun attacks on Yugoslav security forces, state officials and civilians known to openly support the national government, this included Albanians who were non-sympathizers with KLA motives. In March 1998, Yugoslav army units joined Serbian police to fight the separatists, using military force. In the months that followed, thousands of Albanian civilians were killed and more than 10,000 fled their homes; most of these people were Albanian. Many Albanian families were forced to flee their homes at gunpoint, as a result of fighting between national security and KLA forces leading to expulsions by the security forces including associated paramilitary militias. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that 460,000 people had been displaced from March 1998 to the start of the NATO bombing campaign in March 1999. There was violence against non-Albanians as well: UNHCR reported (March 1999) that over 90 mixed villages in Kosovo \\"have now been emptied of Serb inhabitants\\" and other Serbs continue leaving, either to be displaced in other parts of Kosovo or fleeing into central Serbia. The Yugoslav Red Cross estimated there were more than 130,000 non-Albanian displaced in need of assistance in Kosovo, most of whom were Serb. Refugee camp near Kuk√´s, Albania (1999) Following the breakdown of negotiations between Serbian and Albanian representatives, under North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) auspices, NATO intervened on March 24, 1999 without United Nations authority. NATO launched a campaign of heavy bombing against Yugoslav military targets and then moved to wide range bombings (like bridges in Novi Sad). A full-scale war broke out as KLA continued to attack Serbian forces and Serbian/Yugoslav forces continued to fight KLA amidst a massive displacement of the population of Kosovo, which most human rights groups and international organisations regarded as an act of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the government forces. A number of senior Yugoslav government officials and military officers, including President Milo≈°eviƒá, were subsequently indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for war crimes. Milo≈°eviƒá died in detention before a verdict was rendered. The United Nations estimated that during the Kosovo War, nearly 40,000 Albanians fled or were expelled from Kosovo between March 1998 and the end of April 1999. Most of the refugees went to Albania, the Republic of Macedonia, or Montenegro. Government security forces confiscated and destroyed the documents and licence plates of many fleeing Albanians in what was widely regarded as an attempt to erase the identities of the refugees, the term \\"identity cleansing\\" being coined to denote this action. This made it difficult to distinguish with certainty the identity of returning refugees after the war. Serbian sources claim that many Albanians from Macedonia and Albania ‚Äì perhaps as many as 300,000, by some estimates ‚Äì have since migrated to Kosovo in the guise of refugees. The entire issue is moot, however, due to the survival of birth and death records. Post Kosovo War The war ended on June 10, 1999 with the Serbian and Yugoslav governments signing the Kumanovo Agreement which agreed to transfer governance of the province to the United Nations. A NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) entered the province following the Kosovo War, tasked with providing security to the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Before and during the handover of power, an estimated 100,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians, mostly Serbs, fled the province for fear of reprisals. In the case of the non-Albanians, the Roma in particular were regarded by many Albanians as having assisted the Serbs during the war. Many left along with the withdrawing Serbian security forces, expressing fears that they would be targeted by returning Albanian refugees and KLA fighters who blamed them for wartime acts of violence. Thousands more were driven out by intimidation, attacks and a wave of crime after the war as KFOR struggled to restore order in the province. Large numbers of refugees from Kosovo still live in temporary camps and shelters in Serbia proper. In 2002, Serbia and Montenegro reported hosting 277,000 internally displaced people (the vast majority being Serbs and Roma from Kosovo), which included 201,641 persons displaced from Kosovo into Serbia proper, 29,451 displaced from Kosovo into Montenegro, and about 46,000 displaced within Kosovo itself, including 16,000 returning refugees unable to inhabit their original homes. Some sources put the figure far lower; the European Stability Initiative estimates the number of displaced people as being only 65,000, with another 40,000 Serbs remaining in Kosovo, though this would leave a significant proportion of the pre-1999 ethnic Serb population unaccounted-for. The largest concentration of ethnic Serbs in Kosovo is in the north of the province above the Ibar river, but an estimated two-thirds of the Serbian population in Kosovo continues to live in the Albanian-dominated south of the province. On March 17, 2004, serious unrest in Kosovo led to 19 deaths, and the destruction of 35 Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries in the province, as Albanians started pogroms against the Serbs. Several thousand more Kosovo Serbs have left their homes to seek refuge in Serbia proper or in the Serb-dominated north of Kosovo. Since the end of the war, Kosovo has been a major source and destination country in the trafficking of women, women forced into prostitution and sexual slavery. The growth in the sex trade industry has been fuelled by NATO forces in Kosovo. International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 which ended the Kosovo conflict of 1999. Whilst Serbia's continued sovereignty over Kosovo was recognised by the international community, a clear majority of the province's population sought independence. The United Nations-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.\\"UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock \\", BBC News, October 9, 2006. In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. As of early July 2007 the draft resolution, which is backed by the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council, had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty. Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, has stated that it will not support any resolution which is not acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina. Independence Map of the Republic of Kosovo, as proclaimed in 2008 On February 17, 2008, Kosovo's Parliament declared independence,\\"Kosovo MPs proclaim independence\\", BBC News Online, 17 February 2008 to mixed international reactions. Some Kosovo Serbs opposed to secession have boycotted the move by refusing to follow orders from the central government in Pristina and attempting to seize infrastructure and border posts in Serb-populated regions. There have also been sporadic instances of violence against international institutions and governmental institutions, predominantly in Northern Kosovo (see 2008 unrest in Kosovo). On July 25, 2011 Kosovan Albanian police wearing riot gear attempted to seize several border control posts in Kosovo's Serb-controlled north trying to enforce the ban on Serbian imports imposed in retaliation of Serbia's ban on import from Kosovo. It prompted a large crowd to erect roadblocks and Kosovan police units came under fire. An Albanian policeman died when his unit was ambushed and another officer was reportedly injured. Nato-led peacekeepers moved into the area to calm the situation and Kosovan police pulled back. The US and EU criticised the Kosovan government for acting without consulting international bodies. Though tensions between the two sides eased somewhat after the intervention of NATO's KFOR forces, they continued to remain high. Further reading *Malcolm, Noel. Kosovo: A Short History.

The period of occupation spans from the end of the Neolithic era and the beginning of the Bronze Age, until around the Roman times in Corsica. Location Back of Statue Menhir The site lies on road D57, a few hundred metres from the hamlet of Filitosa, west of Sollacaro, in the canton of Petreto-Bicchisano, arrondissement of Sart√®ne, north of Propriano in the Corse-du-Sud d√©partement. It is located on a hill, overlooking the Taravo valley. Site history and features The site was discovered in 1946 by the owner of the land, Charles-Antoine Cesari, and brought to the attention of archeologists by the British writer, Dorothy Carrington (see her masterpiece, Granite Island: Portrait of Corsica,). Systematic excavations started in 1954 by Roger Grosjean. Finds of arrow heads and pottery date earliest inhabitation to 3300 BC. Around 1500 BC, 2-3 metre menhirs were erected. They have been carved with representations of human faces, armour and weapons. Roger Grosjean thought the menhirs may have been erected to ward off an invasion of a group of people called the Torr√©ens (Torreans). However this was unsuccessful: the menhirs were cast down, broken up and reused in some cases as building material by the Torr√©ens. The Torr√©ens built circular stone structures on the site, known as torri (or torre), which may have been used as temples. The torri are remarkably well preserved. This theory had been disputed by later works of F. De Lanfranchi, M.C. Weiss and Gabriel Camps.CORSICA Enciclopedia dell' Arte Antica (1994) In total, about twenty menhirs of various times were counted in Filitosa. They constitute approximately half of the total staff of these monuments in Corsica. Layout The site of Filitosa is approached down a track through an ancient olive grove. The first monument to be seen is a rock overhang and surrounding wall. Then the visitor comes upon the central monument. Various hut platforms are all around, and the track leads a further 50m to the Western Monument or torri. From there, one can enjoy a view down the hill to a stone alignment of five megaliths, set around the base of a 2000-year-old olive tree. Behind the olive tree is the quarry from which the megaliths were extracted.

Al-HajjƒÅj ordered Muhammad bin Qasim then governor of Fars, to summon Atiyah and demand him to curse Ali, which was a practice used by the Umayyads as a test of loyalty.: \\"Here the curse is used as a test of loyalty to the Umayyads.\\" If Atiyah refused, he was to be flogged four hundred times and his head and beard shaved as humiliation.Ibn Hajar al-‚ÄòAsqalani, \\"Tahdhib al-Tahdhib\\", Volume 7, page 226, Narrator no. 413. Al-Tabari narrates that Atiyah refused to curse Ali and he was punished.  Conquest of Sind  Atiyah joined the invasion force of Muhammad bin Qasim in his campaign on Sind. According to Chachnama, he was the commander of the right wing of bin Qasim's army after the conquest of Armabil (modern Bela). Al-Tabari, Ibn Sa'ad and Ibn Hajar give accounts of Atiyah's sojourn in Sind.: \\"Apart from Musa b. Yaqub Thaqafi..., there were a number of individuals who came to Sindh in the wake of the Umayyad conquest, but chose not to settle in the region. One such person was 'Atiyah b. Sad al-Awfi, the renowned Shiite traditionalist.\\"  Khorasan  Al-Tabari's biography states that Atiyah moved to Khorasan and stayed there during the governorship of Qutayba ibn Muslim. After the accession of Yazid II and the appointment of Umar ibn Hubayra as the Governor of Iraq (in 103 AH / 721‚Äì722 CE), he sought permission to return to Iraq. He then moved to Kufa lived there until his death in 111 AH / 729 CE. Scholarly Impact Atiyah ibn Sa'd is regarded as a reliable transmitter of Prophetic narrations, hadith, by Ibn Hajar al- Asqalani and al-Tabari. In addition, he was a great exegete of the Qur'an and wrote a commentary on it in five volumes. He was a student of the great Sahaba Abdullah ibn Abbas and Jabir ibn Abd Allah al-Ansari.

Blavatsky formally defined the higher self as \\"Atma the inseparable ray of the Universe and one self. It is the God above, more than within, us\\". Each and every individual has a Higher self.The Key to Theosophy, H.P. Blavatsky, 1889, p175.  Concept  The Higher Self is generally regarded as a form of being only to be recognized in a union with a divine source. In recent years the New Age faith has encouraged the idea of the Higher Self in contemporary culture, though the notion of the Higher Self has been interpreted throughout numerous historical spiritual faiths. Some denominations believe that the higher self is a part of an individual's metaphysical identity, while others teach that the higher self is essentially our tie to the heavens. Similar to the notion of the soul, the higher self can be defined by many different sects, while also being a topic of interest in the scientific and philosophical fields.  Religious views  Christianity: In the conservative evangelical Christian interpretation, only those who are born again receive a \\"new spirit\\" (Ezekiel 36:26, see John 3:1-7). This appears to be similar to the concept of the \\"higher self\\" yet different in many respects. According to this tradition, only those who are \\"born again\\" receive the indwelling of the ‚ÄúHoly Spirit,‚Äù or the personal presence of God. This is distinct from the conception in the Advaita Vedanta non-dual mystical tradition, which teaches that the Atma, the individual soul, and Brahman, the Oversoul, are one and the same. Islam: In Sufism and some esoteric Shia sects (Batiniyya), the Higher Self has an important role, which is connected with notion of al-InsƒÅn al-KƒÅmil, the six organs, Al-Nafsul Mud‚Äôma‚Äôinah and Fana'. Hinduism: In Hinduism, the higher self is one and the same with the Jiva or individual self. With this perspective, the Hindu faith generally teaches that the higher self, or Atman is not an object possessed by an individual, rather the self is the subject which perceives. In his book, The Higher Self, Deepak Chopra utilizes the views of the Hindi denomination to support his claims concerning the divine force that is acquired with the awareness of the self. Hinduism teaches that through the examination of self-knowledge, or ‚Äúatma jnana,‚Äù one can attain salvation by comprehending the true self.Chopra, D. (2001). The Higher Self. New York, NY: Simon & Schuster, Inc. New Age: Most New Age literature defines the Higher self as an extension of the self to a godlike state. This Higher Self is essentially an extension of the worldly self. With this perspective, New Age text teaches that in exercising your relationship with the higher self, you will gain the ability to manifest your desired future before you. In other words, the self creates its own reality when in union with the Higher Self.Hanegraaff, Woutner J. \\"New Age Spiritualities as Secular Religion: A Historian's Perspective.\\" Social Compass 46.2 (1999): 145-60. Scp.sagepub. Web. 10 Sept. 2012.  Higher self meditation and channeling  In numerous reports concerning the Higher Self, the practice of meditation or channeling to contact the Higher Self is highly encouraged. Most of this ideology agrees with the concept that with mindful awareness of the higher self, peace, salvation, or enlightenment may be procured. This is due to the idea that the Higher Self contains an advanced amount of insight into man‚Äôs most taxing questions, such as the purpose of existence or death, etc. Through spiritual exposure, a person is thought to make a conscious connection with their higher self or other higher beings. In this state, the meditator may tap into this higher intelligence in order to develop a more enlightened perspective on world matters.

He is sometimes conjectured to have been the captain of the Greek explorer Eudoxus of Cyzicus' ship. The writer of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea credited Hippalus with discovering the direct route from the Red Sea to Tamilakam over the Indian Ocean by plotting the scheme of the sea and the correct location of the trade ports along the Indian coast. Pliny the Elder claimed that Hippalus discovered not the route but the monsoon wind also called Hippalus (the south-west monsoon wind). Most historians have tried to reconcile the reports by stating that knowledge of the monsoon winds was necessary to use the direct route, but the historian Andr√© Tchernia explains that Plinius' connection between the wind and the navigator was based on common pronunciation: in the Hellenistic Era the name of the wind was written as Hypalus, only in Roman times the spelling Hippalus came in use. The wind had already been known in Hellenistic times and had before been used by Himyarite (Southern Arabian Semites) and Indian sailors to cross the Indian Ocean. To understand the importance of Hippalus' discovery we have to know that before him Greek geographers thought that the Indian coast stretched from west to east. Hippalus was probably the first (in the west) to recognize the north-south direction of India's west coast. Only someone who has this insight will think crossing the Indian Ocean might be a faster way to south India than following the coastline. The use of Hippalus' direct route greatly contributed to the prosperity of trade contacts between the Roman province of Aegyptus and India from the 1st century BCE onwards. From Red Sea ports like Berenice large ships crossed the Indian Ocean to the Tamil kingdoms of the Pandyas, Cholas and Cheras in present-day Kerala and Tamil Nadu. In modern times a crater on the moon was named after the navigator. He is also a prominent character in L. Sprague de Camp's novel about Eudoxus, The Golden Wind.

It is focused on accountants working in industry, and provides ongoing support and training for members. CIMA is one of the member of professional associations for accountants in the UK and Ireland. Its particular emphasis is on developing the management accounting profession. CIMA is the largest management accounting body in the world with 281,467 students and 106,095 members in 2017.cimaglobal.com CIMA is also a member of the International Federation of Accountants.  History  CIMA was formed in March 1919, as the Institute of Cost and Works Accountants, by a group of legal professionals and businessmen who wanted to develop an approach to accounting that would meet the demands of a rapidly changing business world. Industrialisation had led to large scale, complex businesses providing unprecedented challenges in management. Employers needed a new form of in- house accountant to provide, in addition to accounts, better analysis of cost and of operations to inform performance management. The new institute soon gained the backing of leading industrialists including, Lord Leverhulme who became its president. Advances in technology and globalisation made business ever more complex over the 20th century and the role of the accountant in business became more significant. It expanded to include provision of a wider range of information and the emphasis shifted from accounting to management. The status of management accounting as a distinct branch of the accounting profession was recognised by the granting of a Royal Charter in 1975.  Activities  CIMA operates a standard scheme of qualifying examinations for prospective members. It promotes local education, training and management development operations, and new techniques through its research foundation and the dissemination of management accounting practices through publications and other media related activities. CIMA has been active in recent educational and vocational initiatives in former Eastern bloc countries. It publishes a monthly journal, supplied free to members and registered students, called 'Financial Management'. CIMA is recognised as a professional accounting body for various statutory purposes by UK and various overseas governments. The institute regulates the activities of its members by a code of practice, a discipline committee and a continuing professional development education scheme. Its governing body is its council, comprising members elected from regional branches. Each of the branches has a committee and is responsible for much of the 'grass roots' activity. Activity such as qualification development is undertaken from the London head office. In 2011 CIMA left CCAB.http://www.cimaglobal.com/Pages-that-we-will-need-to-bring-back/Old-site- pages1/Old-site-pages/About-us/Press-office/Press- releases/2011/March-2011/CIMA-withdraws-from-the-CCAB/ In 2012, CIMA and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants created the CGMA designation (Chartered Global Management Accountant). The designation recognises the most talented and committed management accountants. The CGMA is the most widely held management accounting designation in the world with more than 150,000 designees; it is educationally equivalent to a master's degree. The designation is built on extensive global research to maintain the highest relevance with employers and develop the competencies most in demand. CGMA professionals are business strategists who can link the board's objectives with those of organisation's, guiding critical business decisions and creating sustainable business success. In 2014 CIMA, with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, launched the Global Management Accounting Principles (Principles). The Principles were endorsed by UK business leaders including: Mr Ian king Chief Executive, BAE Systems and Howard Orme, Director General, Finance & Commercial, Department for Business Innovation & Skills.www.ft.com The CGMA Competency Framework was also launched in 2014. The framework shows the range of technical, accounting and finance skills that management accountants need to do their jobs and consists of four knowledge areas: Technical Skills, Business Skills, People Skills and Leadership Skills all underpinned by Ethics, Integrity and Professionalism. In 2016 CIMA, sponsored the creation of the world's first management accounting standard: Guide to management accounting principles. The standard, published by the British Standards Institute codifies a universal framework for best practice in decision making. Organisations including, Sky, The Environment Agency, Fujitsu, the NHS and Siemens had input into its development. It is designed as a best-practice guide to management accounting, allowing organisations to benchmark their finance function and unlock the full contribution that management accountancy can make. The specification is based on the Global Management Accounting Principles, created in 2014 by CIMA and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.Global Management Accounting Principles In 2017, members of CIMA and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) formed the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants to unite and strengthen the accounting profession globally.  Membership  CIMA has two grades of full membership: * Associate ‚Äì designated by the letters ACMA * Fellow ‚Äì designated by the letters FCMA A CIMA Associate or Fellow is permitted to use the suffix letters CGMA (Chartered Global Management Accountant) after their name. To be admitted as an Associate, a candidate must have: * completed a period of qualifying practice of at least two years, documented and signed by appropriate witnesses, * passed the institute's 16 qualifying examinations (or have a verified exemption), including 3 integrated case study exams under 2019 syllabus.

Places are presented alphabetically History The Barony of Leuchars is recorded during the reign of William the Lion (1165‚Äì1214). The 12th-century St Athernase Church is one of the finest surviving examples of an unaisled Romanesque parish church in Scotland. The church has two levels of blind arcading in the Norman style running round the exterior, surmounted by a corbel table with heads of various designs. The interior has elaborate chancel and apse arches, and a series of powerful beast-heads on the corbels supporting the ribs of the internal vaults. The nave has been rebuilt, while the apse roof is crowned by a small bell-tower added in the 17th century. The medieval Leuchars Castle was located to the north of the town: it was demolished in the 19th century but the motte can still be seen, as well as a nearby doocot. Leuchars Station The surrounding area was improved by drainage in the 18th century. In the 19th century, a railway station on the line from Edinburgh to Aberdeen brought increased prosperity to the town. When The St. Andrews Railway branch line was closed in the late 1960s, Leuchars became the closest place to get the train to St Andrews. Since then, Leuchars railway station has been used by many University of St Andrews students. In 1911 construction started on what would become RAF Leuchars. This Royal Air Force station would host a great variety of aircraft in its time, protecting the North of the United Kingdom from airborne threats until the final QRA (Quick Reaction Alert) aircraft of 1 Squadron departed RAF Leuchars in September 2014. The Station has since been handed over to the Army as of March 2015. The station remains an RAF diversion airfield for aircraft in distress and QRA aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth. Geography The town is located near the north-eastern coast of Fife. The town has a population of 3,060. The town is nearly to the north of the village of Guardbridge, which lies on the north bank of the River Eden where it widens to the Edenmouth estuary before joining the North Sea at St Andrews Bay. Leuchars is north-east of Cupar and north-west from the university town of St Andrews. The city of Dundee is to the north, across the rail and road bridges that span the Firth of Tay. The town had an adjoining Royal Air Force base, RAF Leuchars, which was established in 1920, and was home to the Eurofighter Typhoon. In 2015, the RAF base became an Army base, as the regimental headquarters of 2 Close Support Battalion REME and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, who saw their return to Scotland after 20 years in Germany, as coming home. Climate Leuchars has an oceanic climate, like most of Western Europe. On average, Leuchars gets around of rain each year and 1,564 hours of sunshine, making it one of the driest and sunniest places in Scotland. The highest recorded temperature was in August 1990, while the lowest was , which was recorded in February 1986.

Berliner, or \\"midi\\", is a newspaper format with pages normally measuring about . The Berliner format is slightly taller and marginally wider than the tabloid/compact format; and is both narrower and shorter than the broadsheet format. Origin The Berliner format is an innovation in press and an alternative to the broadsheet format. The name refers to the city of Berlin, and was originally contrasted with \\"North German\\" and \\"French\\" sizes in the early 20th century. European newspapers The Berliner format is used by many European newspapers, including dailies such as Le Monde and Le Figaro in France, Osloboƒëenje in Bosnia, Le Temps in Switzerland, La Repubblica and La Stampa in Italy, De Morgen, Le Soir and Het Laatste Nieuws in Belgium, Mlad√° fronta Dnes and Lidov√© noviny in the Czech Republic, and others such as Expresso in Portugal and Jurnalul Na»õional or Evenimentul Zilei in Romania. The French business newspaper Les √âchos changed to this format in September 2003, and the largest daily papers in Croatia (Veƒçernji list), Serbia (Politika) and Montenegro (Vijesti), are also in this format. A recent European newspaper to join this trend is Het Financieele Dagblad, the daily Dutch newspaper that is focused on business and financial matters on 26 March 2013. Student publication The University Observer became Ireland's first Berliner-sized paper in September 2009. The Independent in London considered adopting this format, but could not afford to buy new presses; it ultimately became a tabloid size. Although the daily Berliner Zeitung is occasionally called simply Berliner, it is not printed in Berliner format. In fact, only two German national dailies use Berliner format: Die Tageszeitung (generally known as the \\"'\\"); and the Junge Welt, which in 2004 abandoned the unique slightly-larger-than-A4 size that had distinguished it since the early 1990s. The majority of the national quality dailies use the larger broadsheet format known as \\"nordisch\\", measuring . United States and Canada newspapers The daily Journal & Courier in Lafayette, Indiana was the first newspaper in North America to be produced in this format, making its debut on 31 July 2006. The Bucks County Herald in Lahaska, Pennsylvania, followed in 2009, and The Chronicle in Laurel, Mississippi, in April 2012, commencing publication at that time. Major papers such as the Chicago Tribune and The Cincinnati Enquirer have tested the format. Since then, a number of broadsheet newspapers throughout the United States and Canada have adopted a page format similar to Berliner, though some may use a taller page. In some instances, only the width has changed from the typical broadsheet page, and the height has remained the same or close to it. For example, The New York Times used a tall by wide page, but in 2007 downsized to . It still refers to itself as a broadsheet, even though its size is closer to Berliner. Asian newspapers The Indian business daily Mint, a collaboration with the Indian media house Hindustan Times Media Limited (HTML) and The Wall Street Journal, was among the first newspapers to use the Berliner format, starting from 1 February 2007. In Nepal, the Nepali Times became the first and the only newspaper using this format. In Pakistan, the English daily Pakistan Today is published in the Berliner format. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz has been published in this format since 18 February 2007. Though very rarely used in Metro Manila, the Berliner is the most popular format in the Philippines. In the Ilocandia, some of the well-known names are the Zigzag Weekly, the Northern Dispatch‚Äîcommonly called as Nordis‚Äîand the Northern Philippine Times. In the Visayas, the Panay News (Visayas' most widely circulated newspaper) also uses this format. Though not published for commercial purposes, the official publication of the Caritas Manila uses a slightly narrower Berliner format. In March 2009, South Korea's JoongAng Ilbo adopted the Berliner format, becoming the first Korean newspaper to do so. Also in the same month, Turkey's Gazete Habert√ºrk and Zaman adopted a variation of this format as and become two of the first Turkish newspaper to do so. The format is called Ciner format in Turkey because it is unique. On 1 June 2012, the UAE's leading English language newspaper, Gulf News, adopted the Berliner format, the first ever in the Arab Middle East. South American newspapers Some South American papers have dubbed the \\"compact\\" size as \\"Berliner\\". The former (also called \\"tall tab\\") size is closer to tabloid, being marginally taller. Argentina The Buenos Aires Herald, a daily Argentine newspaper founded in 1876, uses the Berliner format, which is also used by La Nueva, a newspaper of the Buenos Aires province. C√≥rdoba newspaper La Voz switched to Berliner from broadsheet in 2016. Bolivia The Los Tiempos newspaper from Cochabamba releases its editions in Berliner with full color in all pages starting October 2017. Previously, the newspaper was published in broadsheet. Brazil Jornal do Brasil, a daily Brazilian newspaper founded in 1891, was published in Berliner from 16 April 2006 until 31 August 2010, when the newspaper ceased to publish its physical issue and transferred all activities to the internet. Initially, only the newsstand edition was in that format, but its success made the format switch extend later to the subscriber's edition, which until then remained in broadsheet format. In 2008, Salvador-based Correio* (formerly Correio da Bahia) switched to Berliner, also from broadsheet. After being sold by Organiza√ß√µes Globo (currently Grupo Globo) to J. Hawilla's Grupo Traffic, Di√°rio de S. Paulo, which was a broadsheet, switched to Berliner, bringing it in line with its sister publications under Rede Bom Dia (the company, including Di√°rio de S. Paulo, is currently owned by Cereja Digital). Chile In 2003, national newspaper La Tercera switched from tabloid to Berliner. Local papers around Chile have also adopted the format, most notably El Mercurio de Valparaiso, the longest-running newspaper of the Spanish language. As of 17 November 2017, the format expanded to La Cuarta, which previously published in tabloid, like La Tercera. Peru El Comercio, the nation's most important newspaper switched its weekday editions to Berliner in 2016. The weekend editions are still produced in broadsheet. Other parts of the world In February 2010, Mauritius's century-old Le Mauricien adopted the Berliner format with full- colour content, thus becoming the first evening national paper in the country to adopt this format.

She completed her schooling at Fort Convent School, Bombay (present-day Mumbai), and graduated from Sydenham College, Bombay. Chawla was the winner of the Miss India title in 1984.Juhi Chawla - Femina 1990-1981! Contestants - Indiatimes.com. Feminamissindia.indiatimes.com (28 April 2011). Retrieved on 2013-12-23. She also won the Best Costume Award at the Miss Universe contest in 1984. Career Debut and breakthrough (1986‚Äì1988) Chawla ventured into films with the 1986 Sultanat but it turned out to be a commercial failure. She went on to act in the Kannada classic Premaloka, directed by Ravichandran in 1987. She also starred opposite Prosenjit Chatterjee in two films. Her first major role in Bollywood was in Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak in 1988, in which she starred with Aamir Khan. The film, a modern-day adaption of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, was both a major critical and commercial success, with Khan and Chawla becoming \\"overnight stars\\". It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film, and Chawla became the first actress to win the Filmfare Award for Lux New Face of the Year, also receiving her first nomination for Best Actress. Chawla's pairing with Aamir Khan and their on-screen chemistry was often cited by the media as successful. The film has since attained a cult status, with The Times of India ranking it amongst the \\"Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films\\", calling it \\"one of the landmark films of Hindi cinema\\" and crediting it with making \\"Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla household names\\". Premankur Biswas of First Post wrote in a retrospective review, \\"Juhi Chawla, with her flouncy ghagra and passive but assertive demeanor was an early predecessor to the sexually liberated Bollywood heroines of today. She wore what she wanted and initiated a relationship with the man she desired\\". 1989‚Äì1999: Success and stardom In 1990, she starred in Pratibandh. She also received her second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for the film.

The last film she appeared in that year was the thriller Darr, directed by Yash Chopra.

Harikrishnans was a commercial success. In 1999, she appeared in Arjun Pandit alongside Sunny Deol, which was mostly rejected by the audience.

The romantic comedy Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani was the company's first production starring Chawla and Khan. Upon release, the film underperformed at the box office, though over the years it has been appreciated for its bold theme on media wars. Chawla's performance as the journalist Ria Banarjee received appreciation from the critics. Rediff critic Swapna Mitter wrote, \\"This is probably one of Juhi's best performances. She has never looked better... and once again, like Hum Hain Rahi Pyaar Ke, she shows a flair for comedy.\\" Her other release of the year was Rakesh Roshan's delayed Karobaar: The Business of Love, which was in the making for over five years and failed upon release. She played a small role in Gang. In 2001, she appeared in the action comedy One 2 Ka 4 with Shah Rukh Khan, in their seventh collaboration together and with Jackie Shroff, the film was a flop at the box office. Chawla played three roles in the film; a haryanvi maid, a bar dancer and an undercover cop. While the film was noticed for its serious content, her comedic performance won acclaim from several critics. Vinayak Chakravorty wrote, \\"But the winner here is Juhi ‚Äî that vintage comic flair of Hum Hain Raahi Pyaar Ke almost comes back from the dead.\\" Similarly, Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India \\"The only saving grace in this sea of confusion is Juhi. As a fast talking Haryanvi loudmouth who has the hots for her 'Ricky Martin' (Shahrukh), she is an absolute delight.\\" The Hindu agreed with this observation, further noting her \\"unfailing sense of humour\\" and timing, which \\"few can match\\". Another release of the year was the comedy Aamdani Atthani Kharcha Rupaiyaa opposite Govinda. Chawla in 2009 Having taken a one-year break from film work, Chawla started appearing in independent and art films, and her work included critically acclaimed films Jhankaar Beats, 3 Deewarein (both 2003), 7¬Ω Phere and My Brother Nikhil (both 2005), and Bas Ek Pal (2006).

She won a Star Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress for 3 Deewarein, which earned her positive reviews. Robert Koehler of Variety wrote, \\"Chawla gradually settles into a role that contains at least three different character layers to it.\\" She acted opposite Gurdas Mann in the Punjabi-language feature Des Hoyaa Pardes (2004) which was warmly received. She said she chose the part because upon reading the script, she identified a \\"tremendous scope for performance\\". The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Punjabi. Set in Goa between 1986 and 1994, Onir's My Brother Nikhil centers on the character of Nikhil (played by Sanjay Suri), a young man who is tested HIV-positive. Chawla co-starred as Anamika Kapoor, a schoolteacher by profession and Nikhil's loving and supportive elder sister, who accepts his same-gender partner and stands by his side through his struggle. The film opened to a welcome reception by critics, and Chawla's performance was particularly praised. Khalid Mohamed was highly approving of her portrayal: \\"Above all, Juhi Chawla is perfect. Her effortless blend of conflicting emotions is what A-class acting is all about. Ms Chawla is a diamond in this little gem of a movie.\\" She starred alongside Irfan Khan in 7¬Ω Phere. Hindustan Times commended her comic performance. In 2006, she appeared in ensemble drama Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute To Love directed by Nikhil Advani.

Jha wrote of Chawla that she \\"uses her ability to portray hurt and guilt with minimum effort.\\" The same year she starred in another Punjabi film, the historical drama Waris Shah: Ishq Daa Waaris, which won a National Film Award. According to BBC, the film \\"bears the hallmarks of a quality production\\". The film is based on the life of Punjabi poet Waris Shah during the times he wrote the poem Heer. Chawla and Manoj Bajpayee played a married couple in Ganesh Acharya's drama Swami (2007), which follows their financial struggles to secure proper education for their intelligent son. Reviews of the film were varied. Tanveer Bookwala of Rediff appreciated the film for its simple story and for giving the lead pair \\"the chance to be unconventional and subtle and they do not fail to deliver.\\" Chawla then appeared in Ravi Chopra's Bhoothnath (2008) with Amitabh Bachchan, in which she made her singing debut with the song \\"Chalo Jaane Do\\", the film was a moderate success and Chawla was appreciated for her role. Manish Gajjar from BBC wrote, \\"Juhi Chawla's brilliant comic timing as Banku's mum has you in stitches.\\" Another film called Krazzy 4 with Irfan Khan and Arshad Warsi was released in 2008, the film failed to do well at the box office. In 2009, she appeared in a guest appearance in Luck By Chance to play a comic part for which she dyed her hair blonde. The film and Chawla's performance got extremely positive reviews and got a good opening at the box office. Work after hiatus (2010‚Äìpresent) In 2011, Chawla starred in Onir's critically acclaimed anthology film I Am (2010). Unfolded in several chapters, the film starred Chawla alongside Manisha Koirala in an episode named \\"I Am Megha\\".

Her performance also earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Rajeev Masand wrote, \\"Juhi Chawla is a portrait of suppressed vulnerability as she confronts her feelings about an old home and an old friend.\\" Chawla next starred in the action comedy Son of Sardaar (2012) opposite Ajay Devgn, which was poorly received by critics. Live Mint called it \\"the worst portrayal of Punjabiyat in Hindi cinema\\", although it referred to her part as \\"the only unique role in the film\\" and further noted, \\"An actor with proven talent for comedy, Chawla makes Pammi, her character, pathetic as well as feisty.\\" The film earned worldwide. Chawla in 2012 After appearing in offbeat films and occasionally playing guest roles throughout the decade, Chawla made a full-fledged comeback in 2014 with Gulaab Gang alongside her once arch-rival Madhuri Dixit. Chawla and Dixit played ruthless political rivals, and this was the first time in Chawla's career that she played an antagonist. Her negative role of Sumitra was widely appreciated and her performance earned rave reviews. Shubhra Gupta of The financial Times described her character as \\"the sort of politician that men have played for ever: hungry for power, will stop at nothing, not even murder and mayhem. She rules with an iron fist and a sneer.\\" Hindustan Times wrote, \\"An effective hero needs a larger-than-life villain. In this case, it is Juhi Chawla who marries her sister to a rapist and apparently killed her husband to get political power. Like most corrupt politicians we see onscreen, she is an opportunist who lusts for power. It speaks well about her acting prowess that we come to hate the otherwise effervescent Juhi in this film.\\" Anupama Chopra wrote, \\"Her perverse wickedness is the best part of the film\\", but called it a \\"a one-note character\\". Rajeev Masand called her \\"terrific\\" in the part and concluded a scathing review of the film asserting, \\"if you must watch this film, watch it for Juhi Chawla's inspired performance.\\" She received a second Filmfare nomination for Best Supporting Actress. The same year she also appeared with Helen Mirren and Om Puri in a guest role in the Steven Spielberg-produced Hollywood film The Hundred Foot Journey.

In a critical review for The Hindu, Namrata Joshi noted \\"Azmi and Chawla who, with their dignified presence and easy camaraderie stop you from heading to the exit doo.\\" Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times liked the film for its \\"well told ethics versus greed story\\" and mentioned Chawla as \\"heartwarming\\". In 2017, she played an Indian defence minister in the Alt Balaji web series The Test Case.

He was an MP from 1996 to 1999, representing first the Alliance and then the Christian Heritage Party in the House of Representatives. The Liberals Grover was originally a member of the National Party, but became disillusioned with National's economic policy under Minister of Finance Ruth Richardson. Richardson promoted strong free market economic theories, which were popular with some sections of the party, but resented by more conservative elements. Gilbert Myles and Hamish McIntyre, two National MPs who believed that Richardson's reforms were deeply harmful to society, split from the party in 1992, founding the new Liberal Party. Grover was one of those who accompanied them. Soon afterwards, the Liberals chose to join the Alliance, a broad left-wing coalition which they saw as the most significant opponent of Richardson and her allies. Some members of the Liberals, quite possibly including Grover, were unhappy at this decision, however ‚Äî while they opposed Richardson's reforms, they did not see themselves as left-wing. Following the failure of either Myles or McIntyre to be re-elected, Myles decamped to the newly founded New Zealand First party and McIntyre retired. Grover assumed the leadership of the Liberals in 1994. Member of Parliament Grover was elected to Parliament in the 1996 election as an Alliance list MP. He disagreed with the Alliance on a number of issues, however, and on 11 June 1999, not long before the 1999 election, he officially quit the Alliance to join the Christian Heritage Party. This gave the CHP its only ever seat in Parliament. In 1998 Grover had indicated that he would stand for the Christian Democrat Party, but when they became Future New Zealand he decided to join the CHP instead. Grover's switches was strongly criticised by other parties, particularly the Alliance but also New Zealand First, which had also experienced defections. For the election, Grover was ranked sixth on Christian Heritage's list, but the party failed to win any seats. Grover therefore left Parliament. Before entering politics, Grover had a background in law, having received an LLB from University of Auckland. He worked as a magistrate in Hong Kong from 1979 to 1983.

Led by Karl Kilbom and Nils Flyg, the party was founded in 1929 as a splinter group of the Communist Party of Sweden. Until 1934, the splinter group used the same name Communist Party of Sweden (), so in order to keep the two factions apart, this faction was generally known as Kilbommare (\\"Kilbomians\\") while those who stayed in the old party were known as Sill√©nare (\\"Sill√©nians\\", after their leader Hugo Sill√©n). SP election poster. Text reads, \\"Strike the beast down - vote with the people for the country' (the dragon is labelled \\"International Capitalism\\"). In the split, the entire communist parliamentary group, the party's official newspaper, Folkets Dagblad Politiken, and most of the more militant members joined the Kilbom-Flyg faction. History The Kilbom-led SKP held its congress prior to the Sill√©n- led party. At the congress there was a debate regarding the character of the party, whether to continue the system of party cells (the structure of the pre-split SKP) or whether to become a more open mass party. In the end the statues adopted by the congress differed little from those of the pre-split SKP. Party cells remained the basic organization of the party, and in places where no cell existed a party member would be organized in the arbetarkommun directly. However the criteria for membership were relaxed, the sole remaining criterion was activism in the base level organization.Bolin, Jan. Parti av ny typ?: skapandet av ett svenskt kommunistiskt parti 1917-1933. Stockholm: Distribution, Almqvist & Wiksell International, 2004. p. 371 In 1930 Flyg, as an MP, put forward a motion on separation of church and state. The motion was voted down in the Lower House. The Kilbom party merged in 1934 with a break- away group of the Social Democrats based in Gothenburg, led by Albin Str√∂m. At the time of the merger, the party changed its name to the Socialist Party (Socialistiska partiet). The transformation into SP also marked a break with the previous line of the party towards the Comintern and the Soviet Union. Initially the party had tried to persuade the Comintern to be allowed to return to the International. Gradually, however the party became more and more antagonistic toward the Comintern and the Soviet Union. The party gradually disintegrated, and many of the most prominent leaders such as Kilbom, left the party in 1937. During World War II, their staunch anti-Soviet line led the party to actually embrace some pro-German views (partially since the huge financial problems of the party led it to seek financial aid from Germany). As a result of this, in 1940, a group of members that included Albin Str√∂m and Evald H√∂glund broke away and formed the Left Socialist Party. In the elections the same year, the party lost its parliamentary representation. When Flyg died in 1943 he was succeeded as party leader by Agaton Blom. During the final years of the war, the party continued to lose members and support, and changed its name to the Swedish Socialist Party (Svenska socialistiska partiet). It was finally dissolved in 1948. The local units of the party were known as \\"Socialist Labour Communes\\" (Socialistiska Arbetarkommuner). In terms of international contacts, the party was initially associated with the International Communist Opposition and later with the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre (also known as the \\"London Bureau\\"). The youth league of the party was called the Socialist Youth League (Socialistiska ungdomsf√∂rbundet), affiliated to the International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations.

It incorporates the Ferrypoint, Sinah Beach, The Kench, Sinah Warren, and Sinah Common. It is bounded to the east by West Town. Langstone Harbour and its entrance form the north and west borders, and to the south is Hayling Bay. History Monks had settled in the Sinah Warren by the 15th century. Fishermen's huts were present in the shelter of the Kench by the 19th century. The Norkfolk Inn, precursor to the Ferry Boat Inn, was created to serve the needs of the fishermen. Around 1900 Sandeman set out to extend a road out to the ferrypoint for the Hayling Island Steamboat enterprise. While that enterprise failed the road did assist subsequent development of the Hayland Island Ferry, golf course, health farm and the war effort for the Second World War. In recent years land use of Sinah has stabilised with various areas being designated nature reserves. The Ferry Point The Ferry Point is at the westernmost tip of Hayling Island in Hampshire, England, overlooking the fast tides of Langstone Harbour entrance. It was previously known as Sinah Point. The current at the Ferry Point is extremely treacherous and has claimed many lives over the years. There is a small cluster of houses and a pub, the \\"Ferry Boat Inn\\" (originally the Duke of Norfolk). Continuing directly past the put leads to a slipway directly into the water. A fork to the left leads past the base of the Langstone Harbour Master to the jetty for the passenger ferry to Eastney in Portsmouth. The Hayling Island golf course backs on to the point and the Kench (a small bay) lies just eastward. A single lane leads east toward the rest of the island. There are good views north to Portsdown Hill and Butser Hill. Sinah Beach Sinah Beach extends from the Ferry Boat Inn at the western end of Hayling Island. Sinah Warren Sinah Warren is the area to north of Ferry Road where the Holiday Camp is located. Monks initially had a settlement here by the 15th century, and it is jokingly put this was the first health farm on the site. The 16th century saw the monks displaced and the rights sold to the Duke of Norfolk. It may have been sold to William Padwick, Esq. in 1825. Sold to August Arbuthnot in the 1930s he built the Sinah Warren Residence and planted various species of plants and trees from his worldwide travels and established one of the first Factory Farms, initially with Angora Rabbits then with Poultry to help alleviate the food shortage in the Second World War. The Royal Navy then took over Sinah Warren until the 1950s when it was sold and developed into the current holiday camp. Sinah Common Sinah Common is the area to the south of Ferry Road incorporating the Golf course. The area is now a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The area of water in front of the clubhouse is seemingly nowadays referred to as Sinah Lake although an area within Langstone Harbour that forms a lake at low tide is also known as Sinah Lake. Elements of World War 2 gun batteries and pill boxes are well preserved in this area. The Kench The Kench is a small natural inlet to the north of Ferry Road. Proposals to change this into a commercial port or marina foundered or were thwarted, and the area is now a designated nature reserve with a handful of houseboats permitted. Landmarks and places of interest Ferry Boat Inn The inn was known previously by various titles: as the \\"Norfolk Inn\\", \\"Norfolk Lodge (Inn)\\", \\"Hayling Ferry Tavern\\", and the \\"Duke of Norfolk\\". The original Norfolk Inn was present before 1776, built to the east of The Kench on the north side of the ferry point. The replacement building at the ferry point, south of Ferry Road, was built from the wreck of HMS Impregnable which sunk in 1799. The current building to the north of ferry was originally where the boathouse stood. Members of the Spraggs family were licensees and owners from at least 1900 until after the mid-twentieth century and were responsible for the \\"Ferry\\" rebranding. The Spraggs were also responsible for operation of Hayling Ferry and there was an undoubtedly synergy between the two enterprises. The establishment is no longer a freehouse, having been sold to Stonegate Pub Company, and is variously branded \\"Ferryboat\\" both with and without a space. Other places of interest * Sinah Warren Holiday Camp * Golf Club * Second World War Pillbox and Gunnery Buildings Transport The Hayling Ferry links to Portsmouth from the Ferry Point, and has been running for more than 200 years. In March 2015, the service shut down when the Hayling Island Ferry company went into administration after safety problems and repeated fines for carrying too many passengers at once. Service resumed in August 2016 after a fundraising effort which included a ¬£5,000 donation from Richard Branson. Bus services to the ferry ceased in 2004.

It has over of remaining parkland estate, forming the Malahide Demesne Regional Park. History The estate began in 1185, when Richard Talbot, a knight who accompanied Henry II to Ireland in 1174, was granted the \\"lands and harbour of Malahide.\\" The oldest parts of the castle date back to the 12th century and it was home to the Talbot family for 791 years, from 1185 until 1976, the only exception being the period from 1649‚Äì60, when Oliver Cromwell granted it to Miles Corbet after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland; Corbet was hanged following the demise of Cromwell, and the castle was restored to the Talbots. The building was notably enlarged in the reign of Edward IV, with towers added in 1765. The estate survived such losses as the Battle of the Boyne, when fourteen members of the owner's family sat down to breakfast in the Great Hall, and all were dead by evening, and the Penal Laws, even though the family remained Roman Catholic until 1774. In 1918 during the First World War a mooring-out base for airships was established in the grounds of the castle, used by airships from RNAS Anglesey in Wales which conducted anti-submarine operations in the Irish Sea. There were plans to base airships here from 1919, but these were abandoned at the end of the war. In the 1920s the private papers of James Boswell were discovered in the castle, and sold to American collector Ralph H. Isham by Boswell's great-great-grandson Lord Talbot de Malahide. The papers have since passed to Yale University, which has published popular and scholarly editions of his journals and correspondence. A second cache was discovered soon after and also purchased by Isham. Malahide Castle and its demesne was eventually inherited by the 7th Baron Talbot and on his death in 1973, passed to his sister, Rose. In 1975, Rose sold the castle to the Irish State, partly to fund inheritance taxes. Many of the contents, notably furnishings, had been sold in advance, leading to considerable public controversy, but private and governmental parties were able to retrieve some. Visiting The castle, along with its subsidiary attractions, was for many years operated as a tourist attraction by Dublin Tourism, working with Fingal County Council, which owns the whole demesne. The operating partner is now Shannon Heritage, which has in turn appointed subsidiary partners, most notably, for shop and caf√© facilities, Avoca Handweavers. The castle itself can be visited for a fee, on a guided-tour-only basis. In addition, it is possible to hire the famously Gothic Great Hall for private banquets. The castle's best-known rooms are the Oak Room, and the Great Hall, which displays Talbot family history. In the courtyard behind the castle are a caf√© and craft shop, and other retail facilities. Malahide Castle stands within an extensive demesne The Talbot Botanic Gardens, situated behind the castle, comprising several hectares of plants and lawns, a walled garden of 1.6 hectares and seven glasshouses, including a Victorian conservatory. Many plants from the southern hemisphere, notably Chile and Australia, are featured. The gardens showcase the plant collecting passion of the 7th Lord Talbot de Malahide in the mid 20th Century. The demesne is one of few surviving examples of 18th century landscaped parks, and has wide lawns surrounded by a protective belt of trees. It can be visited freely, with a number of entrances and car parking areas. In addition to woodland walks, and a marked \\"exercise trail,\\" the park features sports grounds, including a cricket pitch and several football pitches, a 9-hole par-3 golf course, an 18-hole pitch-and-putt course, tennis courts and a boules area. Adjacent to the golfing facilities, and containing the access to them, is a pavilion which also contains a caf√© and other facilities. There is an extensive children's playground near the castle. A seasonal road train operates in a loop from the vicinity of the castle to the railway station and back. A Malahide castle and coastal tour bus begins its journeys in Malahide Castle and continues to Howth, with two daily departures. Former exhibits Two major exhibits were required to move away from the demesne in 2010-2011, as the park was prepared for relaunch under new management. One has since reopened, the other is pending: *Tara's Palace Museum of Childhood was formerly located at Malahide Castle, but relocated to Powerscourt Estate near Enniskerry in 2011. *The Fry Model Railway was located at Malahide Castle from 1988-2010. it is expected to re-open in 2019 at the restored Casino House, a former shooting lodge of the Talbot de Malahide family, located near the railway station. Cricket The cricket venue is located in the Lady Acre field and is home to Malahide Cricket Club. It also attracts international fixtures with teams such as Australia, England and Pakistan.. In September 2013 using temporary grandstands and hospitality pavilions over 10,000 spectators were accommodated, a record for the Island of Ireland. Access The Park at Malahide Castle The main entrance to the demesne is off the Malahide Road, with access also possible from Malahide village. Dublin Bus route numbers 42, 102 and 142 lie along one side of the park, and Malahide Railway Station is near the castle end of the park.  Concert venue  The grounds at Malahide Castle were opened as a new concert venue by Fingal County Council in summer 2007, with concerts by Arctic Monkeys, Pink, Joe Cocker, Al Green and Bell X1 amongst others. In 2008 performers included Neil Young, Radiohead, and Eric Clapton. Prince performed at the Castle on July 30, 2011. In the summer of 2017 two more bands played at the venue, with a capacity of 20,000 people. The band Arcade Fire brought their 'Everything Now' tour to the venue. The next day, The 1975 performed. More artists played the grounds in June 2018, including Chic featuring Nile Rodgers, Liam Gallagher, Gorillaz, Kodaline, and LCD soundsystem. June 2019 saw more artists perform in the venue, over a longer period of time compared to previous years. Snow Patrol were followed by The Cure the following day, and Mumford & Sons performed on both the Friday and Saturday of the second weekend, with Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds playing on Sunday. George Ezra performed on the Friday of the third and final weekend, with Lana Del Rey playing on the Saturday.  World Scout Moot  The grounds of the castle have been announced as the venue for the base camp of the 16th World Scout Moot, to be hosted by Scouting Ireland in July and August 2021.

He is remembered for his role in the Authorized Version of the Bible, a project of which he was initiator. Life He was born about Michaelmas 1549 at Pinhoe, near Exeter. He was fifth son of Richard Rainolds; William Rainolds was his brother. His uncle Thomas Rainolds held the living of Pinhoe from 1530 to 1537, and was subsequently Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Dean of Exeter. John Rainolds appears to have entered the University of Oxford originally at Merton, but on 29 April 1563 he was elected to a scholarship at Corpus Christi College, where two of his brothers, Hierome and Edmond, were already fellows. He became probationary fellow on 11 October 1566, and full fellow two years later. While a student at Corpus, he converted from Catholicism to Protestantism. On 15 October 1568 he graduated B.A.; and about this time he was assigned as tutor to Richard Hooker. In 1566 he played the female role of Hippolyta in a performance of the play Palamon and Arcite at Oxford, as part of an elaborate entertainment for Queen Elizabeth I. She rewarded him with 8 gold angels. Rainolds later recalled this youthful role with embarrassment, as he came to support Puritan objections to the theatre, being particularly critical of cross-dressing roles.Kirby Farrell, Kathleen M. Swaim, The Mysteries of Elizabeth I: Selections from English Literary Renaissance, Univ of Massachusetts Press, 2003, p.37. In 1572‚Äì73 Rainolds was appointed reader in Greek, and his lectures on Aristotle's Rhetoric made his reputation. In 1576 he objected to the proposal that Antonio de Corro should be allowed to proceed Doctor of Divinity; and at the same time he was instrumental in having Francesco Pucci expelled from the university, Pucci being an associate and ally of Corro, who had moved against orthodox Calvinist positions.Secor, Philip Bruce (1999) Richard Hooker: Prophet of Anglicanism, p. 96. Rainolds resigned his readership in 1578. The popular, young scholar was promoted as a candidate for college president by many university authorities in 1579, when it was thought to be an opening for the position.\\"Corpus Christi College.\\" A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 3, the University of Oxford. Eds. H E Salter, and Mary D Lobel. London: Victoria County History, 1954. 219-228. British History Online Retrieved 8 February 2020. In the early 1580s, in the aftermath of Edmund Campion's strenuous defence of Catholic principles, Francis Walsingham sent the Jesuit John Hart to Rainolds for an extended discussion. Hart conceded to Rainolds on the deposing power of the Pope, at least according to the Protestant perspective, and an account was published in The summe of the conference betweene John Rainoldes and John Hart (1584). Unable to agree with the president of Corpus, William Cole, Rainolds then gave up his fellowship in 1586, and became a tutor at Queen's College. In the same year Rainolds was appointed to a temporary lectureship, founded by Walsingham, for anti-Catholic polemical theology. In 1589 the Regius Chair of Divinity at Oxford fell vacant. Rainolds had reason to anticipate the position would be his, but the Queen objected, and Thomas Holland was appointed. Rainolds's lectureship was continued by Walsingham.Lawrence D. Green, John Rainolds's Oxford Lectures (1986), p. 33; Google Books By this time he had acquired a considerable reputation as a disputant on the Puritan side, and the story goes that Elizabeth I visiting the university in 1592 \\"schooled him for his obstinate preciseness, willing him to follow her laws, and not run before them.\\" In 1593 Rainolds was made dean of Lincoln College, Oxford and/or of Lincoln Cathedral. The fellows of Corpus were anxious to replace Cole with Rainolds, and an exchange was effected, Rainolds being elected president in December 1598. Creation of the King James Version of the Bible The chief events of his subsequent career were his share in the Hampton Court Conference, where he was the most prominent representative of the Puritan party and received a good deal of favour from the King. During the Conference, the Puritans, led by Rainolds as spokesperson, directly questioned James about their grievances. However, almost every request brought forward by Rainolds was immediately denied or disputed by James. See Adam Nicolson, God‚Äôs Secretaries: The Making of the King James Bible (New York: HarperCollins, 2003), pp. 53‚Äì57 At some point during the course of Rainolds‚Äô pleading before the king, Rainolds made a request that ‚Äúone only translation of the Bible . . . [be] declared authentical, and read in the church.‚Äù Alister E. McGrath, In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 161 Whether Rainolds was asking for a new translation or simply for a direction to authorize only one of the existing English translations, most took Rainolds‚Äô words as a request for the former.In the semiofficial proceedings of William Barlow, it is reported, ‚ÄúAfter that, he [Rainolds] moved his Majesty that there be a new translation of the Bible because those which were allowed in the reigns of Henry the eighth and Edward the sixth were corrupt and not answerable to the truth of the original.‚Äù See Olga S. Opfell, The King James Bible Translators (London: McFarland, 1982), pp. 6‚Äì7 James readily agreed to a new translation. During the creation of the subsequent drafting of the new translation of the Bible, Rainolds worked as a part of the group which undertook the translation of the Prophets. The group met weekly in Rainolds‚Äô lodgings in Corpus. Despite being afflicted by failing eyesight and gout, Rainolds continued the work of translation to the end of his life, even being carried into the meeting room. Death Rainolds died of consumption on 21 May 1607, leaving a great reputation for scholarship and high character. On his deathbed he earnestly desired absolution according to the form of the Church of England, and received it from Dr. Thomas Holland (translator), whose hand he affectionately kissed. He is buried in the chapel of Corpus Christi.

However, it cost his own life in the following power struggle within the Communist Party of China. Early life Yuan was born into a Hakka family in Maoping Township, Jinggangshan City, Jiangxi, at the foothills of the Luoxian Mountains, in October, 1898. After graduating from a private elementary school, he dropped out of a local public middle school when his father abruptly died in 1920, leaving the family destitute. Being one of the extremely few peasants who received some education, he was elected by the local peasants as their representatives in their struggle against the brutal oppression of local landlords. As a result, he was deeply feared and hated by local strongmen such as Xie Guannan (). In 1923, Xie Guannan had Yuan Wencai's home ransacked, house burned down, his elder brother imprisoned, his wife raped and then enslaved, while his mother murdered execution style. The local strongmen were able to bribe the corrupted local government and had Yuan Wencai as wanted criminal. This marked the end of Yuan's struggle for welfare of the local peasants in legal means. The young Yuan Wencai, then in his early twenties, fled into the mountains and joined a group of brigands calling themselves the \\"Horse and Sword Brigade\\" () headed by Hu Yachun (). Yuan Wencai soon proved himself and it was not long before he became the leader of bandits. They operated in the hills of Jinggangshan, particularly around Ningang county, and had close ties with the \\"Green Forest\\" () bandits based on higher terrain, led by Wang Zuo. Yuan Wencai proved to be a better leader than Wang Zuo in that he had managed to win greater support of local peasants, and in 1924, Yuan's band attacked and took the town of Ninggang (), burned down the governmental administrative building. The Jiangxi provincial government sent in a battalion to eradicate Yuan's force, but due to the completely lack of support of local population which cheered Yuan's action, not only the campaign had failed to eradicate Yuan's force and resulted in defeat, but also suffered heavy casualties, though a great portion of the casualties suffered by the governmental force was due to illness. The failed governmental attempt increased Yuan's reputation among local peasants. In 1925, Wang Zuo was forced to flee to Yuan Wencai's turf due to a coup staged by his subordinates, and Yuan helped Wang to defeat his opponents and firmly reestablished Wang's position as the chief of the band. The two became sworn brothers and strategically positioned their forces to secure their bases in Jinggangshan. Yuan's force was stationed at the foothills at Maoping, while Wang's force was stationed in the mountains at higher elevation at Greater and Lesser Five Wells (Daxiaowujing ). Early communist years From the summer of 1925, Yuan Wencai began to have contact with representatives of the Communist Party of China via the Ninggang () communist You Chaoqing (). In September, 1925, Yuan's force was reorganized as the Ninggang Security Regiment with Yuan as the regimental commander, and this is the first armed force in China that was under the control of Communist Party of China. In October 1926, during the Northern Expedition, he organized an attack on Ninggang county, deposed the local county chief Shen Qingyuan () of the Beiyang clique of warlords, while seizing weapons and securing the area for the Communists. In November of that year, he became a member of the Communist Party, and his men were reorganized as a peasant self-defence force. After the appointment of a new county chief by the newly established Republican government at Nanjing. After April 12 Incident, Yuan Wencai, like Wang Zuo, decided to stay with communist side, and became the only two surviving communist forces locally, each had around sixty rifles respectively. Both Yuan and Wang adopted new strategies when they resumed their banditry activities for survival in that they had only targeted the richest landlords and merchants who were mostly hated by the general population. In doing so, they had managed not only to win the support of lower and lower-middle classes, but also that of many members of the middle class such as small business owners. Consequently, this successful practice also became the source of their crimes they were accused of in their subsequent downfall, when their future comrades accused them for being \\"Not carrying out the revolution completely\\" and \\"Being rightist\\". Due to the popular support from those with better economic status, the communists were able to secure a steady supply of provisions needed via trade, and helped with properties confiscated from the richest local strongmen, the communists became bolder and concentrated on guerrilla warfare against local governmental forces which were incapable of exterminating Yuan's and Wang's forces due to the strong popular support the communists enjoyed. In July, 1927, under the order of communists, Yuan's men and Wang's men raided Yongxin County, freeing over 80 Communist Party agents held in the local jail converted from a gaol. Although the town was briefly occupied, it was obvious that it was impossible for the token communist force to hold the town and thus they soon withdrew to the mountains to continue their guerrilla warfare. Joining Mao Zedong On September 30, 1927, Mao Zedong arrived at Sanwan (‰∏âÊπæ) village of Yongxin (Ê∞∏Êñ∞) county, just north of Jinggangshan, with the remnants from the abortive Autumn Harvest Uprising, and sent letters to both Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo to ask their help to establish a communist base locally. On October 3, 1927, Mao's force reached the town of Ninggang (ÂÆÅÂÜà) and held a conference, at which Mao personally vetoed the suggestion to eliminate Yuan and Wang by force. At first Yuan Wencai was suspicious of Mao and lay an ambush on the mountain road to Ninggang to defend his turf. Accompanied by You Chaoqing (Â∞§Ë∂ÖÊ∏Ö), Mao went to meet Yuan on October 6, 1927 at Dacang (Â§ß‰ªì) village near Maoping (ËåÖÂù™), and convinced Yuan to join his men. Mao gave more than a hundred rifles to Yuan and in return, Yuan gave over a thousand silver dollars to Mao. The next day, Yuan personally held a ceremony to welcome Mao and his men to Maoping (ËåÖÂù™). Yuan had his bodyguard Li Genjin (ÊùéÊ†πÂã§) accompany Mao to Maoping, where they set up military headquarters. Yuan subsequently helped to gather five tons of grains and a huge amount of cloth to Mao's men, and helped to established the first military hospital in the communist base. That winter Yuan's men drilled together with the Communists and were further indoctrinated in Marxist political theory, when Mao sent cadres including Xu Yangang (ÂæêÂΩ¶Âàö), You Xuecheng (Ê∏∏Èõ™Á®ã), and Chen Bojun (Èôà‰ºØÈíß) to help Yuan. In February 1928, the forces of Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo were officially incorporated into the regular Communist army as the 1st Army, 1st Division, 2nd Regiment. Yuan was named as the regimental commander, and Wang as the deputy regimental commander, with He Changgong as the communist party representative (‰ΩïÈïøÂ∑•). They participated in a successful attack at Xincheng on a battalion of the Kuomintang's Jiangxi Army, killing the enemy commander and taking more than a hundred prisoners. In the spring of 1928 Yuan Wencai introduced the sister of a classmate, He Zizhen, to Mao Zedong. The couple began living together soon afterwards, much to the delight of Yuan. He cooked them a nuptial supper, apparently hoping that the partnership would commit Mao more strongly to the area's defence. Soon afterwards, he accompanied Mao Zedong to Lingxian county in southern Hunan province in aid of Zhu De. Jinggangshan had meanwhile been overrun by landlord militia and had to be reconquered. After Zhu De's soldiers joined the Jinggangshan base, they were merged with the existing forces to become the Fourth \\"Red Army\\". Yuan and Wang's 2nd Regiment was renamed the 32nd Regiment. Later in the year, Zhu De's 28th and 29th regiments crossed into Hunan. The 32nd Regiment was given the assignment of securing Maoping from the advance of the Kuomintang's Jiangxi units until his return. In January 1929, the bulk of the Red Army left Jinggangshan to establish a new base at Ruijin, leaving around 800 ex- Kuomintang troops under Peng Dehuai. Just after the New Year, it was agreed that Peng's men and the 32nd Regiment of Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai should stay behind to defend Jinggangshan. Under intense pressure for about a week, Peng gathered together his three surviving companies and broke through the enemy blockade with heavy casualties. For the next year Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo survived with their men in the mountains and may have returned to banditry in their guerrilla warfare. The Kuomintang's repeated mop up operations against them proved to be futile because the communist forces only confiscated property from wealthy landlords, and distributing to peasants. As a result, such banditry was viewed positively by the local general populace, which refused to corporate with the Kuomintang forces. Prelude to downfall Jinggangshan and Jiangxi Soviet were not immune to the power struggles within the Communist Party of China in the early 1930s. Xiang Zhongfa and Li Lisan succeeded in rising to power under the direction and support of the Comintern and their extreme leftist policy inevitably effected all communist bases in China, including Jinggangshan. The extreme leftism of the new communist leadership included what Mao Zedong called military adventurism, which included attempts to take over the large cities, a result of unrealistic optimism on the Chinese revolution and a direct copy of the Soviet model of urban revolution. The new strategy was obvious unfit for China at the time, and many commanders such as Peng Dehuai, Zhu De and Chen Yi voiced their opposition, Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai included, but it was useless because the new leadership refused to change its policy. As a result, the communist forces met disastrous defeats in attempts to carry out this unrealistic policy. Mao Zedong strongly opposed the military adventurism of Xiang Zhongfa and Li Lisan, but lost and was temporarily forced out of the communist leadership and sent to southern Jiangxi. Although Mao's new position appeared to have the equal rank, in reality Mao was demoted, and could not protect Yuan and Wang, and his other prot√©g√©s as he used to. Furthermore, during the 6th National Conference of Communist Party of China held from June to July, 1928 in Moscow, the top brass of communists passed the resolution on the \\"Organizational Problems of Soviet Government\\", in which it clearly stated that the bandits could only be utilized before the success of uprising, but afterward, they must be eliminated. This resolution had provided excellent ammo for Li Lisan and Xiang Zhongfa in their power struggle against Mao, and people like Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo were obviously targets. However, the political struggle did not end at the top leadership of the communists. In contrast to the professional soldier Peng Dehuai who faithfully attempted to carry out the impossible missions by dutifully obeying the orders despite his personal opposition, which of course ended in obvious defeats, Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai not only voiced their opposition in words, but also carried it out in action by simply refusing to obey the unrealistic orders from the new communist party leadership and continued to practice Mao Zedong's strategy. The result of their actions was the obvious success that enabled Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai to have most of their force preserved. However, the relative success of Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai not only proved to be useless in helping them within the communist party, but it also served as a catalyst of their downfall because their success of preserving their own forces was viewed as an urgent threat by the new communist leadership, since with greater military force, it was more difficult to remove them politically. With their primary supporter and protector Mao Zedong falling out from power, Wang Zuo's and Yuan Wencai's days were numbered. When the resolution from the communist 6th National Conference held in the mid-1928 in Moscow reached the communist base in Jinggangshan, it was already winter. In the beginning of 1929, Mao held the Bailu (ÊüèÈú≤) Conference to discuss the issue. Wang Huai (ÁéãÊÄÄ), the communist party secretary of Yongxin (Ê∞∏Êñ∞) county and You Chaoqing (Â∞§Ë∂ÖÊ∏Ö), the communist party secretary of Ninggang (ÂÆÅÂÜà) county, who had been at odds with Yuan and Wang insisted on executing Yuan and Wang according to the resolution but their suggestion was once again vetoed by Mao. The resulting decision was that Wang would remain to command forces in the communist base, while Yuan would be named as the chief- of-staff and deployed with the communist force striking southern Jiangxi. During campaigns in southern Jiangxi, Yuan accidentally came across the resolution from Moscow at Donggu (‰∏úÂõ∫), and although he feared for his life, he decided to prove himself by returning to the communist base in May, 1929, and he continued his service with communist faithfully, but this did not help. Death In the late night of February 23, 1930, Peng Dehuai was awakened from bed by Xiang Zhongfa's and Li Lisan's three lieutenants Zhu Changxie (Êú±ÊòåÂÅï) and Wang Huai (ÁéãÊÄÄ), who told Peng that they had just received intelligence that claimed Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai, had defected to Kuomintang, and therefore they need Peng's signature to deploy troops to exterminate the traitors. Ironically, one of the supporters of Zhu Changxie (Êú±ÊòåÂÅï) and Wang Huai (ÁéãÊÄÄ), You Chaoqing (Â∞§Ë∂ÖÊ∏Ö), was the one who introduced Wang and Yuan to the communists, and Peng knew full well that neither Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai would do such thing. Peng initially refused, and argued in defense of Wang and Yuan. The three lieutenants of Xiang Zhongfa and Li Lisan then changed their story, claiming that the intelligence indeed appeared to be a rumor, and that they needed to arrange a meeting with the two commanders to clear things up, and that some forces should be deployed just in case. Sensing Peng Dehuai's opposition, the three also asked Peng not to become involved, to remaining where he was, instead of attending the planned meeting, for the sake of not agitating the situation. This tactic finally convinced Peng Dehuai to give his signature. Subsequently the three men led over three hundred troops away to plot their next move. After leaving Peng Dehuai's camp, the three immediately faked Mao Zedong's order to lure both Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai to the supposed meeting to discuss the military situation. But once Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai reached the meeting, they were shot in obscure circumstances, allegedly ambushed while trying to rebel. Wang managed to escape out a window but drowned whilst attempting to cross a river. As early as October of that year, Mao Zedong criticized the officials in power of the Jiangxi Soviet for the assassination of his old allies. Just who gave the order for the death of Wang Zuo, however, is still not clear, although a number of officials of the Jiangxi Communist Party were implicated. Wang Yunlong (ÁéãÈõ≤ÈöÜ), Wang Zuo's younger brother and an officer of the 32nd Regiment, became the new leader of his brother's men, and defected to Kuomintang, taking many former Yuan Wencai's men with them. After Wang Yunlong's death, Wang Zuo's son became the leader and it was not until nearly two decades later in 1949 when the communists were finally able to retake Jinggangshan. After 1949, both Yuan and Wang were marked as examples of ideologically reformed bandits who had been transformed into Communist soldiers. Both were recognised as martyrs of the Chinese Revolution. When Zhu De visited Jinggangshan in 1962 and Mao Zedong in 1965, both called upon Yuan Wencai's elderly widow Xie Meixiang (Ë¨ùÊ¢ÖÈ¶ô). In 1986, his grave was moved to the newly constructed Jinggangshan Martyrs Cemetery. Although Peng Dehuai was not directly involved in the death of Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo, as proved by the history, that did not prevent Mao Zedong from blaming the affair on Peng. Peng Dehuai was persecuted thirty years later for the death of Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai. This was one of the alleged crime Peng committed against Mao, and this alleged crime again appeared during the Cultural Revolution when Peng Dehuai was struggled by the Red Guards.

Allport was one of the first psychologists to focus on the study of the personality, and is often referred to as one of the founding figures of personality psychology. He contributed to the formation of values scales and rejected both a psychoanalytic approach to personality, which he thought often was too deeply interpretive, and a behavioral approach, which he thought did not provide deep enough interpretations from their data. Instead of these popular approaches, he developed an eclectic theory based on traits. He emphasized the uniqueness of each individual, and the importance of the present context, as opposed to past history, for understanding the personality. Allport had a profound and lasting influence on the field of psychology, even though his work is cited much less often than that of other well-known figures. Part of his influence stemmed from his knack for exploring and broadly conceptualizing important and interesting topics (e.g. rumor, prejudice, religion, traits). Another part of his influence resulted from the deep and lasting impression he made on his students during his long teaching career, many of whom went on to have important careers in psychology. Among his many students were Jerome S. Bruner, Anthony Greenwald, Stanley Milgram, Leo Postman, Thomas Pettigrew, and M. Brewster Smith. His brother Floyd Henry Allport, was professor of social psychology and political psychology at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs (in Syracuse, New York) from 1924 until 1956, and visiting professor at University of California, Berkeley. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Allport as the 11th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.  Biography  Allport was born in Montezuma, Indiana, the youngest of four sons of John Edward and Nellie Edith (Wise) Allport. When Gordon was six years old, the family had moved many times and finally settling in Ohio; his early education was in the public schools of Cleveland, Ohio. His father was a country doctor with his clinic and hospital in the family home. Because of inadequate hospital facilities at the time, Allport's father actually turned their home into a makeshift hospital, with patients as well as nurses residing there. Gordon Allport and his brothers grew up surrounded by their father's patients, nurses, and medical equipment, and he and his brothers often assisted their father in the clinic. Allport reported that \\"Tending office, washing bottles, and dealing with patients were important aspects of my early training\\" (p. 172).HJelle, L.A., Ziegler, D.J. (1992). Personality Theories: Basic Assumptions, Research, and Applications. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company. During this time, Allport's father was encapsulated in a blurb in Samuel Hopkins Adams' expos√© in Collier's Magazine on fraudulent medicinal cures, later reprinted as the book The Great American Fraud: Articles on the Nostrum Evil and Quackery. While much of the book focuses on large scale, heavily advertised patent medicines available at the turn of the century, the author states Allport \\"would never have embodied this article were it not for the efforts of certain physicians of Cleveland.\\" Allport was criticized for diagnosing and treating morphine addicts via mail simply on the basis of letters and no in-person appointments. Upon receiving Adams' letter detailing his concocted affliction, Allport replied back via mail, diagnosing Adams as a morphine addict and sending doses of the \\"Dr. J. Edward Allport System,\\" designed to cure morphine addicts. Analysis of the medicine revealed its active ingredient to be nothing more than additional morphine, packed with a bottle of pink whiskey \\"to mix with the morphin[sp] when it gets low.\\" Adams referred to Allport as a \\"[quack] who pretend[s] to be a physician,\\" is \\"no less scoundrelly,\\" and \\"is even more dangerous\\" than other fraudulent addiction cure peddlers mentioned earlier in the book. Allport's mother was a former school teacher, who forcefully promoted her values of intellectual development and religion. One of Allport's biographers states, \\"he grew up not only with the Protestant religion, but also the Protestant work ethic, which dominated his home life.\\" Gordon Allport's father, who was Scottish, shared this outlook, and operated by his own philosophy that \\"If every person worked as hard as he could and took only the minimum financial return required by his families needs, then there would be just enough wealth to go around.\\" Biographers describe Allport as a shy and studious boy who lived a fairly isolated childhood. As a teenager, Allport developed and ran his own printing business while serving as editor of his high school newspaper. In 1915, he graduated second in his class at Glenville High School at the age of eighteen. He earned a scholarship that allowed him to attend Harvard University, where one of his older brothers, Floyd Henry Allport, was working on his Ph.D. in Psychology.V.W. Hevern (1996-2003). Narrative Psychology: Internet and Resource Guide. Moving to Harvard was a difficult transition for Allport because the moral values and climate were so different from those of his home. However he earned his A.B. degree in 1919 in Philosophy and Economics (not psychology). His interest in the convergence of social psychology and personality psychology was evident in his use of his spare time at Harvard in social service: conducting a boy's club in Boston, visiting for the Family Society, serving as a volunteer probation officer, registering homes for war workers, and aiding foreign students.Pettigrew, T.F. (1999). Journal of Social Issues, Fall, 1999 Next he traveled to Robert College in Istanbul, Turkey, where he taught economics and philosophy for a year, before returning to Harvard to pursue his Ph.D. in psychology on fellowship in 1920 (in addition to German, Allport remained partially fluent in modern Greek throughout his life). His first publication, Personality Traits: Their Classification and Measurement in 1921, was co-authored with his older brother, Floyd Henry Allport, who became an important social psychologist. Allport earned his master's degree in 1921, studying under Herbert Langfeld, and then his Ph.D. in 1922, along the way taking a class with Hugo M√ºnsterberg before the latter's death in 1916.Bowman, John S. The Cambridge Dictionary of American Biography. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995) p. 13 Harvard then awarded Allport a coveted Sheldon Traveling Fellowship--\\"a second intellectual dawn,\\" as he later described it. He spent the first Sheldon year studying with the new Gestalt School‚Äîwhich fascinated him‚Äîin Berlin and Hamburg, Germany; and then the second year at Cambridge University. Then Allport returned to Harvard as an instructor in psychology from 1924 to 1926. He began teaching his course \\"Personality: Its Psychological and Social Aspects\\" in 1924; it was probably the first course in personality psychology ever taught in the U.S. During this time, Allport married Ada Lufkin Gould, who was a clinical psychologist, and they had one child, a boy, who later became a pediatrician. After going to teach introductory courses on social psychology and personality at Dartmouth College for four years, Allport returned to Harvard and remained there for the rest of his career. Gordon W. Allport was a longtime and influential member of the faculty at Harvard University from 1930 to 1967. In 1931, he served on the faculty committee that established Harvard's Sociology Department. In the late 1940s, he fashioned an introductory course for the new Social Relations Department into a rigorous and popular undergraduate class. At that time, he was also editor of the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology. Allport was also a Director of the Commission for the United Nations Educational Scientific, and Cultural Organization. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1933. Allport was elected President of the American Psychological Association in 1939. In 1943, he was elected President of the Eastern Psychological Association. In 1944, he served as President of the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues. In 1950, Allport published his third book titled The Individual and His Religion. His fourth book, The Nature of Prejudice, was published in 1954, and benefited from his insights from working with refugees during World War II. His fifth book, published in 1955, was titled Becoming: Basic Considerations for Psychology of Personality. This book became one of his most widely known publications. In 1963, Allport was awarded the Gold Medal Award from the American Psychological Foundation. In the following year, he received the APA's Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award. Gordon Allport died on October 9, 1967, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, of lung cancer. He was one month shy of being seventy years old. Visit with Freud Allport told the story in his autobiographical essay in Pattern and Growth in PersonalityAllport, Gordon: Pattern and Growth in Personality; Harcourt College Pub., of his visit as a young, recent college graduate to the already famous Dr. Sigmund Freud in Vienna. To break the ice upon meeting Freud, Allport recounted how he had met a boy on the train on the way to Vienna who was afraid of getting dirty. He refused to sit down near anyone dirty, despite his mother's reassurances. Allport suggested that perhaps the boy had learned this dirt phobia from his mother, a very neat and apparently rather domineering type. After studying Allport for a minute, Freud asked, \\"And was that little boy you?\\" Allport experienced Freud's attempt to reduce this small bit of observed interaction to some unconscious episode from his own remote childhood as dismissive of his current motivations, intentions, and experience. It served as a reminder that psychoanalysis tends to dig too deeply into both the past and the unconscious, overlooking in the process the reputedly more important conscious and immediate aspects of experience. Allport rejected the Freudian views of the unconscious as well as the reductionist theories that attribute human behavior to innate instincts, childhood conditioning, or repressed complexes. While Allport never denied that unconscious and historical variables have a role to play in human psychology (particularly in the immature and disordered) his own work would always emphasize conscious motivations and current context. Allport's trait theory Allport is known as a \\"trait\\" psychologist. He did not believe that people can be classified according to a small number of trait dimensions, maintaining that each person is unique and distinguished by peculiar traits. One of his early projects was to go through the dictionary and locate every term that he thought could describe a person. From this, he developed a list of 4500 trait like words. He organized these into three levels of traits. This is similar to Goldberg's fundamental lexical hypothesis, or the hypothesis that over time, humans develop widely used, generic terms for individual differences in their daily interactions. Allport's three trait levels are: 1\\\\. Cardinal trait - This is the trait that dominates and shapes a person's behavior. These are the ruling passions/obsessions, such as a need for money, fame etc. 2\\\\. Central trait - This is a general characteristic found in some degree in every person. These are the basic building blocks that shape most of our behavior although they are not as overwhelming as cardinal traits. An example of a central trait would be honesty. 3\\\\. Secondary trait - These are characteristics seen only in certain circumstances (such as particular likes or dislikes that a very close friend may know). They must be included to provide a complete picture of human complexity. Genotypes and phenotypes Allport hypothesized the idea of internal and external forces that influence an individual's behavior. He called these forces Genotypes and Phenotypes. Genotypes are internal forces that relate to how a person retains information and uses it to interact with the external world. Phenotypes are external forces, these relate to the way an individual accepts his surroundings and how others influence their behavior. These forces generate the ways in which we behave and are the groundwork for the creation of individual traits. The Problem with this hypothesis is that it cannot be proven as they are internal theories, influenced presumably by the outer environment. Functional autonomy of motives Allport was one of the first researchers to draw a distinction between Motive and Drive. He suggested that a drive forms as a reaction to a motive, which may outgrow the motive as the reason for a behavior. The drive then becomes autonomous and distinct from the motive, whether the motive was instinct or something else. The idea that drives can become independent of the original motives for a given behavior is known as \\"functional autonomy.\\" Allport gives the example of a man who seeks to perfect his task or craft. His original motive may be a sense of inferiority engrained in his childhood, but his diligence in his work and the motive it acquires later on is a need to excel in his chosen profession, which becomes the man's drive. Allport says that the theory: > ... avoids the absurdity of regarding the energy of life now, in the > present, as somehow consisting of early archaic forms (instincts, prepotent > reflexes, or the never-changing Id). Learning brings new systems of > interests into existence just as it does new abilities and skills. At each > stage of development these interests are always contemporary; whatever > drives, drives now.Allport, G. W. (1937). The American Journal of > Psychology, 50, pp. 141-156.  The Psychologist's Frame of Reference  Allport gave a presidential address at the 47th annual meeting of the American Psychological Association, Berkeley, California, on September 7, 1939 on The Psychologist's Frame of Reference, a piece of literature he and his colleagues collaborated on addressing the changing culture of psychological writing from as early as 1888 to 1938 in America. He began his address by simply asking, \\"First, what it is that competent psychologists in America have been making of our science in the past fifty years?\\" Between thirty of his colleagues, they divided fifty journals according to how significant and devoted they were to the advancement of psychology as a science (Allport, pg.1). More than sixteen hundred articles in total were analyzed. Allport first points to the decline in \\"facultative\\" treatment of mental functions. He explains that from 1888 to 1898, 19% of the psychological writing leaned upon instinctive, \\"synthetic apperceptive unity, and kindred concepts\\" (pg.2). As the pre-existing model for treatment drop off in the years to follow, modern facultative treatment risen and with it, different terminology, but \\"kindred in spirit\\". Allport later points out that studies related to the higher mental processes, such as language behavior that involved learning, reasoning, and concept-formation began declining, but experimental studies, however, were slowly on the rise. Using rats and doing maze learning in animals and studies using men who were rendered speechless steadily increased from 1918 on. Other findings point out that the literature examined that related to applied psychology and social betterment was steadily declining as well. Allport suggests that psychologists were turning to specialized journals not included in his survey and that some welcomed the change while others did not. In conclusion, Allport's address welcomed the change, claiming that psychology should avoid authoritarianism in the field, from becoming a cult that ruled out novel and unexplained phenomenon by \\"one- sided tests of method.\\" Bibliography * Studies in expressive movement (with Vernon, P.

It was the seventh Indiana Jones limited series by Dark Horse, and the sixth about the adult Indiana. The comic was based on a canceled LucasArts video game, a sequel to Fate of Atlantis (which was also the first Dark Horse Indiana Jones comic). Plot The comic is set after World War II, with the Nazis seeking the Philosopher's Stone in an attempt to resurrect dead Nazis. Along with the beautiful Russian major Nadia, Indiana Jones gathers the pieces of the philosopher's stone. Development The reasons for the game's cancellation included the clash between the drawing styles of the characters (art deco) and of the background (realistic), the retiring from the project of Aric Wilmunder, the main programmer, and finally, the problems with distribution in Germany, where censorship laws prohibit the sale of any products with explicit depictions of Nazi symbols. Earlier games could get away easily by simply removing the Nazi flags and references to them, but this could not be done with this game, as they were an important part of the plot and Hitler was featured as a central villain. After this game, LucasArts briefly considered making a game named Spear of Destiny (involving the spear of Longinus). They eventually abandoned the idea of creating a classical adventure game in the Indiana Jones series, instead focusing on Tomb Raider-style 3D action games, thus, ending it with the release of Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, followed by Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb and Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings. Comic book Since the game, Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix was canceled, Dark Horse Comics released a four-part comic book series based upon it. A comic book was also created for the canceled game, Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny.

The music combines elements of jazz/fusion, hardcore, metal, and progressive pop punk. The band is known for its intense live show, described by Cincinnati CityBeat as a \\"live act capable of unleashing a scary, uncontrolled intensity bordering on dangerous,\\" and oft-satirical eccentric lyrics.  History  Look What I Did was formed in 2001 in Nashville, Tennessee by singer Barry Donegan and guitarist Colby Shea. Miles McPherson (drums, currently drumming for Kelly Clarkson) and Chris Bradley (bass) were added before the band's first public live performance in January 2002. In 2003, the band added a second guitar player, Aaron \\"Skeet\\" Childress, formerly of National Green, and relocated to Los Angeles, California. At this time they also released their first recording, an independently recorded, financed, and released LP, My First Time, on their own Clockrock Recordings. Despite its limited pressing, the record received many features from ezines such as theprp.com, loudside.com, Opuszine.com. Miles McPherson was not able to join the band in L.A., and Eli Green, now of HORSE the band filled in for some time. McPherson returned to the group in 2004. In 2005, newly reformed Combat Records and producer, Brian Virtue (Jane's Addiction, TheStart) worked with the band to release Minuteman for the Moment on October 4, 2005. The band then relocated to Nashville, TN, and began heavy national touring with bands such as Ion Dissonance, Animosity, At All Cost, Contra, Dog Fashion Disco, Tub Ring and The Classic Struggle, Drop Dead, Gorgeous, Folly, and The Human Abstract. In October 2006, Jake Omen (drums, ex Year of Desolation) and Ty Coughlin (bass, ex L.A.O.) joined the band, replacing McPherson and Shea. Chris Bradley took over the duties on guitar. In early 2008 the band signed a deal with new label Modernist Movement. The album Atlas Drugged was released on February 9, 2010 via Modernist Movement Recordings. Atlas Drugged was also produced by Brian Virtue. Decibel magazine referred to the band in a review of Atlas Drugged, \\"Look What I Did crush on political philosophers, put Latin words in their song titles and generally get off on being a bunch of wiseasses to spazzed-out Adderall punk.\\". The album title is play on Ayn Rand's 1957 novel 'Atlas Shrugged' In 2013, Look What I Did began revealing songs set to be released on their upcoming rock opera: \\"Zanzibar III: Analog Prison\\". Popular songs included: \\"Brigham Young and David Koresh Rally the Troops on the Moon\\", \\"The Trial\\", \\"Sebastian's Analog Prison\\", \\"David Koresh Has a Message (For You)\\" and \\"Wait, Don't Jump\\". Zanzibar III: Analog Prison was named the Best Metal Album of 2015 by The Nashville Scene. The band released a full new song If I Were You I Wouldn't in January 2016 on their YouTube account, followed by Fireball in June 2016, their first songs released since 'Zanzibar III : Analog Prison'. The band was named after friend's child said the phrase 'Mommy, look what I did', about a drawing to her mother when Barry was talking to her over the phone discussing what the band's name should be. The band announced their fifth album, Sympathy Porn, will be released on 15 November 2019, preceded with the single \\"Hands Off My Snacks\\" on 2 October. In September 2020, the band announced that Evan Brewer has joined the band on bass, replacing Chad Omen, with new music underway in the studio.

Czes≈Çaw PiƒÖtas (born 20 March 1946) is a Polish general, former Chief of General Staff of the Polish Army. He is one of the authors of the plan of modernisation of the Polish armed forces and one of the architects of its integration with the structures of NATO. Biography Czes≈Çaw PiƒÖtas was born in Hausach, Germany. In September 1965 he joined the Polish Army and the Armour Officer's School in Pozna≈Ñ. After he graduated in 1968, he was promoted to the rank of ensign (podporucznik) and assigned to the 8th Tank Regiment of ≈ªaga≈Ñ-based Polish 11th Armoured Division as a tank platoon commander. In 1971 he was promoted to first lieutenant (porucznik) and the following year he assumed command over a company of tanks in the same regiment. For the good effects of his work on the post of a tank commander, in 1974 PiƒÖtas was sent to Moscow, where he joined the Kliment Voroshilov Academy of Tank Troops. One of the best students at his course, in 1975 he was promoted to captain. In 1977 he graduated and was instantly assigned to the staff of the 11th Armoured Division, where he accomplished his probation. In 1978 he became the chief of staff and deputy commanding officer of the 3rd Tank Regiment of the 11th Division. The following year PiƒÖtas was promoted to major. In 1980 he joined the 10th Tank Regiment of the Polish 10th Armoured Division, of which he also was the chief of staff. The unit under his command won many military awards, including the title of a leading unit of the Silesian Military District, which won PiƒÖtas a promotion to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1982. The following year he became the chief of staff and deputy commanding officer of the Opole-based 10th Armoured Division. He served on that post until 1986, when he was promoted to colonel and yet again sent to Moscow for training. There he joined the General Staff Academy of the USSR. He graduated in 1982 and was assigned to the Headquarters of the Silesian Military Area, and in 1986 was given the command of Polish 4th Mechanised Division. Upon his return in 1988, PiƒÖtas settled in Wroc≈Çaw, where he became the Chief of Operations and the deputy commander of the Silesian Military District. In 1991 he left that post and became the commander of the Polish 4th Armoured Division dislocated in Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie. Yet again he distinguished himself as a brilliant organizer and in 1992 his division received the title of The Leading Unit of the Polish Army - the highest peacetime award a tactical unit can achieve. The same year he was promoted by president Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa to the rank of brigadier general (genera≈Ç brygady) and in 1993 he returned to the headquarters of the Silesian Military District, where he resumed his previous post of Chief of Operations and deputy commander. In 1996 he was moved to Warsaw, where he assumed the post of chief of staff of the Warsaw Military District. However, only in January 1997 he left that post and was assigned to the General Staff of the Polish Army as the Chief of Operational and Strategic Command. As such he was one of the Polish officers who took part in the Polish-NATO accession talks in 1997-1998. After that he travelled to United States. There he settled in Washington, D.C. and joined the National War College. He graduated in 1999 and returned to Warsaw, where he became the deputy Chief of General Staff of the Polish Army. On 15 August 1999 he was promoted by president Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski to major general (genera≈Ç dywizji). On 28 September 2000 PiƒÖtas became the Chief of General Staff and was promoted to lieutenant general (genera≈Ç broni). On 15 August 2002 PiƒÖtas was promoted to the newly created rank of general (genera≈Ç). On 25 September 2003 he was reappointed to another three-year term as Chief of General Staff. However, he has retired from the active service already in January 2006. In January 2008 he became Deputy Minister of Defense in Donald Tusk's government.

For the Triumph 2000 Saloon of 1949, see Triumph Renown. The Triumph 2000 is a mid- sized, rear wheel drive automobile which was produced in Coventry by the Triumph Motor Company between 1963 and 1977. It was introduced on 15 October 1963.New Triumph marks the End of an Era. The Times, Tuesday, 15 October 1963; pg. 16; Issue 55832 Larger-engined models, known as the Triumph 2.5 PI and Triumph 2500 were also produced from 1968.  Engine  The 2000 used the six- cylinder engine first seen in the Standard Vanguard at the end of 1960. However, the last of the six cylinder Vanguards had applied a compression ratio of 8.0:1 which the increasing availability of higher octane fuels enabled the manufacturers to increase to 8.5:1 for the Triumph. This and the fitting of twin Stromberg 150 CD carburettors made for a claimed power output increased to from the Vanguard's .  Running gear  Standard transmission on the original car was a 4-speed manual gearbox: overdrive and Borg-Warner Type 35 3-speed automatic transmission were options. The unitary body had independent suspension all-round with semi-trailing arms at the rear, all using coil springs. The servo-assisted brakes were disc at the front and drums at the rear. Market place Triumph's 2000 competed with the contemporary Rover P6 2000, which initially was offered only with a four-cylinder engine. The Rover was also released in October 1963, just one week before the Triumph. Together the cars defined a new market sector in the UK, promising levels of comfort and luxury hitherto associated with larger Rover and Jaguar models, but with usefully lower running costs and purchase prices, all in a modern package. Triumph 2000 Mk 1 & 2.5 PI Mk 1  Although the Mk 1 was presented to the public at the London Motor Show in October 1963, volume sales began only in January 1964. Continuing in production until 1969, this version came in saloon and, from 1965, estate forms. The estate, its body shell partly built by Carbodies, was in the Mk 1 version the same length as the saloon. Various minor improvements were made during the period of which the most noteworthy, probably, was a significant upgrade in October 1966 to the \\"previously rather ineffective\\" ventilation, with eyeball vents added in the centre of the facia and the heater controls repositioned beneath them. In October 1968 the 2.5 PI (petrol injection) Mk 1 was launched, fitted with a Lucas Automotive mechanical fuel injection system. Performance was very good, but the PI models (along with the TR6 models) gained a reputation for unreliability and poor fuel economy. In Australia, these models suffered badly because of the summer heat. The electric fuel pump commonly overheated causing fuel to vaporise and render the engine inoperable until the pump cooled down. The overheating of the pump was caused by a combination of very high pressure fuel loads (over ) and a pump that was adapted from what was originally a windscreen wiper motor. As such, it did not cope well with sustained pressures in moderate to high ambient temperatures. Because of the launch late in the Mk I's life, there are relatively few PIs in the original shape. File:Triumph Estate (2368440169).jpg|Triumph 2000 (Mk 1) Estate File:Triumph 2.5 PI.jpg|Triumph 2.5 PI Mk 1 Saloon  Triumph 2000 Mk 2, 2.5 PI Mk 2, 2500TC and 2500S  In October 1969, the Mk 2 range was launched, again styled by Michelotti, updating the car for the 1970s. The front of the car now followed the lines of the then-upcoming Triumph Stag grand tourer. There were entry- level 2000 models, which were the most plentiful, but the remainder of the range consisted of 2500, 2500 TC and 2500 PI models. Apart from the PI (petrol injection) models, all Triumph 2000 and 2500s had twin Stromberg or SU carburettors, the \\"TC\\" suffix on some models can seem misleading in this respect as it stood for a higher equipment level. In June 1975 the 2500S model, with 14 inch (356 mm) wheels and anti-roll bar, was added: it replaced the 2.5PI which had quietly disappeared from the show rooms two months earlier. This marked the end of fuel injected engines for the car, but improved acceleration was claimed for the twin carburettor 2500S and its slightly less expensive 2500TC sibling. These new versions featured an extensive list of other, mostly minor, improvements, of which the most significant were probably those affecting the ride and handling: these resulted from suspension changes including an anti-roll bar. The Estate in the Mk 2 version was 5 inches (125 mm) shorter than the Mk 2 Saloon, because the rear bodywork of the car was carried over unchanged from the Mk 1 version. The Mk 2, the last big Triumph car, ceased production in 1977, supplanted by British Leyland's corporate executive car, the Rover SD1. Six-cylinder 2300 and 2600 versions of the new Rover would nonetheless be powered by engines designed by Triumph, originally intended to replace the older 2000 / 2500 units. The last production car, a 2500S estate (BOL87V) is kept at the Heritage Motor Centre.

Sir Rob Muldoon, New Zealand's then Prime Minister, privately owned a white 2500S and had been known to drive to work in it. This car is now owned by a member of the Auckland Triumph Car Club. The 2000 was assembled in Australia by Australian Motor Industries. A special version was known as the 2000MD (\\"Managing Director\\"), which had special features such as knock-off wire wheels, triple Stromberg carburettors, and the battery moved to the boot. Total production of the 2000MD was approximately 100. Today Many of these cars are still on the road, supported by owners clubs and specialist parts. The 2000 and derivatives are also popular with modifiers owing to common parts and engines shared with other Triumph models such as the TR6, GT6, and Vitesse.

The social model of disability diverges from the dominant medical model of disability, which is a functional analysis of the body as a machine to be fixed in order to conform with normative values. While physical, sensory, intellectual, or psychological variations may cause individual functional limitation or impairments, these do not necessarily have to lead to disability unless society fails to take account of and include people regardless of their individual differences. The social model of disability is based on a distinction between the terms impairment and disability. In this model, the word impairment is used to refer to the actual attributes (or lack of attributes) that affect a person, such as the inability to walk or breathe independently. The word disability is used to refer to the restrictions caused by society when it does not give equivalent attention and accommodation to the needs of individuals with impairments. As a simple example, if a person is unable to climb stairs, the medical model focuses on making the individual physically able to climb stairs. The social model tries to make stair-climbing unnecessary, such as by replacing the stairs with a wheelchair-accessible ramp. According to the social model, the person remains impaired with respect to climbing stairs, but the impairment should no longer be considered disabling in that scenario, because the person can get to the same locations without climbing any stairs. The origins of the approach can be traced to the 1960s, and the specific term emerged from the United Kingdom in the 1980s. According to Mike Oliver, the social model of disability was never meant to be an all-encompassing explanation of everything that a disabled person experiences. History  UPIAS  The history of the social model of disability begins with the history of the disability rights movement. In 1975, the UK organization Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS, 1972-1990) claimed: \\"In our view it is society which disables physically impaired people. Disability is something imposed on top of our impairments by the way we are unnecessarily isolated and excluded from full participation in society.\\" This became known as the social interpretation, or social definition, of disability.  Alf Morris  However, there is a hint from before the 1970s that the interaction between impairment and society was beginning to be considered. Alf Morris wrote that in 1969: * \\"When the title of my Bill was announced, I was frequently asked what kind of improvements for the chronically sick and disabled I had in mind. It always seemed best to begin with the problems of access. I explained that I wanted to remove the severe and gratuitous social handicaps inflicted on disabled people, and often on their families and friends, not just by their exclusion from town and county halls, art galleries, libraries and many of the universities, but even from pubs, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and other places of entertainment ... I explained that I and my friends were concerned to stop society from treating disabled people as if they were a separate species.\\" (emphasis added)  Mike Oliver  Following the UPIAS \\"social definition of disability\\", in 1983 the disabled academic Mike Oliver coined the phrase social model of disability in reference to these ideological developments. Oliver focused on the idea of an individual model (of which the medical was a part) versus a social model, derived from the distinction originally made between impairment and disability by the UPIAS. Oliver's seminal 1990 book is widely cited as a major moment in the adoption of this model. The book included just three pages about the social model of disability.  Developments  The \\"social model\\" was extended and developed by academics and activists in Australia, the UK, the US and other countries, and extended to include all disabled people, including those who have learning difficulties / learning disabilities / or who are intellectually disabled, or people with emotional, mental health or behavioural problems.  Tool for cultural analysis  The \\"social model\\" has become a key tool in the analysis of the cultural representation of disability; from literature, to radio, to charity-imagery to cinema. The \\"social model\\" has become the key conceptual analysis in challenging, for examples, stereotypes and archetypes of disabled people by revealing how conventional imagery' reinforces the oppression of disabled people. Key theorists include Paul Darke (cinema), Lois Keith (literature), Leonard Davis (deaf culture), Jenny Sealey (theatre) and Mary-Pat O'Malley (radio). Components and usage A fundamental aspect of the social model concerns equality. The struggle for equality is often compared to the struggles of other socially marginalized groups. Equal rights are said to empower people with the \\"ability\\" to make decisions and the opportunity to live life to the fullest. A related phrase often used by disability rights campaigners, as with other social activism, is \\"Nothing About Us Without Us.\\" The social model of disability focuses on changes required in society. These might be in terms of: *Attitudes, for example a more positive attitude toward certain mental traits or behaviors, or not underestimating the potential quality of life of those with impairments, *Social support, for example help dealing with barriers; resources, aids or positive discrimination to overcome them, for example providing a buddy to explain work culture for an autistic employee, *Information, for example using suitable formats (e.g. braille) or levels (e.g. simplicity of language) or coverage (e.g. explaining issues others may take for granted), *Physical structures, for example buildings with sloped access and elevators, or *Flexible work hours for people with circadian rhythm sleep disorders or, for example, for people who experience anxiety/panic attacks in rush hour traffic.  Limitations  Oliver did not intend the social model of disability to be an all-encompassing theory of disability, but rather a starting point in reframing how society views disability. This model was conceived of as a tool that could be used to improve the lives of disabled people, rather than a complete explanation for every experience and circumstance. It has been criticized for underplaying the role of impairments. It has also been criticized for not promoting the normal differences between disabled people, who can have any age, gender, race, and sexual orientation, and instead presenting them as a monolithic, insufficiently individuated block of people.  As an identity  In the late 20th century and early 21st century, the social model of disability became a dominant identity for disabled people in the UK. The social model of disability implies that attempts to change, \\"fix\\" or \\"cure\\" individuals, especially when used against the wishes of the patient, can be discriminatory and prejudiced. This attitude, which may be seen as stemming from a medical model and a subjective value system, can harm the self-esteem and social inclusion of those constantly subjected to it (e.g. being told they are not as good or valuable, in an overall and core sense, as others). Some communities have actively resisted \\"treatments\\", while, for example, defending a unique culture or set of abilities. In the deaf community, sign language is valued even if most people do not know it and some parents argue against cochlear implants for deaf infants who cannot consent to them. People diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum may argue against efforts to change them to be more like others. They argue instead for acceptance of neurodiversity and accommodation to different needs and goals. Some people diagnosed with a mental disorder argue that they are just different and don't necessarily conform. The biopsychosocial model of disease/disability is a holistic attempt by practitioners to address this. The social model implies that practices such as eugenics are founded on social values and a prejudiced understanding of the potential and value of those labeled disabled. \\"Over 200,000 disabled people were the first victims of the Holocaust.\\" A 1986 article stated: \\"It is important that we do not allow ourselves to be dismissed as if we all come under this one great metaphysical category 'the disabled'. The effect of this is a depersonalization, a sweeping dismissal of our individuality, and a denial of our right to be seen as people with our own uniqueness, rather than as the anonymous constituents of a category or group. These words that lump us all together ‚Äì 'the disabled', 'spina bifida', 'tetraplegic', 'muscular dystrophy‚Äô, ‚Äì are nothing more than terminological rubbish bins into which all the important things about us as people get thrown away.\\"  Economic aspects  The social model also relates to economics. It proposes that people can be disabled by a lack of resources to meet their needs. For example, a person with impairments may need some kinds of support services to be able to participate fully in society, and can become disabled if society cuts the funding for those support services, perhaps in the name of government austerity measures. It addresses issues such as the under-estimation of the potential of people to contribute to society and add economic value to society, if given equal rights and equally suitable facilities and opportunities as others. Economic research on companies that attempt to accommodate disability in their workforce suggest they outperform competitors. In Autumn 2001, the UK Office for National Statistics identified that approximately one fifth of the working-age population was disabled ‚Äì 7.1 million disabled people as opposed to 29.8 million able people ‚Äì and in this analysis also provided insight into some of the reasons why disabled people were unwilling to enter the labour market, such as that the reduction in disability benefits in entering the labour market would not make it worthwhile to enter into employment. A three-pronged approach was suggested: \\"incentives to work via the tax and benefit system, for example through the Disabled Person‚Äôs Tax Credit; helping people back into work, for example via the New Deal for Disabled People; and tackling discrimination in the workplace via anti-discrimination policy. Underpinning this are the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995 and the Disability Rights Commission.\\" Law and public policy In the United Kingdom, the Disability Discrimination Act defines disability using the medical model - disabled people are defined as people with certain conditions, or certain limitations on their ability to carry out \\"normal day-to-day activities.\\" But the requirement of employers and service providers to make \\"reasonable adjustments\\" to their policies or practices, or physical aspects of their premises, follows the social model. By making adjustments, employers and service providers are removing the barriers that disable - according to the social model, they are effectively removing the person's disability. In 2006, amendments to the act called for local authorities and others to actively promote disability equality. This enforcement came in the shape of the Disability Equality Duty in December 2006. In 2010, The Disability Discrimination Act (1995) was amalgamated into the Equality Act 2010 along with other pertinent discrimination legislation. It extends the law on discrimination to indirect discrimination. For example, if a carer of a person with a disability is discriminated against, this is now also unlawful. Since October 2010, when it came into effect, employers may not legally ask questions about illness or disability at interview for a job or for a referee to comment on such in a reference, except where there is a need to make reasonable adjustments for an interview to proceed. Following an offer of a job, an employer can lawfully ask such questions. In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), revision of 2008 effective in January 2009, is a wide-ranging civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability. It affords similar protections against discrimination to Americans with disabilities as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national origin, and other characteristics illegal. Certain specific conditions are excluded, such as alcoholism and transsexualism. In 2007, the European Court of Justice in the Chacon Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA court case, defined disability narrowly according to a medical definition that excluded temporary illness, when considering the Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (Council Directive 2000/78/EC). The directive did not provide for any definition of disability, despite discourse in policy documents previously in the EU about endorsing the social model of disability. This allowed the Court of Justice to take a narrow medical definition.

Hugues de Lionne (11 October 1611 ‚Äì 1 September 1671) was a French statesman. He was born in Grenoble, of an old family of Dauphin√©. Early trained for diplomacy, he fell into disgrace under Cardinal Richelieu, but his remarkable abilities attracted the notice of Cardinal Mazarin, who sent him as secretary of the French embassy to the congress of Munster, and, in 1642, on a mission to the pope. In 1646 he became secretary to the queen regent Anne of Austria; in 1653 obtained high office in the kings household; and in 1654 was ambassador extraordinary at the election of Pope Alexander VII. On the death of Ferdinand III, Hugues co-led the French effort to select an Emperor outside the Habsburg family. He and the Cardinal cultivated relationships with German nobility, including Franz Egon of F√ºrstenberg, prime minister of Cologne, and his brother William. With their help, Hugues was instrumental in forming the league of the Rhine, by which Austria was cut off from the Spanish Netherlands, and, as minister of state, was associated with Mazarin in the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), which secured the marriage of Louis XIV to the infanta Maria Theresa of Spain. At the cardinals dying request he was appointed his successor in foreign affairs, a position he held from 3 April 1663 to 1 September 1671. Among his most important diplomatic successes were the Treaty of Breda (1667), the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668) and the Sale of Dunkirk. He died in Paris in 1671, leaving memoirs. His friend Arnauld de Pomponne replaced him as secretary of State. He was a man of pleasure, but his natural indolence gave place to an unflagging energy when the occasion demanded it; and, in an age of great ministers, his consummate statesmanship placed him in the front rank. One of his sons, Artus de Lionne, became a missionary of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, and was active in Siam (modern Thailand) and China.

Lyngby Hovedgade is a busy shopping street and the site of a branch of Magasin du Nord as well as Lyngby Storcenter. The district is also home to several major companies, including COWI A/S, Bang & Olufsen, ICEpower a/s and Microsoft. Lyngby station is located on the Hiller√∏d radial of Copenhagen's S-train network. Kongens Lyngby borders: Brede; the municipality of Gentofte (the most affluent in Denmark); Sorgenfri, where the Danish Prime Minister's official residence, Marienborg, lies; and the Gladsaxe municipality. History Kongens Lyngby in c. 1820 with the White Mansion visible on the left The name Kongens Lyngby is first recorded in 1348. At that time large parts of North Zealand belonged to the Catholic Church (represented by Roskilde Cathedral and the name Lyngby was associated with several places. Store Lyngby belonged to Arres√∏ church. \\"Our\\" Lyngby, on the other hand, was crown land. It may therefore have been to distinguish it from these other places that the name emerged. The original Lyngby village is now known as Bondebyen. Kongens Lyngby was also the site of a watermill, Lyngby Watermill, which is first mentioned in 1492 but is probably several hundred years older. A royal road, Lyngby Kongevej, was created in 1584 to provide an easy link between Copenhagen and Frederick's new Frederiksborg Castle from where it was later extended to Fredensborg and Helsing√∏r. It was the first of a number of royal roads created by Frederick II and his successor Christian IV. Scene from Kongens Lyngby, 1810, painting by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg In the 18th century, a growing number of country houses were built in the area by civil servants and merchants from Copenhagen. Kongens Lyngby had no market rights but developed into a local service centre with an increasing number of craftsmen and merchants. Lyngby Main Street in c. 1900 The North Line came to Lyngby in 1863 and was extended to Helsing√∏r in 1864,This enabled citizens from Copenhagen to settle permanently in the area. Several factories opened in the area, including Christian Hasselbalck's curtain factory in 1892 which later became the town's largest employer. In the 1930s, Kongens Lyngby developed into a modern suburb. The North Line was converted into an S-train line with more stations and Kongens Lyngby gradually merged with the neighboring settlements. Shopping Kongens Lyngby is the important shopping destination in the northern suburbs. Lyngby Hovedgade is a busy shopping site and is the site of a Magasin du Nord as well as Lyngby Storcenter.

The island is 10 kilometers wide, and was created by the activity of the Manam Volcano, one of the country‚Äôs most active. It was evacuated in 2004 and its residents resettled elsewhere in Papua New Guinea, but many have begun to return despite concerns of future volcanic activity. Geology Large ash plume From Manam Volcano, November 2004 Manam is a basaltic-andesitic stratovolcano, and despite remarkably symmetrical lower flanks has four distinct valleys, locally known as \\"avalanche valleys\\" due to their ability to focus avalanches and particularly pyroclastic flows generated at the summit. These valleys represent the highest-risk areas during eruptions, and, when the island was inhabited, were typically the first areas to be evacuated during heightened activity. The earliest documented eruption of Manam was in 1616. History The first recorded sighting by Europeans of Manam Island was by the Spanish navigator I√±igo √ìrtiz de Retes on 5 August 1545 when on board of the carrack San Juan tried to return from Tidore to New Spain.Coello, Francisco \\"Conflicto hispano-alem√°n\\" Bolet√≠n de Sociedad Geogr√°fica de Madrid, t.XIX. 2¬∫ semestre 1885, Madrid, p.317. Eruptions and hazards Sulfur dioxide cloud released by the January 27, 2005 eruption of Manam, as measured by the OMI aboard NASA's Aura satellite. Thirteen local residents were killed during an eruption on 3 December 1996, when pyroclastic flows reached the village of Budua. In November 2004, a major eruption forced the emergency evacuation of over 9,000 inhabitants of the island. The eruption began October 24 but was not seen as a major threat until the wind changed pushing ash and debris towards inhabited areas. Five people died during the eruption. On December 11, the threat was downgraded due to a reduction in activity. There have been significant problems at Bogia on the mainland where the evacuees resettled in camps at Mangem, Asarumba and Potsdam. In March 2007 the government of Papua New Guinea made a large area of land available for permanent resettlement of displaced islanders at Andarum near Bogia. Also in March 2007, three people were killed by mudslides on the northern part of the island. As of 2014, at least 2000-3000 people have returned to the island despite continued government concerns for their safety. Map of Manama and adjacent coast Residents Manam Islanders have their own language called Manam Pile (literally \\"Manam talk\\"), which is spoken on Manam and the nearby Boisa Islands. Manam islanders have a reputation in Papua New Guinea for musicianship and have produced several locally renowned musicians.

The standardization process began in 1977. While the seven-layer OSI model is often used as a reference for teaching and documentation, the protocols originally conceived for the model did not gain popularity, and only X.400, X.500, and IS-IS have achieved lasting impact. The goal of an open-standard protocol suite instead has been met by the Internet protocol suite, maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Overview The OSI protocol stack is structured into seven conceptual layers. The layers form a hierarchy of functionality starting with the physical hardware components to the user interfaces at the software application level. Each layer receives information from the layer above, processes it and passes it down to the next layer. Each layer adds encapsulation information (header) to the incoming information before it is passed to the lower layer. Headers generally include address of source and destination, error control information, protocol identification and protocol parameters such as flow control options and sequence numbers. Layer 1: physical layer This layer deals with the physical plugs and sockets and electrical specification of signals only. This is the medium over which the digital signals are transmitted. It can be twisted pair, coaxial cable, optical fiber, wireless, or other transmission media. Layer 2: data link layer The data link layer packages raw bits from the physical layer into frames (logical, structured packets for data). It is specified in ITU-T Rec. X.212 [ISO/IEC 8886], ITU-T Rec. X.222 and others. This layer is responsible for transferring frames from one host to another. It might perform error checking. This layer further consists of two sublayers : MAC and LLC. Layer 3: network layer * Connectionless Network Service (CLNS) ‚Äì ITU-T Rec. X.213 [ISO/IEC 8348]. SCCP is based on X.213. * Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP) ‚Äì ITU-T Rec. X.233 [ISO/IEC 8473-1]. * Connection-Oriented Network Service (CONS) ‚Äì ITU-T Rec. X.213 [ISO/IEC 8348]. * Connection-Oriented Network Protocol (X.25) ‚Äì ITU-T Rec. X.233 [ISO/IEC 8878]. This is the use of the X.25 protocol to provide the CONS. * Network Fast Byte Protocol ‚Äì ISO/IEC 14700 * End System to Intermediate System Routing Exchange Protocol (ES-IS) - ISO/IEC 9452 (reprinted in RFC 995). * Intermediate System to Intermediate System Intra-domain Routing Protocol (IS-IS) - ISO/IEC 10589 (reprinted in RFC 1142), later adapted for the TCP/IP model. * End System Routing Information Exchange Protocol for use with ISO/IEC 8878 (SNARE) ‚Äì ITU-T Rec. X.116 [ISO/IEC 10030]. This level is in charge of transferring data between systems in a network, using network-layer addresses of machines to keep track of destinations and sources. This layer uses routers and switches to manage its traffic (control flow control, error check, routing etc.) So here it takes all routing decisions, it deals with end to end data transmission. Layer 4: transport layer The connection-mode and connectionless-mode transport services are specified by ITU-T Rec. X.214 [ISO/IEC 8072]; the protocol that provides the connection-mode service is specified by ITU-T Rec. X.224 [ISO/IEC 8073], and the protocol that provides the connectionless-mode service is specified by ITU-T Rec. X.234 [ISO/IEC 8602]. * Transport Protocol Class 0 (TP0) * Transport Protocol Class 1 (TP1) * Transport Protocol Class 2 (TP2) * Transport Protocol Class 3 (TP3) * Transport Protocol Class 4 (TP4) * Transport Fast Byte Protocol ‚Äì ISO 14699 The transport layer transfers data between source and destination processes. Generally, two connection modes are recognized, connection-oriented or connectionless. Connection-oriented service establishes a dedicated virtual circuit and offers various grades of guaranteed delivery, ensuring that data received is identical to data transmitted. Connectionless mode provides only best-effort service without the built-in ability to correct errors, which includes complete loss of data without notifying the data source of the failure. No logical connection, and no persistent state of the transaction exists between the endpoints, lending the connectionless mode low overhead and potentially better real-time performance for timing-critical applications such as voice and video transmissions. Layer 5: session layer * Session service ‚Äì ITU-T Rec. X.215 [ISO/IEC 8326] * Connection-oriented Session protocol ‚Äì ITU-T Rec. X.225 [ISO/IEC 8327-1] * Connectionless Session protocol ‚Äì ITU-T Rec. X.235 [ISO/IEC 9548-1] The session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application. It provides for full-duplex, and half-duplex or simplex operation, and establishes checkpointing, adjournment, termination, and restart procedures. The OSI model made this layer responsible for graceful close of sessions, which is a property of the Transmission Control Protocol, and also for session checkpointing and recovery, which is not usually used in the Internet Protocol Suite. The session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use remote procedure calls. Layer 6: presentation layer * Presentation service ‚Äì ITU-T Rec. X.216 [ISO/IEC 8822] * Connection-oriented Presentation protocol ‚Äì ITU-T Rec. X.226 [ISO/IEC 8823-1] * Connectionless Presentation protocol ‚Äì ITU-T Rec. X.236 [ISO/IEC 9576-1] This layer defines and encrypts/decrypts data types from the application layer. Protocols such as MIDI, MPEG, and GIF are presentation layer formats shared by different applications.

She was transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS Brighton, and later to the Soviet Navy as Zharkiy. As USS Cowell Named for John G. Cowell, she was launched on 23 November 1918 by Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Miss E. P. Garney; and commissioned on 17 March 1919, Lieutenant Commander C. E. Van Hook in command. Cowell cleared Boston, Massachusetts, 3 May 1919, to take station at Trepassey Bay, Newfoundland, first stopping point for the Navy seaplanes which that month began the historic first aerial crossing of the Atlantic. After patrolling her station, she returned to Boston 22 May to prepare for European service, and on 30 June sailed from New York to join the American naval force in the Adriatic. Here she served as dispatch ship for the Allied Peace Commission, and as station ship at Croatian (then in Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes ports of Rijeka, Split, and Trogir, in turn until 23 October, when she cleared for home. In reserve at Boston and Charleston from 1 December 1919, Cowell put to sea for a training period out of Newport, Rhode Island, with a reserve organization from April through October 1921, returning to Charleston. On 27 June 1922, she was decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she lay until recommissioned 17 June 1940 for patrol duty in the Atlantic. She cruised along the United States East Coast on this duty until 18 September 1940 when she arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, there to be decommissioned 23 September 1940 and transferred to the Royal Navy the same day in the land bases for destroyers exchange. As HMS Brighton Commissioned as HMS Brighton, the destroyer served with minelayers in the Denmark Strait and off the Faroe Islands. On 27 February 1941, she rescued from the sea 19 survivors of torpedoed SS Baltisan. Brighton was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4\\"/50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of Hedgehog.Lenton&Colledge; (1968) p.91 After refit, she served during 1943 and 1944 as target ship for naval aircraft training in the Western Approaches and at Rosyth, Scotland.

In addition to dramatically improved performance compared to older protocols, ZMODEM offered restartable transfers, auto-start by the sender, an expanded 32-bit CRC, and control character quoting supporting 8-bit clean transfers, allowing it to be used on networks that would not pass control characters. In contrast to most transfer protocols developed for bulletin board systems (BBSs), ZMODEM was not directly based on, nor compatible with, the seminal XMODEM. Many variants of XMODEM had been developed in order to address one or more of its shortcomings, and most remained backward compatible and would successfully complete transfers with \\"classic\\" XMODEM implementations. This list includes Forsberg's own YMODEM. ZMODEM eschewed backward compatibility in favor of producing a radically improved protocol. It performed as well or better than any of the high-performance varieties of XMODEM, did so over links that previously didn't work at all, like X.25, or had poor performance, like Telebit modems, and included useful features found in few or no other protocols. ZMODEM became extremely popular on bulletin board systems (BBS) in the early 1990s, becoming a standard as widespread as XMODEM had been before it. Improvements Streaming Generally, file transfer protocols break down a file into a series of packets, and then send them one-at-a-time to the receiver. The main portion of the packet, the payload, is a certain number of bytes from the file being sent. After the payload comes a checksum or cyclic redundancy check (CRC) that can be used to determine if the payload was received correctly. If the packet is received correctly, the receiver sends an \`ACK\` message and the sender then starts sending the next packet. The telephone system introduces a small delay known as latency that interferes with this process. Even if the receiver sends the \`ACK\` immediately, the delay in the phone lines means there will always be some time before the sender receives it and sends the next packet. As modem speeds increase, this delay represents a larger and larger number of packets that could have been sent during the delay, decreasing the channel efficiency. XMODEM used 128-bytes payloads with a three-byte header and one-byte checksum for a total of 132 bytes per packet. In the era of 300 bps modems, a packet took about four seconds to send, and typical latencies were on the order of of a second, so the performance overhead was not significant. As speeds increase the problem becomes more problematic; at 2400 bps a packet takes about to send, so about of the available bandwidth is wasted waiting for \`ACK\`s. At 9600 bps a packet requires only 0.13 seconds to send, so about of the bandwidth is wasted. One solution to this problem is the use of a sliding window. These protocols address latency by allowing the sender to continue sending a number of packets without waiting for an \`ACK\`. The number of packets that it allows to continue is the \\"window\\", which was typically between two and sixteen packets in most implementations. A number of new versions of XMODEM with sliding window support appeared in the early 1980s. Sliding windows are useful for latencies on the order of several packet lengths, which is the case for XMODEM on conventional phone lines. However, it is not enough to address longer latencies found on overseas phone calls or X.25 services such as PC Pursuit, where the latencies are on the order of a second or longer. In other cases, where the reverse channel was much slower than the sending one, as was the case for Telebit or US Robotics modems, even the small number of \`ACK\`s might overwhelm the return channel and cause the transfer to pause. ZMODEM addressed these problems by removing the need for \`ACK\`s at all, allowing the sender to send data continually as long as the receiver detected no errors. Only \`NAK\`s had to be sent, if and only if there was a problem. Since ZMODEM was often used on links with built-in error correction, like X.25, the receiver would often not send a single message back to the sender. As a result, the system would send the entire file in a continual stream, and ZMODEM referred to itself as a \\"streaming protocol\\". ZMODEM's performance was so improved over previous common protocols that it generally replaced even special protocols such as YMODEM-g, which included no error correction at all and instead relied on error-free links maintained by the modems. Although YMODEM-g was faster, the lack of other features such as restartable transfers made it less appealing. Restart XMODEM, and most protocols based on it, managed packet order by prefixing the data with a packet number from 1 to 255. Windowed versions used this packet number to indicate which packets had been received property, or specify one that had not. Since the packets were 128 bytes long, this meant the maximum amount of data that could be transferred before the packet numbers rolled over was 32 kB. ZMODEM replaced the packet number with the actual location in the file, indicated by a 32-bit number. This allowed it to send \`NAK\` messages that re- wound the transfer to the point of failure, regardless of how long the file might be. This same feature was also used to re-start transfers if they failed or were deliberately interrupted. In this case, the receiver would look to see how much data had been previously received and then send a \`NAK\` with that location, automatically triggering the sender to start from that point. Auto-start Auto-starting simplified management by allowing the sending machine to start the transfer. Previously the user had to first request the file from the sender, placing it into a \\"waiting\\" state, then return to their local program and invoke a command to start the transfer. With auto-transfer, they simply requested the file, the sender would then automatically trigger the transfer in the user's program. Variations A number of modified versions of ZMODEM appeared. ZedZap was a variant of ZMODEM with 8 kbyte blocks for better performance on high-speed modems. LeechZmodem was a mischievous ZMODEM variant (among similar XMODEM and YMODEM derivatives) that cheated BBS download quotas. A backwards compatible extension of ZMODEM with 32 kbyte and 64 kbyte block lengths was created by ADONTEC in 2002 and 2007 to increase performance on high-speed error free connections like ISDN or TCP/IP networks. The most notable ZMODEM implementations were from Chuck Forsberg's Omen Technology, Inc. These included DSZ (DOS Send ZMODEM), GSZ (Graphical Send ZMODEM), and the ubiquitous (l)rzsz for Unix variants. In more current times, the developers of Synchronet have created a modern X/Y/ZMODEM implementation named SEXYZ, loosely based on the zmtx/zmrx package, which runs natively on Windows and Unix variants, supports long filenames and faster, more reliable data transfers. The ZMODEM implementation from SEXYZ has also been incorporated into the SyncTERM project. Synchronet, SEXYZ, and SyncTERM are all open-source, cross-platform, BBS-centric projects. Forsberg himself collected a number of improvements into ZMODEM-90. The first of these is MobyTurbo, which removed control quoting to further improve performance, about 15%. Even on networks that \\"eat\\" control characters, ZMODEM-90 can be tailored to quote only those characters the network actually eats, as opposed to every possible one. A similar improvement allows ZMODEM-90 to work on 7-bit networks, whereas earlier protocols (with the notable exception of Kermit) had all demanded 8-bits to one degree or another. Finally, ZMODEM-90 includes a basic run-length encoding compression system to further improve performance on uncompressed files. Limitations * Some of the ZMODEM packets (e.g. ZACK, ZRPOS) embed a byte-offset within the transferred file as a 32-bit unsigned integer. This design limits the feasibility of ZMODEM to only reliably transfer files that are under 4GB in size. * Even though the protocol could permit it, the reference (l)rzsz implementation cannot encode arbitrary non- control characters (e.g. '~') which are often used by TCP/IP connection programs like telnet and ssh as client-side \\"terminal escape\\" characters. Users must disable the terminal escape feature to achieve reliable transfers over these kinds of links, e.g. ssh -e none user@hostname.

It allowed users to transmit files between their computers when both sides used MODEM. Keith Petersen made a minor update to always turn on \\"quiet mode\\", and called the result XMODEM.Ward Christensen, \\"Memories\\", 25 November 1992 XMODEM, like most file transfer protocols, breaks up the original data into a series of \\"packets\\" that are sent to the receiver, along with additional information allowing the receiver to determine whether that packet was correctly received. If an error is detected, the receiver requests that the packet be re-sent. A string of bad packets causes the transfer to abort. XMODEM became extremely popular in the early bulletin board system (BBS) market, largely because it was simple to implement. It was also fairly inefficient, and as modem speeds increased, this problem led to the development of a number of modified versions of XMODEM to improve performance or address other problems with the protocol. Christensen believed his original XMODEM to be \\"the single most modified program in computing history\\". Chuck Forsberg collected a number of common modifications into his YMODEM protocol, but poor implementation led to a further fracturing before they were re-unified by his later ZMODEM protocol. ZMODEM became very popular, but never completely replaced XMODEM in the BBS market. Packet structure The original XMODEM used a 128-byte data packet, the basic block size used on CP/M floppy disks. The packet was prefixed by a simple 3-byte header containing a \`\` character, a \\"block number\\" from 0-255, and the \\"inverse\\" block number‚Äî255 minus the block number. Block numbering starts with 1 for the first block sent, not 0. The header was followed by the 128 bytes of data, and then a single-byte checksum. The complete packet was thus 132 bytes long, containing 128 bytes of payload data, for a total channel efficiency of about 97%. The checksum was the sum of all bytes in the packet modulo 256. The modulo operation was easily computed by discarding all but the eight least significant bits of the result, or alternatively on an eight-bit machine, ignoring arithmetic overflow which would produce the same effect automatically. In this way, the checksum was restricted to an eight-bit quantity. For example, if this checksum method was used on a tiny data packet containing only two bytes carrying the values 130 and 130, the total of these codes is 260 and the resulting checksum is 4. The file was marked \\"complete\\" with a \`\` character sent after the last block. This character was not in a packet, but sent alone as a single byte. Since the file length was not sent as part of the protocol, the last packet was padded out with a \\"known character\\" that could be dropped. In the original specification, this defaulted to \`\` or 26 decimal, which CP/M used as the end-of-file marker inside its own disk format. The standard suggested any character could be used for padding, but there was no way for it to be changed within the protocol itself ‚Äì if an implementation changed the padding character, only clients using the same implementation would correctly interpret the new padding character. Transfer details Files were transferred one packet at a time. When received, the packet's checksum was calculated by the receiver and compared to the one received from the sender at the end of the packet. If the two matched, the receiver sent an \`\` message back to the sender, which then sent the next packet in sequence. If there was a problem with the checksum, the receiver instead sent a \`\`. If a \`\` was received, the sender would re-send the packet, and continued to try several times, normally ten, before aborting the transfer. A \`\` was also sent if the receiver did not receive a valid packet within ten seconds while still expecting data due to the lack of a \`\` character. A seven-second timeout was also used within a packet, guarding against dropped connections in mid-packet. The block numbers were also examined in a simple way to check for errors. After receiving a packet successfully, the next packet should have a one-higher number. If it instead received the same block number this was not considered serious, it was implied that the \`\` had not been received by the sender, which had then re-sent the packet. Transfers were receiver-driven; the transmitter would not send any data until an initial \`\` was sent by the receiver. This was a logical outcome of the way the user interacted with the sending machine, which would be remotely located. The user would navigate to the requested file on the sending machine, and then ask that machine to transfer it. Once this command was issued, the user would then execute a command in their local software to start receiving. Since the delay between asking the remote system for the file and issuing a local command to receive was unknown, XMODEM allowed up to 90 seconds for the receiver to begin issuing requests for data packets. Problems Although XMODEM was robust enough for a journalist in 1982 to transmit stories from Pakistan to the United States with an Osborne 1 and acoustic coupler over poor-quality telephone lines, the protocol had several flaws. Minor problems XMODEM was written for CP/M machines, and bears several marks of that operating system. Notably, files on CP/M were always multiples of 128 bytes, and their end was marked within a block with the \`\` character. These characteristics were transplanted directly into XMODEM. However, other operating systems did not feature either of these peculiarities, and the widespread introduction of MS-DOS in the early 1980s led to XMODEM having to be updated to notice either a \`\` or \`\` as the end-of- file marker. For some time it was suggested that sending a \`\` character instead of an \`\` or \`\` should be supported in order to easily abort the transfer from the receiving end. Likewise, a \`\` received in place of the \`\` indicated the sender wished to cancel the transfer. However, this character could be easily \\"created\\" via simple noise-related errors of what was meant to be an \`\` or \`\`. A double-\`\` was proposed to avoid this problem, but it is not clear if this was widely implemented. Major problems XMODEM was designed for simplicity, without much knowledge of other file transfer protocols ‚Äì which were fairly rare anyway. Due to its simplicity, there were a number of very basic errors that could cause a transfer to fail, or worse, result in an incorrect file which went unnoticed by the protocol. Most of this was due to the use of a simple checksum for error correction, which is susceptible to missing errors in the data if two bits are reversed, which can happen with a suitably short burst of noise. Additionally, similar damage to the header or checksum could lead to a failed transfer in cases where the data itself was undamaged. Many authors introduced extensions to XMODEM to address these and other problems. Many asked for these extensions to be included as part of a new XMODEM standard. However, Ward Christensen refused to do this, as it was precisely the lack of these features, and the associated coding needed to support them, which led to XMODEM's widespread use. As he explained: :It was a quick hack I threw together, very unplanned (like everything I do), to satisfy a personal need to communicate with some other people. ONLY the fact that it was done in 8/77, and that I put it in the public domain immediately, made it become the standard that it is... :...People who suggest I make SIGNIFICANT changes to the protocol, such as 'full duplex', 'multiple outstanding blocks', 'multiple destinations', etc etc don't understand that the incredible simplicity of the protocol is one of the reasons it survived. Batch Transfers Another problem with XMODEM was that it required the transfer to be user-driven rather than automated. Typically this meant the user would navigate on the sender's system to select the file they wanted, and then use a command to put that system into the \\"ready to send\\" mode. They would then trigger the transfer from their end using a command in their terminal emulator. If the user wanted to transfer another file, they would have to repeat this process again. For automated transfers between two sites, a number of add-ons to the XMODEM protocol were implemented over time. These generally assumed the sender would continue sending file after file, with the receiver attempting to trigger the next file by sending a \`NAK\` as normal at the start of a transfer. When the \`NAK\`s timed out, it could be assumed that either there were no more files, or the link was broken anyway. MODEM7 MODEM7, also known as MODEM7 batch or Batch XMODEM, was the first known extension of the XMODEM protocol. A normal XMODEM file transfer starts with the receiver sending a single \`NAK\` character to the sender, which then starts sending a single \`SOH\` to indicate the start of the data, and then packets of data. MODEM7 changed this behavior only slightly, by sending the filename, in 8.3 filename format, before the \`\`. Each character was sent individually and had to be echoed by the receiver as a form of error correction. For a non-aware XMODEM implementation, this data would simply be ignored while it waited for the \`SOH\` to arrive, so the characters would not be echoed and the implementation could fall back to conventional XMODEM. With \\"aware\\" software, the file name could be used to save the file locally. Transfers could continue with another \`\`, each file is saved under the name being sent to the receiver. Jerry Pournelle in 1983 described MODEM7 as \\"probably the most popular microcomputer communications program in existence\\". TeLink MODEM7 sent the filename as normal text, which meant it could be corrupted by the same problems that XMODEM was attempting to avoid. This led to the introduction of TeLink by Tom Jennings, author of the original FidoNet mailers. TeLink avoided MODEM7's problems by standardizing a new \\"zero packet\\" containing information about the original file. This included the file's name, size, and timestamp, which were placed in a regular 128 byte XMODEM block. Whereas a normal XMODEM transfer would start with the sender sending \\"block 1\\" with a \`\` header, the TeLink header packet was labeled \\"block 0\\" and began with a \`\`. The packet contained the file creation date and time, filename up to 16 characters, the file size as a 4-byte value, and the name of the program sending the file. A normal XMODEM implementation would simply discard the packet, the assumption being that the packet number had been corrupted. But this led to a potential time delay if the packet were discarded, as the sender could not tell whether the receiver had responded with a \`\` because it did not understand the zero packet or because there was a transmission error. As TeLink was normally used only by FidoNet software, which demanded it as part of the FidoNet standards, this did not present a real-world problem as both ends would always support this standard. The basic \\"block 0\\" system became a standard in the FidoNet community, and was re-used by a number of future protocols like SEAlink and YMODEM. XMODEM-CRC The checksum used in the original protocol was extremely simple, and errors within the packet could go unnoticed. This led to the introduction of XMODEM-CRC by John Byrns, which used a 16-bit CRC in place of the 8-bit checksum. CRC's encode not only the data in the packet, but its location as well, allowing it to notice the bit-replacement errors that a checksum would miss. Statistically, this made the chance of detecting an error less than 16 bits long 99.9969%, and even higher for longer error bit strings. XMODEM-CRC was designed to be backwardly compatible with XMODEM. To do this, the receiver sent a \`C\` (capital C) character instead of a \`\` to start the transfer. If the sender responded by sending a packet, it was assumed the sender \\"knew\\" XMODEM-CRC, and the receiver continued sending \`C\`'s. If no packet was forthcoming, the receiver assumed the sender did not know the protocol, and sent an \`\` to start a \\"traditional\\" XMODEM transfer. Unfortunately, this attempt at backward compatibility had a downside. Since it was possible that the initial \`C\` character would be lost or corrupted, it could not be assumed that the receiver did not support XMODEM-CRC if the first attempt to trigger the transfer failed. The receiver thus tried to start the transfer three times with \`C\`, waiting three seconds between each attempt. This meant that if the user selected XMODEM-CRC while attempting to talk to any XMODEM, as it was intended, there was a potential 10 second delay before the transfer started. To avoid the delay, the sender and receiver would generally list XMODEM-CRC separately from XMODEM, allowing the user to select \\"basic\\" XMODEM if the sender didn't explicitly list it. To the average user, XMODEM-CRC was essentially a \\"second protocol\\", and treated as such. This was not true of FidoNet mailers, however, where CRC was defined as the standard for all TeLink transfers. Higher throughput Since the XMODEM protocol required the sender to stop and wait for an \`\` or \`\` message from the receiver, it tended to be quite slow. In the era of 300 bit/s modems, the entire 132-byte packet required just over 3.5 seconds to send (132 bytes * 8 bits per byte / 300 bits per second). Assuming it takes 0.2 seconds for the receiver's \`\` to make it back to the sender and the next packet to start hitting the receiver (0.1 seconds in both directions), the overall time for one packet would be 3.7 seconds, just over 92% throughput. As modem speeds increased, the fixed delay needed to send the \`\`/\`\` grew in proportion to time needed to send the packet. For instance, at 2400 bit/s the packets took only 0.44 seconds to send, so if the \`\`/\`\` still took 0.2 seconds to make it back (this is latency in the network, not throughput), the throughput has fallen to under 60%. At 9600 bit/s it is under 30% ‚Äì more time is spent waiting for the reply than is needed to send the packet. A number of new versions of XMODEM were introduced in order to address these problems. Like earlier extensions, these versions tended to be backward-compatible with the original XMODEM, and like those extensions, this led to a further fracturing of the XMODEM landscape in the user's terminal emulator. In the end, dozens of versions of XMODEM emerged. WXModem WXmodem, short for \\"Windowed Xmodem\\", is a variant of XMODEM developed by Peter Boswell in 1986 for use on high-latency lines, specifically public X.25 systems and PC Pursuit. These have latencies that are far higher than the plain-old telephone service, which leads to very poor efficiency in XMODEM. Additionally, these networks often use control characters for flow control and other tasks, notably XON/XOFF will stop the data flow. Finally, in the case of an error that required a resend, it was sometimes difficult to know whether a \`SOH\` was a packet indicator or more noise. WXmodem adapted XMODEM-CRC to address these problems. One change was to escape a small set of control characters, \`DLE\`, \`XON\`, \`XOFF\` and \`SYN\`. These were escaped by inserting a \`DLE\` in front of them, and then modifying the character by XORing it with 64. In theory, this meant the packet might be as long as 264 bytes if it originally consisted entirely of characters that required escaping. These inserted and modified characters are not part of the CRC calculation, they are removed and converted at the receiving end before calculating the CRC. Additionally, all packets were prefixed with a \`SYN\` character, which meant the packet lead-in was \`SYN\`\`SOH\`, reducing the chance that a stray \`SOH\` would be confused for a packet header in various error cases. An unescaped \`SYN\` found in the body of a packet was an error. The major change in WXMODEM is the use of a sliding window to improve throughput on high-latency links. To do so, the \`ACK\` messages were followed by the packet number they were \`ACK\`ing or \`NAK\`ing. The receiver does not have to \`ACK\` every packet, it is allowed to \`ACK\` any number between one and four packets. An \`ACK\` with the fourth packet sequence number is assumed to \`ACK\` all four packets. A error causes a \`NAK\` to be sent immediately, with all packets from that number and after being re-sent. Requiring an \`ACK\` every four packets makes the system work like it has a packet size of 512 bytes, but in the case of an error, typically only requires 128 bytes to be re-sent. Moreover, it reduces the amount of data flowing in the reverse direction by four times. This is of little interest in the typical modem's full duplex operation, but is important in half duplex systems like Telebit models which have 19 kB speed in one direction and 75 bits/s in the return channel. SEAlink One of the first third-party mailers for the FidoNet system was SEAdog, written by the same author as the then-popular .arc data compression format. SEAdog included a wide variety of improvements, including SEAlink, an improved transfer protocol based on the same sliding window concept as WXmodem. It differed from WXmodem mostly in details. One difference is that SEAlink supported the \\"zero packet\\" introduced by TeLink, which is needed in order to operate as a drop-in replacement for TeLink in FidoNet systems where the header was expected. \`ACK\`s and \`NAK\`s were extended to three-byte \\"packets\\", starting with the \`ACK\` or \`NAK\`, then the packet number, then the complement of the packet number, in the same fashion as the original XMODEM packet header. The window size was normally set to six packets. SEAlink was not expected to operate over X.25 or similar links, and thus did not perform escaping. This was also needed so the zero packet would work properly, as this standard used the \`SYN\` character that WXmodem had re-purposed. On top of these changes, it added an \\"Overdrive\\" mode for half duplex links. This suppressed ACKs for packets that were successfully transferred, in effect making the window of infinite size. This mode was indicated by a flag in the zero block. SEAlink later added a number of other improvements and was a useful general-purpose protocol. However, it remained rare outside the FidoNet world, and was rarely seen in user-facing software. XMODEM-1K Another way to solve the throughput problem is to increase the packet size. Although the fundamental problem of latency remains, the speed at which it becomes a problem is higher. XMODEM-1K with 1024-byte packets was the most popular such solution. In this case, the throughput at 9600 bit/s is 81%, given the same assumptions as above. XMODEM-1K was an expanded version of XMODEM-CRC, which indicated the longer block size in the sender by starting a packet with the \`\` character instead of \`\`. Like other backward-compatible XMODEM extensions, it was intended that a -1K transfer could be started with any implementation of XMODEM on the other end, backing off features as required. XMODEM-1K was originally one of the many improvements to XMODEM introduced by Chuck Forsberg in his YMODEM protocol. Forsberg suggested that the various improvements were optional, expecting software authors to implement as many of them as possible. Instead, they generally implemented the bare minimum, leading to a profusion of semi-compatible implementations, and eventually, the splitting out of the name \\"YMODEM\\" into \\"XMODEM-1K\\" and a variety of YMODEMs. Thus XMODEM-1K actually post-dates YMODEM, but remained fairly common anyway. NMODEM NMODEM is a file transfer protocol developed by L. B. Neal, who released it in 1990. NMODEM is essentially a version of XMODEM-CRC using larger 2048 byte blocks. The block size was chosen to match the common cluster size of the MS- DOS FAT file system on contemporary hard drives, making buffering data for writing simpler.NMODEM 1.12 program and source codeNMODEM documentation Protocol spoofing Over reliable (error-free) connections, it is possible to eliminate latency by \\"pre-acknowledging\\" the packets, a technique known more generally as \\"protocol spoofing\\". This is normally accomplished in the link hardware, notably Telebit modems. The modems, when the option was turned on, would notice the XMODEM header and immediately sent an \`ACK\`. This would cause the sending XMODEM program to immediately send the next packet, making the transfer continuous, like an infinite-sized window. The modems also suppress the \`ACK\` being sent by the XMODEM software at the far end, thereby freeing up the low-speed return channel. The system can also be implemented in the protocol itself, and variations of XMODEM offered this feature. In these cases, the receiver would send the \`ACK\` as soon as the packet started, in the same fashion as the Telebit modems. Since this feature is only an alteration of the receiver-side behavior, it does not require any changes in the protocol on the sender's side. YMODEM formalized this system. This concept should be contrasted with the one used in SEAlink, which changes the behavior on both sides of the link. In SEAlink, the receiver stops sending the \`ACK\` entirely, and the sender changes its behavior to not expect them.

It was primarily used to transfer files to and from bulletin board systems. YMODEM was developed by Chuck Forsberg as an expansion of XMODEM and was first implemented in his CP/M YAM program. Initially also known as YAM, it was formally given the name \\"YMODEM\\" in 1985 by Ward Christensen, author of the original XMODEM. YMODEM extended XMODEM in three ways, combining features found in other extended XMODEM varieties. Like XMODEM-CRC, YMODEM replaced the 8-bit checksum with a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC), but made it the default form of correction instead of optional. From TeLink it added the \\"block 0\\" header that sent the filename and size, which allowed batch transfers (multiple files in a single session) and eliminated the need to add padding at the end of the file. Finally, YMODEM allowed the block size to be increased from the original 128 bytes of data to 1024, as in XMODEM-1k, which greatly improved throughput on faster modems. Forsberg built the standard with all of these features as runtime options, allowing a single protocol driver to fall back to XMODEM-CRC or even XMODEM when connecting to non-YAM systems. He believed that programmers would want to implement as many of these features as possible on any given platform. He was dismayed to find that the majority of implementations were actually providing nothing more than 1k block size with CRC-16, failing to implement the \\"block 0\\" while continuing to use the YMODEM name. The result was the release of many mutually incompatible YMODEM implementations, and the use of the name YMODEM Batch to clearly indicate those versions that did support the complete standard. Features XMODEM The original XMODEM was a very simple protocol and that is the reason for its success; it could be implemented on practically any machine of the era, even those with very limited processors and storage. It worked by breaking up the data to be sent into 128-byte packets, adding a 3-byte header and 1-byte checksum footer, and sending the resulting 132-byte packets out in order. The receiving computer recalculated the checksum from the 128 bytes of data, and if it matched the checksum sent in the footer it sent back an \`ACK\`, and if it did not match, a \`NAK\`. When the sender received an \`ACK\` it sent the next packet, while a \`NAK\` caused it to re-send the last one. There were a number of problems with the protocol. The use of a simple checksum meant some common errors could go unnoticed. The small packet size and requirement to wait for the \`ACK\` or \`NAK\` led to slow performance on higher speed links or ones with significant latency. Finally, as the transfer contained no details of the file, every file had to be manually started, which could be a chore when many small files were being transferred. Solutions to these problems were developed during the early 1980s. XMODEM-CRC replaced the checksum with a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC), which was much more resistant to common errors. XMODEM-1k expanded the packet size from 128 bytes to 1024, improving performance on higher-speed connections, while others, like WXMODEM and SEAlink instead introduced sliding window systems to combat both performance and latency, at the cost of some complexity. Still others, like TeLink and MODEM7, added file information so that a single transfer could contain multiple files, allowing batches of files to be sent with a single command. YMODEM Unfortunately, none of these expanded versions included all of these features. Chuck Forsberg, author of the CP/M \\"Yet Another Modem program\\", or YAM, decided to write a single protocol driver that supported all of these options. When the users started a transfer they could indicate which options they wanted on the command line, for instance, saying they wished to use CRC. The protocol was written so that it would attempt this style, but gracefully fall-back to match whatever capabilities the remote software did implement. Abort One problem with the original XMODEM was that there was no defined way to abort the transfer once started. The normal solution was to send \`NAK\`s to every subsequent packet if the user requested it. Since the XMODEM protocol defined a limit of ten \`NAK\`s to abort a send, and each packet might take a second to send, this meant there was a ten second delay where the sender continually sent data that was simply ignored. Some implementations had added the ability to send a \`CAN\` instead of \`ACK\` or \`NAK\` at the end of a received packet to indicate an abort. Unfortunately, there was the possibility that a \`CAN\` could be generated by line noise and trigger an abort. YAM thus modified this slightly to require two \`CAN\`s back-to-back, which would immediately perform a \\"graceful abort\\" on the sender end. CRC CRC support had been introduced in XMODEM-CRC. This was a very simple change to the original protocol; if requested, the receiver would attempt to trigger the transfer by sending an initial \`C\` instead of a \`NAK\`. If the remote sender supported the CRC option, it would begin sending packets as normal, but with a 16-bit CRC in the footer rather than the 1-byte checksum. YAM supported this option with no changes. 1k 1024-byte packets had been introduced in XMODEM-1k. This version did not change the trigger character from the receiver, so there was no way for the sender to know whether the receiver supported larger packets. Instead, XMODEM-1k was presented as a separate protocol on both ends of the connection. When such a connection was started, the sender could choose to send either 1024 bytes in a packet or 128, indicating the larger with an \`STX\` character in the header rather than the normal \`SOH\`. Normally only the last few packets would use the smaller packets, to avoid sending large amounts of padding. 1k also assumed CRC for all connections. YAM supported 1k with no changes. Zero packet In order to support automated transfers of FidoNet mail, MODEM7 introduced the ability to send the filename as plain text before sending the first block of data. This was not reliable, and TeLink improved this by placing the filename, and optionally other data like the creation date and file length, in a complete 128-byte packet. XMODEM started transfers with packet number one, so TeLink sent this packet as number zero. This \\"zero packet\\" or \\"block zero\\" became common in other FidoNet systems like SEAlink and others. YAM supported the zero packet format, but it was ignored by many 3rd party implementations of YMODEM. When one implementation attempted to send the zero packet to a non-aware version, the receiver would naturally \`NAK\` the packet, as packet zero is illegal. The sender would then see the \`NAK\` as a transmission error and try to send the packet again, attempting this ten times before failing. For reasons that are not entirely clear, many implementations of YMODEM did not implement this feature. Because they were unaware of it, they sent a \`NAK\`, triggering a series of resend attempts before failing out. This meant that if the user chose to use a compliant YMODEM with a non-compliant version, the transfers would fail. Nevertheless, such non-compliant versions were common. As a result, it was common to see both YMODEM and YMODEM Batch listed as two separate protocols. Further confusion was created by the similarity between XMODEM-1k and these non- compliant YMODEMs, which were similar to the point that they were often incorrectly listed as the same. Streaming support YMODEM-g is a streaming variant used for error-free connections. It does not wait for an ACK to be received before sending the next packet. The protocol is faster than YMODEM because no latency is introduced between packets, but has no capability for correcting errors. It is reliant on the underlying connection being error- free, which is the case for modems supporting MNP for instance. Normally, a YMODEM transfer would be started by the receiver sending a \`C\` to indicate it wants to use the 128-byte format with CRC, or \`NAK\` if it wishes to use the original checksum system. When g-protocol is desired, the transfer is instead triggered by sending a \`G\`. If the sender does not support the g-protocol, it considers this to be an error and ignores it, but if it does support g it begins sending packets in a continual stream. It only expects a single \`ACK\` after the final packet is received, which is indicated by the presence of an \`EOT\` character in the data. YMODEM-g assumes 1k packets are available. However, despite this protocol potentially being faster than ZMODEM it was still rarely used. This was partially due to the lack of other functionality, but also a more serious issue. Before the emergence of the 16550 UART, there was a substantial risk of buffer overrun on the serial port. Although this would be detected by YMODEM-g it could not be corrected since no block re- transmission is possible. The receiver would have to cancel and restart the whole transmission from the beginning. ZMODEM on the other hand has transfer resume capability which made it more appealing.

It was designed by James Barnet and constructed by John Young, at a cost of ¬£191,800 in only eight months. This was largely due to the importation from England of electric lighting, which enabled work to be carried out around the clock. Description and history The Garden Palace Ruins of the Garden Palace, 1882 A reworking of London's Crystal Palace, the plan for the Garden Palace was similar to that of a large cathedral, having a long hall with lower aisle on either side, like a nave, and a transept of similar form, each terminating in towers and meeting beneath a central dome. The successful contractor was John Young, a highly experienced building contractor who had worked on the Crystal Palace for The Great Exhibition of 1851 and locally on the General Post Office and Exhibition Building at Prince Alfred Park. The dome was 100 feet (30.4 metres) in diameter and 210 feet (65.5 metres) in height. The building was over 244 metres long and had a floor space of over 112,000 metres with 4.5 million feet of timber, 2.5 million bricks and 243 tons of galvanised corrugated iron. The building was similar in many respects to the later Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne. Sydney's first hydraulic lift, was contained in the north tower, enabling visitors to climb the tower. The Garden Palace was sited at what is today the southwestern end of the Royal Botanic Garden (although at the time it was built it occupied land that was outside the Garden and in The Domain). It was constructed primarily from timber, which ensured its complete destruction when engulfed by fire in the early morning of 22 September 1882. The Garden Palace at that time was used by a number of Government Departments and many significant records were destroyed in the fire, notably records of squatting occupation in New South Wales. Most importantly, however, 500-1000 pieces of Sydney Aboriginal artefacts were also lost in this fire. The only extant remains of the Garden Palace are its carved Sydney sandstone gateposts and wrought iron gates, located on the Macquarie Street entrance to the Royal Botanical Garden. A 1940s-era sunken garden and fountain featuring a statue of Cupid marks the former location of the Palace's dome. Few artefacts from the International Exhibition survived the fire, one of which is a carved graphite statue of an elephant, from Ceylon, now in the collection of the Powerhouse Museum. An 1878 Bechstein concert grand piano, that had won the musical instrument first prize at the Exhibition, but had luckily been removed from the Garden Palace prior to the fire, is also held by the Powerhouse.

They have the NATO reporting name Tarantul (not to be confused with the Stenka-class patrol boat, whose official Soviet name is also \\"Tarantul\\"). These ships were designed to replace the Project 205 Tsunami (NATO: \\"Osa\\") missile boats. Development In the late 1970s, the Soviets realised the need for a larger, more seaworthy craft with better gun armament and higher positioned air search radars. The need for these improvements was underscored by the First Gulf War, when 12 Iraqi 'Osa-I's' were destroyed or damaged by short ranged Sea Skua anti-ship missiles. They were attacked by British Lynx helicopters, but the Osa crews didn't notice them because they flew below their radar horizon. In the Tarantul, both the single 76 mm main gun and the two 30 mm Gatling-type guns are used for air defence, together with a comprehensive electronic warfare suite. The boats are built by the Petrovsky yard (St. Petersburg), Rybinsk and Ulis yard (Vladivostok). A version of these ships for coastal anti submarine warfare and patrol was developed as the Pauk class corvette or Project 1241.2. The Indian navy paid approximately $30 million each to license-produce Tarantul-I in the early nineties. With over 30 sales on the export market the Tarantul has been a relative success for the Russian shipbuilding industry. Versions Project 1241.1 (NATO: Tarantul-II) The naming convention for NATO reporting name Tarantul was a special case here. NATO called the first version of the class as Tarantul-II, given that they had a better sensor suite/equipment than the ships of the following class Tarantul-I, which was produced exclusively for export.

Propulsion is a COGOG system (COmbined Gas Or Gas) consisting of two M70 at 12,000 hp (8826 kW) high power gas turbines with a combined 24200 horsepower output for full power and two cruise gas turbines type M75 with a combined output of 5,000 hp (2942 kW). Top speed is 38 knots. Between 1979 and 1984, 13 ships of the type were built. Another ship R-55 was rebuilt after its completion as a test vessel for the \\"Kortik\\" short-range defense system for Project 1241.7. Project 1241.RE (NATO: Tarantul-I) To clarify, by NATO's definition, Project 1241.RE (NATO: Tarantul-I) was an export version of Project 1241.1 (NATO: Tarantul-II). This class of ships could be distinguished by the lack of fire control radar on the roof of the bridge. Instead, the fire control radar, X-band \\"Garpun-Bal\\" (NATO: \\"Plank Shave\\"), built for the anti-ship missiles, was installed on the top of the mast. Other equipment included a small navigation radar type \\"Kivach-2\\" on the bridge roof (or MR-312 \\"Pechera-1\\" on the ships of Poland), and the gun-fire control radar MR-123 Vympel (NATO: \\"Bass Tilt\\") at the foot of the mast. Two PK-16 decoy launchers were also installed. The model of the missiles in the KT-138 launch containers were P-20 (NATO: SS-N-2B), basically they were P-15 updated with the new guidance system but with the original 40 km range. Between 1977 and 1979, 22 ships of this class were produced exclusively for export. Only one of these ships, R-26, was retained by the Soviet Navy for training purposes. India bought five of these ships as Veer class corvettes, and would later produce eight ships of the same class domestically. Vietnam also bought six Project 1241.RE ships from various sources over the years. Project 12411 (1241.1M/1241.1MR) (NATO: Tarantul-III/Tarantul-III Mod) Retaining the main armament and basic hull form of the 1241.RE (NATO: Tarantul-I) class, 1241.1M (NATO: Tarantul-III) received important upgrades. Apart from a modest but useful internal redesign, the Tarantul-III had a new type of propulsion‚Äîa CODAG (COmbined Diesel And Gas) system. Two M-70 gas turbines (rated at 12000 hp each) and two M510 (rated at 4000 hp each) diesel engines were used, being a big improvement over the earlier COGOG system both in terms of serviceability (the two cruise diesels being almost something of a Soviet 'classic'), fuel efficiency and, most importantly, service life expectancy compared to the older NK-12M's. The maximum speed reached . The superstructures were redesigned and the angled mast of the previous projects has been replaced by a narrow, straight lattice. The sensor position remained almost the same as the Project 1241.1. The \\"Pechera\\" navigation radar was off the roof of the bridge, with the MR-123 \\"Vympel\\" fire control radar installed. Two jamming system (NATO: \\"Wine Glass\\") were installed on both sides at the foot of the mast. The reason for this was the installation of four SS-N-22 'Sunburn' supersonic ship-to-ship missiles with a range of at least 100 km. The associated radar system is the L-band 'Band Stand' radar, with a 120 km active and 500 km passive range and the capability to track 15 different targets. The missiles can also receive third party guidance through the 'Light Bulb' uplink (from other ships, helicopters or long range patrol aircraft). Cannon armament is retained, as were the PK-16 launchers, although Soviet Navy ships benefited from the improved SA-N-8 quadruple MANPAD launcher. At least one ship had an SA-N-11 Kashtan gun+missile CIWS installed instead of the AK-630's. The Tarantul-III, built from 1987 on, received an improved ECM (Electronic countermeasures) suite, consisting of 2 'Half Hat' and 2 'Foot Ball' jamming systems, coupled to 4 improved PK-10 decoy launchers. At least 24 of these ships were built for the Soviet Navy before production ended in 1992. Between 1985 and 2001, 34 ships of this class were built. After the construction of first batch of 11 ships, the anti-ship missiles were changed from the P-80 \\"Moskit\\" to the more modern model P-270 \\"Moskit-M\\", therefore the following 23 boats had a new ID: Project 1241.1MR. The Guided Missile Corvette 'R-60' was further modernized in 2005, having the 2 AK-630M CIWS removed, and replaced with \\"Palash\\" CIWS. Project 1242.1/1241.8 'Molniya' Project 1242.1 and project 1241.8 Molniya (\\"Lightning\\") are further developments of the Tarantul family of ships. The two projects has been modified and rearmed with modern missile systems like the Uran-E and are more capable ships than the Tarantul types. The ships are built by the Russian Vympel Shipyard. Russia received at least one boat for trials in the 1990s and in 1999 Vietnam ordered two vessels. Vietnam is currently the main user of the Molniya class, with two Russian made ships and 6 locally built ships. Vietnam started its own production line of 1241.8 Molniya ships with the assistance of Almaz Central Design Bureau in Russia. The first two locally built ships were delivered on July 2014 and the last two in October 2017.http://vpk- news.ru/news/27262https://bmpd.livejournal.com/2888368.html The Vietnamese ships are armed with 1 AK-176 76mm gun, 16 Uran-E anti ship missiles, 4 Igla-M air defence missiles and 2 AK-630 close in weapon systems. The Vietnamese ships are also larger at 56.9m in length and a maximum displacement of 563 tons. They have a range of with 44 crew members on board. The Indian Navy ordered 4 further modified 1241.8 Tarantuls, this order was later reduced to 2. These last two ships of the Veer-class are armed with 16 SS-N-25 'Switchblade' / URAN E Missiles, 1 OTO Melara 76 mm instead of the AK-176, and MR 352 Positiv-E (NATO: Cross Dome) Radar. In 2009 Libya ordered 3 ships however, there has been no news since and the reliability of the news source is questionable. The Libyan Civil War in 2011 put a stop to any acquisitions. Shortly afterwards Turkmenistan acquired three Type 1241.8 vessels, possibly those that had been ordered by Libya but not delivered. The Russian Navy plans to receive two upgraded Molniya-class missile boats by early 2019; they were initially planned for a foreign customer but the contract was cancelled, so the Russian Navy acquired them. The boats replace the Moskit with eight Kh-35U anti-ship missiles and MANPADS launcher with the Pantsir-M gun/missile system. They will also have a modern radar phased antenna array. One boat is expected to operate in the Black Sea and the other in the Caspian Sea.Russian Navy to get Two Upgraded Molniya-class Missile Boats. Navy Recognition. 10 July 2018.

Martinus Schouman, 1832 Jan Carolus Josephus van Speijk, also written Van Speyk (31 January 1802 ‚Äì 5 February 1831), was a Dutch naval lieutenant who became a hero in the Netherlands for his opposition to the Belgian Revolution. Early life Born in Amsterdam in 1802, Van Speijk was orphaned only a few weeks after his birth. When he was 18 years old, he joined the Royal Netherlands Navy and served in the Dutch East Indies from 1823 to 1825. He successfully attacked Bangka and Java, which earned him the nickname Schrik der Roovers (Terror of the Bandits). Death When the Belgian War of Independence began, Van Speijk was given command of a Dutch gunboat. Van Speijk despised the Belgian independence movement, and he said he would rather die \\"than become an infamous Brabander\\". On February 5, 1831, a gale blew his gunboat into the quay at the port of Antwerp. The Belgians quickly stormed his ship, demanding Van Speijk haul down the Dutch flag. Rather than surrender his ship, he fired a pistol (some versions say he threw a lighted cigar) into a barrel of gunpowder in the ship's magazine. According to legend, he shouted \\"Dan liever de lucht in\\" ( \\"(I'd) rather be blown up\\"). The number of Belgians killed is unknown, though it probably numbered in the dozens. Twenty-eight of his 31 crewmen also perished in the blast. Legacy Eight days after Van Speijk's death, the Netherlands declared a period of mourning. His remains were buried in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam, where the remains of Dutch naval hero Michiel de Ruyter also are interred. Van Speijk is regarded as a naval hero in the Netherlands. This resulted in a royal decree (Koninklijk Besluit number 81, 11 February 1833) issued by King William I pronouncing that as long as the Dutch Navy exists there will always be a ship named 'Van Speijk' to preserve his memory. Seven ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy ships have carried this name, the latest being of 1994, a . Her predecessor, the frigate , launched in 1965, was the lead ship of her own class. The mast of Van Speijk's ship is preserved at the Koninklijk Instituut voor de Marine (Royal Netherlands Naval College). For his actions as captain of Gunboat Number 2, Jan van Speijk was decorated with the Knight's Cross (4th class) of the Order of William. A national memorial in his honour is located at the J.C.J. van Speijk Lighthouse in Egmond aan Zee.  References  * Encarta-encyclopedia Winkler Prins (1993-2002) s.v. Speijk, Jan Carel Josephus van.

XTP provides protocol options for error control, flow control, and rate control. Instead of separate protocols for each type of communication, XTP controls packet exchange patterns to produce different models, e.g. reliable datagrams, transactions, unreliable streams, and reliable multicast connections. Long latency is one of the major problems in satellite communications. Couple this with possible environmental variables and sometimes asymmetrical bandwidth conditions, the quality of service in satellite communications is sometimes lacking. XTP addresses these issues in a variety of ways such as a Selective Retransmission algorithm that deals with loss recovery. This works by the receiver detecting missing data packets and transmitting a list of those missing packets to the sender, who then is able to quickly resend missing packets as needed. As stated, XTP also provides rate control in which the maximum bandwidth can be specified as well as what size burst data can be accepted. XTP also offers a reliable multicast protocol, and the flexibility to match any specific application needs.. XTP does not employ congestion avoidance algorithms. XTP is a real-time option at Layer 4 for the US Navy SAFENET LAN Profile.  See also  * T/TCP * SCTP Notes Caini, C., Firrincieli, R., Marchese, M., de Cola, T., Luglio, M., Roseti, C., et al. (2006).

It was first published online on 7 February 2003 and was released three times a week until its end in June 2015. Before starting the website in 2003, the comics had been published in zine form. With the launch of the website, the comic gained wider recognition, most notably when Warren Ellis linked to the comic on his blog, and then began to feature it as a \\"Favored Puny Human\\". It appeared in The Guardian for a short time until a change of editors caused it to be removed. Between 2008 and 2010, science fiction-themed strips of A Softer World were also produced and published on Tor.com. Format Comeau and Horne With occasional exceptions for double- length strips, each comic is three panels long. The three panels are made up of photographic art, either a series of three photographs, or one photograph that is spread over multiple frames, or repeated with different crops and zooms. Short text is added over the photographs. The photos do not illustrate the text directly, instead presenting a similar tone, or being in conflict. The strip grew out of work by Comeau that started in 2001 which used magazine about royalty as the illustrations. The photographs for A Softer World were taken by Horne, then sent to Comeau for text. Horne said that the two were more collaborative when they lived in the same city and the process for making the strips changed when Horne moved away. The tone of the comic tends to be absurdist and dark, with the punchlines often being both humorous and disturbing. Horne stated that \\"Even those [strips] that are overtly hilarious usually manage to make you feel a bit guilty about your laughter. ... Few things are black-and-white, funny-or-not-funny, and ASW reflects that.\\" The strip occasionally features text with overt sexual content; for example, the strip from which the comic's title comes from reads, \\"In the caves behind my house, I found a softer world. / They understand what I had to do for love. / They don't believe in restraining orders.\\" Recurring themes include sexuality, accidents or disasters, and the supernatural. Hovering one's cursor over the comic will prompt the image title to appear, which contains an extra punchline or commentary related to the strip overall. In May 2010, a feature was added to display this text when clicking or tapping on the comic image, for users on mobile phones and touchscreen devices, which lack a \\"hovering\\" function. In hardcopy versions, the extra text appeared under the comic.  Reception  In a 2004 review, Dani Atkinson wrote for Sequential Tart: \\"The strips read like the first lines of a novel, the kind of really good first lines that manage to evoke the whole novel. Or a sort of ... post-modern haiku. They're blackly funny, or oddly touching, or creepy.\\" The website The Webcomics Examiner included A Softer World in its list of 25 \\"Best Webcomics of 2005\\", saying \\"the sly inferences in each Softer World strip are variously acidic, achingly funny, or casually disturbing.\\"The comic won the first Web Cartoonists' Choice Award for photographic webcomic in 2007. A Softer World was profiled in the September 2007 issue of the Australian Rolling Stone. In a 2008 article for ComicMix, reviewer Rick Marshall said the strip \\"is always a gamble. One strip can prompt hysterical laughter, while the next can only make you shiver and wonder what the unholy hell was going on in its creators‚Äô minds when that strip was conceived. ASW can explore complex social issues one moment and the depth of depravity in the next.\\" Writing after the final strip, Gary Tyrrel of Fleen called the series \\"one thousand two hundred and forty-three perfect little pillows of hope/despair, melancholy/sanguinity, [and] sexiness/moresexiness\\". As of August 2019, all print editions of the comic have a rating of 4.49 or higher on Goodreads. Other features of the site The website asofterworld.com was also used to host other creative works by Horne and Comeau: * \\"i blame the sea\\" is Emily Horne's photo journal, added to the site in 2008 and updated weekly. * \\"Overqualified\\" is a series of satirical cover letters for job applications. These cover letters are generally written so as to reveal a degree of insanity in the imagined author. For example, one is a letter from someone applying to be a mall Santa Claus, in which he explains that, as a foreman at Mattel, he fired all the middle aged men and hired midgets who he forced to wear green costumes, and that, after being fired, he broke into houses to steal milk and cookies. Overqualified was published in book form in 2009. * \\"i am other people\\" is a series of interviews that Joey conducts with people. * Lockpick Pornography, Comeau's first novel, was first serialized on the A Softer World website before publication.

It is located within the administrative area of Kunshan, 30 km southeast of the city centre of Suzhou. Zhouzhuang is a popular tourist destination, classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. It is one of the most famous water townships in China, noted for its profound cultural background, the well preserved ancient residential houses and the elegant watery views. It has been called the \\"Venice of the East\\".http://www.xaluan.com/modules.php?name=News&file;=article&sid;=166706 (in chinese)http://members.virtualtourist.com/m/5d91d/ef2aa/ Boat in Zhouzhuang passing through canals A canal in Zhouzhuang thumb thumb History In the Spring and Autumn period (770 BC-476 BC), Zhouzhuang Suzhou was a part of the fief Yaocheng and called Zhenfengli. After being donated to Full Fortune (Quanfu) Temple by Zhou Digong, a very devout Buddhist, in 1086 during the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), Zhouzhuang got its present name. Sights Double Bridges (Shuang qiao) Zhouzhuang is surrounded and divided by lakes and rivers. Many stone bridges cross the rivers, showing distinctive views of the water-town. The Double Bridges, which are Shide Bridge and Yongan Bridge, are the most famous and are considered the symbol of Zhouzhuang. Built in the Wanli era (1573‚Äì1619) of the Ming Dynasty, the Double Bridges are located in the northeast of the town. Shide Bridge is east-west and has a round arch, while Yongan Bridge is north-south and has a square arch. Crossing the two crisscross rivers (Yinzi Creek and Nabeishi River) and connecting at the middle, the Twin Bridges look like an old-style Chinese key. In 1984, 38 canvases of the notable painter, Chen Yifei, were exhibited in a New York gallery of Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corporation. \\"Memory of Hometown\\", which depicted the Double Bridges, was one of the items on display and has gained the world's attention for Zhouzhuang. The painting was chosen to be the first-day cover of the United Nations' postage stamp in 1985. Fuan Bridge Located at the eastern end of Zhongshi Jie, Fuan Bridge was built in 1355 during the Yuan Dynasty. The unique trait of the Fuan is the consummate combination of the single-arch bridge and the bridge towers. Shenting House Built in 1742 and located at the southeast side of Fuan Bridge, Shenting House was the private property of the descendant of Shen Wansan, the first millionaire of Jiangnan (South of Yangtze River) in the early Ming Dynasty. The whole architectural complex is of the Qing's style and occupies an area of more than 2,000 square meters (half an acre). Over 100 rooms are divided into three sections and each one is connected by arcades and aisles. The first is the water gate and the wharf, where Shen's family moored boats and washed clothes. The middle part includes the gate tower, the tearoom and the main hall. Bricky gate tower carved with lively and ingenious figures which tell the historic stories or show the good wishes, make it a rare artwork. Tea room and main hall are places for serving guests, and the furnishings here are all very elegant. The last section is the two-storied dwelling which consists of several buildings which are quite different from the main hall, more comfortable and refined in pattern and atmosphere. The painted sculpture of legendary Shen Wansan is in Datang Tower; cultural relics including ancient folk instruments are exhibited in Xiaotang Tower and Back Hall. Zhangting House It was built by Xu's family in the Zhengtong era (1436‚Äì1449) of the Ming Dynasty and bought by Zhang's family in the early Qing Dynasty. Located to the south of the Double Bridges, Zhangting House has more than 70 rooms and takes up about 1,800 square meters (less than half an acre). With Ruojing River flowing through, Zhangting House is a dapper and graceful residential house; has a tranquil courtyard and pond. Deep halls all represent the life of the quondam owner. Milou Tower Once called the De's Tavern, Milou Tower perches next to Zhenfeng Bridge which is at the southwest corner of Zhouzhuang. It is famous for being a rallying place of the literators in old times. Chengxu Temple The Chengxu Temple in Zhouzhuang Standing on Zhongshi Street which is opposite to Puqing Bridge, Chengxu Taoist Temple was built during 1086-1093 of the Song Dynasty and also known as Sanctity Hall (Shengtang Hall). After several periods of expansion, it is one of the most famous Taoist temples in Wuzhong Region. In an area of 1,500 square meters (1,800 square yards), Shengdi and Doumu halls, Yuhuang, Wenchang and Shengdi pavilions are pieces of Taoist architectures.  Local food  Wansan pork The most famous and delicious local food of Zhouzhuang is Wansan pork hock, named after Shen Wansan, the richest man in the late Yuan and early Ming Dynasty in Jiangnan.  Sanwei Glutinous rice balls  Sanwei Glutinous rice balls are commonly called soup gluten. In the area of Jiangnan, rice balls are a delicious dish that every family would make at home.  Practicalities  Entrance and tickets Entry fee is 100 yuan per person for a day. This ticket gives you entry to the ancient city area and all the sights noted above. Without purchasing the ticket, you cannot enter the area. There is an organized boat ride down the narrow canal. It costs 40 yuan per head, or 100 yuan for a boat, which can be used by 1-6 people. The boat ride lasts 20 minutes. Note that the boat ride service lasts until 8pm, so you may consider a ride in the evening after the other attractions have closed. The day trip (before 4pm) and night trips (4-8pm) have different routes.

The designer was Benjamin Dean Wyatt. It is sited where Regent Street meets The Mall, a purposefully wide endpoint of Regent Street known as Waterloo Place and Gardens, in between the two terraces of Carlton House Terrace and their tree- lined squares. The three very wide flights of steps down to The Mall adjoining are known as the Duke of York Steps. The column was completed in December 1832 and the statue of the Duke of York, by Sir Richard Westmacott, was raised on 10 April 1834. History Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany was the commander-in-chief of the British Army during the French Revolutionary Wars and led the reform of the army into a capable modernised force. The Duke is remembered in the children's nursery rhyme, \\"The Grand Old Duke of York\\". When he died in 1827, the entire British Army by general consensus following a proposal of the senior officers, forwent one day's wages to pay for a monument to the Duke. Duke Of York Monument from The Mall When the sum of subscriptions for a monument to the duke reached ¬£21,000 (), the committee overseeing the project asked a number of architects to submit proposals, and in December 1830 they chose a design by Benjamin Dean Wyatt. The mason Nowell of Pimlico, was contracted to build the column for a sum of ¬£15,760. Excavations for the concrete foundations began on 27 April 1831. The ground was excavated to a layer of natural soil, around below street level. A layer of York stone slabs at a depth of around was used to consolidate the concrete, and another was placed at the top of the foundations, as a base for the masonry. The foundations were completed on 25 June 1831, and construction of the stonework began three weeks later. Description The column is of the Tuscan order. It is built of granite from Aberdeenshire; a light grey variety was used for the pedestal, a bluer grey type for the base of the shaft, and 'red' Peterhead granite (warm beige) for the rest of the structure. There is an iron railing around the abacus of the capital (narrow main shaft). On top of the column, on a plinth, is a bronze statue of the duke dressed in the robes of the Knights of the Garter, by Sir Richard Westmacott. It is tall, weighs and was raised to the top on 8 April 1834. The total height of the monument to the top of the statue is . The statue faces south southeast, and from its base also are views of The Mall and St. James's Park. Inside the hollow column a spiral staircase of 168 steps, lit by narrow apertures in the wall, leads to the viewing platform around the base of the statue. Given the small, fragile platform and previous high demand for climbing, this staircase has been closed to the public for many decades. The great height of the column caused contemporary wits to suggest that the Duke was trying to escape his creditors, as the Duke died ¬£2 million in debt. The high very wide central section t-road it sits in was designed by architect John Nash as London's in the 1815‚Äì1820 period. Wealthy nobles desirous of a central London home followed by politicians such as William Ewart Gladstone lived in its Grade I-listed terraces described as 'palatial' by Historic England.

Eccles was one of the show's secondary characters, but like his counterpart Bluebottle (portrayed by Sellers), Eccles became extremely popular and he is regarded as epitomising the show's humour. Milligan visualised Eccles as a tall, lanky, amiable, well- meaning, but incredibly stupid teenager who often found himself involved-- usually alongside Bluebottle--in one of the nefarious schemes created by arch- villain Hercules Grytpype-Thynne.  Physique  Eccles was often referred to as being something other than an ordinary human. Seagoon says of him \\"He was the nearest thing I had seen to a human being without actually being one\\" (\\"The Dreaded Batter Pudding Hurler of Bexhill-On-Sea\\"). In \\"Lurgi Strikes Britain\\", in a conversation about how Lurgi could easily kill every human in England, Eccles quips, \\"Then I'm okay, fellers!\\" In \\"The Greenslade Story\\", Grytpype-Thynne mentions that Eccles is colour-blind, and in \\"The Missing Scroll\\", Seagoon says of Eccles: \\"He was living proof that the Piltdown Skull was not a hoax.\\" The Eccles character and his distinctive voicing were strongly influenced by Milligan's childhood love for the classic Walt Disney cartoons and specifically Disney's anthropomorphic buffoon dog character Goofy. However Eccles transcended the denseness of Goofy, being instead more like a young adult with childlike impulses, which may explain his friendship with Bluebottle. His special talent is for taking things he hears literally, with humorous and occasionally insightful results. Thus: :Seagoon (finding Eccles in a coal cellar): What are you doing here? :Eccles: Everybody's gotta be somewhere. and in the same conversation (from \\"The Last Goon Show of All\\"): :Seagoon: After you deliver the coal, you're supposed to go back to the cart! :Eccles: You mean I should let go of the sack? :Seagoon: Yes! :Eccles: But they said they was givin' me the sack! During an arctic expedition in \\"Scradge\\": :Seagoon: Now then Dr. Eccles, any cases of frozen feet? :Eccles: You didn't order any cases of frozen feet! Early cameo at the beginning of \\"The Great Art Mystery/The Case Of The Fake Neddie Seagoons\\": :Eccles: What's going on here!? :Grytpype-Thynne: Nothing. :Eccles: Oh I'd better go then. :Greenslade: The part of the mysterious stranger was played by Eccles. The rest of him was played by Rawicz and Landauer. When Milligan wrote The Idiot Weekly, an Australian version of The Goon Show, Eccles often made appearances in the script. Eccles also possessed remarkable stupidity when dealing with physical objects; in \\"The Greatest Mountain in the World\\" he describes two sticks of dynamite as \\"What luck! Two big cigars and they're both lit!\\" Eccles would frequently engage in echolalia, a symptom of several mental illnesses (including bipolar disorder, which Milligan himself suffered from). He also had a tendency to copy or outright assume the role of another character in a scene (to the original character's intense frustration), usually culminating in repeated efforts to throw Eccles off the premises.

HRSA helps fund, staff and support a national network of health clinics for people who otherwise would have little or no access to care. The Bureau is headed by Associate Administrator Jim Macrae, Senior Advisor Tracey Orloff and Chief Medical Advisor Seiji Hayashi. The Divisions such as OQI is run by Suma Nair. OSBO Margret Davis,  History  The Bureau was formed in 1982 as a merge of the Bureau of Medical Services and the Bureau of Community Health Services.  Predecessors  The Bureau of Primary Health Care is the direct descendant of the oldest function of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS): the system of Marine Hospitals founded in 1798. When the PHS's predecessor, the Marine Hospital Service, first divided itself into divisions in 1899, the hospitals became part of the Division of Marine Hospitals and Relief. In 1944, it was renamed the Division of Hospitals. As part of the PHS reorganizations of 1966‚Äì1973, it became part of the Federal Health Programs Service within the Health Services and Mental Health Administration in 1968, and then became the (second) Bureau of Medical Services within the Health Services Administration in 1973. In 1981, budget cuts imposed by the Reagan administration forced the end of PHS hospital system, with the last eight hospitals transferred to other organizations. The system of Community Health Centers has a different origin. They have their roots in the Migrant Health Act of 1962 and the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which established funding for the first community-based clinics that were to become today‚Äôs Health Center Program. The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 provided Federal funds for two \\"neighborhood health centers,\\" which were launched in 1965 by Jack Geiger and Count Gibson, physicians at Tufts University in Boston. Federal support for entities that would later be called health centers began in 1962 with passage of the Migrant Health Act, which funded medical and support services for migrant and seasonal farmworkers and their family members. In the mid-1970s, Congress permanently authorized neighborhood health centers as ‚Äúcommunity health centers‚Äù and ‚Äúmigrant health centers‚Äù under sections 329 and 330 of the Public Health Service Act. These programs were initially part of the Office of Economic Opportunity. However, the Nixon administration moved them into the PHS in 1974 as the Bureau of Community Health Services within the Health Services Administration.  Merge  In 1982, the Health Services Administration merged with the Health Resources Administration to form HRSA. As part of the merge, the Bureau of Medical Services absorbed the Bureau of Community Health Services to form the Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance. In 1987, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau split from the Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance. In 1992, the Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance was renamed the Bureau of Primary Health Care. The Bureau of Primary Health Care was reorganized and restructured around 1992 to become more organized and efficient. This resulted in creation of the Office of Minority and Special Populations, the Office of Policy and Program Development, and the Office of Quality and Data. There are also four divisions that were created: Eastern, Central Mid Atlantic, Western and the National Hansen‚Äôs disease program. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has the responsibility for managing the Consolidated Health Centers Grant Program. More recently, the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program was established in 2004. Key facts * Over 1,300 health center grant recipients operate more than 9,000 community-based clinic sites in every state and territory, giving geographically isolated or economically distressed people access to preventive and primary health care. * HRSA-supported health centers treated more than 24 million people in 2015, approximately two-thirds of whom are members of minority groups. Nearly forty percent have no health insurance; a third are children. * Since 2001, through a major expansion initiative, HRSA has increased access to primary health care in 1,375 communities through new or expanded clinical sites. During this time, health centers increased their patient base by almost 60 percent, nearly doubled the number of people receiving oral health care, and tripled the number of clients who received mental health and addiction counseling services. One of every 20 people living in the U.S. now relies on a HRSA-funded clinic for primary care, including nearly a quarter of the nation‚Äôs homeless and migrant and seasonal farmworkers. * The National Hansen‚Äôs Disease Program is the major source of direct patient care, clinician training and research in the field of Hansen‚Äôs Disease and related leprous conditions. * The Federally Supported Health Centers Assistance Act of 1992 and 1995 granted medical malpractice liability protection through the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) to HRSA-supported health centers. BPHC administers this program through its Office of Quality and Data. The Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program extends this coverage to insures physicians and other clinicians who contribute free health care services in the communities, relieving them of the burden of paying for private liability coverage.  Health Center Program  Health Centers are community-based and patient-directed organizations that serve people with limited access to health care. These include low-income patients, the uninsured, those with limited English proficiency, migrant and seasonal farmworkers, individuals and families experiencing homelessness, and those living in public housing. HRSA- supported clinics provide comprehensive, culturally competent, quality primary health care to a broadly diverse patient base that includes increasing numbers of veterans. Services include pharmacy, mental health, substance abuse and oral health treatment, as well as supportive services (education, translation, transportation and case management) that promote access to health care and ensure patient well-being. Health centers are required to be located in or serve a high-need community (a ‚Äúmedically underserved‚Äù area or population) ‚Äî and to make their services available to all patients on a sliding scale, with fees based on ability to pay. By law, health centers must be governed by community boards with majority patient representation. Looking at national numbers, Health Centers serve: * 1 in 20 individuals * 1 in 12 African- Americans * 1 in 9 Hispanic/Latinos * 1 in 8 uninsured * 1 in 7 individuals living below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level * 1 in 4 homeless individuals and migrant/seasonal farmworkers  Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program  Free clinics play a significant role in meeting the health care needs of the uninsured, particularly at a time when private physicians may be less likely to provide free care in their offices. These clinics are typically small organizations with annual budgets of less than $250,000, making them less able to afford the growing cost of malpractice coverage for those clinicians who might otherwise be willing to donate their time. The Free Clinics Program serves HRSA‚Äôs overall policy aim of expanding treatment capacity for the disadvantaged by assuring health professional volunteers that they will be protected against medical malpractice claims. To date, over 2,800 health care providers have been given federal indemnity through the program. The community health center is a nonprofit health care agency concerned with health promotion and primary prevention goals for specific populations. Populations may include the homeless, minorities, Medicaid recipients, migrant/seasonal farmworkers, persons infected with HIV/AIDS, the underinsured, and the uninsured. Community health centers are funded by the Bureau of Primary Health Care, U.S. Public Health Service, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, via grant money and are located in designated medically underserved areas. The National Association for Community Health Centers and state associations for community health centers are advocates for the local centers. Community health centers are unique in that they employ community health care specialists (e.g., family practice physicians and advanced practice nurses). They provide accessible primary care preventive health services. Their clients include the individual, family, and community; and they have a partnership relationship with the community. National Hansen's Disease Program The National Hansen's Disease Program have been providing care and treatment for Hansen's disease (leprosy) and related conditions since 1921. Currently, the National Hansen's Disease (Leprosy) Clinical Center is located at Ochsner Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It is \\"the only facility in the United States devoted to diagnosis, treatment, and research concerning Hansen's disease.\\" The Clinical Center states that it offers: {{quote|Free consultations for physicians treating complicated cases of Hansen's disease, including referrals for reconstructive hand or foot surgery. Free pathologic review of skin biopsy and consultation concerning molecular techniques for identification of M. leprae. Free antibiotics for leprosy treatment shipped to physicians. Free educational materials for healthcare professionals and patients to improve understanding of the disease, and to prevent injury and disability. Surgical care and rehabilitation for those referred for complicated (digit or limb threatening) wounds or reconstruction of correctable deformity resulting from Hansen's disease. The National Hansen's Disease (Leprosy) Research Program at the Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine in Baton Rouge is a research center that \\"conducts and supports research in the causes, diagnosis, prevention and cure of Hansen's disease and tuberculosis ‚Äî aimed at the global elimination of Hansen's disease (leprosy).\\" The research program maintains the world's only M. leprae-infected armadillo colony. Twenty-three people work at the Research Program. The program provides health care to those affected by the disease through three means of service delivery: at HRSA-run facilities in Louisiana; via a payment to a Hawaii in-patient program; or at any of 11 regional outpatient clinics under contract to the agency. The programs also support scientific research and training for health professionals at the world‚Äôs largest and most comprehensive laboratory dedicated to Hansen‚Äôs Disease. The programs are the only dedicated source of expertise, treatment and continuing education on the disease in the United States. Though Hansen's disease is very rare in the United States (there are currently only 6500 cases) there is still a widely held stigma because of the history of the disease. With current treatment methods patients become noninfectious after only a few doses of medication. Patients may continue their lives without change during treatment. This Program has led the development of the treatments for Hansen's Disease. It wasn't until the 1940s that any effective means of treating this Disease were created. \\"Guy Henry Faget, MD and his staff demonstrate the efficacy of sulfone drugs, At the end of one year, 15 of 22 patients had improved.\\"  Models that Work Campaign  The main objective of the Models That Work Campaign (MTW) is improving access to health care for vulnerable and underserved populations. The MTW Campaign is a collaboration between the Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) and 39 cosponsors including national associations, state and federal agencies, community-based organizations, foundations, and businesses. This initiative gives recognition and visibility to innovative and effective service delivery models. Models are selected based on a set of criteria that includes delivery of high quality primary care services, community participation, integration of health and social services, quantifiable outcomes, and replicability. Winners of the competition are showcased nationally and hired to provide training to other communities, to document and publish their strategies, and to provide onsite technical assistance on request. MTW staff at HRSA's Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) work in collaboration with cosponsors in national and local campaigns to publicize the innovative approaches used by MTW winners. On the federal level for example, HRSA's HIV/AIDS Bureau works with MTW staff and cosponsors to develop a series of community based workshops with MTW winners; sharing lessons and advising community leaders, clinicians, and administrators on strategies to improve primary care coordination for populations with high incidences of HIV/AIDS. Innovative strategies are often identified and incorporated into federal technical assistance initiatives and local program design as well.

He was one of the first guerrilla commanders of the Second World War in Europe. Early life and career Henryk Dobrza≈Ñski was born on 22 June 1897 in Jas≈Ço, Austria-Hungary to a Polish noble family (Coat of arms of Leliwa), of Henryk Dobrza≈Ñski de Hubal and Maria Dobrza≈Ñska n√©e Lubieniecka. In 1912 he joined the \\"Dru≈ºyny Strzeleckie\\", a Polish pro- independence youth organisation. When World War I broke out he volunteered to join J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's Polish Legions. He served with distinction in the 2nd Regiment of Uhlans and participated in many battles such as Stawczany and Battle of Rara≈Ñcza. In 1918 after Poland regained its independence he joined the Polish Army. He took part in the Polish-Ukrainian War of 1918 and fought with his cavalry platoon during the Siege of Lw√≥w. Later he participated in Polish-Bolshevik War of 1919-1921. For his bravery he was awarded the Virtuti Militari, the highest Polish military award, and four times the Krzy≈º Walecznych, in addition to many other military awards. After the Peace of Riga he remained in the Polish Army. He became a member of the Polish equestrian team, winning many international competitions. He also took part in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam and came fourth at the prestigious Aldershot competition. In his sports career he gained 22 gold, three silver and four bronze medals altogether. World War II Shortly before the 1939 Invasion of Poland he was assigned to the 110th reserve Cavalry Regiment as a deputy commander. His unit was to enter combat as a second-line formation, but fast advances of the Wehrmacht made the completion of training impossible. On 11 September it was moved to Wo≈Çkowysk, from where it marched towards Grodno and August√≥w Forest. It fought several skirmishes against the German army and took part in the defense of the city against the Red Army. After two days of heavy fighting against the numerically superior Soviets, on 20 September Grodno was lost and three days later gen. bryg. Wac≈Çaw Prze≈∫dziecki, the commander of the defense of the Grodno area, ordered all his troops to escape to neutral Lithuania. The 110th Regiment was the only unit to disobey this order. The unit joined with the remnants of several routed regiments and fought its way towards the capital Warsaw. The unit got surrounded by the Red Army in the Biebrza river area and suffered serious casualties, but managed to break through the enemy defenses. After that, Lieutenant Colonel Jerzy DƒÖbrowski, the commander of the regiment, decided his unit should disband. A group of approximately 180 men wanted to continue, and Dobrza≈Ñski took command of them and led them towards Warsaw, which was under siege. Warsaw capitulated on 27 September, before Dobrza≈Ñski and his men were able to reach it. That left him faced with three choices: disband, evacuate (via Hungary or Romania) to France, or continue the fight. Approximately 50 men volunteered to continue the fight. He led his unit southwards to try to break out and reach France. On 1 October 1939 they crossed the Vistula near Dƒôblin and started their march towards the Holy Cross Mountains. The same day his unit fought their first skirmish against the Germans. After that he decided to stay in the Kielce area with his unit and wait until the Allied relief came, which he expected in the Spring of 1940. He also swore that he would not take off his uniform until after the war. He named his force the \\"Separated Unit of the Polish Army\\" (Oddzia≈Ç Wydzielony Wojska Polskiego). On 6 October the Battle of Kock ended the resistance of the last major unit of the Polish Army. With the support of the local civilian population, Hubal and his men managed to evade the Germans. In March 1940 his unit inflicted heavy casualties on a number of German units in ambushes. The German authorities responded with reprisals against the civil population, burning several villages and killing an estimated 700 civilians. Due to these reprisals local sentiment turned against Hubal's unit, and the newly formed ZWZ became concerned that this would inhibit their ability to recruit. The ZWZ and the Government Delegate's Office at Home ordered Hubal to disband his unit. He refused to do so. Death and legacy On 30 April 1940 his staff quarters, in a ravine near the village of Anielin (powiat of Opoczno), were ambushed. In an unequal battle Dobrza≈Ñski and most of his men were killed. The Germans desecrated his body and put it on public view in the local villages. They then transported it to Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki and either burnt it or buried it in an unknown location. The remnants of the \\"Separated Unit of the Polish Army\\" continued the struggle until 25 June 1940, when it was disbanded. In 1949 Dobrza≈Ñski's son, Ludwik, emigrated to England and became a property developer. He died on 15 December 1990 in Bedford. In 1966 Henryk Dobrza≈Ñski was posthumously awarded the Golden Cross of the Virtuti Militari and promoted to Colonel. Currently almost 200 organisations and institutions bear his name, including 82 Scouting groups, 31 schools and several military units. There are streets named after him in almost every Polish city. The site of his burial remains unknown. In 1973 the film Hubal, based on his resistance campaign, was released. The pseudonym \\"Hubal\\" comes from his family coat of arms.

Probability density function Illustrating how the log of the density function changes when K = 3 as we change the vector Œ± from Œ± = (0.3, 0.3, 0.3) to (2.0, 2.0, 2.0), keeping all the individual \\\\alpha_i's equal to each other. The Dirichlet distribution of order K ‚â• 2 with parameters Œ±1, ..., Œ±K > 0 has a probability density function with respect to Lebesgue measure on the Euclidean space RK-1 given by :f \\\\left(x_1,\\\\ldots, x_{K}; \\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_K \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{B}(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha)} \\\\prod_{i=1}^K x_i^{\\\\alpha_i - 1} :where \\\\\\\\{x_k\\\\\\\\}_{k=1}^{k=K} belong to the standard K-1 simplex, or in other words: \\\\sum_{i=1}^{K} x_i = 1 \\\\mbox{ and } x_i \\\\ge 0 \\\\mbox{ for all } i \\\\in [1,K] The normalizing constant is the multivariate beta function, which can be expressed in terms of the gamma function: :\\\\mathrm{B}(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha) = \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{i=1}^K \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_i)}{\\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^K \\\\alpha_i\\\\right)},\\\\qquad\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}=(\\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_K). Support The support of the Dirichlet distribution is the set of K-dimensional vectors \\\\boldsymbol x whose entries are real numbers in the interval (0,1) such that \\\\|\\\\boldsymbol x\\\\|_1 = 1, i.e. the sum of the coordinates is equal to 1. These can be viewed as the probabilities of a K-way categorical event. Another way to express this is that the domain of the Dirichlet distribution is itself a set of probability distributions, specifically the set of K-dimensional discrete distributions. The technical term for the set of points in the support of a K-dimensional Dirichlet distribution is the open standard (K ‚àí 1)-simplex, which is a generalization of a triangle, embedded in the next-higher dimension. For example, with K = 3, the support is an equilateral triangle embedded in a downward-angle fashion in three-dimensional space, with vertices at (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1), i.e. touching each of the coordinate axes at a point 1 unit away from the origin. Special cases A common special case is the symmetric Dirichlet distribution, where all of the elements making up the parameter vector \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha have the same value. The symmetric case might be useful, for example, when a Dirichlet prior over components is called for, but there is no prior knowledge favoring one component over another. Since all elements of the parameter vector have the same value, the symmetric Dirichlet distribution can be parametrized by a single scalar value Œ±, called the concentration parameter. In terms of Œ±, the density function has the form :f(x_1,\\\\dots, x_{K-1}; \\\\alpha) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha K)}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha)^K} \\\\prod_{i=1}^K x_i^{\\\\alpha - 1}. When Œ±=1, the symmetric Dirichlet distribution is equivalent to a uniform distribution over the open standard (K ‚àí 1)-simplex, i.e. it is uniform over all points in its support. This particular distribution is known as the flat Dirichlet distribution. Values of the concentration parameter above 1 prefer variates that are dense, evenly distributed distributions, i.e. all the values within a single sample are similar to each other. Values of the concentration parameter below 1 prefer sparse distributions, i.e. most of the values within a single sample will be close to 0, and the vast majority of the mass will be concentrated in a few of the values. More generally, the parameter vector is sometimes written as the product \\\\alpha \\\\boldsymbol n of a (scalar) concentration parameter Œ± and a (vector) base measure \\\\boldsymbol n=(n_1,\\\\dots,n_K) where \\\\boldsymbol n lies within the (K ‚àí 1)-simplex (i.e.: its coordinates n_i sum to one). The concentration parameter in this case is larger by a factor of K than the concentration parameter for a symmetric Dirichlet distribution described above. This construction ties in with concept of a base measure when discussing Dirichlet processes and is often used in the topic modelling literature. : If we define the concentration parameter as the sum of the Dirichlet parameters for each dimension, the Dirichlet distribution with concentration parameter K, the dimension of the distribution, is the uniform distribution on the (K ‚àí 1)-simplex. Properties Moments Let X = (X_1, \\\\ldots, X_K)\\\\sim\\\\operatorname{Dir}(\\\\alpha). Let :\\\\alpha_0 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^K \\\\alpha_i. ThenEq. (49.9) on page 488 of Kotz, Balakrishnan & Johnson (2000). Continuous Multivariate Distributions. Volume 1: Models and Applications. New York: Wiley. : \\\\operatorname{E}[X_i] = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_i}{\\\\alpha_0}, :\\\\operatorname{Var}[X_i] = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_i (\\\\alpha_0-\\\\alpha_i)}{\\\\alpha_0^2 (\\\\alpha_0+1)}. Furthermore, if i eq j :\\\\operatorname{Cov}[X_i,X_j] = \\\\frac{- \\\\alpha_i \\\\alpha_j}{\\\\alpha_0^2 (\\\\alpha_0+1)}. The matrix so defined is singular. More generally, moments of Dirichlet-distributed random variables can be expressed as :\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left[\\\\prod_{i=1}^K X_i^{\\\\beta_i}\\\\right] = \\\\frac{B\\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}\\\\right)}{B\\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}\\\\right)} = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^K \\\\alpha_{i}\\\\right)}{\\\\Gamma\\\\left[\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^K (\\\\alpha_i+\\\\beta_i)\\\\right]}\\\\times\\\\prod_{i=1}^K \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_i+\\\\beta_i)}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_i)}. Mode The mode of the distribution is the vector (x1, ..., xK) with : x_i = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_i - 1}{\\\\alpha_0 - K}, \\\\qquad \\\\alpha_i > 1. Marginal distributions The marginal distributions are beta distributions: :X_i \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Beta} (\\\\alpha_i, \\\\alpha_0 - \\\\alpha_i). Conjugate to categorical/multinomial The Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior distribution of the categorical distribution (a generic discrete probability distribution with a given number of possible outcomes) and multinomial distribution (the distribution over observed counts of each possible category in a set of categorically distributed observations). This means that if a data point has either a categorical or multinomial distribution, and the prior distribution of the distribution's parameter (the vector of probabilities that generates the data point) is distributed as a Dirichlet, then the posterior distribution of the parameter is also a Dirichlet. Intuitively, in such a case, starting from what we know about the parameter prior to observing the data point, we then can update our knowledge based on the data point and end up with a new distribution of the same form as the old one. This means that we can successively update our knowledge of a parameter by incorporating new observations one at a time, without running into mathematical difficulties. Formally, this can be expressed as follows. Given a model :\\\\begin{array}{rcccl} \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha &=& \\\\left(\\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_K \\\\right) &=& \\\\text{concentration hyperparameter} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{p}\\\\mid\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha &=& \\\\left(p_1, \\\\ldots, p_K \\\\right ) &\\\\sim& \\\\operatorname{Dir}(K, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbb{X}\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{p} &=& \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{x}_K \\\\right ) &\\\\sim& \\\\operatorname{Cat}(K,\\\\mathbf{p}) \\\\end{array} then the following holds: :\\\\begin{array}{rcccl} \\\\mathbf{c} &=& \\\\left(c_1, \\\\ldots, c_K \\\\right ) &=& \\\\text{number of occurrences of category }i \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\mid \\\\mathbb{X},\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha &\\\\sim& \\\\operatorname{Dir}(K,\\\\mathbf{c}+\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha) &=& \\\\operatorname{Dir} \\\\left (K,c_1+\\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,c_K+\\\\alpha_K \\\\right) \\\\end{array} This relationship is used in Bayesian statistics to estimate the underlying parameter p of a categorical distribution given a collection of N samples. Intuitively, we can view the hyperprior vector Œ± as pseudocounts, i.e. as representing the number of observations in each category that we have already seen. Then we simply add in the counts for all the new observations (the vector c) in order to derive the posterior distribution. In Bayesian mixture models and other hierarchical Bayesian models with mixture components, Dirichlet distributions are commonly used as the prior distributions for the categorical variables appearing in the models. See the section on applications below for more information. Relation to Dirichlet-multinomial distribution In a model where a Dirichlet prior distribution is placed over a set of categorical-valued observations, the marginal joint distribution of the observations (i.e. the joint distribution of the observations, with the prior parameter marginalized out) is a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. This distribution plays an important role in hierarchical Bayesian models, because when doing inference over such models using methods such as Gibbs sampling or variational Bayes, Dirichlet prior distributions are often marginalized out. See the article on this distribution for more details. Entropy If X is a Dir(Œ±) random variable, the differential entropy of X (in nat units) is : h(\\\\boldsymbol X) = \\\\operatorname{E}[- \\\\ln f(\\\\boldsymbol X)] = \\\\ln \\\\operatorname{B}(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha) + (\\\\alpha_0-K)\\\\psi(\\\\alpha_0) - \\\\sum_{j=1}^K (\\\\alpha_j-1)\\\\psi(\\\\alpha_j) where \\\\psi is the digamma function. The following formula for \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\ln(X_i)] can be used to derive the differential entropy above. Since the functions \\\\ln(X_i) are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, the exponential family differential identities can be used to get an analytic expression for the expectation of \\\\ln(X_i) and its associated covariance matrix: : \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\ln(X_i)] = \\\\psi(\\\\alpha_i)-\\\\psi(\\\\alpha_0) and : \\\\operatorname{Cov}[\\\\ln(X_i),\\\\ln(X_j)] = \\\\psi'(\\\\alpha_i) \\\\delta_{ij} - \\\\psi'(\\\\alpha_0) where \\\\psi is the digamma function, \\\\psi' is the trigamma function, and \\\\delta_{ij} is the Kronecker delta. The spectrum of R√©nyi information for values other than \\\\lambda = 1 is given by :F_R(\\\\lambda) = (1-\\\\lambda)^{-1} \\\\left( - \\\\lambda \\\\log \\\\mathrm{B}(\\\\alpha) + \\\\sum_{i=1}^K \\\\log \\\\Gamma(\\\\lambda(\\\\alpha_i - 1) + 1) - \\\\log \\\\Gamma(\\\\lambda (\\\\alpha_0 -d)+d ) \\\\right) and the information entropy is the limit as \\\\lambda goes to 1. Another related interesting measure is the entropy of a discrete categorical (one-of-K binary) vector \\\\boldsymbol Z with probability-mass distribution \\\\boldsymbol X , i.e., P(Z_i=1, Z_{j e i} = 0 \\\\boldsymbol X) = X_i . The conditional information entropy of \\\\boldsymbol Z , given \\\\boldsymbol X is : S(\\\\boldsymbol X) = H(\\\\boldsymbol Z \\\\boldsymbol X) = \\\\operatorname{E}_{\\\\boldsymbol Z}[- \\\\log P(\\\\boldsymbol Z \\\\boldsymbol X ) ] = \\\\sum_{i=1}^K - X_i \\\\log X_i This function of \\\\boldsymbol X is a scalar random variable. If \\\\boldsymbol X has a symmetric Dirichlet distribution with all \\\\alpha_i = \\\\alpha, the expected value of the entropy (in nat units) is, eq. 8 : \\\\operatorname{E}[S(\\\\boldsymbol X)] = \\\\sum_{i=1}^K \\\\operatorname{E}[- X_i \\\\ln X_i] = \\\\psi(K\\\\alpha + 1) - \\\\psi(\\\\alpha + 1) Aggregation If :X = (X_1, \\\\ldots, X_K)\\\\sim\\\\operatorname{Dir}(\\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_K) then, if the random variables with subscripts i and j are dropped from the vector and replaced by their sum, :X' = (X_1, \\\\ldots, X_i + X_j, \\\\ldots, X_K)\\\\sim\\\\operatorname{Dir} (\\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_i + \\\\alpha_j, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_K). This aggregation property may be used to derive the marginal distribution of X_i mentioned above. Neutrality If X = (X_1, \\\\ldots, X_K)\\\\sim\\\\operatorname{Dir}(\\\\alpha), then the vector X is said to be neutral in the sense that XK is independent of X^{(-K)} where :X^{(-K)}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{X_1}{1-X_K},\\\\frac{X_2}{1-X_K},\\\\ldots,\\\\frac{X_{K-1}}{1-X_K} \\\\right), and similarly for removing any of X_2,\\\\ldots,X_{K-1}. Observe that any permutation of X is also neutral (a property not possessed by samples drawn from a generalized Dirichlet distribution).See Kotz, Balakrishnan & Johnson (2000), Section 8.5, \\"Connor and Mosimann's Generalization\\", pp. 519‚Äì521. Combining this with the property of aggregation it follows that Xj \\\\+ ... + XK is independent of \\\\left(\\\\frac{X_1}{X_1+\\\\cdots +X_{j-1}},\\\\frac{X_2}{X_1+\\\\cdots +X_{j-1}},\\\\ldots,\\\\frac{X_{j-1}}{X_1+\\\\cdots +X_{j-1}} \\\\right). In fact it is true, further, for the Dirichlet distribution, that for 3\\\\le j\\\\le K-1, the pair \\\\left(X_1+\\\\cdots +X_{j-1}, X_j+\\\\cdots +X_K\\\\right), and the two vectors \\\\left(\\\\frac{X_1}{X_1+\\\\cdots +X_{j-1}},\\\\frac{X_2}{X_1+\\\\cdots +X_{j-1}},\\\\ldots,\\\\frac{X_{j-1}}{X_1+\\\\cdots +X_{j-1}} \\\\right) and \\\\left(\\\\frac{X_j}{X_j+\\\\cdots +X_K},\\\\frac{X_{j+1}}{X_j+\\\\cdots +X_K},\\\\ldots,\\\\frac{X_K}{X_j+\\\\cdots +X_K} \\\\right), viewed as triple of normalised random vectors, are mutually independent. The analogous result is true for partition of the indices {1,2,...,K} into any other pair of non-singleton subsets. Characteristic function The characteristic function of the Dirichlet distribution is a confluent form of the Lauricella hypergeometric series. It is given by Phillips as : CF\\\\left(s_1,\\\\ldots,s_{K-1}\\\\right) = \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left(e^{i\\\\left(s_1X_1+\\\\cdots+s_{K-1}X_{K-1} \\\\right)} \\\\right)= \\\\Psi^{\\\\left[K-1\\\\right]} (\\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_{K-1};\\\\alpha;is_1,\\\\ldots, is_{K-1}) where \\\\alpha = \\\\alpha_1 + \\\\cdots + \\\\alpha_K and : \\\\Psi^{[m]} (a_1,\\\\ldots,a_m;c;z_1,\\\\ldots z_m) = \\\\sum\\\\frac{(a_1)_{k_1} \\\\cdots (a_m)_{k_m} \\\\, z_1^{k_1} \\\\cdots z_m^{k_m}}{(c)_k\\\\,k_1!\\\\cdots k_m!}. The sum is over non- negative integers k_1,\\\\ldots,k_m and k=k_1+\\\\cdots+k_m. Phillips goes on to state that this form is \\"inconvenient for numerical calculation\\" and gives an alternative in terms of a complex path integral: : \\\\Psi^{[m]} = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(c)}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_L e^t\\\\,t^{a_1+\\\\cdots+a_m-c}\\\\,\\\\prod_{j=1}^m (t-z_j)^{-a_j} \\\\, dt where L denotes any path in the complex plane originating at -\\\\infty, encircling in the positive direction all the singularities of the integrand and returning to -\\\\infty. Inequality Probability density function f \\\\left(x_1,\\\\ldots, x_{K-1}; \\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_K \\\\right) plays a key role in a multifunctional inequality which implies various bounds for the Dirichlet distribution. Related distributions For K independently distributed Gamma distributions: : Y_1 \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Gamma}(\\\\alpha_1, \\\\theta), \\\\ldots, Y_K \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Gamma}(\\\\alpha_K, \\\\theta) we have: :V=\\\\sum_{i=1}^K Y_i\\\\sim\\\\operatorname{Gamma} \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^K\\\\alpha_i, \\\\theta \\\\right ), :X = (X_1, \\\\ldots, X_K) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{Y_1}{V}, \\\\ldots, \\\\frac{Y_K}{V} \\\\right)\\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Dir}\\\\left (\\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_K \\\\right). Although the Xis are not independent from one another, they can be seen to be generated from a set of K independent gamma random variable. Unfortunately, since the sum V is lost in forming X (in fact it can be shown that V is stochastically independent of X), it is not possible to recover the original gamma random variables from these values alone. Nevertheless, because independent random variables are simpler to work with, this reparametrization can still be useful for proofs about properties of the Dirichlet distribution. Conjugate prior of the Dirichlet distribution Because the Dirichlet distribution is an exponential family distribution it has a conjugate prior. The conjugate prior is of the form: :\\\\operatorname{CD}(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha \\\\mid \\\\boldsymbol{v},\\\\eta) \\\\propto \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\operatorname{B}(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha)}\\\\right)^\\\\eta \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\sum_k v_k \\\\alpha_k\\\\right). Here \\\\boldsymbol{v} is a K-dimensional real vector and \\\\eta is a scalar parameter. The domain of (\\\\boldsymbol{v},\\\\eta) is restricted to the set of parameters for which the above unnormalized density function can be normalized. The (necessary and sufficient) condition is: : \\\\forall k\\\\;\\\\;v_k>0\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\text{ and } \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\eta>-1 \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\text{ and } \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;(\\\\eta\\\\leq0\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\text{ or }\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\sum_k \\\\exp-\\\\frac{v_k} \\\\eta < 1) The conjugation property can be expressed as : if [prior: \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}\\\\sim\\\\operatorname{CD}(\\\\cdot \\\\mid \\\\boldsymbol{v},\\\\eta)] and [observation: \\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\mid\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}\\\\sim\\\\operatorname{Dirichlet}(\\\\cdot \\\\mid \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha})] then [posterior: \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}\\\\mid\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\sim\\\\operatorname{CD}(\\\\cdot \\\\mid \\\\boldsymbol{v}-\\\\log \\\\boldsymbol{x}, \\\\eta+1)]. In the published literature there is no practical algorithm to efficiently generate samples from \\\\operatorname{CD}(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha} \\\\mid \\\\boldsymbol{v},\\\\eta). Applications Dirichlet distributions are most commonly used as the prior distribution of categorical variables or multinomial variables in Bayesian mixture models and other hierarchical Bayesian models. (In many fields, such as in natural language processing, categorical variables are often imprecisely called \\"multinomial variables\\". Such a usage is unlikely to cause confusion, just as when Bernoulli distributions and binomial distributions are commonly conflated.) Inference over hierarchical Bayesian models is often done using Gibbs sampling, and in such a case, instances of the Dirichlet distribution are typically marginalized out of the model by integrating out the Dirichlet random variable. This causes the various categorical variables drawn from the same Dirichlet random variable to become correlated, and the joint distribution over them assumes a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution, conditioned on the hyperparameters of the Dirichlet distribution (the concentration parameters). One of the reasons for doing this is that Gibbs sampling of the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution is extremely easy; see that article for more information. Random number generation Gamma distribution With a source of Gamma-distributed random variates, one can easily sample a random vector x=(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_K) from the K-dimensional Dirichlet distribution with parameters (\\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_K) . First, draw K independent random samples y_1, \\\\ldots, y_K from Gamma distributions each with density : \\\\operatorname{Gamma}(\\\\alpha_i, 1) = \\\\frac{y_i^{\\\\alpha_i-1} \\\\; e^{-y_i}}{\\\\Gamma (\\\\alpha_i)}, \\\\\\\\! and then set :x_i = \\\\frac{y_i}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^K y_j}. Proof The joint distribution of \\\\\\\\{y_{i}\\\\\\\\} is given by: : e^{-\\\\sum_{i}y_{i}} \\\\prod _{i=1}^{K} \\\\frac{y_{i}^{\\\\alpha _{i}-1}}{\\\\Gamma (\\\\alpha _{i})} Next, one uses a change of variables, parametrising \\\\\\\\{y_{i}\\\\\\\\} in terms of y_{1}, y_{2}, \\\\ldots , y_{K-1} and \\\\sum _{i=1}^{K}y_{i} , and performs a change of variables from y \\\\to x such that x_{K} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{K}y_{i} , x_{1} = \\\\frac{y_{1}}{x_{K}}, x_{2} = \\\\frac{y_{2}}{x_{K}}, \\\\ldots , x_{K-1} = \\\\frac{y_{K-1}}{x_{K}} One must then use the change of variables formula, P(x) = P(y(x))\\\\bigg|\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial x}\\\\biggin which \\\\bigg|\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial x}\\\\biggis the transformation Jacobian. Writing y explicitly as a function of x, one obtains y_{1} = x_{K}x_{1}, y_{2} = x_{K}x_{2} \\\\ldots y_{K-1} = x_{K-1}x_{K}, y_{K} = x_{K}(1-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{K-1}x_{i}) The Jacobian now looks like :\\\\begin{vmatrix}x_{K} & 0 & \\\\ldots & x_{1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & x_{K} & \\\\ldots & x_{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ -x_{K} & -x_{K} & \\\\ldots & 1-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{K-1}x_{i} \\\\end{vmatrix} The determinant can be evaluated by noting that it remains unchanged if multiples of a row are added to another row, and adding each of the first K-1 rows to the bottom row to obtain :\\\\begin{vmatrix}x_{K} & 0 & \\\\ldots & x_{1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & x_{K} & \\\\ldots & x_{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\ldots & 1 \\\\end{vmatrix} which can be expanded about the bottom row to obtain x_{K}^{K-1} Substituting for x in the joint pdf and including the Jacobian, one obtains: :\\\\frac{\\\\left[\\\\prod _{i=1}^{K-1}(x_{i}x_{K})^{\\\\alpha _{i}-1} \\\\right] \\\\left[x_{K}(1-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{K-1}x_{i})\\\\right]^{\\\\alpha_{K}-1}}{\\\\prod _{i=1}^{K}\\\\Gamma (\\\\alpha _{i})}x_{K}^{K-1}e^{-x_{K}} Each of the variables 0 \\\\leq x_{1}, x_{2}, \\\\ldots , x_{k-1} \\\\leq 1 and likewise 0 \\\\leq \\\\sum _{i=1}^{K-1}x_{i} \\\\leq 1 . Finally, integrate out the extra degree of freedom x_{K} and one obtains: : x_{1}, x_{2}, \\\\ldots, x_{K-1} \\\\sim \\\\frac{(1-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{K-1}x_{i})^{\\\\alpha _{K}-1}\\\\prod _{i=1}^{K-1}x_{i}^{\\\\alpha _{i} -1}}{B(\\\\underline{\\\\alpha})} Which is equivalent to : \\\\frac{\\\\prod _{i=1}^{K} x_{i}^{\\\\alpha_{i}-1}}{B(\\\\underline{\\\\alpha})} with support \\\\sum_{i=1}^{K}x_{i}=1 Below is example Python code to draw the sample: params = [a1, a2, ..., ak] sample = [random.gammavariate(a, 1) for a in params] sample = [v / sum(sample) for v in sample] This formulation is correct regardless of how the Gamma distributions are parameterized (shape/scale vs. shape/rate) because they are equivalent when scale and rate equal 1.0. Marginal beta distributions A less efficient algorithm relies on the univariate marginal and conditional distributions being beta and proceeds as follows. Simulate x_1 from : \\\\textrm{Beta}\\\\left(\\\\alpha_1, \\\\sum_{i=2}^K \\\\alpha_i \\\\right) Then simulate x_2, \\\\ldots, x_{K-1} in order, as follows. For j=2, \\\\ldots, K-1, simulate \\\\phi_j from :\\\\textrm{Beta} \\\\left(\\\\alpha_j, \\\\sum_{i=j+1}^K \\\\alpha_i \\\\right ), and let :x_j= \\\\left(1-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i \\\\right )\\\\phi_j. Finally, set :x_K=1-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{K-1} x_i. This iterative procedure corresponds closely to the \\"string cutting\\" intuition described below. Below is example Python code to draw the sample: params = [a1, a2, ..., ak] xs = [random.betavariate(params[0], sum(params[1:]))] for j in range(1, len(params) - 1): phi = random.betavariate(params[j], sum(params[j + 1 :])) xs.append((1 - sum(xs)) * phi) xs.append(1 - sum(xs)) Intuitive interpretations of the parameters The concentration parameter Dirichlet distributions are very often used as prior distributions in Bayesian inference. The simplest and perhaps most common type of Dirichlet prior is the symmetric Dirichlet distribution, where all parameters are equal. This corresponds to the case where you have no prior information to favor one component over any other. As described above, the single value Œ± to which all parameters are set is called the concentration parameter. If the sample space of the Dirichlet distribution is interpreted as a discrete probability distribution, then intuitively the concentration parameter can be thought of as determining how \\"concentrated\\" the probability mass of a sample from a Dirichlet distribution is likely to be. With a value much less than 1, the mass will be highly concentrated in a few components, and all the rest will have almost no mass. With a value much greater than 1, the mass will be dispersed almost equally among all the components. See the article on the concentration parameter for further discussion. String cutting One example use of the Dirichlet distribution is if one wanted to cut strings (each of initial length 1.0) into K pieces with different lengths, where each piece had a designated average length, but allowing some variation in the relative sizes of the pieces. The Œ±/Œ±0 values specify the mean lengths of the cut pieces of string resulting from the distribution. The variance around this mean varies inversely with Œ±0. Example of Dirichlet(1/2,1/3,1/6) distribution P√≥lya's urn Consider an urn containing balls of K different colors. Initially, the urn contains Œ±1 balls of color 1, Œ±2 balls of color 2, and so on. Now perform N draws from the urn, where after each draw, the ball is placed back into the urn with an additional ball of the same color. In the limit as N approaches infinity, the proportions of different colored balls in the urn will be distributed as Dir(Œ±1,...,Œ±K). For a formal proof, note that the proportions of the different colored balls form a bounded [0,1]K-valued martingale, hence by the martingale convergence theorem, these proportions converge almost surely and in mean to a limiting random vector. To see that this limiting vector has the above Dirichlet distribution, check that all mixed moments agree. Each draw from the urn modifies the probability of drawing a ball of any one color from the urn in the future. This modification diminishes with the number of draws, since the relative effect of adding a new ball to the urn diminishes as the urn accumulates increasing numbers of balls.

Modernization refers to a model of a progressive transition from a 'pre-modern' or 'traditional' to a 'modern' society. Modernization theory originated from the ideas of German sociologist Max Weber (1864‚Äì1920), which provided the basis for the modernization paradigm developed by Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons (1902‚Äì1979). The theory looks at the internal factors of a country while assuming that with assistance, \\"traditional\\" countries can be brought to development in the same manner more developed countries have been. Modernization theory was a dominant paradigm in the social sciences in the 1950s and 1960s, then went into a deep eclipse. It made a comeback after 1991 but remains a controversial model. Modernization theory both attempts to identify the social variables that contribute to social progress and development of societies and seeks to explain the process of social evolution. Modernization theory is subject to criticism originating among socialist and free-market ideologies, world-systems theorists, globalization theorists and dependency theorists among others. Modernization theory stresses not only the process of change but also the responses to that change. It also looks at internal dynamics while referring to social and cultural structures and the adaptation of new technologies. Modernization theory suggests that traditional societies will develop as they adopt more modern practices. Proponents of modernization theory claim that modern states are wealthier and more powerful and that their citizens are freer to enjoy a higher standard of living. Developments such as new data technology and the need to update traditional methods in transport, communication and production, it is argued, make modernization necessary or at least preferable to the status quo. That view makes critique difficult since it implies that such developments control the limits of human interaction, not vice versa. And yet, seemingly paradoxically, it also implies that human agency controls the speed and severity of modernization. Supposedly, instead of being dominated by tradition, societies undergoing the process of modernization typically arrive at forms of governance dictated by abstract principles. Traditional religious beliefs and cultural traits, according to the theory, usually become less important as modernization takes hold. Today, the concept of modernization is understood in three different meanings: 1) as the internal development of Western Europe and North America relating to the European New Era; 2) as a process by which countries that do not belong to the first group of countries, aim to catch up with them; 3) as processes of evolutionary development of the most modernized societies (Western Europe and North America), i.e. modernization as a permanent process, carried out through reform and innovation, which today means a transition to a postindustrial society. Historians link modernization to the processes of urbanization and industrialization and the spread of education. As Kendall (2007) notes, \\"Urbanization accompanied modernization and the rapid process of industrialization.\\" In sociological critical theory, modernization is linked to an overarching process of rationalisation. When modernization increases within a society, the individual becomes increasingly important, eventually replacing the family or community as the fundamental unit of society. It is also a subject taught in traditional Advanced Placement World History classes. Origins The current modernization theory originated with the ideas of German sociologist Max Weber (1864‚Äì1920) regarding the role of rationality and irrationality in the transition from traditional to modern society. Weber's approach provided the basis for the modernization paradigm as popularized by Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons (1902‚Äì1979), who translated Weber's works into English in the 1930s and provided his own interpretation. After 1945 the Parsonian version became widely used in sociology and other social sciences. By the late 1960s opposition developed because the theory was too general and did not fit all societies in quite the same way.  Globalization and modernization  Globalization can be defined as the integration of economic, political and social cultures. It is argued that globalization is related to the spreading of modernization across borders. Global trade has grown continuously since the European discovery of new continents in the Early modern period; it increased particularly as a result of the Industrial Revolution and the mid-20th century adoption of the shipping container. Annual trans-border tourist arrivals rose to 456 million by 1990 and almost tripled since, reaching a total of over 1.2 billion in 2016.(Knowles, 1994: FT, 7 January 1997: V11) Communication is another major area that has grown due to modernization. Communication industries have enabled capitalism to spread throughout the world. Telephony, television broadcasts, news services and online service providers have played a crucial part in globalization. Former U.S president Lyndon B. Johnson was a supporter of the modernization theory and believed that television had potential to provide educational tools in development. With the many apparent positive attributes to globalization there are also negative consequences. The dominant, neoliberal model of globalization often increases disparities between a society's rich and its poor. In major cities of developing countries there exist pockets where technologies of the modernised world, computers, cell phones and satellite television, exist alongside stark poverty. Globalists are globalization modernization theorists and argue that globalization is positive for everyone, as its benefits must eventually extend to all members of society, including vulnerable groups such as women and children.  Democratization and modernization  The relationship between modernization and democracy is one of the most researched studies in comparative politics. There is academic debate over the drivers of democracy because there are theories that support economic growth as both a cause and effect of the institution of democracy. ‚ÄúLipset‚Äôs observation that democracy is related to economic development, first advanced in 1959, has generated the largest body of research on any topic in comparative politics,‚ÄùPrzeworski and Limongi, 1997. Larry Diamond and Juan Linz, who worked with Lipset in the book, Democracy in Developing Countries: Latin America, argue that economic performance affects the development of democracy in at least three ways. First, they argue that economic growth is more important for democracy than given levels of socioeconomic development. Second, socioeconomic development generates social changes that can potentially facilitate democratization. Third, socioeconomic development promotes other changes, like organization of the middle class, which is conducive to democracy. As Seymour Martin Lipset put it, \\"All the various aspects of economic development‚Äîindustrialization, urbanization, wealth and education‚Äîare so closely interrelated as to form one major factor which has the political correlate of democracy\\". The argument also appears in Walt W. Rostow, Politics and the Stages of Growth (1971); A. F. K. Organski, The Stages of Political Development (1965); and David Apter, The Politics of Modernization (1965). In the 1960s, some critics argued that the link between modernization and democracy was based too much on the example of European history and neglected the Third World. Recent demonstrations of the emergence of democracy in South Korea, Taiwan and South Africa have been cited as support for Lipset's thesis. One historical problem with that argument has always been Germany whose economic modernization in the 19th century came long before the democratization after 1918. Berman, however, concludes that a process of democratization was underway in Imperial Germany, for \\"during these years Germans developed many of the habits and mores that are now thought by political scientists to augur healthy political development\\". Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel contend that the realization of democracy is not based solely on an expressed desire for that form of government, but democracies are born as a result of the admixture of certain social and cultural factors. They argue the ideal social and cultural conditions for the foundation of a democracy are born of significant modernization and economic development that result in mass political participation. Peerenboom explores the relationships among democracy, the rule of law and their relationship to wealth by pointing to examples of Asian countries, such as Taiwan and South Korea, which have successfully democratized only after economic growth reached relatively high levels and to examples of countries such as the Philippines, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia and India, which sought to democratize at lower levels of wealth but have not done as well. He suggests China will grant democratic rights when it is as modern and as rich as the West per capita. Adam Przeworski and others have challenged Lipset's argument. They say political regimes do not transition to democracy as per capita incomes rise. Rather, democratic transitions occur randomly, but once there, countries with higher levels of gross domestic product per capita remain democratic. Epstein et al. (2006) retest the modernization hypothesis using new data, new techniques, and a three-way, rather than dichotomous, classification of regimes. Contrary to Przeworski, this study finds that the modernization hypothesis stands up well. Partial democracies emerge as among the most important and least understood regime types. Highly contentious is the idea that modernization implies more human rights, with China in the 21st century being a major test case. Technology New technology is a major source of social change. (Social change refers to any significant alteration over time in behaviour patterns and cultural values and norms.) Since modernization entails the social transformation from agrarian societies to industrial ones, it is important to look at the technological viewpoint; however, new technologies do not change societies by itself. Rather, it is the response to technology that causes change. Frequently, technology is recognized but not put to use for a very long time such as the ability to extract metal from rock Although that initially went unused, it later had profound implications for the developmental course of societies. Technology makes it possible for a more innovative society and broad social change. That dramatic change through the centuries that has evolved socially, industrially, and economically, can be summed up by the term modernization. Cell phones, for example, have changed the lives of millions throughout the world. That is especially true in Africa and other parts of the Middle East, where there is a low-cost communication infrastructure. With cell phone technology, widely dispersed populations are connected, which facilitates business-to-business communication and provides internet access to remoter areas, with a consequential rise in literacy. Development and modernization Development, like modernization, has become the orienting principle of modern times. Countries that are seen as modern are also seen as developed, which means that they are generally more respected by institutions such as the United Nations and even as possible trade partners for other countries. The extent to which a country has modernized or developed dictates its power and importance on the international level. Modernization of the health sector of developing nations recognizes that transitioning from 'traditional' to 'modern' is not merely the advancement in technology and the introduction of Western practices; implementing modern healthcare requires the reorganization of political agenda and, in turn, an increase in funding by feeders and resources towards public health. However, rather than replicating the stages of developed nations, whose roots of modernization are found with the context of industrialization or colonialism, underdeveloped nations should apply proximal interventions to target rural communities and focus on prevention strategies rather than curative solutions. That has been successfully exhibited by the Christian Medical Commission and in China through 'barefoot doctors'. Additionally, a strong advocate of the DE-emphasis of medical institutions was Halfdan T. Mahler, the WHO General Director from 1973 to 1988. Related ideas have been proposed at international conferences such as Alma-Ats and the \\"Health and Population in Development\\" conference, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation in Italy in 1979, and selective primary healthcare and GOBI were discussed (although they have both been strongly criticized by supporters of comprehensive healthcare). Overall, however, this is not to say that the nations of the Global South can function independently from Western states; significant funding is received from well- intention programs, foundations, and charities that target epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis that have substantially improved the lives of millions of people and impeded future development. Modernization theorists often saw traditions as obstacles to economic growth. According to Seymour Martin Lipset, economic conditions are heavily determined by the cultural, social values present in that given society. Furthermore, while modernization might deliver violent, radical change for traditional societies, it was thought worth the price. Critics insist that traditional societies were often destroyed without ever gaining the promised advantages if, among other things, the economic gap between advanced societies and such societies actually increased. The net effect of modernization for some societies was therefore the replacement of traditional poverty by a more modern form of misery, according to these critics. Others point to improvements in living standards, physical infrastructure, education and economic opportunity to refute such criticisms. Applications United States foreign aid in the 1960s President John F. Kennedy (1961‚Äì63) relied on economists W.W. Rostow on his staff and outsider John Kenneth Galbraith for ideas on how to promote rapid economic development in the \\"Third World\\", as it was called at the time. They promoted modernization models in order to reorient American aid to Asia, Africa and Latin America. In the Rostow version in his The Stages of Economic Growth (1960) progress must pass through five stages, and for underdeveloped world the critical stages were the second one, the transition, the third stage, the takeoff into self-sustaining growth. Rostow argued that American intervention could propel a country from the second to the third stage he expected that once it reached maturity, it would have a large energized middle class that would establish democracy and civil liberties and institutionalize human rights. The result was a comprehensive theory that could be used to challenge Marxist ideologies, and thereby repel communist advances. Diane B. Kunz, Butter and guns: America's Cold War economic diplomacy (1997) pp. 125‚Äì28. The model provided the foundation for the Alliance for Progress in Latin America, the Peace Corps, Food for Peace, and the Agency for International Development (AID). Kennedy proclaimed the 1960s the \\"Development Decade\\" and substantially increased the budget for foreign assistance. Modernization theory supplied the design, rationale, and justification for these programs. The goals proved much too ambitious, and the economists in a few years abandoned the European-based modernization model as inappropriate to the cultures they were trying to impact.Amanda Kay McVety, \\"JFK and Modernization Theory,‚Äù in Andrew Hoberek, ed., The Cambridge Companion to John F. Kennedy (2015) pp. 103‚Äì17 online Michael E. Latham, Modernization as Ideology: American Social Science and 'Nation Building' in the Kennedy Era (2000). online Kennedy and his top advisers were working from implicit ideological assumptions regarding modernization. They firmly believed modernity was not only good for the target populations, but was essential to avoid communism on the one hand or extreme control of traditional rural society by the very rich landowners on the other. They believed America had a duty, as the most modern country in the world, to promulgate this ideal to the poor nations of the Third World. They wanted programs that were altruistic, and benevolent‚Äîand also tough, energetic, and determined. It was benevolence with a foreign policy purpose. Michael Latham has identified how this ideology worked out in three major programs the Alliance for Progress, the Peace Corps, and the strategic hamlet program in South Vietnam. However, Latham argues that the ideology was a non-coercive version of the modernization goals of the imperialistic of Britain, France and other European countries in the 19th century . Michael E. Latham, Modernization as Ideology. American Social Science and \\"Nation Building\\" in the Kennedy Era‚Äô‚Äô (2000). Criticism From the 1970s, modernization theory has been criticized by numerous scholars, including Andre Gunder Frank (1929‚Äì2005) and Immanuel Wallerstein (1930-2019). In this model, the modernization of a society required the destruction of the indigenous culture and its replacement by a more Westernized one. By one definition, modern simply refers to the present, and any society still in existence is therefore modern. Proponents of modernization typically view only Western society as being truly modern and argue that others are primitive or unevolved by comparison. That view sees unmodernized societies as inferior even if they have the same standard of living as western societies. Opponents argue that modernity is independent of culture and can be adapted to any society. Japan is cited as an example by both sides. Some see it as proof that a thoroughly modern way of life can exist in a non western society. Others argue that Japan has become distinctly more western as a result of its modernization. As Tipps has argued, by conflating modernization with other processes, with which theorists use interchangeably (democratization, liberalization, development), the term becomes imprecise and therefore difficult to disprove. The theory has also been criticised empirically, as modernization theorists ignore external sources of change in societies. The binary between traditional and modern is unhelpful, as the two are linked and often interdependent, and 'modernization' does not come as a whole. Modernization theory has also been accused of being Eurocentric, as modernization began in Europe, with the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution and the Revolutions of 1848 and has long been regarded as reaching its most advanced stage in Europe. Anthropologists typically make their criticism one step further and say that the view is ethnocentric and is specific to Western culture. Dependency theory One alternative model on the left is Dependency theory. It emerged in the 1950s and argues that the underdevelopment of poor nations in the Third World derived from systematic imperial and neo-colonial exploitation of raw materials.Abhijeet Paul, \\"Dependency theory.\\" in John Mackenzie, ed. The Encyclopedia of Empire (2016) Its proponents argue that resources typically flow from a \\"periphery\\" of poor and underdeveloped states to a \\"core\\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theorists such as Andre Gunder Frank that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the \\"world system\\". Dependency models arose from a growing association of southern hemisphere nationalists (from Latin America and Africa) and Marxists. It was their reaction against modernization theory, which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today's underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and structures of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy.Newschool, \\"Economic Development\\" , retrieved July 2009.

The m/45 was the standard submachine gun of the Swedish Army from 1945 to 1965. It was gradually replaced in Swedish service by updated Ak 4 battle rifles and Ak 5 assault rifles. The last official user of the m/45, the Swedish Home Guard (Hemv√§rnet), retired it from service in April 2007.Milit√§r historia #10 2017, Bonniers f√∂rlag. Published 15 August 2019. The m/45 SMG was developed in 1944‚Äì45, with a design borrowing from and also improving on many design elements of earlier submachine guns. The sheet metal stamping techniques used in making the German MP 40, the British Sten, and the Soviet PPSh-41 and PPS-43 were studied in detail. Two designs were tested in 1944, one from Carl Gustafs Stads Gev√§rsfaktori and one from Husqvarna Vapenfabriks and the prototype from Carl Gustafs Stads Gev√§rsfaktori was chosen for further development. The first production version was adopted in 1945 as the Kpist m/45. The Danish Hovea M/49 SMG, although similar in appearance, is not a version derived from the m/45. The Hovea was a development of the failed test contender (fm44) from Husqvarna. Features 275x275px The standard m/45 is a fully-automatic-only weapon without any option for semi-automatic fire. It weighs 3.3 kg (7.3 lbs.) unloaded, and 4.2 kg (9.25 lbs.) loaded with a 36-round box magazine. It is 808 mm (31.8 in.) long with the stock extended, and 550 mm (21.7 in.) long with the stock folded. The m/45 is an open bolt design with a fixed firing pin. The relatively slow cyclic rate of fire (550‚Äì600 rds/min.) and low recoil of the bolt-mechanism actuation (straight blowback) makes it easy to control during full automatic fire. Single shots are also easy to achieve (with very little training) by letting go of the trigger before another round is cycled. The m/45 is fairly accurate up to 200 meters. Accessories include a special sub-calibre barrel (painted silver) for firing blanks and low-powered gallery ammunition. When firing blanks, a cone shaped blank firing adapter must be attached to the threaded muzzle of the sub-calibre barrel (and secured by a clip) to ensure the mechanism has adequate pressure for its blowback operation. Other accessories include night sights (wartime use only) that attach to the fixed day sights (f: protected post, r: L-type), a brass catcher for collecting spent cartridges (peacetime use only, for reloading and recycling), a quick-detachable (by attached cord) ejection port cover (painted bright red) for guard duty which secures the bolt from accidental firing, and a magazine loader that loads a magazine from a cartridge tray in seconds. The m/45 was also issued with a standard cleaning kit containing a threaded cleaning rod, threaded jag and a container for the jag, lubricant and cleaning patches. The standard sling issued was made of leather, attached to the rear left receiver and left barrel-sleeve sling bars. The 36-round straight detachable staggered row box magazine is wider at the rear than at the front, the extra space allows the tapered 9mm Parabellum cartridges to feed more efficiently. The trapezium design makes the magazine very reliable in dusty environments and sub-zero temperatures, because magazines of parallel-side design are more likely to jam under adverse conditions. The magazine was used post-war by Finland in the m/31 Suomi under the designation m/54, a distinguishing feature of the variation m/55 (made by Lapua) is a steel wire carrying loop mounted at the bottom front edge. The basic design idea of the m/45 magazine was also used for the magazines of the Czech model 23 and model 25 and the French MAS submachine guns. The m/45 has no safety switch. Instead the m/45 is put in \\"safe\\" by sliding the cocking handle into a short side-slot above the main (lock) slot. In the example US Army photograph, this short safety side-slot is visible behind the rear L-sight. When the m/45 is unloaded the bolt is locked in place in the bolt- forward position by pushing the cocking handle inwards, engaging a hole in the lower left receiver wall. Variants * First production: the SMG models Kpist m/45 and Kpist m/45S (integrated suppressor, never used in Sweden) featured a detachable (via removable clip) magazine support. It accepted the kpist m/37-39 50-round \\"coffin\\" magazine and the later standard 36-round box magazine. Retrieved 17 March 2008. The m/45 had a dark gun metal finish. * General production: the m/45B model features a fixed magazine support, smaller holes in the barrel shroud, a strengthened bolt buffer (in the receiver-rear), and a hook securing the buffer cap in place. Early m/45B models had the same metal finish as the m/45 but most had a dull green lacquer finish. Over time, most first production m/45's were converted by permanently riveting the magazine support to the receiver.The submachine guns of Sweden. * UN/ONU and Ceremonial: the m/45C is an m/45B with a bayonet mount on the barrel sleeve which was used for parade and guard duties. During the Congo Crisis in the 1960s, the Swedish UN forces used the C version extensively. The standard m/45 and m/45B have no bayonet mount. * Police: The Swedish Police used the m/45 as a reinforcement weapon, issued to specially trained police officers under exceptional circumstances like terrorist attacks and armed robberies. Unlike the military model it was equipped with a selector switch for full auto or semi-auto fire. The police model designation was m/45BE (E = enkelskott/single-shot) and BET (T = t√•rgas/tear gas). The BET model was later locked to semi-auto with a screw to the selector switch. The Police model had an all black finish, this in contrast to the slate grey phosphate and enamel green of the military versions. In the mid to late 70's the BE version was retrofitted with a modified stock (m/75) with a removable upper cheekpiece allowing the operator to wear a visored riot protection helmet (Huvudskydd m/69). The BET model was only used to fire a tear gas canister (T√•rgaskastspray m/74). To be able to fire the canister, a special blank cartridge (9mm l√∂s ptr m / T) had to be used. A red sticker on the left side of the weapon reminded the operator that only blank ammunition could be used. The BET also had a high front sight and an adjustable rear sight (30, 45 and 60 meters). The m/45 BET was replaced by Heckler & Koch MZP-1 (HP 40) in the early /mid 1990s because it was regarded unfashionable and also because new tear gas canisters became hard to obtain since they contained the hazardous substance: Freon-12. Manufacture and use The Kpist m/45 in service (left) with Swedish soldiers during the Congo Crisis. The Swedish Army list price of the Carl Gustaf m/45 in the late 1970s was around Swedish krona (SEK) 600 (US$67).600 SEK Swedish Krona to USD US Dollar conversion The Carl Gustaf m/45 was replaced in the Swedish Armed Forces during the mid-1960s with the 7.62mm Ak 4 battle rifle, and starting in 1986 with the 5.56mm Ak 5 assault rifle. On 2 April 2007 kpist m/45 was officially declared obsolete when it was retired from the Home Guard who were the last users in the Swedish Armed Forces.[sv:Kulsprutepistol m/45] In addition to Sweden, several other countries have used the weapon, with versions of the weapon being produced in Egypt and the United States. Licensed production in Egypt A Carl Gustaf m/45, probably a Port Said variant, seized in 2016 during the Northern Mali conflict. The m/45 has been manufactured under license in Egypt as the Port Said and the Akaba. The tooling needed for production, as well as technical assistance, was sold by Sweden to Egypt during the 1950s. The Port Said looks and functions exactly as the m/45 (first version while the Akaba is a modified and simplified version). The Akaba has no barrel jacket and a slightly shorter barrel and the folding butt stock has been replaced by a telescoping wire butt stock similar to the one used on the US M3A1. The simplified sights of the Akaba were moved to the front (unprotected post) and back (protected peep) of the receiver. Use by the United States in Southeast Asia During the Vietnam War, the US Navy SEALs used the m/45 extensively. One of the gun's qualities which appealed to the US Navy was that the m/45 can fire almost immediately out of the water (over the beach). It also saw use by CIA operatives and advisers. In US service it was largely known as the \\"Swedish-K\\" or \\"K-Rifle\\". The US Navy was so impressed by the m/45 that when Sweden embargoed the export of weapons to the United States in 1966, Smith & Wesson was given the task of producing a copy. This was designated the Smith & Wesson M76. However, by the time the M76 was ready for combat deployment, the US Navy interest had largely evaporated.World Guns' Smith & Wesson SW76 Many of the m/45s used by US forces and agencies were devoid of markings, implying clandestine use (\\"sanitized\\").

She was later transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS Georgetown (I-40), to the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS Georgetown, and then to the Soviet Navy as Doblestny (or Zhyostky; sources vary). She was the last \\"four piper\\" destroyer to be scrapped.  Construction and career   United States Navy service  Named for William A. T. Maddox, she was laid down on 20 July 1918 by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachusetts. The ship was launched on 27 October 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Clarence N. Hinkamp, granddaughter of Captain Maddox. Maddox was commissioned on 10 March 1919, Comdr. Edward C. S. Parker in command. On 17 July 1920 she was designated DD-168. Assigned to Division 21, Atlantic Fleet, Maddox departed Boston 3 May 1919 for Trepassey, Newfoundland, en route to the Azores where she became part of a \\"bridge of ships\\" assigned to guide US Navy flying boats NC-1 and NC-4 across the ocean on the first transatlantic flight. Returning to Boston on 22 May, the destroyer operated out of there until she sailed for Europe on 26 August 1919. Arriving at Brest, France on 19 September, she soon joined an honor escort for , then bound for Ostend, Belgium, to embark the Belgian King and Queen for the United States. Detached on 25 September, Maddox commenced cross-channel service. Until 24 October she escorted ships and carried naval and Army passengers from Dover and Harwich to Boulogne, France, and the Hook of Holland. Departing Harwich on 25 October, the four stacker proceeded through Kiel Canal to visit various Baltic ports. Returning to the United States on 12 February 1920, Maddox operated out of Boston for the next 2 years, off the east coast. Departing Boston on 25 February 1922 for Philadelphia, she decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 14 June 1922. Inactive for the next 18 years, Maddox recommissioned on 17 June 1940. After brief duty on mid- Atlantic Neutrality Patrol, she departed Newport, Rhode Island on 16 September 1940 for Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she decommissioned on 23 September 1940. The same day, under the destroyer-naval base agreement, she was transferred to Great Britain and commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS Georgetown.  Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy service  As Georgetown, she participated in operation ‚ÄúBowery‚Äù, escorting the aircraft carrier in May 1942 on her second reinforcement of the Supermarine Spitfire strength on the island of Malta. In September 1942, she transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy for convoy escort duties in the western Atlantic. Georgetown was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4\\"/50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of Hedgehog anti-submarine launcher.Lenton & Colledge (1968) p.91 Returned to the United Kingdom in December 1943, she joined the Reserve Fleet.

The full family of Landau distributions is obtained by extending the original distribution to a location-scale family of stable distributions with parameters \\\\alpha=1 and \\\\beta=1 , with characteristic function: :\\\\varphi(t;\\\\mu,c)=\\\\exp\\\\left(it\\\\mu -\\\\tfrac{2ict}{\\\\pi}\\\\log|t|-c|t|\\\\right) where c\\\\in(0,\\\\infty) and \\\\mu\\\\in(-\\\\infty,\\\\infty), which yields a density function: :p(x;\\\\mu,c) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi c}\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-t}\\\\cos\\\\left(t\\\\left(\\\\frac{x-\\\\mu}{c}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{2t}{\\\\pi}\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{t}{c}\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\, dt , Let us note that the original form of p(x) is obtained for \\\\mu=0 and c=\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}, while the following is an approximation of p(x;\\\\mu,c) for \\\\mu=0 and c=1: :p(x) \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{x + e^{-x}}{2}\\\\right).

The reduction in size makes it neater still.\\" They were mainly developed for, and sold in, the Japanese domestic market, in part due to the tougher motorcycle drivers' license restrictions in Japan at the time for bike exceeding 400cc. Outside Japan, the VFR400R (NC30) was officially imported to the United Kingdom for four years, but with a price tag of ¬£5899Performance Bikes, March 1990, p. 8:\\"Of course, being well-informed, you already know about the ¬£5899 price...\\" (similar to that of the 1000 cc bikes of the time and actually more than Honda's own VFR750F), failed to sell well. This model was also officially imported (in very limited numbers) and sold in Austria, France and Germany for a few years. Although mainly produced for the Japanese domestic market, VFR400s have been popular as grey imports in other markets (especially so for the NC30 in the United Kingdom,Performance Bikes, September 2001, p. 82:\\"More of them have been imported - a few officially by Honda UK, but mostly by other means - than any other 400 race-rep.\\" and also for racing purposes in the United States) in the \\"mini\\" superbike segment. VFR400 engines produce a noticeable whine when the engine is running, due to the cams being driven by straight cut gears, rather than chains or belts. Model history 1990 Honda VFR400R NC30The first generation of VFR400 was the 1986-1987 NC21, which had replaced the VF400F when the Honda VF series was phased out (mainly due to reliability issues with the head and cam chain). This model came in 4 designations, \\"R\\", \\"Z\\", \\"K\\" and a police version with the \\"P\\" designation. The \\"R\\" model (VFR400R) being the most common. Between the designations multiple colour schemes were also available. The \\"R\\" had a full fairing and single headlight. The \\"Z\\" model was semi fared (side fairings and belly pan) and had 2 round headlights. The \\"K\\" and \\"P\\" both had a single round headlight and bar risers to give a more upright riding position. All designations had a single piece seat for rider and pillion, 3 spoke cast wheels, an aluminum frame with steel rear subframe, and a conventional dual-sided aluminum swing arm with single shock. The clutch was hydraulically actuated and the front left fork featured Hondas TRAC (Torque Reactive Anti-dive Circuit) system with adjustable dampening on the right fork. This had 4 stage adjustment on the bottom of the fork. Both forks featured air assist. The engine was a 180¬∞ degree crank firing version, and had a rpm redline of 13000rpm on the \\"R\\" and \\"Z\\", the \\"K\\" and \\"P\\" had a redline of 14000rpm. A small number of NC21s (VFR400R) were imported new into New Zealand in 1987. The 2nd generation of VFR400 was the VFR400R NC24, produced for the 1987 and 1988 model years, it was one of the first production Honda motorcycle to utilize an ELF-designed Pro-Arm single-sided swingarm (which later became one of the trademarks of the Honda VFR series). Discontinued with this model were the hydraulically actuated clutch which was switched back to a cable system, and while the TRAC anti dive system on the front left fork was retained, it was not adjustable. The cast wheels were updated to 8 spoke rear and 6 spoke front. Styling remained close to the NC21, with both having the same aluminium frame and with the NC24 keeping the VFR400R NC21's single large headlight and the exhaust silencer on the right side although the silencer was mounted higher up. The seat was changed to a separate seat for the rider and pillion each. This model also had the 180¬∞ deg crank firing engine as with the nc21, but redline was raised to 14000 rpm and the CDI dropped the cam position sensor input that the nc21 used. The NC24 was available in three colour schemes in 1987 (including an official Rothmans replica), and one in 1988. Note that the rear wheel on the NC24 was held onto the hub with 4 bolts (sometimes hidden with a plastic 'fake' single nut). The third generation of VFR400R was the best known version, the VFR400R NC30. This saw styling changes, most notably the headlights were updated to smaller twin headlights, much the same as the RC30, and relocation of the silencer to the left side, which gave a more open look to the rear wheel on the right side. This model saw the introduction of the 360¬∞ crank firing engine, which is also known as the \\"big bang\\" engine. The tachometer red-line was also raised to 14500 rpm. The NC30 was also officially sold in limited numbers in several European countries. The official European models were sometimes installed with a different CDI (ignition device), no restriction, speedometer that reached to and larger headlights (Germany). The NC30 was produced between 1989 and 1992, though unsold bikes were still available to purchase from Honda dealers for several years thereafter. The NC30 reflected the styling of its iconic bigger brother, the VFR750R (RC30), right down to its 18-inch rear wheel. Japanese-spec NC30s were available in a total of eight different colour schemes, produced with three different model year specifications (1989, 1990 and 1992). Export models were made in two different colour schemes, and carried model year designations L and M (1990 and 1991). The official UK model has the following distinguishable features: slightly larger front and rear direction indicators; additional rear number plate light (separate from rear lamp) oil cooler, 60/55 watt headlamp bulbs, and a MPH speedo. The official UK bikes were only ever available in two colour schemes. The Honda VFR400R NC30 is widely regarded as being a fine handling motorcycle. The engine has a very wide powerband for a 400cc engine, which made it a perfect beginners-superbike. It has a hardcore fanbase, especially in Japan and the UK, where the NC30 is a popular track-day and racing bike. Successors As the RC30 was eventually replaced by the RVF750R (RC45), the VFR400R NC30 evolved into the RVF400R NC35, which was produced between 1994 and 1996. This model featured inverted forks and an updated racing-style fairing. Speed restriction In the Japanese market, 400 cc motorcycles were once restricted by top speed, but these restrictions can be removed through various means, including the fitting of an ignition \\"black box\\". The VFR400R is restricted by means of an optical sensor inside the speedometer, and a black sector attached to the indicator needle shaft. When needle swings round to the sector starts to block the sensor, ignition is cut to the front two cylinders thereby reducing power such that the motorcycle can not accelerate further. Some models also had power restrictions, this was most commonly a restriction washer in each of the rubber sections between the carbs and cylinder inlet.

Salting, either with dry salt or brine, was a common method of preserving meat until the middle of the 20th century, becoming less popular after the advent of refrigeration. It was frequently called \\"junk\\" or \\"salt horse\\". Salt inhibits the growth of microorganisms by drawing water out of microbial cells through osmosis. Concentrations of salt up to 20% are required to kill most species of unwanted bacteria. Smoking, often used in the process of curing meat, adds chemicals to the surface of meat that reduce the concentration of salt required. Salted meat and fish are a staple of the diet in North Africa, Southern China, Scandinavia, coastal Russia, and in the Arctic. Salted meat was a staple of the mariner's diet in the Age of Sail. It was stored in barrels, and often had to last for months spent out of sight of land. The basic Royal Navy diet consisted of salted beef, salted pork, ship's biscuit, and oatmeal, supplemented with smaller quantities of peas, cheese and butter. Even in 1938, Eric Newby found the diet on the tall ship Moshulu to consist almost entirely of salted meat. Moshulu's lack of refrigeration left little choice as the ship made voyages which could exceed 100 days passage between ports.

Wuzhen has been the permanent host place of the annual World Internet Conference, an international Internet conference held in China, since 2014.  Location  Located in the centre of the six ancient towns south of the Yangtze River, north of the city of Tongxiang, Wuzhen displays its history through its ancient stone bridges, stone pathways and delicate wood carvings. Notable people * Mao Dun, a renowned modern Chinese revolutionary writer, was born in Wuzhen, and his well-known work, 'The Lin's Shop', describes the life of Wuzhen. * Mu Xin, a contemporary poet, calligrapher and painter, was born and died in Wuzhen. The Mu Xin Art Museum in the city is dedicated to his work. Town layout Wuzhen is divided into six districts. These are: the traditional workshops district, the traditional local-styled dwelling houses district, the traditional culture district, the traditional food and beverage district, the traditional shops and stores district, and the water township customs and life district. Following an east-west-east circuit created by these six districts, visitors can witness reenactment of traditional practices and cultures. Former residence of Mao Dun Originally built in the mid 19th century and covering a total area of , the former residence of Mao Dun, was the Mao family home for many generations. In 1984, the building was renovated and extended to cover a total area of , opening to the public one year later. In 1988, it was listed as one of the Key State Preserved Relic Units and in 1994 was renamed the Mao Dun Museum of the City of Tongxiang. The house has three exhibition areas: 'Wuzhen, the Hometown of Mao Dun', 'the Way of Mao Dun', and 'the Former Residence of Mao Dun (renovated)'. The present Mao Dun Museum lies to the east of the residence, which was formerly the Lizhi Shuyuan (Aspiration Academy) where Mao Dun spent his early school years. Former residence of Mu Xin This house is located at 186 Caishenwan, Dongzha, where Muxin spent his childhood until the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1950, Muxin's mother was obliged to donate this house to the local government, and it was later used as a standard and metric Fastener factory. In 1999, the local government renovated this house and returned it to Muxin. Muxin lived in it until he passed away in 2011.

Fanglu Pavilion (Pavilion of Visits to Lu) The Fanglu Pavilion obtained its name from an accidental meeting between Lu Tong, the owner, and Lu Yu, the Patron Saint of Tea, during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). It is said that Lu Yu once mistakenly ate some poisonous leaves and was rescued by Lu Tong, who happened to collect tea leaves at that time. In return, Lu Yu taught Lu Tong knowledge of tea and tea-making skills, which resulted in the prosperity of Lu Tong's teahouse. At the suggestion of one guest, Lu Tong changed the establishment's name to the Pavilion of Visits to Lu, in memory of this respected scholar. Located to the south of Ying Bridge and backing onto the city river, the teahouse enjoys a broad view of Guanqian Street.  Bridge within a bridge  The \\"Bridge within a Bridge\\" is a scenic attraction created by two ancient bridges, the Tongji Bridge which crosses the river from east to west and the Renji Bridge running from south to north that joins the former at one end. Either of two bridges can be seen through the arch of the other, hence the name. Having been rebuilt five times, Tongji Bridge is a and one- curvature arch bridge, with a span of . Renji Bridge, which has also undergone repairs during its history, has a length of , a width of and a span of . Demonstration in the traditional workshops district display traditional crafts as the printing and dyeing of blue printed fabrics, the primitive techniques of cloth shoe making and tobacco-planing. Visitors may operate the machines to get an idea of how the original work was carried out over 200 years ago. The local houses here are decorated with carved wooden and stone doors and windows.

The sale also included a Canadian subsidiary of John Hancock, Maritime Life; it was integrated into Manulife's Canadian operations.Caffrey, Andrew, \\"Hancock chief D'Alessandro stepping down\\", Boston Globe, June 11, 2004 Headquarters The current headquarters is located in the John Hancock building at 197 Clarendon Street in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood. In a memo to all employees, CEO Marianne Harrison announced the company would be returning to the Back Bay section of Boston by the end of 2018. The 1,100 employees will be moving into 200 Berkeley Street, sometimes known as the \\"Old John Hancock Building\\" and 197 Clarendon Street. John Hancock no longer has a presence in the Back Bay tower at 200 Clarendon Street, still known by many Bostonians as the Hancock Tower. Investor Sentiment Index John Hancock created an index called the \\"John Hancock Investor Sentiment Index\\" in 2011. The company describes the index as a \\"quarterly measure of investors' views on a range of investment choices, life goals and economic outlook.\\" Leadership In October 2017, Marianne Harrison became the first female president and chief executive officer of John Hancock. She earned a reported $4.4 million in compensation in 2017.

The word epenthesis comes from \\"in addition to\\" and en \\"in\\" and thesis \\"putting\\". Epenthesis may be divided into two types: excrescence, for the addition of a consonant, and svarabhakti, or anaptyxis (), for the addition of a vowel. The opposite process, where one or more sounds are removed, is referred to as elision. Uses Epenthesis arises for a variety of reasons. The phonotactics of a given language may discourage vowels in hiatus or consonant clusters, and a consonant or vowel may be added to make pronunciation easier. Epenthesis may be represented in writing or be a feature only of the spoken language. Separating vowels A consonant may be added to separate vowels in hiatus. This is the case with linking and intrusive R in English. *drawing ‚Üí drawring Bridging consonant clusters A consonant may be placed between consonants in a consonant cluster where the place of articulation is different (e.g., where one consonant is labial and the other is alveolar). * something ‚Üí somepthing *hamster ‚Üí hampster a-mrotos ‚Üí ambrotos (see below) Breaking consonant clusters A vowel may be placed between consonants to separate them. *Hamtramck ‚Üí Hamtramick Other contexts While epenthesis most often occurs between two vowels or two consonants, it can also occur between a vowel and a consonant, or at the ends of words. For example, the Japanese prefix transforms regularly to when followed by a consonant, as in . The English suffix , often found in the form , as in (from + ), is an example of terminal excrescence. Excrescence Excrescence is the epenthesis of a consonant. Historical sound change *Latin > French (\\"to tremble\\") *Old English > English thunder * French , > English messenger, passenger * French , > Portuguese , *(Reconstructed) Proto- Germanic > Old English , Old Saxon (\\"to sow\\") *(Reconstructed) Proto-Greek > Ancient Greek (\\"immortal\\"; cf. ambrosia) *Latin > homne > homre > Spanish (\\"man\\") * (Reconstructed) Common Slavic > Old Church Slavonic , Russian (\\"I will buy\\") Synchronic rule In French, is inserted in inverted interrogative phrases between a verb ending in a vowel and a pronoun beginning with a vowel: ('he has') > ('has he?'). There is no epenthesis from a historical perspective since the is derived from Latin ('he has'), and so the is the original third-person verb inflection. However, it is correct to call it epenthesis when viewed synchronically since the modern basic form of the verb is and so the psycholinguistic process is therefore the addition of to the base form. A similar example is the English indefinite article a, which becomes an before a vowel. It originated from Old English (\\"one, a, an\\"), which retained an n in all positions, so a diachronic analysis would see the original n disappearing except if a following vowel required its retention: an > a. However, a synchronic analysis, in keeping with the perception of most native speakers, would (equally correctly) see it as epenthesis: a > an. In Dutch, whenever the suffix (which has several meanings) is attached to a word already ending in -r, an additional is inserted in between. For example, the comparative form of the adjective (\\"sweet\\") is , but the comparative of (\\"sour\\") is and not the expected **. Similarly, the agent noun of (\\"to sell\\") is (\\"salesperson\\"), but the agent noun of (\\"to perform\\") is (\\"performer\\"). Variable rule In English, a stop consonant is often added as a transitional sound between the parts of a nasal + fricative sequence: *English hamster often pronounced with an added p sound, GA: or RP: *English warmth often pronounced with an added p sound, GA: or RP: *English fence often pronounced Poetic device *Latin \\"remnants, survivors\\" (accusative plural) > poetic The three short syllables in do not fit into dactylic hexameter because of the dactyl's limit of two short syllables so the first syllable is lengthened by adding another l. However, the pronunciation was often not written with double ll, and may have been the normal way of pronouncing a word starting in rel- rather than a poetic modification. In Japanese A limited number of words in Japanese use epenthetic consonants to separate vowels. An example is the word , a compound of haru and ame in which an is added to separate the final of haru and the initial of ame. That is a synchronic analysis. As for a diachronic (historical) analysis, since epenthetic consonants are not used regularly in modern Japanese, the epenthetic could be from Old Japanese. It is also possible that Old Japanese /ame2/ was once pronounced */same2/; the would then be not epenthetic but simply an archaic pronunciation. Another example is . A complex example of epenthesis is , from + . It exhibits epenthesis on both morphemes: ‚Üí is common (occurring before a consonant), and ‚Üí occurs only in the example; it can be analyzed as ‚Üí (intervocalic) ‚Üí ; akin to from + . One hypothesis argues that Japanese developed \\"as a default, epenthetic consonant in the intervocalic position\\". Anaptyxis Epenthesis of a vowel is known as anaptyxis (/Àå√¶n…ôpÀàt…™ks…™s/, from Greek \\"unfolding\\"). Some accounts distinguish between \\"intrusive\\" optional vowels, vowel-like releases of consonants as phonetic detail, and true epenthetic vowels that are required by the phonotactics of the language and are acoustically identical with phonemic vowels. Historical sound change End of word Many languages insert a so- called prop vowel at the end of a word, often as a result of the common sound change where vowels at the end of a word are deleted. For example, in the Gallo-Romance languages, a prop schwa /…ô/ was added when final non-open vowels were dropped leaving /Cr/ clusters at the end, e.g. Latin nigrum '(shiny) black' > * > Old French negre 'black' (thus avoiding the impermissible , cf. carrum > char 'cart'). Middle of word Similarly as above, a vowel may be inserted in the middle of a word to resolve an impermissible word-final consonant cluster. An example of this can be found in Lebanese Arabic, where /Àà îal…™b/ 'heart' corresponds to Modern Standard Arabic ŸÇŸÑÿ® /qalb/ and Egyptian Arabic / î√¶lb/. In the development of Old English, Proto-Germanic 'field, acre' would have ended up with an impermissible final cluster (*√¶cr), so it was resolved by inserting an /e/ before the rhotic consonant: (cf. the use of a syllabic consonant in Gothic ). Vowel insertion in the middle of a word can be observed in the history of the Slavic languages, which had a preference for open syllables in medieval times. An example of this is the Proto-Slavic form 'town', in which the East Slavic languages inserted an epenthetic copy vowel to open the closed syllable, resulting in (), which became () in modern Russian and Ukrainian. Other Slavic languages used metathesis for the vowel and the syllable-final consonant, producing *grod≈≠ in this case, as seen in Polish , Old Church Slavonic –≥—Ä–∞–¥—ä grad≈≠, Serbo-Croatian and Czech . Another environment can be observed in the history of Modern Persian, in which former word-initial consonant clusters, which were still extant in Middle Persian, are regularly broken up: Middle Persian brƒÅdar 'brother' > modern Iranian Persian ÿ®ÿ±ÿßÿØÿ± , Middle Persian st≈´n 'column' > Early New Persian ÿ≥ÿ™ŸàŸÜ > modern Iranian Persian ÿ≥ÿ™ŸàŸÜ . In Spanish, as a phonetic detail, it is usual to find a schwa vowel in sequences of a consonant followed by a flap. For instance, 'vinegar' may be but also . Beginning of word In the Western Romance languages, a prothetic vowel was inserted at the beginning of any word that began with and another consonant, e.g. Latin 'two-edged sword, typically used by cavalry' becomes the normal word for 'sword' in Romance languages with an inserted : Spanish/Portuguese , Catalan , Old French > modern (see also 'swordfish'). French in fact has three uses of initial vowel epenthesis depending on the time the word came into the language: * inserting epenthetic , and after the medieval period dropping in inherited and commonly-used learned and semi-learned words: > Old French > modern , > OF > modern * inserting and keeping for learned words brought in during the Middle Ages or the Renaissance: > , > * not inserting in further borrowings during the modern period, and remolding uncommon old learned borrowings to look more like Latin: > , > , > learned Old French > remolded to modern Poetic device Grammatical rule Epenthesis often breaks up a consonant cluster or vowel sequence that is not permitted by the phonotactics of a language. Regular or semi-regular epenthesis commonly occurs in languages with affixes. For example, a reduced vowel or (here abbreviated as ) is inserted before the English plural suffix and the past tense suffix when the root ends in a similar consonant: glass ‚Üí glasses or ; bat ‚Üí batted . However, this is a synchronic analysis as the vowel was originally present in the suffix but has been lost in most words. Borrowed words Vocalic epenthesis typically occurs when words are borrowed from a language that has consonant clusters or syllable codas that are not permitted in the borrowing language. Languages use various vowels, but schwa is quite common when it is available: * Hebrew uses a single vowel, the schwa (pronounced in Israeli Hebrew). * Japanese generally uses except after and , when it uses , and after , when it uses an echo vowel. For example, English cap becomes in Japanese; English street, ; the Dutch name , ; and the German name , . * Korean uses except after borrowed , which takes a following at the end of the word. For example, English strike becomes , with three epenthetic vowels and a split of English diphthong into two syllables. * Brazilian Portuguese uses , which, in most dialects, triggers palatalization of a preceding or : nerd > ; stress > ; McDonald's > with normal vocalization of to . Most speakers pronounce borrowings with spelling pronunciations, and others try to approximate the nearest equivalents in Portuguese of the phonemes in the original language. The word stress became estresse as in the example above. * Classical Arabic does not allow clusters at the beginning of a word, and typically uses to break up such clusters in borrowings: Latin > 'street'. In Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian Arabic, copy vowels are often used as well, e.g. English/French klaxon (car horn) > Egyptian Arabic ŸÉŸÑŸÉÿ≥ 'car horn', but note French blouse > Egyptian Arabic ÿ®ŸÑŸàÿ≤ÿ© (where corresponds to MSA ). Many other modern varieties such as North Levantine Arabic and Moroccan Arabic allow word-initial clusters however. *Persian also does not allow clusters at the beginning of a word and typically uses to break up such clusters in borrowings except between and , when is added. * Spanish does not allow clusters at the beginning of a word with an in them and adds e- to such words: Latin > , English stress > . * Turkish prefixes close vowels to loanwords with initial clusters of alveolar fricatives followed by another consonant: < Greek (), < set screw, < Greek (), < Byzantine Greek (), < steamboat, < Scotland, < Greek (), < Greek (). The practice is no longer productive as of late 20th century and a few such words have changed back: < < French . Informal speech Epenthesis most often occurs within unfamiliar or complex consonant clusters. For example, in English, the name Dwight is commonly pronounced with an epenthetic schwa between the and the (), and many speakers insert a schwa between the and of realtor. Irish English and Scottish English are some of the dialects that may insert a schwa between and in words like film () under the influence of Celtic languages, a phenomenon that also occurs in Indian English due to the influence of Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi. Epenthesis is sometimes used for humorous or childlike effect. For example, the cartoon character Yogi Bear says \\"pic-a-nic basket\\" for picnic basket. Another example is found in the chants of England football fans in which England is usually rendered as or the pronunciation of athlete as \\"ath- e-lete\\". Some apparent occurrences of epenthesis, however, have a separate cause: the pronunciation of nuclear as ' () in some North American dialects arises out of analogy with other -cular words (binocular, particular, etc.) rather than from epenthesis. In colloquial registers of Brazilian Portuguese, is sometimes inserted between consonant clusters except those with (), () or syllable-ending (; note syllable-final is pronounced in a number of dialects). Examples would be , and . Some dialects also use , which is deemed as stereotypical of people from lower classes, such as those arriving from rural flight in internal migrations to cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Bras√≠lia and S√£o Paulo. In Finnish In Finnish, there are two epenthetic vowels and two nativization vowels. One epenthetic vowel is the preceding vowel, found in the illative case ending : ‚Üí , ‚Üí . The second is , connecting stems that have historically been consonant stems to their case endings: ‚Üí . In Standard Finnish, consonant clusters may not be broken by epenthetic vowels; foreign words undergo consonant deletion rather than addition of vowels: (\\"shore\\") from Proto-Germanic . However, modern loans may not end in consonants. Even if the word, such as a personal name, is native, a paragogic vowel is needed to connect a consonantal case ending to the word. The vowel is : ‚Üí , or in the case of personal name, + ‚Üí \\"about Bush\\" (elative case). Finnish has moraic consonants: , and are of interest. In Standard Finnish, they are slightly intensified before a consonant in a medial cluster: . Some dialects, like Savo and Ostrobothnian, have epenthesis instead and use the preceding vowel in clusters of type and , in Savo also . (In Finnish linguistics, the phenomenon is often referred to as ; the same word can also mean schwa, but it is not a phoneme in Finnish so there is usually no danger of confusion.) For example, \\"Ostrobothnia\\" ‚Üí , ‚Üí , and Savo ‚Üí . Ambiguities may result: \\"strait\\" vs. . (An exception is that in Pohjanmaa, and become and , respectively: ‚Üí . Also, in a small region in Savo, is used instead.) In constructed languages Lojban‚Äîa constructed language that seeks logically-oriented grammatical and phonological structures‚Äîuses a number of consonant clusters in its words, and since it is designed to be as universal as possible, it allows a type of anaptyxis called \\"buffering\\" to be used if a speaker finds a cluster difficult or impossible to pronounce. A vowel sound that is nonexistent in Lojban (usually \\"…™\\" as in \\"hit\\") is added between two consonants to make the word easier to pronounce. Despite altering the phonetics of a word, the use of buffering is completely ignored by grammar. Also, the vowel sound used must not be confused with any existing Lojban vowel. An example of buffering in Lojban: if a speaker finds the cluster in the word (\\"cat\\") (pronounced ) hard or impossible to pronounce, the vowel can be pronounced between the two consonants, resulting in the form . Nothing changes grammatically, including the spelling and the syllabication of the word. In sign language A type of epenthesis in sign language is known as \\"movement epenthesis\\" and occurs, most commonly, during the boundary between signs while the hands move from the posture required by the first sign to that required by the next.

It is the basis for modern convulsive therapy.Bangen, Hans: Geschichte der medikament√∂sen Therapie der Schizophrenie. Berlin 1992, p. 51-55 Biography Meduna was born to a well- to-do family in Budapest, Hungary, in 1896. Later in life Meduna sometimes used \\"von\\" in his name. The reasons for that are unknown. He studied medicine in Budapest from 1914 to 1921, his studies being interrupted by military service in the Italian front from 1915 to 1918. He was appointed to the Hungarian Interacademic Institute for Brain Research, also in Budapest. He worked under the direction of K√°roly Schaffer. He studied the neuropathology of the structure and development of the pineal gland and of microglia, lead poisoning, and avitaminosis. In 1927 he moved to the Psychiatric Institute with Dr. Schaffer and began clinical and research work in psychopathology. Meduna's interest in treating schizophrenia began with observations that the concentration of brain glia varied among patients who died with epilepsy (more glia than normal) and those with schizophrenia (less glia than normal). He thought that the inductions of seizures in patients with schizophrenia would increase the concentration of glia and relieve the illness. The concept was supported by reports that the incidence of epilepsy in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia was extremely low; and that a few schizophrenic patients who developed seizures after infection or head trauma, were relieved of their psychosis. He sought ways to induce seizures in animals with chemicals; after trials with the alkaloids strychnine, thebaine, coramine, caffeine, and brucin, he settled on camphor dissolved in oil as effective and reliable. For a population with severe schizophrenia, he moved from Budapest to the psychiatric hospital at Lipotmez≈ë, outside Budapest. He began his dose-finding experiments on January 2, 1934. He was able to induce seizures in about 1/3 the first subjects. Nevertheless, three of the first 11 patients had a positive response, encouraging his work (see Gazdag et al., 2009). In his autobiography, he recalls the patient who began his treatment on January 23, 1934 in a severe 33-year-old catatonic patient. After just 5 treatments, catatonia and psychotic symptoms were abolished. Increasing his cases to 26 patients, Meduna achieved recovery in 10 and improvement in 3 more. A major factor in Meduna's achievement was his selection of patients ‚Äî 9 of the first 11 patients were catatonic. Catatonia is a syndrome that is remarkably responsive to induced seizures. The serendipity that catatonia was considered schizophrenia made his discovery possible. Early in his work Meduna replaced camphor with pentylenetetrazol (Metrazol), an intravenous agent that induced seizures immediately compared with the long delay of 15 to 45 minutes after intramuscular camphor. He first published his results in 1935 and then his major text in 1937. Die Konvulsionstherapie der Schizophrenie describes the results in 110 patients. Of these patients about half recovered. The results were much better for patients who were ill less than a year compared to those who had been ill for many years. His results were quickly reproduced in many other centers around the world and this form of therapy became widely used and recognized as the first effective treatment for schizophrenia.Shorter E. A History of Psychiatry. New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1997.Shorter E, Healy D. Shock Therapy: A History of Electroconvulsive Treatment in Mental Illness. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2007.(A parallel development was insulin coma therapy.) A more facile form of induction of seizures, using electricity instead of chemicals, was developed by the Italian psychiatrists Ugo Cerletti and Lucio Bini. They treated their first patient with ECT in May 1938 and by the mid-1940s, electricity had replaced Metrazole as the induction agent. Meduna also developed carbon dioxide therapy. The patient breaths a gaseous mixture of 30% carbon dioxide and 70% oxygen, named carboxygen or carbogen, sometimes called \\"Meduna's Mixture\\". Designed to provoke a powerful feeling of suffocation, after only a few breaths the patient enters an unresponsive but intense altered state. The treatment ‚Äî while usually unpleasant or even terrifying ‚Äî proved very useful for revealing previously unconscious fears. Challenging experiences on carbogen prepared patients for later psychedelic therapy in a profound way. Although it was effective in relieving obsessive-compulsive disorder. ,Meduna L.

With the increase of anti-semitism and the rise to power of Nazism, Meduna emigrated to the US in the following year (1938), to become Professor of Neurology at Loyola University, in Chicago. One of his last contributions to psychiatry was the study of confusional and dream-like states in psychoses (oneirophrenia)Meduna L. Oneirophrenia. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 100 pp., 1950. He was also a founder of the Journal of Neuropsychiatry and a President of the Society of Biological Psychiatry.

She was transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS Roxborough (I07) and later to the Soviet Navy as Zhyostky (or Doblestny ; sources vary). Service history As USS Foote Named for Admiral Andrew Hull Foote, she was launched 14 December 1918 by Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Mrs. Lelia F. Cady, daughter of Admiral Foote; and commissioned 21 March 1919, Lieutenant Commander D. H. Stuart in command. Foote sailed from Boston 3 May 1919 to take up an observation station off Newfoundland for the historic first aerial crossing of the Atlantic, made later that month by Navy seaplanes. She returned to Boston 22 May to complete her interrupted fitting out, then took part in training operations until sailing from Newport 27 August bound for a tour of duty with Naval Forces European Waters. From September through December, she served in the Adriatic, and then called at Italian and French ports homeward bound. Arriving at Boston 12 February 1920, she was placed in reserve 24 February for repairs there and at Charleston. In the summer of 1921, Foote operated with 50 percent of her complement during summer target practice in Narragansett Bay, and returning to Charleston, she lay there and at Boston for alterations and repairs until decommissioned at Philadelphia 6 July 1922. Recommissioned 2 July 1940, Foote operated on patrol out of Charleston, until sailing 7 September for Halifax, Nova Scotia. There, on 23 September 1940, she was decommissioned and transferred to the Royal Navy in the destroyers for land bases exchange. As HMS Roxborough HMS Roxborough in Hampton Roads, September 3, 1942 Commissioned as HMS Roxborough 23 September 1940, the destroyer crossed the Atlantic to join the Western Approaches Command, guarding convoys during the dangerous last leg of their voyages into British ports. In March 1942, Roxborough took up western Atlantic escort duty out of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Roxborough was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original /50 guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar.Lenton&Colledge; (1968) p.92 While with convoy HX222 Roxborough met with such heavy weather that the entire bridge structure was crushed, with eleven dead, including the Commanding Officer and 1st Lieutenant. The sole surviving executive officer managed to regain control of the ship, and under hand steering from aft, she made St. Johns, Newfoundland. Returning to the Tyne 10 January 1944, Roxborough lay in reserve there until transferred to the Soviet Navy on 1 August 1944. In Soviet service  Zhyostky, c.1944-1949 On 1 August 1944 Roxborough was transferred to the Soviet Navy. She was renamed (sources vary) either Zhyostky (rus. \\"Rigid\\")DANFS or Doblestny (rus. \\"Glorious or Valiant\\").Conway p332 She was returned to Great Britain 7 February 1949 and was scrapped on 14 May 1949.

She was 53 years old at the time, still the oldest female gold medal winner at the Olympic Games. Great Britain did not win another women's archery medal at the Olympics until 2004. She joined the Cheltenham Archers club in 1905, and was national champion on three occasions in 1911, 1912 and 1914. Biography Sybil \\"Queenie\\" Fenton Newall was born in Hare Hill House, Littleborough, Rochdale (part of her father's estate) on 17 October 1854. In 1905, along with her sister Margaret, she joined the local Cheltenham archery club. By 1907 she had won four of the five regional meetings. She took part at the 1908 Summer Olympics, held in White City, London. The expected winner of the women's archery, Alice Legh, chose not to compete and so Queenie's main rival was Lottie Dod who was a sporting all- rounder. The entire field competing in the women's archery were British. On the first day of the Archery competition the weather in White City Stadium was so poor that the event was stopped at one point. On the close of the first day Queenie was behind Dod by ten points. The second day's weather was much improved and Queenie overtook Dod, eventually winning with a score of 688 points, 46 points ahead of Dod who finished in the silver medal position. The victory made Queenie the oldest woman to win an Olympic medal, at the age of 53 years and 275 days, a record which still stands as of 2012. At the following National Championships, Newell was defeated by Alice Legh but she went on to win it in 1911, retained it in 1912, and won it once more in 1914. She continued in the sport following the First World War, her last score was recorded by the Cheltenham archery club in 1928. She died at her home in Cheltenham on 24 June 1929. After the 1908 Olympics, no female British archer won an Olympic medal until Alison Williamson won the bronze in the women's individual competition at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Personal life Queenie was the eldest daughter of the ten children of Henry Newall and Maria Fenton. Her father was a merchant and owned Hare Hill House and estate in Littleborough, Lancashire. Her grandfather John Fenton was the Member of Parliament for Rochdale following the 1832 and 1837 general elections.

Located in the winter sports town of St. Moritz, the run is one of the few in the world dedicated entirely to skeleton. It was built in 1884 near the hamlet of Cresta in the municipality of Celerina/Schlarigna by the Outdoor Amusement Committee of the Kulm Hotel and the people of St. Moritz. The committee members were Major William Henry Bulpett (founder of the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club (SMTC)), George Robertson, Charles Digby Jones (Robertson and Digby Jones planned the proposed course), C. Metcalfe, and J. Biddulph. It has continued as a partnership to this day between the SMTC, founded in 1887, and the people of St. Moritz. The sport of intramural sled racing originated in winter resort activities at the Kulm Hotel St. Moritz during the early 1870s. SMTC members still congregate for lunch in the 'Sunny Bar' at the Kulm. In the early days of competitive sledding, the predominant style was luge-style racing, lying on one's back, but the invention of the flexible runner sled (Flexible Flyer) in 1887, known colloquially as 'the America', led to Mr. Cornish using the head-first style in the 1887 Grand National. He finished fourteenth due to some erratic rides but established a trend, and by the 1890 Grand National all competitors were riding head-first.About The St Moritz Tobogganing Club The head-first style for a time became known as 'Cresta' racing. The sport and its history The Cresta Run and the SMTC were founded by devotees of sledding (tobogganing in English) who adopted a head-first (prone) technique of racing down an icy run, as opposed to the feet-first (supine) and somewhat faster luge race. Both evolving sports were natural extensions of the invention of steerable sleds during the early 1870s by British guests of the Kulm hotel in St. Moritz. The initial crude sleds were developed almost accidentally--as bored well-to-do gentlemen naturally took to intramural competition in the streets and byways of mountainous downtown St. Moritz posing a risk to each other and pedestrians alike. This gave impetus to steering the sleds, and soon runners and a primitive mechanism evolved to allow some steerage along the longer curving streets of the 1870s. It also allowed higher speeds on the longer runs. Local views varied, but eventually complaints grew louder and Kulm hotel owner Caspar Badrutt built the first natural ice run for his guests, as part of his efforts to popularize wintering in the mountain resort, while careful not to lose customers to boredom, nor his workforce to injury from errant sleds on the streets. The run The head (top) of the run is located under the remains of a Twelfth Century church, demolished in 1890, known as the 'Leaning Tower'. The overall drop is and the gradient varies from 2.8 to 1 to 8.7 to 1 (length to drop). The modern Cresta track is not shared with bobsled, unlike the original half-pipe sledding track built by hotelier Caspar Badrutt for his guests. Most of it is located within the contour of a steep ravine and is recreated each winter using the rocky ravine and banks of earth as a buttress for the pack ice. The run is owned and operated by an all-male club, created in 1885 by British military officers with the official name of the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club (SMTC), but is generally referred to as 'The Cresta Run'. The course has two entrances known as the 'Top' and the 'Junction' respectively, with two banks, known as 'Upper' 'and 'Lower'. The entrance at the Junction is adjacent to the SMTC clubhouse and is about a third of the way down from the Top along the run. Similarly, the exit is simply called the 'Finish' and given a typical average speed of more than 50 mph, an experienced rider will exit the course at more than 80 mph when riding from the Top. The track was used for the skeleton event in both the 1928 and the 1948 Winter Olympics.1928 Winter Olympics official report. Part 2. p. 14. 1948 Winter Olympics official report. pp. 6, 23. These were the only Olympics with skeleton until 2002.  Male preserve  The exclusion of women from the course, which was enforced until December 2018, dates from the late 1920s and was instituted because of injuries to female racers and the belief, although never proven, that excessive sledding caused breast cancer. It came into effect in 1929, though women had been banned from competitive events several years earlier. In late 2018, St Moritz Tobogganing Club meeting members voted by a two-thirds majority to allow women to ride the Cresta Run again and to become members.  The Club  The primary purpose of the 1300 member club founded in 1887 is \\"‚Ä¶the conduct of races and practice on the Cresta Run and the encouragement of tobogganing generally\\".St Moritz Tobogganing Club - Ride The Cresta While not snobbish, the Cresta Club gathers well-to-do gentlemen and is totally amateur. There are many more luge and bobsled runs world-wide, but only one Cresta devoted to head first sledding. The club asserts that most of the other sledding sports are dominated by professionals and is one of the last bastions of the genuine amateur in sport. As in many social clubs, members are elected from a list of qualifiers called the Supplementary List. The course is open to anyone who meets the three criteria for joining the list, and need not be English. It has a lot of club rites such as the \\"Firework\\", the \\"Shuttlecock Club\\" and a dedicated drink, the \\"Bullshot\\". The highlight of the Shuttlecock Club is the yearly Shuttlecock Dinner. The dinner is organised by the Shuttlecock President. Prominent presidents have included Constantin von Liechtenstein, Gianni Agnelli, Gunther Sachs, Sir Dudley Cunliffe-Owen, Rolf Sachs, Lord Dalmeny, Graf Luca Marenzi, Mark Fischer, Lord Wrottesley and Sven Ley. The club sponsors more than thirty races each season which generally last from just before Christmas to late February. The track is opened as soon as it is seasonally possible to do so, and is kept open as long as natural weather conditions permit. Notable rider-members Some notably good riders from the membership of the past were Nino Bibbia, Italy; Giorgio Jegher, Jack Heaton, USA; and Billy Fiske, USA (the first American pilot killed in World War II as a volunteer in the \\"Millionaire Squadron\\"). In 1955 the then 71-year-old Lord Brabazon Lord Brabazon with the skeleton won the Cresta Run Coronation Cup at an average speed of . Among the best riders in recent years: eight times Grand National winner was Swiss Franco Gansser, fifteen times Grand National winner Lord Wrottesley finished fourth at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games and is the current Top record holder (49.92 in 2015), former Junction Record holder Johannes Badrutt (41.02 in 1999), and current Junction record holder is German Magnus Eger (40.94 in 2017).https://www.cresta- run.com/ride-the-cresta/facts-about-the-cresta/ Marcel Melcher was the youngest ever Winner (age 19, in 1979) of the Grand National. Wing Commander Andy Green is the RAF's team captain for the Cresta Run. Green is an established driver of land speed record cars, and holds the current land speed record which he achieved in Thrust SSC. He also drives the 1,000 mph car Bloodhound SSC. Baron Raunchy was reported to have had the slowest ride from the Junction, with a time of 380 seconds. Women and the Cresta Although since 1929 until December 2018 rulesSt Moritz Tobogganing Club Facts about the Cresta forbade women riders, it was not always so.Notes on Tobogganing at St Moritz, Second Edition, Chapter IX, by T A Cook, 1896 For example, T. A. Cook records that, in 1895, various trials were made by women on the Cresta, testing different riding positions and different styles of toboggan‚Äîalthough at that time women riders were encouraged to use only the lower half of the course. Vera Barclay rode the Cresta Run from the Top. She was followed by a young American, Charles Lowe Boorum, Jnr., who said, \\"See you at the finish\\". Boorum started too fast and slid into Church Leap at such a speed that he crashed at the Shuttlecock, was hit by his toboggan and died from a fractured skull that evening. In 2019 Carina Evans, of Britain, became the first woman to descend the Cresta Run from the Top, since the ban on women riders was lifted in 2018. Towards the end of the season, there is a Ladies Event in which women compete from the Junction by invitation only.

Franklin Computer Corp., 714 F.2d 1240 (3d Cir. 1983), was the first time an appellate level court in the United States held that a computer's operating system could be protected by copyright. As second impact, this ruling clarified that binary code, the machine readable form of software, was copyrightable too and not only the human-readable source code form of software.Impact of Apple vs. Franklin Decision Franklin Computer Corporation introduced the Franklin Ace 1000, a clone of Apple Computer's Apple II, in 1982. Apple quickly determined that substantial portions of the Franklin ROM and operating system had been copied directly from Apple's versions, and on May 12, 1982, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. It cited the presence of some of the same embedded strings, such as the name \\"James Huston\\" (an Apple programmer), and \\"Applesoft,\\" on both the Apple and Franklin system disks. Franklin admitted that it had copied Apple's software but argued that it would have been impractical to independently write its own versions of the software and maintain compatibility, although it said it had written its own version of Apple's copy utility and was working on its own versions of other software. Franklin argued that because Apple's software existed only in machine-readable form, and not in printed form, and because some of the software did not contain copyright notices, it could be freely copied. The Apple II firmware was likened to a machine part whose form was dictated entirely by the requirements of compatibility (that is, an exact copy of Apple's ROM was the only part that would \\"fit\\" in an Apple-compatible computer and enable its intended function), and was therefore not copyrightable. The district court found in favor of Franklin. However, Apple appealed the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which, in a separate case decided three days after Franklin won at the lower level, determined that both a program existing only in a written form unreadable to humans (e.g. object code) and one embedded on a ROM were protected by copyright. (See Williams Elec., Inc., v. Artic Int'l, Inc., 685 F.2d 870 (1982)). The Court of Appeals overturned the district court's ruling in Franklin by applying its holdings in Williams and going further to hold that operating systems were also copyrightable. Hence Apple was able to force Franklin to withdraw its clones by 1988. The company later brought non-infringing clones to market, but as these models were only partially compatible with the Apple II, and as the Apple II architecture was by this time outdated in any case, they enjoyed little success in the marketplace. IBM believed that some IBM PC clone makers such as Eagle Computer and Corona Data Systems similarly infringed on its copyright, and after Apple v. Franklin successfully forced them to stop using the BIOS. The Phoenix BIOS in 1984, however, and similar products such as AMI BIOS, permitted computer makers to legally build essentially 100% PC- compatible clones without having to reverse engineer the PC BIOS themselves. Another impact of the decision was the rise of the shrink-wrap proprietary software commercial business model, where before a source code driven software distribution schema dominated.

It absorbed influences of Eastern civilizations, of Roman art and its patrons, and the new religion of Orthodox Christianity in the Byzantine era and absorbed Italian and European ideas during the period of Romanticism (with the invigoration of the Greek Revolution), until the Modernist and Postmodernist. Greek art is mainly five forms: architecture, sculpture, painting, pottery and jewelry making.  Ancient period  The Stag Hunt Mosaic at the Archaeological Museum of Pella (3rd BC) Artistic production in Greece began in the prehistoric pre- Greek Cycladic and the Minoan civilizations, both of which were influenced by local traditions and the art of ancient Egypt. There are three scholarly divisions of the stages of later ancient Greek art that correspond roughly with historical periods of the same names. These are the Archaic, the Classical and the Hellenistic. The Archaic period is usually dated from 1000 BC. The Persian Wars of 480 BC to 448 BC are usually taken as the dividing line between the Archaic and the Classical periods, and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC is regarded as the event separating the Classical from the Hellenistic period. Of course, different forms of art developed at different speeds in different parts of the Greek world, and varied to a degree from artist to artist.Henri Stierlin. Greece: From Mycenae to the Parthenon. Taschen, 2004. There was a sharp transition from one period to another. The art of ancient Greece has exercised an enormous influence on the culture of many countries from ancient times until the present, particularly in the areas of sculpture and architecture. In the West, the art of the Roman Empire was largely derived from Greek models. In the East, Alexander the Great's conquests initiated several centuries of exchange between Greek, Central Asian and Indian cultures, resulting in Greco-Buddhist art, with ramifications as far as Japan. Following the Renaissance in Europe, the humanist aesthetic and the high technical standards of Greek art inspired generations of European artists. Pottery was either blue with black designs or black with blue designs.  Byzantine period  Mosaic of Daphni Monastery (ca. 1100) Byzantine art is the term created for the Eastern Roman Empire from about the 5th century until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. (The Roman Empire during this period is conventionally known as the Byzantine Empire.) The term can also be used for the art of states which were contemporary with the Byzantine Empire and shared a common culture with it, without actually being part of it, such as Bulgaria, or Russia, and also Venice, which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire despite being in other respects part of western European culture. It can also be used for the art of people of the former Byzantine Empire under the rule of Ottoman Empire after 1453. In some respects, the Byzantine artistic tradition has continued in Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day.C. Mango, ed., The art of the Byzantine Empire, 312-1453: sources and documents (Inglewood Cliffs, 1972) Byzantine art grew from the art of ancient Greece and, at least before 1453, never lost sight of its classical heritage, but was distinguished from it in a number of ways. The most profound of these was that the humanist ethic of ancient Greek art was replaced by the Christian ethic. If the purpose of classical art was the glorification of man, the purpose of Byzantine art was the glorification of God. In place of the nude, the figures of God the Father, Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and the saints and martyrs of Christian tradition were elevated and became the dominant - indeed almost exclusive - focus of Byzantine art. One of the most important forms of Byzantine art was, and still is, the Cretan school as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after Crete fell to the Ottomans in 1669. Like the Cretan school, it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing Western European artistic influence, and also saw the first signiand the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.Theodoros Stamos  Post-Byzantine and modern period  St Theodora icon by Emmanuel Tzanes, an example of the Cretan School Œóistoria (Allegory of History) by Nikolaos Gyzis (1892) Athena column by Leonidas Drosis in front of the Academy of Athens (modern) Cretan School describes the school of icon painting, also known as Post-Byzantine art, which flourished while Crete was under Venetian rule during the late Middle Ages, reaching its climax after the Fall of Constantinople, becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements; the most famous product of the school, El Greco, was the most successful of the many artists who tried to build a career in Western Europe, and also the one who left the Byzantine style farthest behind him in his later career. The Heptanese School of painting (, also known as the Ionian Islands' School) succeeded the Cretan School as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after Crete fell to the Ottomans in 1669. Like the Cretan school it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing Western European artistic influence, and also saw the first significant depiction of secular subjects. The school was based in the Ionian Islands, which were not part of Ottoman Greece, from the middle of the 17th century until the middle of the 19th century.archive.gr - ŒîŒπŒ±Œ¥œÅŒøŒºŒ≠œÇ œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒùŒµŒøŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ§Œ≠œáŒΩŒ∑ Modern Greek art, after the establishment of the Greek Kingdom, began to be developed around the time of Romanticism. Greek artists absorbed many elements from their European colleagues, resulting in the culmination of the distinctive style of Greek Romantic art, inspired by revolutionary ideals as well as the country's geography and history. After centuries of Ottoman rule, few opportunities for an education in the arts existed in the newly independent Greece, so studying abroad was imperative for artists. Munich, as an important international center for the arts at that time, was the place where the majority of the Greek artists of the 19th century chose to study. Later on, they would return to Greece and pass on their knowledge. Both academic and personal bonds developed between early Greek painters and Munich artistry giving birth to the Greek \\"Munich School\\" (Greek academic art of the 19th century). Nikolaos Gysis was an important teacher and artist at the Munich Academy and he soon became a leading figure among Greek artists. Many of these Munich School artists chose subjects such as everyday Greek life, local customs, and living conditions. Several important painters emerged at this time. Theodoros Vryzakis specialized in historical painting and especially inspired by the 1821 Greek War of Independence. Nikiphoros Lytras concentrated on realistic depictions of Greek life. Georgios Jakobides devoted his attention to infants and children and he would laterbecome the first Director of the new National Gallery of Athens. Georgios Roilos was another leading painter of the period closely associated with the Munich School, especially in his early career. Konstantinos Volanakis was inspired mostly by the Greek sea. Other notable painters of the era are Theodore Ralli, Ioannis Altamouras and the folk painter Theofilos Hatzimichail. Notable sculptors of the era are Leonidas Drosis (his major work was the extensive neo-classical architectural ornament at the Academy of Athens, Lazaros Sochos, Georgios Vitalis, Dimitrios Filippotis, Ioannis Kossos, Yannoulis Chalepas, Georgios Bonanos and Lazaros Fytalis.

She was first introduced in Fforde's first published novel, The Eyre Affair, released on 19 July 2001 by Hodder & Stoughton. , the series comprises seven books, in two series.Special features for First Among Sequels - note that a code word (from the novel) is required to access this page. The first series is made up of the novels The Eyre Affair, Lost in a Good Book, The Well of Lost Plots and Something Rotten. The second series is so far made up of First Among Sequels, One of Our Thursdays Is Missing and The Woman Who Died a Lot. Background Thursday is the daughter of Wednesday Next and Colonel Next (whose first name has not yet been revealed), a former agent with Special Operations Network department 12 (SO-12), the Chronoguard. She has two brothers, Anton and Joffy. Anton, however, was killed in the Crimean War. In her parallel universe, England is a republic, with George Formby as its first president, elected following the success of Operation Sea Lion (the mooted Nazi invasion of Great Britain), occupation, and liberation. There is no United Kingdom, and Wales is the independent \\"Socialist Republic of Wales\\". The Crimean War is still being waged in 1985, Russia still has a Czar, and the Whig Party still exists in the House of Commons. Genetic engineering is far more advanced than in our own timeline, and so Thursday has a pet dodo, Pickwick. Re-engineered mammoths can cause damage to local gardens if in their path, and there is a Neanderthal rights movement, given the resurrection of this kindred branch of human evolution. The duck is extinct in this universe. Computer and aviation technology are far behind our own timeline, with the transistor having never been invented (computers are still massive and run on vacuum tubes) and research into the jet engine unfunded as propeller and dirigible technology are viewed as 'good enough'. The Goliath Corporation is a megalithic company that appears to make many of the goods in this alternate world and also acts as a de facto shadow government, being able to take over important police investigations. In the world of Thursday Next, literature is a much more popular medium than in our world, and Thursday is a member of SO-27, the Literary Detectives or LiteraTecs. Her work is centred on Swindon, where she, her husband, infant, and mother live. The importance that literature has in this alternate England is reflected in the fact that so many people want to change their name to that of famous authors that some must be numbered, by law- e.g. John Milton 432. 'WillSpeak' machines are often to be found in public places, such as railway stations - these contain a mannequin of a Shakespearian character and will quote that character's most famous speeches upon payment. In addition, the line between literature and reality becomes increasingly thin, allowing characters in the books and those in 'real life' to jump in and out of novels. This leads Thursday to change the ending of Jane Eyre, the joke being that the plot we know in our reality is the far superior change caused by Thursday. This also happens to other classic novels: Uriah Heep becomes the obsequious, and generally insincere character we know, due to an accident inside the book world, and Thursday's uncle Mycroft becomes Sherlock Holmes's brother. Thursday also finds that the characters in novels are self-aware, knowing they are in a book. They make comments stating they are not needed until page 'such and such,' rather like actors in a play, and thus have time to help Thursday. The world of fiction has its own police force - Jurisfiction - to ensure that plots in books continue to run smoothly with each reading. Thursday ends up hiding in a book, and working for Jurisfiction. The book Caversham Heights is a detective novel featuring Detective Inspector Jack Spratt and his sergeant, Mary Mary, (listed as Mary Jones in WOLP) who swaps with Thursday. Spratt and Mary get their own Fforde series, The Nursery Crime Division books, and appear in The Big Over Easy and The Fourth Bear featuring crimes against characters in classic children's literature. Biography Thursday is in her mid-thirties at the start of the first book, and, by the end of it, had married Landen Parke-Laine. Thursday juggles her work in Swindon and the world of fiction, battling the machinations of the insidious Goliath Corporation, members of the Hades family and other evils at every turn. Her biographer and stalker, \\"Millon de Floss\\", reveals more about her life at the beginnings of chapters in The Eyre Affair, Lost in a Good Book, The Well of Lost Plots and Something Rotten. Her father, Colonel Next, is a rogue member of the ChronoGuard (SpecOps 12), a temporal policing agency, and officially does not exist, having been eradicated by his former bosses (using the simple but effective method of a timely knock on the door just before his conception; despite this, his children and grandchild still exist, likely due to Thursday's son Friday Next being the eventual head of the ChronoGuard, and/or the extensive powers of Colonel Next himself). The elder Next does, however, remain at large throughout the time-space continuum, and still frequently finds time to visit Thursday, usually by stopping time around her so they can talk without his being arrested by the ChronoGuard. Colonel Next's first name is unknown to everybody but him, a consequence of his eradication. Thursday has two brothers, Anton, who died in the Crimean War, and Joffy, who is a minister for the Global Standard Deity (GSD). Thursday also has a pet dodo called Pickwick. Although dodos had been extinct for some time, in Fforde's fictional universe they have been reintroduced through cloning, a popular hobby. Pickwick was 12 years old in 1985, when The Eyre Affair is set, and has some unusual characteristics, including missing wings. She is a version 1.2 dodo, and the DNA sequencing wasn't complete until the release of 1.7. Although initially Thursday Next believed Pickwick to be male, she later turned out to be female when she laid an egg. Her noise is represented as \\"plock plock\\" in the books. Around Thursday Next a fictional world has been created, reflected in several websites of the fictional organisations. Bookworld The BookWorld is a fictitious and complex environment that acts as a \\"behind-the-scenes\\" area of books. The BookWorld is most likely \\"created\\" by what is known as the Great Panjandrum, a person/thing that is thought to be of the highest of authority, yet is never present, acting as a god of sorts to the BookWorld. As the word panjandrum means someone in high authority, this reaffirms this possibility. Consisting of 52 levels total, the Great Library acts as a lobby of sorts for the BookWorld and serves as a public gateway onto any book ever created. 26 of the upper levels, organized according to the author's last name, are laid out in a cross shape, with 4 rows of book cases radiating from a central point. In order to determine whether bookjumping into a book of choice is deemed appropriate or not, the book cover is either green, for \\"open\\", or red for \\"unavailable\\". At the top of the Great Library is a large dome that appears to see a large forest like area below, with other Great Libraries in the distance; there being one for every language. The 26 basements, known as the Well of Lost Plots, hold unpublished works, although whether they are arranged alphabetically by level or not has yet to be discovered. Books which are not published are scrapped, and their text recycled for future works. The Cheshire Cat is the librarian of the Great Library, although due to redistricting in England since the book in which he appears was written, the Cheshire Cat is now known as the Cat Formerly Known as Cheshire, or Unitary Authority of Warrington Cat. The \\"engine room\\" of BookWorld, Text Grand Central uses so- called \\"storycode engines\\" to observe changes in books and allow the reader to read books using a complex \\"imaginotransference system\\" to supposedly continue the images being created in the reader's mind. Within the depths of the Well of Lost Plots, the Text Sea is the source of all text for all books, and is the general burial ground for all destroyed characters to be once more reduced to text. Composed of a random jumble of words and punctuation, words are \\"trawled\\" for using scrawltrawlers, the equivalent of large fishing boats that capture words. Communication Mass communication in the BookWorld is provided by footnoterphones and mobilefootnoterphones. Messages from others appear as footnotes in the text, the \\"number\\" of a footnoterphone being the chosen character's book, chapter, page number, paragraph, and line in a book. Connection between phones is created by hidden tunnel conduits that are invisible in the book, such tunnels spanning distances between other books and other genres. Connections can be crossed and filtered out using \\"textual sieves\\", which filter out all incoming text. Junkfootnoterphones are the \\"spam\\" messages of BookWorld, frequently appearing in the Well of Lost Plots. News is also put over footnoterphones, which can be turned on and off at will. Newspapers are the second choice at receiving news in BookWorld. The primary newspaper in the BookWorld is called The Word. Specific newsletters, such as Moveable Type, the official newsletter of Jurisfiction, may apply to certain groups of characters. Transportation While bookjumping appears to be a given talent to all fictional characters, the bookjumping ability is a rarity in those from outside BookWorld. Bookjumping involves \\"reading\\" yourself into a book, appearing in the storyline at the point read. Such natural talent or ability may be approved in some manner by teaching \\"quality\\" bookjumping, and bookjumping may be possible without reading the text aloud. In order to avoid potentially destroying a book's plot, however, one must be careful to avoid jumping directly into an area where the plot is occurring, although most bookjumps send the jumper to a place directly outside of the narrative area. A bookjump is characterized by a \\"fade out\\" of the character bookjumping. If a character can not or does not wish to bookjump, they will have to utilize a method of private transportation. The only such transportation known is that of TransGenre Taxis, a bookjumping taxi service that may be used for a monetary fee. Most unorganized crime takes place in the Well of Lost Plots, due to its lack of crime control in that area. Such common crime includes illegal selling of plot devices, characters, and others. Due to the frequent instability of much of the BookWorld, a public police agency, instated by the Council of Genres (See Government), uses bookjumping and other devices to keep the BookWorld under control. The central and only crime-preventing force, Jurisfiction has jurisdiction over nearly all areas of the BookWorld. Once having volunteered for Jurisfiction, the applicant then becomes an apprentice to a chosen Jurisfiction agent. All agents are given an essential TravelBook, a necessary item for all situations. Containing needed Jursifiction devices and a link back to the Great Library as well as other popular works of fiction, the TravelBook also acts as a guide to the BookWorld and is password protected to each individual member. Agents deemed appropriate are also given the password to an unpublished work that acts as a bestiary and a research faculty for BookWorld creatures. (See Creatures.) Upon passing a written exam and practical exam, an apprentice is given full agent status. Government While Jurisfiction is given a large amount of power in the BookWorld, the primary legislative government is the Council of Genres, made up of a representative from every genre in the BookWorld. Ruling upon various issues and creating ordinances to counteract them, there is no official executive of the Council of Genres. Concerning judiciary matters, the Council has no control. Courtroom scenes across the BookWorld are used for this purpose, the judge and jury of each scene presiding over the case at hand. Creatures Adjective-creating creatures and maggot-like in appearance, bookworms act as portable thesauri, changing common adjectives into others (for example \\"nice\\" into \\"amiable\\" or \\"attractive\\"). Their presence is welcome in most areas, however, should too many infest one area, the area uses too many adjectives and \\"flowery language\\", making the text unreadable. A variety of species occurring, the grammasite was a failed attempt to change nouns into verbs. Escaping from the experiment, their release resulted in a disaster, as they can contribute severe damage to a book. The known types of grammasites include adjectivores, which suck all description from an object, and verbisoids, as well as others. Verbisoids can be beaten by irregular verbs. Languages Although the actual language of the BookWorld is English, there are also other Great Libraries that are apparently completely other languages. The actual sublanguages of each BookWorld, however, are regarded as fonts. Thus (according to Bradshaw's BookWorld Companion) 'Courier Bold is the traditional language of those in the support industries such as within the Well of Lost Plots, and Lorem Ipsum is the gutter slang of the underworld - useful to have a few phrases in case you get into trouble in Horror or Noir'.Jasper Fforde, One of Our Thursdays is Missing (London 2011) p. 311 (Lorem ipsum is a dummy text used to demonstrate layout. It is the only language Friday Next speaks as a young child). Real World Allusions On his website Fforde reports that the Swindon Town Planning office, due to expansion and the need to name new streets, asked him if he would mind them using names of characters from his books. While Fforde seems to have written the page with his tongue in his cheek several new streets in the Orchid Vale area of Swindon have the names of literary characters that appear in the Thursday Next series.

This is the moment in Christian eschatology when Christ judges souls to send them to either Heaven or Hell.\\"doom: A painting of the Last Judgment on the chancel arch of a medieval parish church.\\"--E. Lucie- Smith, The Thames & Hudson Dictionary of Art Terms (1984); p. 68. The term remains capitalized, as the proper name of a specific incident more often than not. The subject was very commonly painted on a large scale on the western wall of churches, so it was viewed as people left the church, and the term is typically used of these, rather than depictions of the Last Judgement in other locations or media. Many examples survive as wall-paintings in medieval churches, most dating from around the 12th to 13th centuries, although the subject was common from the 1st millennium until (in countries remaining Catholic) the Counter-Reformation. Most dooms in English churches were destroyed by government authority during the English Reformation. The most famous of all Doom paintings, The Last Judgment by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, painted in 1537 to 1541, comes at the end of the tradition, and is unusually sited on the east wall behind the altar. The term \\"Doom\\" Doom or \\"the Doom\\" was a specific term for the Last Judgement and first cited to c. 1200 by the OED (\\"doom\\", 6), a sense surviving in this artistic meaning and in phrases such as the \\"crack of doom\\" and the word \\"doomsday\\", the latter going back to Old English. The original OED in the late 19th century already described this sense of \\"doom\\" as \\"archaic\\", but it remains in use in descriptions of (mostly) British medieval churches.OED \\"doom\\", 6; \\"doomsday\\" Purpose and iconography Dooms were encouraged by the early medieval Church as an instrument to highlight the contrasts between the reward of Heaven and the agony of Hell so as to guide Christians away from misbehaviour and sin. A Doom was usually positioned either on the rear (liturgical Western) wall, if that space was available, or at the front (Chancel end) of a church, often on the Chancel arch itself so that it would be constantly visible to worshippers as they faced the altar during services. Although there are many different versions, the composition stays broadly the same. On the left side of a Doom painting (that is, on Christ's right hand) is Heaven, whilst on the right (Christ's left) is Hell. At the top of the image Jesus Christ sits in glory with his right hand encouraging the saved upward, and his left hand pointing down to Hell for the damned. Typically flanking him is the Virgin Mary on his right and John the Apostle on his left, sometimes with the twenty-four elders mentioned in the Book of Revelation encircling the three of them. The angels blow trumpets to raise the dead for judgment. Commonly the Archangel Michael is in the centre, with the scales he will use to weigh the souls of humanity to see if individually they are fit for Heaven: one person is on one side of the scale while demonic creatures that represent the sins committed by the person are on the other side of the scale. The creatures try to tip the scales in their favour while, in some versions of the painting, the Virgin Mary places a rosary next to the person she wishes to protect, or puts her hand on the scale to counterbalance the demons. In some other versions, while one of the saved enters Heaven, a demon tries to pull them in with the damned, while an angel fights the demon for the soul. Those who are worthy are brought to the gates of Heaven, frequently represented by a castle with large walls built to keep out sinful impurities. This is most commonly depicted on the left hand side of Doom paintings. Groups of angels adorn the walls of Heaven celebrating the saved as they approach Heaven's gates, where Saint Peter waits with his keys. Those on the other side are deemed unworthy of Heaven, usually seized by demons and brought into the Hellmouth, beyond which, mostly out of sight, lie the bowels of hell. A decisive factor in the Doom or Last Judgement will be the question, if the corporal works of mercy were practiced or not during lifetime. They rate as important acts of charity. Therefore, and according to the biblical sources (Mt 5:31-46), the conjunction of the Last Judgement and the works of mercy is very frequent in the pictorial tradition of Christian art.Ralf van B√ºhren, Caravaggio‚Äôs ‚ÄòSeven Works of Mercy‚Äô in Naples.

He was the son-in-law of Noah Webster and edited his Dictionary after his father-in-law's death. Family Goodrich was the son of Elizur and Anne Willard (Allen) Goodrich. His father was a lawyer and member of the United States House of Representatives. He was also the grandson of the Reverend Elizur Goodrich. His uncle, also named Chauncey Goodrich, was also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and a U.S. senator from Connecticut. Biography Marble bust of Chauncey Allen Goodrich, by Chauncey Ives, 1873. Yale University Art Gallery Chauncey Allen Goodrich graduated from Yale in 1810, served as tutor there in 1812-1814, and afterward studied theology. He settled in Middletown, Connecticut, in 1810 as pastor of the Congregational church there, but feeble health obliged him to leave in 1817. In 1820 he was chosen president of Williams College, but declined the office. He was professor of rhetoric and oratory in Yale from 1817 until 1839 when he was transferred to the chair of pastoral theology in that institution, which chair he held till his death. Dr. Goodrich exerted a wide influence, and co-operated with many learned societies. As a teacher he inspired his pupils to the highest effort. He was a liberal benefactor of the Yale Divinity School. The degree of D.D. was conferred on him by Brown University in 1835. Dr. Goodrich made numerous contributions to periodical literature, and in 1829 established the Christian Quarterly Spectator, with which he was connected nearly ten years, being its sole editor after 1830. While a tutor at Yale, Dr. Goodrich published a Greek grammar (1814) based on the grammar by C.F. Hachenberg, and in 1830, at the request of President Timothy Dwight, he prepared a textbook, Greek and Latin Lessons (1832), which was extensively used in New England. Soon after the publication of the American Dictionary, by his father-in-law, Noah Webster (1828), Dr. Goodrich was entrusted by its author with power to superintend an abridgment of the work, which he did, conforming the orthography more nearly to the common standard. This edition, in the preparation of which he was assisted by Benjamin Silliman, Denison Olmsted, and others, was issued in 1847, and the ‚ÄúUniversal‚Äù edition of the same work appeared in 1856. In 1859 the supplement was issued, to which comprehensive additions were made. At the time of his death Dr. Goodrich was engaged on a radical revision of the dictionary, but he died before the work received its final form, and it was published under the supervision of Noah Porter (1864). He was also engaged in preparing a new edition of the Bible, with English text, as one of the American Bible society's ‚Äúcommittee on versions.‚Äù Dr. Goodrich was also the author of Select British Eloquence (1852). A commemorative discourse by President Theodore D. Woolsey has been published as a pamphlet (New Haven, 1860). Goodrich Street, a principal thoroughfare linking Prospect Street and Dixwell Avenue along the division between northern New Haven and southern Hamden in Connecticut, is named for him.

With this, one node on a network can have multiple connections to a network, each serving a different purpose. In the Linux kernel, it was first implemented by Juan Jos√© Ciarlante in 1995. On Solaris this was called logical network interface and was first available in Solaris 2.5 in 1995. It has also been possible in Microsoft Windows NT since (at least) Windows NT 3.51, released in 1995. IP aliasing can be used to provide multiple network addresses on a single physical interface. This demonstrates using IP version 4 addresses only. One reason for using this could be to make a computer look as though it is multiple computers, so for example you could have one server that is acting as both a gateway (router) and a DHCP server and DNS using three different IP addresses, perhaps with a future plan to use a hardware router and to move the functionality to separate DNS and DHCP servers. Or indeed the opposite you could decide to replace the three different hardware devices with a single server to reduce the administration overhead. In this case you can have three different addresses which are all on the same computer without having to install many physical network interfaces. Another reason is that you want to have the computer on two different logical network subnets whilst using a single physical interface.

He was a member of the House of Babenberg. Like his predecessors, he attempted to develop the land by founding monasteries. His most important foundation is Lilienfeld in the Lower Austrian valley of the Traisen river, where he was buried after his death. Besides that, he supported the then highly modern Mendicant Orders of the Franciscans and Dominicans.  Life  Leopold VI was the younger son of Duke Leopold V and his wife, Helena of Hungary (daughter of G√©za II of Hungary and Euphrosyne of Kiev). He was betrothed to the Damsel of Cyprus in 1193, but the marriage never took place. In contravention of the provisions of the Georgenberg Pact, the Babenberg reign was divided after the death of Leopold V: Leopold VI's elder brother, Frederick I, was given the Duchy of Austria (corresponding roughly to modern Lower Austria and eastern Upper Austria), while Leopold VI himself became Duke of Styria. Both duchies were reunified under Leopold VI when Frederick died after only four years of rule. Leopold VI participated in the Reconquista in Spain and in two crusades, the Albigensian Crusade in 1212 and the failed Fifth Crusade from 1217 to 1221, and‚Äîlike his predecessors‚Äîattempted to develop the land by founding monasteries.

He elevated Enns to the status of a city in 1212, and Vienna in 1221, the territory of which was nearly doubled. Under Leopold's rule, the Gothic style began to reach Austria - the Cappella Speciosa in his temporary residence of Klosterneuburg is known as the first building influenced by it in the Danube area - a reconstruction of it can be seen today in the palace gardens of Laxenburg. Babenbergian Austria reached the zenith of its prestige under Leopold's rule. Evidence of this is given by his marriage to the Byzantine princess Theodora Angelina and his attempt to mediate between Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and Pope Gregory IX, which he was working on when he died in 1230 in Italy. Leopold's court is known as a center of the Minnesang, e.g., Walther von der Vogelweide, Neidhart von Reuental and Ulrich von Liechtenstein were active here. Also, the Nibelungenlied may have been written in his court. Leopold died at San Germano in 1230.

Biography Bachelor of Arts degree, Elizur Goodrich Sr., father of Elizur Goodrich, Yale College, 1752 Born in Durham in the Connecticut Colony, he was the son of Elizur Goodrich. He graduated from Yale College in 1779, was a tutor there from 1781 to 1783, and studied law. After his was admitted to the bar in 1783, he began the practice of law in New Haven. He served in the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1795 to 1802 and was its Clerk for six sessions and its Speaker for two. In the 1796 United States presidential election he was a Federalist elector for President, supporting Federalist candidate John Adams against Democratic-Republican Party candidate Thomas Jefferson. He was elected to represent Connecticut At-Large to the Sixth and Seventh Congresses, but only served in the Sixth Congress from March 4, 1799 to March 3, 1801 because President John Adams appointed him collector of customs for the Port of New Haven. After a short time he was removed from the office of collector by Adams' successor, President Thomas Jefferson. The discussion of this act elicited from Jefferson a letter in which he avowed his approval of removal for political opinions. Goodrich was elected to the Governor's Council in Connecticut in 1803, serving until 1818. He taught law at Yale from 1801 to 1810 and was probate judge from 1802 to 1818.

Formed under the Local Government Act 1972, it came into being on 1 April 1974 and is governed by Thanet District Council. On the north eastern tip of Kent, it is predominantly coastal, with north, east and southeast facing coastlines, and is bordered by the City of Canterbury district to the west and the Dover district to the south. The main towns are Margate, Ramsgate and Broadstairs. History The Isle of Thanet is the major part of the district. Formed over 7,000 years ago and separated from the mainland by the Wantsum Channel, it has always borne the brunt of invasions from the Continent. An Isle of Thanet Rural District had existed from the Local Government Act 1894 until it was abolished in 1935 to form part of Eastry Rural District. The current District was formed in 1974, by the addition of the area over which was once the Wantsum Channel, including the settlement of Sarre. Governance The District Council is held by a Labour minority, following a coup led by an Independent member to remove the Conservative Leader Cllr Bob Bayford. There are two MPs for Thanet: *Roger Gale, Conservative MP for North Thanet, *Craig MacKinlay, Conservative MP for South Thanet. The names of the civil parishes located in the district are: *Acol *Birchington *Cliffsend *Manston *Minster *Monkton *St Nicholas-at-Wade Broadstairs and St Peter's form Broadstairs and St Peter's, served by a town council, which has no more than the powers of a parish council. A town council was created for Ramsgate in 2009.The District of Thanet (Reorganisation of Community Governance) Order 2009 Retrieved 19 May 2010 The town of Margate is an unparished area: it has a charter maintained by charter trustees, having been a municipal borough before 1974. Demography According to the 2011 census, the population of Thanet was 134,186, an increase of about 6000 in the ten years since the previous census. Economy The whole district suffers from seasonal unemployment, in spite of its proximity to London, because of various factors, among them being inward migration, high numbers of old people, and low numbers of affluent people. It is not helped by poor overall indicators for health.Association of Public Health Observatories - Health Profiles APHO Health Profiles In a study of resilience to economic downturns, Thanet was poorly rated at 295th out of 324 districts. Unemployment levels are nearly twice the South East of England as a whole, and as a result a great deal of planning is being done to encourage more businesses to relocate to the District. The Thanet & East Kent Chamber produces a weekly business digest, the Thanet & East Kent Insider, which reports on economic activity in the private and public sectors. New projects underway include: A new community centre for Broadstairs. Redevelopment and renovations are to be undertaken at Margate's Dreamland (a Heritage Amusement Park); Cliftonville (Lido site); and a Holiday Inn (hotel), now open. A large retail and residential development on Ramsgate seafront, known as Royal Sands, started construction in 2011 but was quickly halted. A multimillion-pound art gallery The Turner Contemporary (opened by Tracey Emin in April 2011) in Margate and this has created the opening of many new shops in the Margate old town and visitor numbers have far exceeded expectation. Margate has been chosen as a Mary Portas retail town. Massive investment and building work is taking place in schools across the island. In addition, the District Council has introduced an empty property initiative and has compulsory purchased empty and derelict buildings with the objective of bringing them back into use. The Thanet Offshore Wind Project, near North Foreland, began operating in September 2010. The project is expected to have a total capacity of up to 300 MW which, on average, is sufficient to supply approximately 240,000 homes with green energy. The project will thus make a significant contribution to the government's national and regional renewable energy targets. Thanet Earth is the largest greenhouse development in the UK, covering an area of 91 hectares with 7 greenhouses each the size of 10 football pitches producing cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers all year. Margate, Ramsgate and Broadstairs each have shopping centres with a mix of local and national retailers complemented by Northdown Road, Cliftonville, Westgate and Birchington. Westwood at the centre of Thanet has seen much major development in recent years with the building of Westwood Cross shopping centre which is the home of national retailers and several restaurant chains including a Travelodge hotel. Associated development has taken place around the shopping centre spawning other retail parks. National retailer Primark opened a new superstore in October 2012, the largest Primark store in Kent. Transport \\"Javelin\\" trains. The rail connections are via the Chatham Main Line through Margate to Ramsgate, and the Ashford to Ramsgate (via Canterbury West) line. New high-speed rail links from London to Thanet began in December 2009, and it is now possible to travel from Margate to St Pancras railway station at an average speed of 96 kmh (around 60 mph); maximum speed of 225 km/h (around 140 mph). This will form part of the UK's first true high- speed commuter service, according to the South Eastern Railway Company. Main road links are the A28 which brings traffic from Canterbury and Ashford; and the A299, north coast route. The Saxon Shore Way Long distance footpath skirts the coast. There is an airport, now closed, at Manston, formerly RAF Manston, but later renamed by its commercial operators as Kent International Airport. The airport closed permanently on 15 May 2014. Because it was used as a U.S. airbase during the Second World War it has one of the longest runways in the UK, and while open it was designated by the United Nations as an emergency landing site for aircraft in trouble. Ferry services are no longer running from the Port of Ramsgate, and the council is currently in dispute with the former operators over the payment of ¬£3.3 million Health Thanet has a large hospital: the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital, known as the QEQM. Extension work which started in 2007 has made the QEQM a major hospital site. As of July 2010, overall indicators of health are poor for Thanet:Association of Public Health Observatories, Thanet Health Profile , July 2010 * Health is worse in Thanet than in England on average * Life expectancy is lower than for England * There are health inequalities: in deprived areas life expectancy is 5 years lower for women and 10 years lower for men * Teenage pregnancies are high compared to the England average * Estimated smoking rates are average but death rates from smoking are significantly higher * Binge drinking is around the national average * Children are significantly less active than average * Significantly higher than average number of people admitted to hospital for alcohol-specific conditions * Significantly higher than average rate of diabetes * Significantly higher than average rate of mental health problems Media Local newspapers are the Thanet Extra, part of the KM Group; Isle of Thanet Gazette and Thanet Times (merged with Adscene, October 2009), (the Thanet Times was withdrawn in October 2012) all owned by Northcliffe Media; and the midweek Your Thanet published online by KOS Media. The county-wide newspaper Kent on Saturday also serves the district. Local radio stations are; *KMFM Thanet (previously known as Thanet Local Radio) owned by the KM Group. (All Programmes are networked with other KM Kent stations). *Community non- commercial station Academy FM Thanet on 107.8FM and online and via mobile app it broadcasts from within Marlowe Academy, Ramsgate. *The county-wide Heart Kent *BBC Radio Kent National TV stations carry regional news: The ITV1 service is provided currently by Meridian Broadcasting; and the BBC South East Today. Thanet also has a local online radio and podcasting service currently operating online only known as 'Thanet Community Radio' (TCR). The station works closely with Dover-based 'Dover Community Radio' (DCR) which operates in a similar way. Education Margate Adult Education Centre, built in 1928 as Thanet School of Art. Thanet has a wide variety of local schools including approximately 41 primary schools such as Drapers Mills, Palm Bay, and Upton. Outstanding secondary schools include Dane Court Grammar, and Chatham and Clarendon Grammar. The community learning within the district is varied and wide, including charitable training organisations such as East Kent ITeC Ltd, and organisations such as Margate Adult Education Centre, Thanet Skills Studio and Thanet Stage School. East Kent College is a provider of further education in Thanet and a Training Provider that works with local businesses to raise the level of education across the region. Canterbury Christ Church University currently has a campus in Broadstairs, serving Media, Art and Design subjects. Climate Thanet enjoys a maritime climate, being surrounded on three sides by the sea. This generally results in mild winters and warm, dry summers.

This process was originally invented by Mary Somerville who presented her research to Sir John Herschel (who is often misquoted as the inventor) in 1842. An emulsion is made from crushed flower petals or any other light-sensitive plant, fruit or vegetable. A coated sheet of paper is then dried. Place some material, for example leaves or a transparent photo positive on the paper and expose to direct full sunlight until the image part not covered by the material is bleached out by the sun rays. The color remains in the shadowed parts. The paper remains sensitive against such rays. History The photo-sensitive properties of plants and vegetables have been known to scholars for centuries. Among many early observations the experiments of Henri August Vogel in Paris are of particular interest. He discovered in 1816: An alcoholic tincture of either red carnations, violets or corn poppy turned white behind blue glass in a few days, while it remained unchanged behind red glass after about the same time. Cotton and paper colored with these tinctures exhibited the same differences. Later that century Herschel attempted to invent a color process, he tried several flower and plant emulsions and published his findings. His research resulted in the anthotype process. His research into making photographic images from flowers was limited and was ultimately abandoned since no commercial application was feasible from a process which takes days to produce an image. The process continued to be listed in photographic literature of the time but was likely little used. Over time the process has earned a misleading reputation for being simply too impractical. Image permanence have been brought into question to this day but this problem seems to be mostly related to choice of flower or plant matter. How it works Other flower suggestions Henry H. Snelling writes based on his research: \\"Viola odorata-- or sweet scented violet, yields to alcohol a rich blue color, which it imparts in high perfection to paper. Senecio Splendens -- or double purple groundsel, yields a beautiful color to paper.\\" Bingham, quoting by Sir John Herschel, recommends Corchorus japonicus flower (japanese Jute) for a \\"fine yellow colour\\" that \\"upon exposure to sunlight, it is in about half an hour rendered quite white\\".

It is located in Tonga's southern island group, to which it gives its name, and is the country's most populous island, with 74,611 residents (2016), 70.5% of the national population, on . Its maximum elevation is above sea level. Tongatapu is Tonga's centre of government and the seat of its monarchy. Tongatapu has experienced more rapid economic development than the other islands of the Kingdom, and has thus attracted many internal migrants from them. Geography Map of Tongatapu The island is (or including neighbouring islands) and rather flat, as it is built of coral limestone. The island is covered with thick fertile soil consisting of volcanic ash from neighboring volcanoes. At the steep coast of the south, heights reach an average of gradually decreasing towards the north. 'Atata Island, about a 30-minute boat ride from Tongatapu.

The almost completely closed Fanga'uta and Fangakakau Lagoons are important breeding grounds for birds and fish as they live within the mangroves growing around the lagoon's shores. The lagoons were declared a Natural Reserve in 1974 by the government. Climate Tongatapu has a rather cooler climate than the rest of Tonga as it is the southernmost group of islands in the country. Because of this, fruit production is lower in Tongatapu than it is in the warmer islands in the north. History People of the Lapita culture Tongatapu is known as having one of the highest concentration of archaeological remains in the Pacific. The earliest traces of Lapita pottery found in Tonga was from around 900‚Äì850 BCE, 300 years after the first settlements in Tonga were established. Archaeologist David Burley discovered the pottery around the Fanga'uta Lagoon, away from the Lapita pottery found at Santa Cruz in the Solomon Islands. Although Tonga was always the seat of the Tongan Empire, but in an area of distances up to , it was often only a symbolic rule. From the first capital at Toloa, around 1000 years ago, to the second capital at HeketƒÅ, at the site of the Ha'amonga 'a Maui Trilithon, none boasts more traditional attractions than the third capital at Mu'a (from 1220‚Äì1851) with more than 20 royal grave mounds. Europeans Royal Palace. Tongatapu was first sighted by Europeans on 20 January 1643 by Abel Janszoon Tasman commanding two ships, the Heemskerck and the Zeehaen commissioned by the Dutch East India Company of Batavia (Jakarta). The expedition's goals were to chart the unknown southern and eastern seas and to find a possible passage through the South Pacific and Indian Ocean providing a faster route to Chile. The expedition set sail from Batavia on 14 August 1642. Tasman named the island \\"t‚Äô Eijlandt Amsterdam\\" (Amsterdam Island), because of its abundance of supplies. This name is no longer used except by historians. Captain James Cook, sailing the British vessel Resolution visited the island on October 2, 1773 by some accounts and by other accounts October 1774, returning again in 1777 , with Omai, whereupon they left some cattle for breeding. These were still flourishing in 1789 when Bounty, under Fletcher Christian visited. The earliest mention of the name Tongatapu (spelled \\"Tongataboo\\") was by Captain Cook in 1777, as he wrote his memoirs for the Three Voyages Around the World, Volume 1. British and American whalers were regular visitors to the island for provisions, water and wood. The first on record was the Hope, in April‚ÄìMay 1807. The last known to have called was the Albatross in November‚ÄìDecember 1899.Langdon, Robert (ed.)

Later life After recovering from his injuries, H√∂hnel became an officer on board the corvette SMS Donau, and traveled in 1897 to the Mediterranean and along the coast of West Africa south to Cameroon, then across the Atlantic to the Caribbean, and to New York and Newport, Rhode Island. During the trip, the ship's captain suffered a heart attack and H√∂hnel was made provisional commandant until June 1898. Also on this voyage he met the future US president Theodore Roosevelt, who was then in his words the 'much feared' police commissioner of New York. After this, H√∂hnel was assigned as officer of the deck to the central battery ship , whose executive officer was Commander Anton Haus, the future commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. In 1899 H√∂hnel became Emperor Franz Joseph's aide-de-camp and later (1905‚Äì09) led an official Austro-Hungarian delegation to Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia. He also commanded the Austro-Hungarian cruiser in a voyage to Australia and Polynesia. H√∂hnel was instrumental in introducing the chamois into New Zealand, negotiating the acquisition in 1905 of six does and two bucks from Neuberg in Austria.

After studying law, he was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1781, practicing in Hartford. He served in the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1793 to 1794, when he was elected as a Federalist to the Fourth Congress from the Second District of Connecticut. He was re-elected to the Fifth and Sixth Congresses, serving from March 4, 1795 to March 3, 1801. In the Sixth Congress, he served with his brother Elizur Goodrich. Returning to Connecticut, he resumed his law practice and was on the Governor's Council from 1802 to 1807. The Connecticut General Assembly elected him to the United States Senate to complete the term of Uriah Tracy, who died, and re-elected him to a full term. On June 17, 1812, he voted against war with Britain, but the vote for war was 19 to 13. He served in the Senate in the Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Congresses from October 25, 1807 to May 1813 when he resigned to become Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut. He was elected to that office in 1813, having also been elected Mayor of Hartford in 1812. He served as both Mayor and Lieutenant Governor until his death in Hartford. In 1814-15 he was a Connecticut delegate to the Hartford Convention.

The treaty consisted of two parts. The first part was an agreement under which the childless and deathly ill Ottokar IV, the first and last Styrian duke from the Otakar dynasty who had contracted leprosy while on the Third Crusade, was to pass his duchy to the Austrian duke Leopold V and to his son Frederick from the Franconian Babenberg dynasty, under the stipulation that Austria and Styria would henceforth remain united forever. The second part consists of a delineation of rights of the Styrian estates and citizens. It has been incorrectly called by English-speaking historians a \\"Styrian Magna Carta\\", for it sought to maintain the rights of the Styrian ministeriales in anticipation of the Babenberg acquisition.Freed, p. 83, note 64 The territory of Styria at the time went far beyond the modern Austrian state of Styria, and included lands not only in modern Slovenia (Lower Styria), but also in Upper Austria, more precisely the Traungau region around the cities of Wels and Steyr, as well as the present-day districts of Wiener Neustadt and Neunkirchen in Lower Austria. The case of succession came to pass upon Ottokar's death in 1192, Styria has since then remained connected to Austria. The treaty was acknowledged by Emperor Frederick II in 1237.Freed, p. 182 It was continued under the rule of the Habsburg dynasty after the line of Babenberg dukes became extinct in 1246; despite several interludes when the Styrian lands were ruled by Inner Austrian cadet branches. The Georgenberg Pact thus was the first step towards the creation of a complex of \\"hereditary lands\\" of the Habsburg Monarchy. The Pact formed an integral part of the Austrian constitution until the Revolutions of 1848. The original document is kept at the Styrian State Archive in Graz. Notes References Freed, John B.

There has been little agreement on the precise definition of automatic programming, mostly because its meaning has changed over time. David Parnas, tracing the history of \\"automatic programming\\" in published research, noted that in the 1940s it described automation of the manual process of punching paper tape. Later it referred to translation of high-level programming languages like Fortran and ALGOL. In fact, one of the earliest programs identifiable as a compiler was called Autocode.

After following these steps to implement mathematical routines, a sub-routine library, and sorting programs, our task was to look at the larger programming process. We needed to understand how we might reuse tested code and have the machine help in programming. As we programmed, we examined the process and tried to think of ways to abstract these steps to incorporate them into higher-level language.

Source- code generation Source-code generation is the process of generating source code based on a description of the problem or an ontological model such as a template and is accomplished with a programming tool such as a template processor or an integrated development environment (IDE). These tools allow the generation of source code through any of various means. Modern programming languages are well supported by tools like Json4Swift (Swift) and Json2Kotlin (Kotlin). Programs that could generate COBOL code include: * the DYL250/DYL260/DYL270/DYL280 series * Business Controls Corporation's SB-5 * Peat Marwick Mitchell's PMM2170 application-program-generator package These application generators supported COBOL inserts and overrides.

Built in 1156 by the Bhati Rajput ruler Jaisal, Jaisalmer Fort, situated on Meru Hill and named as Trikoot Garh has been the scene of many battles. Its massive sandstone walls are a tawny lion colour during the day, turning to a magical honey-gold as the sun sets. The famous Indian film director Satyajit Ray wrote a detective novel and later turned it into a film ‚àí Sonar Kella (The Golden Fortress) which was based on this fort. About a quarter of city's population still live inside the fort. The main attractions inside the fort are: Raj Mahal (Royal palace), Jain temples and the Laxminath temple. Jain heritage of Jaisalmer Jaisalmer has been enriched by its Jain community, which has adorned the city with beautiful temples, notably the temples dedicated to the 16th Tirthankara, Shantinath, and 23rd Tirthankara, Parshvanath. There are seven Jain temples in total which are situated within the Jaisalmer fort built during the 12th and 15th centuries. Among these temples, the biggest is the Paraswanath Temple; the others are Chandraprabhu temple, Rishabdev temple, Shitalnath Temple, Kunthunath Temple, and Shantinath Temple. Known for their exquisite work of art and architecture that was predominant in the medieval era the temples are built out of yellow sandstone and have intricate engravings on them. Jaisalmer has some of the oldest libraries of India which contain rarest of the manuscripts and artefacts of Jain tradition.

The basis for modern dental implants is a biologic process called osseointegration, in which materials such as titanium form an intimate bond to bone. The implant fixture is first placed so that it is likely to osseointegrate, then a dental prosthetic is added. A variable amount of healing time is required for osseointegration before either the dental prosthetic (a tooth, bridge or denture) is attached to the implant or an abutment is placed which will hold a dental prosthetic/crown. Success or failure of implants depends on the health of the person receiving the treatment, drugs which affect the chances of osseointegration, and the health of the tissues in the mouth. The amount of stress that will be put on the implant and fixture during normal function is also evaluated. Planning the position and number of implants is key to the long-term health of the prosthetic since biomechanical forces created during chewing can be significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and angle of adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using computed tomography with CAD/CAM simulations and surgical guides called stents. The prerequisites for long-term success of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy bone and gingiva. Since both can atrophy after tooth extraction, pre- prosthetic procedures such as sinus lifts or gingival grafts are sometimes required to recreate ideal bone and gingiva. The final prosthetic can be either fixed, where a person cannot remove the denture or teeth from their mouth, or removable, where they can remove the prosthetic. In each case an abutment is attached to the implant fixture. Where the prosthetic is fixed, the crown, bridge or denture is fixed to the abutment either with lag screws or with dental cement. Where the prosthetic is removable, a corresponding adapter is placed in the prosthetic so that the two pieces can be secured together. The risks and complications related to implant therapy divide into those that occur during surgery (such as excessive bleeding or nerve injury), those that occur in the first six months (such as infection and failure to osseointegrate) and those that occur long-term (such as peri-implantitis and mechanical failures). In the presence of healthy tissues, a well-integrated implant with appropriate biomechanical loads can have 5-year plus survival rates from 93 to 98 percent and 10 to 15 year lifespans for the prosthetic teeth. Long-term studies show a 16- to 20-year success (implants surviving without complications or revisions) between 52% and 76%, with complications occurring up to 48% of the time. Medical uses The primary use of dental implants is to support dental prosthetics (i.e. false teeth). Modern dental implants make use of osseointegration, the biologic process where bone fuses tightly to the surface of specific materials such as titanium and some ceramics. The integration of implant and bone can support physical loads for decades without failure. The US has seen an increasing use of dental implants, with usage increasing from 0.7% of patients missing at least one tooth (1999 - 2000), to 5.7% (2015 - 2016), and was projected to potentially reach 26% in 2026. Implants are used to replace missing individual teeth (single tooth restorations), multiple teeth, or to restore edentulous dental arches (implant retained fixed bridge, implant-supported overdenture). Do note that alternative treatments to tooth loss are available (see Missing tooth replacement, Tooth Loss). Dental implants are also used in orthodontics to provide anchorage (orthodontic mini implants). An evolving field is the use of implants to retain obturators (removable prosthesis used to fill a communication between the oral and maxillary or nasal cavities). Facial prosthetics, used to correct facial deformities (e.g. from cancer treatment or injuries) can use connections to implants placed in the facial bones. Depending on the situation the implant may be used to retain either a fixed or removable prosthetic that replaces part of the face. Single tooth implant restoration Single tooth restorations are individual freestanding units not connected to other teeth or implants, used to replace missing individual teeth. For individual tooth replacement, an implant abutment is first secured to the implant with an abutment screw. A crown (the dental prosthesis) is then connected to the abutment with dental cement, a small screw, or fused with the abutment as one piece during fabrication. Dental implants, in the same way, can also be used to retain a multiple tooth dental prosthesis either in the form of a fixed bridge or removable dentures. There is limited evidence that implant-supported single crowns perform better than tooth-supported fixed partial dentures (FPDs) on a long-term basis. However, taking into account the favorable cost-benefit ratio and the high implant survival rate, dental implant therapy is the first-line strategy for single-tooth replacement. Implants preserve the integrity of the teeth adjacent to the edentulous area, and it has been shown that dental implant therapy is less costly and more efficient over time than tooth-supported FPDs for the replacement of one missing tooth. The major disadvantage of dental implant surgery is the need for a surgical procedure. Implant retained fixed bridge / implant supported bridge An implant supported bridge (or fixed denture) is a group of teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. They are similar to conventional bridges, except that the prosthesis is supported and retained by one or more implants instead of natural teeth. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments in the same way as a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer. Implant-supported overdenture A removable implant supported denture (also an implant supported overdenture) is a removable prosthesis which replaces teeth, using implants to improve support, retention and stability. They are most commonly complete dentures (as opposed to partial), used to restore edentulous dental arches. The dental prosthesis can be disconnected from the implant abutments with finger pressure by the wearer. To enable this, the abutment is shaped as a small connector (a button, ball, bar or magnet) which can be connected to analogous adapters in the underside of the dental prosthesis. Orthodontic mini-implants (TAD) Dental implants are used in orthodontic patients to replace missing teeth (as above) or as a temporary anchorage device (TAD) to facilitate orthodontic movement by providing an additional anchorage point. For teeth to move, a force must be applied to them in the direction of the desired movement. The force stimulates cells in the periodontal ligament to cause bone remodeling, removing bone in the direction of travel of the tooth and adding it to the space created. In order to generate a force on a tooth, an anchor point (something that will not move) is needed. Since implants do not have a periodontal ligament, and bone remodelling will not be stimulated when tension is applied, they are ideal anchor points in orthodontics. Typically, implants designed for orthodontic movement are small and do not fully osseointegrate, allowing easy removal following treatment. They are indicated when needing to shorten treatment time, or as an alternative to extra-oral anchorage. Mini-implants are frequently placed between the roots of teeth, but may also be sited in the roof of the mouth. They are then connected to a fixed brace to help move the teeth.  Small Diameter Implants (Mini Implants)  The introduction of small-diameter implants has provided dentists the means of providing edentulous and partially edentulous patients with immediate functioning transitional prostheses while definitive restorations are being fabricated. Many clinical studies have been done on the success of long term usage of these implants. Based on the findings of many studies, mini dental implants exhibit excellent survival rates in the short to medium term (3-5 years). They appear to be a reasonable alternative treatment modality to retain mandibular complete overdentures from the available evidence. Composition A typical conventional implant consists of a titanium screw (resembling a tooth root) with a roughened or smooth surface. The majority of dental implants are made of commercially pure titanium, which is available in four grades depending upon the amount of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron contained.Arturo N. Natali (ed.) (2003). \\"Dental Biomechanics\\". Taylor & Francis, London / New York, 273 pp., , pp. 69-87. Cold work hardened CP4 (maximum impurity limits of N .05 percent, C .10 percent, H .015 percent, Fe .50 percent, and O .40 percent) is the most commonly used titanium for implants. Grade 5 titanium, Titanium 6AL-4V (signifying the titanium alloy containing 6 percent aluminium and 4 percent vanadium alloy) is slightly harder than CP4 and used in the industry mostly for abutment screws and abutments. Most modern dental implants also have a textured surface (through etching, anodic oxidation or various- media blasting) to increase the surface area and osseointegration potential of the implant. If C.P. titanium or a titanium alloy has more than 85% titanium content, it will form a titanium-biocompatible titanium oxide surface layer or veneer that encloses the other metals, preventing them from contacting the bone. Ceramic (zirconia-based) implants exist in one-piece (combining the screw and the abutment) or two-piece systems - the abutment being either cemented or screwed - and might lower the risk for peri‚Äêimplant diseases, but long-term data on success rates is missing. Technique Planning General considerations Planning for dental implants focuses on the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of the bones of the jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long- term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants. It has been suggested that radiotherapy can negatively affect the survival of implants. Nevertheless, a systemic study published in 2016 concluded that dental implants installed in the irradiated area of an oral cavity may have a high survival rate, provided that the patient maintains oral hygiene measures and regular follow ups to prevent complications. Biomechanical considerations The long-term success of implants is determined, in part, by the forces they have to support. As implants have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of implants is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the bottom jaw have lower failure rates than implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on implants and increase the likelihood of failures. The design of implants has to account for a lifetime of real-world use in a person's mouth. Regulators and the dental implant industry have created a series of tests to determine the long-term mechanical reliability of implants in a person's mouth where the implant is struck repeatedly with increasing forces (similar in magnitude to biting) until it fails. When a more exacting plan is needed beyond clinical judgment, the dentist will make an acrylic guide (called a stent) prior to surgery which guides optimal positioning of the implant. Increasingly, dentists opt to get a CT scan of the jaws and any existing dentures, then plan the surgery on CAD/CAM software. The stent can then be made using stereolithography following computerized planning of a case from the CT scan. The use of CT scanning in complex cases also helps the surgeon identify and avoid vital structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the sinus. Bisphosphonate drugs The use of bone building drugs, like bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL drugs require special consideration with implants, because they have been associated with a disorder called Medication- associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). The drugs change bone turnover, which is thought to put people at risk for death of bone when having minor oral surgery. At routine doses (for example, those used to treat routine osteoporosis) the effects of the drugs linger for months or years but the risk appears to be very low. Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, discussed that the risk of BRONJ from low dose oral therapy (or slow release injectable) as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those on steroids, those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high dose or high frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care. Otherwise, implants can generally be placed and the use of bisphosphonates does not appear to affect implant survival. Main surgical procedures Placing the implant Most implant systems have five basic steps for placement of each implant: # Soft tissue reflection: An incision is made over the crest of bone, splitting the thicker attached gingiva roughly in half so that the final implant will have a thick band of tissue around it. The edges of tissue, each referred to as a flap are pushed back to expose the bone. Flapless surgery is an alternate technique, where a small punch of tissue (the diameter of the implant) is removed for implant placement rather than raising flaps. # Drilling at high speed: After reflecting the soft tissue, and using a surgical guide or stent as necessary, pilot holes are placed with precision drills at highly regulated speed to prevent burning or pressure necrosis of the bone. # Drilling at low speed: The pilot hole is expanded by using progressively wider drills (typically between three and seven successive drilling steps, depending on implant width and length). Care is taken not to damage the osteoblast or bone cells by overheating. A cooling saline or water spray keeps the temperature low. # Placement of the implant: The implant screw is placed and can be self- tapping, otherwise the prepared site is tapped with an implant analog. It is then screwed into place with a torque controlled wrench at a precise torque so as not to overload the surrounding bone (overloaded bone can die, a condition called osteonecrosis, which may lead to failure of the implant to fully integrate or bond with the jawbone). # Tissue adaptation: The gingiva is adapted around the entire implant to provide a thick band of healthy tissue around the healing abutment. In contrast, an implant can be \\"buried\\", where the top of the implant is sealed with a cover screw and the tissue is closed to completely cover it. A second procedure would then be required to uncover the implant at a later date. Timing of implants after extraction of teeth There are different approaches to placement dental implants after tooth extraction. The approaches are: #Immediate post-extraction implant placement. #Delayed immediate post-extraction implant placement (two weeks to three months after extraction). #Late implantation (three months or more after tooth extraction). An increasingly common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes the placement of a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner. One versus two-stage surgery After an implant is placed, the internal components are covered with either a healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is flush with the surface of the dental implant, and is designed to be completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment. In the early stages of implant development (1970‚àí1990), implant systems used a two-stage approach, believing that it improved the odds of initial implant survival. Subsequent research suggests that no difference in implant survival existed between one-stage and two-stage surgeries, and the choice of whether or not to \\"bury\\" the implant in the first stage of surgery became a concern of soft tissue (gingiva) management When tissue is deficient or mutilated by the loss of teeth, implants are placed and allowed to osseointegrate, then the gingiva is surgically moved around the healing abutments. The down-side of a two-stage technique is the need for additional surgery and compromise of circulation to the tissue due to repeated surgeries. The choice of one or two-stages, now centers around how best to reconstruct the soft tissues around lost teeth. Additional surgical procedures For an implant to osseointegrate, it needs to be surrounded by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, it needs to have a thick healthy soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it. It is common for either the bone or soft tissue to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement. Hard tissue (bone) reconstruction Bone grafting is necessary when there is a lack of bone. Also, it helps to stabilize the implant by increasing survival of the implant and decreasing marginal bone level loss. While there are always new implant types, such as short implants, and techniques to allow compromise, a general treatment goal is to have a minimum of 10 mm in bone height, and 6 mm in width. Alternatively, bone defects are graded from A to D (A=10+ mm of bone, B=7‚Äì9 mm, C=4‚Äì6 mm and D=0‚Äì3 mm) where an implant's likelihood of osseointegrating is related to the grade of bone. To achieve an adequate width and height of bone, various bone grafting techniques have been developed. The most frequently used is called guided bone graft augmentation where a defect is filled with either natural (harvested or autograft) bone or allograft (donor bone or synthetic bone substitute), covered with a semi-permeable membrane and allowed to heal. During the healing phase, natural bone replaces the graft forming a new bony base for the implant. Three common procedures are: # Sinus lift # Lateral alveolar augmentation (increase in the width of a site) # Vertical alveolar augmentation (increase in the height of a site) Other, more invasive procedures, also exist for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and microvascular bone graft where the blood supply to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best is based on an assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2‚Äì3 mm loss), moderate (4‚Äì6 mm loss) or severe (greater than 6 mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation. Soft tissue (gingiva) reconstruction The gingiva surrounding a tooth has a 2‚Äì3 mm band of bright pink, very strong attached mucosa, then a darker, larger area of unattached mucosa that folds into the cheeks. When replacing a tooth with an implant, a band of strong, attached gingiva is needed to keep the implant healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva surrounding an implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on a tooth (a longer biologic width). When an adequate band of attached tissue is absent, it can be recreated with a soft tissue graft. There are four methods that can be used to transplant soft tissue. A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) can be moved towards the lip (buccal), gingiva from the palate can be transplanted, deeper connective tissue from the palate can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of tissue is needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in the palate (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area. Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, a band of full, plump gingiva is needed to fill in the space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue complication is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2‚Äì4 mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater. Recovery The steps taken to secure dental crowns on the implant fixture including placement of the abutment and crown The prosthetic phase begins once the implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable assurance that it will integrate) and an abutment is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even in the event of early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the vertical dimension of occlusion, the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.  Healing time  There are various options for when to attach teeth to dental implants, classified into: #Immediate loading procedure. #Early loading (one week to twelve weeks). #Delayed loading (over three months) For an implant to become permanently stable, the body must grow bone to the surface of the implant (osseointegration). Based on this biologic process, it was thought that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).However, later research suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure. Single teeth, bridges and fixed dentures An abutment is selected depending on the application. In many single crown and fixed partial denture scenarios (bridgework), custom abutments are used. An impression of the top of the implant is made with the adjacent teeth and gingiva. A dental lab then simultaneously fabricates an abutment and crown. The abutment is seated on the implant, a screw passes through the abutment to secure it to an internal thread on the implant (lag-screw). There are variations on this, such as when the abutment and implant body are one piece or when a stock (prefabricated) abutment is used. Custom abutments can be made by hand, as a cast metal piece or custom milled from metal or zirconia, all of which have similar success rates. The platform between the implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, the collar of the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments. Regardless of the abutment material or technique, an impression of the abutment is then taken and a crown secured to the abutment with dental cement. Another variation on abutment/crown model is when the crown and abutment are one piece and the lag-screw traverses both to secure the one-piece structure to the internal thread on the implant. There does not appear to be any benefit, in terms of success, for cement versus screw-retained prosthetics, although the latter is believed to be easier to maintain (and change when the prosthetic fractures) and the former offers high esthetic performance. Prosthetic procedures for removable dentures When a removable denture is worn, retainers to hold the denture in place can be either custom made or \\"off-the- shelf\\" (stock) abutments. When custom retainers are used, four or more implant fixtures are placed and an impression of the implants is taken and a dental lab creates a custom metal bar with attachments to hold the denture in place. Significant retention can be created with multiple attachments and the use of semi-precision attachments (such as a small diameter pin that pushes through the denture and into the bar) which allows for little or no movement in the denture, but it remains removable. However, the same four implants angled in such a way to distribute occlusal forces may be able to safely hold a fixed denture in place with comparable costs and number of procedures giving the denture wearer a fixed solution. Alternatively, stock abutments are used to retain dentures using a male-adapter attached to the implant and a female adapter in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style retainer and the button-style adapter. These types of stock abutments allow movement of the denture, but enough retention to improve the quality of life for denture wearers, compared to conventional dentures. Regardless of the type of adapter, the female portion of the adapter that is housed in the denture will require periodic replacement, however the number and adapter type does not seem to affect patient satisfaction with the prosthetic for various removable alternatives. Maintenance After placement, implants need to be cleaned (similar to natural teeth) with a periodontal scaler to remove any plaque. Because of the more precarious blood supply to the gingiva, care should be taken with dental floss. Implants will lose bone at a rate similar to natural teeth in the mouth (e.g. if someone suffers from periodontal disease, an implant can be affected by a similar disorder) but will otherwise last. The porcelain on crowns should be expected to discolour, fracture or require repair approximately every ten years, although there is significant variation in the service life of dental crowns based on the position in the mouth, the forces being applied from opposing teeth and the restoration material. Where implants are used to retain a complete denture, depending on the type of attachment, connections need to be changed or refreshed every one to two years. An oral irrigator may also be useful for cleaning around implants. The same kinds of techniques used for cleaning teeth are recommended for maintaining hygiene around implants, and can be manually or professionally administered. Examples of this would be using soft toothbrushes or nylon coated interproximal brushes. The one implication during professional treatment is that metal instruments may cause damage to the metallic surface of the implant or abutment, which can lead to bacterial colonisation. So, to avoid this, there are specially designed instruments made with hard plastic or rubber. Additionally rinsing (twice daily) with antimicrobial mouthwashes has been shown to be beneficial. There is no evidence that one type of antimicrobial is better than the other. Peri-implantitis is a condition that may occur with implants due to bacteria, plaque, or design and it is on the rise. This disease begins as a reversible condition called peri-implant mucositis but can progress to peri-implantitis if left untreated, which can lead to implant failure. People are encouraged to discuss oral hygiene and maintenance of implants with their dentists. There are different interventions if peri-implantitis occurs, such as mechanical debridement, antimicrobial irrigation, and antibiotics. There can also be surgery such as open-flap debridement to remove bacteria, assess/smooth implant surface, or decontaminate implant surface. There is not enough evidence to know which intervention is best in the case of peri-implantitis. Risks and complications During surgery Placement of dental implants is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around the implant. Nearby anatomic structures, such as the inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or the implant placed. Even when the lining of the maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide stability of the implant (referred to as primary stability of the implant) increases the risk of failure to osseointegration. First six months  Primary implant stability  Primary implant stability refers to the stability of a dental implant immediately after implantation. The stability of the titanium screw implant in the patient's bone tissue post surgery may be non-invasively assessed using resonance frequency analysis. Sufficient initial stability may allow immediate loading with prosthetic reconstruction, though early loading poses a higher risk of implant failure than conventional loading. The relevance of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant in the first weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability is different from the initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3‚Äì4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure. Immediate post-operative risks # Infection (pre-op antibiotics reduce the risk of implant failure by 33 percent but do not affect the risk of infection). # Excessive bleeding # Flap breakdown (less-than 5 percent) Failure to integrate An implant is tested between 8 and 24 weeks to determine if it is integrated. There is significant variation in the criteria used to determine implant success, the most commonly cited criteria at the implant level are the absence of pain, mobility, infection, gingival bleeding, radiographic lucency or peri-implant bone loss greater than 1.5 mm. Dental implant success is related to operator skill, quality and quantity of the bone available at the site, and the patient's oral hygiene, but the most important factor is primary implant stability. While there is significant variation in the rate that implants fail to integrate (due to individual risk factors), the approximate values are 1 to 6 percent Integration failure is rare, particularly if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are followed closely by the patient. Immediate loading implants may have a higher rate of failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use. Long term The long-term complications that result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors of the patient and the technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support. From these theoretical risks, derive the real world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to peri-implantitis or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no dental enamel on an implant, it does not fail due to cavities like natural teeth. While large- scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 93-98 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to get caught in the gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there does not appear to be any additional peri-implantitis in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall. In compound implants (two stage implants), between the actual implant and the superstructure (abutment) are gaps and cavities into which bacteria can penetrate from the oral cavity. Later these bacteria will return into the adjacent tissue and can cause periimplantitis. Criteria for the success of the implant supported dental prosthetic varies from study to study, but can be broadly classified into failures due to the implant, soft tissues or prosthetic components or a lack of satisfaction on the part of the patient. The most commonly cited criteria for success are function of at least five years in the absence of pain, mobility, radiographic lucency and peri-implant bone loss of greater than 1.5 mm on the implant, the lack of suppuration or bleeding in the soft tissues and occurrence of technical complications/prosthetic maintenance, adequate function, and esthetics in the prosthetic. In addition, the patient should ideally be free of pain, paraesthesia, able to chew and taste and be pleased with the esthetics. The rates of complications vary by implant use and prosthetic type and are listed below: Single crown implants (5-year) # Implant survival: 96.8 percent # Crown survival: metal-ceramic: 95.4 percent; all-ceramic: 91.2 percent; cumulative rate of ceramic or acrylic veneer fracture: 4.5 percent #Peri- implantitis: 9.7 percent up to 40 percent #Peri-implant mucositis: 50 percent # Implant fracture: 0.14 percent # Screw or abutment loosening: 12.7 percent # Screw or abutment fracture: 0.35 percent Fixed complete dentures # Progressive vertical bone loss but still in function (Peri-implantitis): 8.5 percent # Failure after the first year 5 percent at five years, 7 percent at ten years # Incidence of veneer fracture at: #::5-year: 13.5 to 30.6 percent, #::10-year: 51.9 percent (32.3 to 75.5 percent with a confidence interval at 95 percent) #::15-year: 66.6 percent (44.3 to 86.4 percent with a confidence interval at 95 percent) # 10-year incidence of framework fracture: 6 percent (2.6 to 9.3 percent with a confidence interval at 95 percent) # 10-year incidence of esthetic deficiency: 6.1 percent (2.4 to 9.7 percent with a confidence interval at 95 percent) # prosthetic screw loosening: 5 percent over five years to 15 percent over ten years The most common complication being fracture or wear of the tooth structure, especially beyond ten years with fixed dental prostheses made of metal-ceramic having significantly higher ten-year survival compared those made of gold-acrylic. Removable dentures (overdentures) # Loosening of removable denture retention: 33 percent # Dentures needing to be relined or having a retentive clip fracture : 16 to 19 percent History Greenfield's basket: one of the earliest examples of a successful endosseous implant was Greenfield's 1913 implant system While studying bone cells in a rabbit tibia using a titanium chamber, Branemark was unable to remove it from bone. His realization that bone would adhere to titanium led to the concept of osseointegration and the development of modern dental implants. The original x-ray film of the chamber embedded in the rabbit tibia is shown (made available by Branemark).Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants, taken 1978 There is archeological evidence that humans have attempted to replace missing teeth with root form implants for thousands of years. Remains from ancient China (dating 4000 years ago) have carved bamboo pegs, tapped into the bone, to replace lost teeth, and 2000-year-old remains from ancient Egypt have similarly shaped pegs made of precious metals. Some Egyptian mummies were found to have transplanted human teeth, and in other instances, teeth made of ivory. Wilson Popenoe and his wife in 1931, at a site in Honduras dating back to 600 AD, found the lower mandible of a young Mayan woman, with three missing incisors replaced by pieces of sea shells, shaped to resemble teeth. Bone growth around two of the implants, and the formation of calculus, indicates that they were functional as well as esthetic. The fragment is currently part of the Osteological Collection of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University. In modern times, a tooth replica implant was reported as early as 1969, but the polymethacrylate tooth analogue was encapsulated by soft tissue rather than osseointegrated. The early part of the 20th century saw a number of implants made of a variety of materials. One of the earliest successful implants was the Greenfield implant system of 1913 (also known as the Greenfield crib or basket). Greenfield's implant, an iridioplatinum implant attached to a gold crown, showed evidence of osseointegration and lasted for a number of years. The first use of titanium as an implantable material was by Bothe, Beaton and Davenport in 1940, who observed how close the bone grew to titanium screws, and the difficulty they had in extracting them. Bothe et al. were the first researchers to describe what would later be called osseointegration (a name that would be marketed later on by Per-Ingvar Br√•nemark). In 1951, Gottlieb Leventhal implanted titanium rods in rabbits. Leventhal's positive results led him to believe that titanium represented the ideal metal for surgery. In the 1950s research was being conducted at Cambridge University in England on blood flow in living organisms. These workers devised a method of constructing a chamber of titanium which was then embedded into the soft tissue of the ears of rabbits. In 1952 the Swedish orthopaedic surgeon, Per-Ingvar Br√•nemark, was interested in studying bone healing and regeneration. During his research time at Lund University he adopted the Cambridge designed \\"rabbit ear chamber\\" for use in the rabbit femur. Following the study, he attempted to retrieve these expensive chambers from the rabbits and found that he was unable to remove them. Br√•nemark observed that bone had grown into such close proximity with the titanium that it effectively adhered to the metal. Br√•nemark carried out further studies into this phenomenon, using both animal and human subjects, which all confirmed this unique property of titanium. Leonard Linkow, in the 1950s, was one of the first to insert titanium and other metal implants into the bones of the jaw. Artificial teeth were then attached to these pieces of metal. In 1965 Br√•nemark placed his first titanium dental implant into a human volunteer. He began working in the mouth as it was more accessible for continued observations and there was a high rate of missing teeth in the general population offered more subjects for widespread study. He termed the clinically observed adherence of bone with titanium as \\"osseointegration\\". Since then implants have evolved into three basic types: # Root form implants; the most common type of implant indicated for all uses. Within the root form type of implant, there are roughly 18 variants, all made of titanium but with different shapes and surface textures. There is limited evidence showing that implants with relatively smooth surfaces are less prone to peri-implantitis than implants with rougher surfaces and no evidence showing that any particular type of dental implant has superior long-term success. # Zygoma implant; a long implant that can anchor to the cheek bone by passing through the maxillary sinus to retain a complete upper denture when bone is absent. While zygomatic implants offer a novel approach to severe bone loss in the upper jaw, it has not been shown to offer any advantage over bone grafting functionally although it may offer a less invasive option, depending on the size of the reconstruction required. # Small diameter implants are implants of low diameter with one piece construction (implant and abutment) that are sometimes used for denture retention or orthodontic anchorage.

This is a period of stellar evolution undertaken by all low- to intermediate-mass stars (0.6‚Äì10 solar masses) late in their lives. Observationally, an asymptotic-giant-branch star will appear as a bright red giant with a luminosity ranging up to thousands of times greater than the Sun. Its interior structure is characterized by a central and largely inert core of carbon and oxygen, a shell where helium is undergoing fusion to form carbon (known as helium burning), another shell where hydrogen is undergoing fusion forming helium (known as hydrogen burning), and a very large envelope of material of composition similar to main-sequence stars. Stellar evolution A sun-like star moves onto the AGB from the Horizontal Branch after core helium exhaustion A star moves onto the AGB after a blue loop when helium is exhausted in its core When a star exhausts the supply of hydrogen by nuclear fusion processes in its core, the core contracts and its temperature increases, causing the outer layers of the star to expand and cool. The star becomes a red giant, following a track towards the upper-right hand corner of the HR diagram. Eventually, once the temperature in the core has reached approximately , helium burning (fusion of helium nuclei) begins. The onset of helium burning in the core halts the star's cooling and increase in luminosity, and the star instead moves down and leftwards in the HR diagram. This is the horizontal branch (for population II stars) or red clump (for population I stars), or a blue loop for stars more massive than about . After the completion of helium burning in the core, the star again moves to the right and upwards on the diagram, cooling and expanding as its luminosity increases. Its path is almost aligned with its previous red-giant track, hence the name asymptotic giant branch, although the star will become more luminous on the AGB than it did at the tip of the red giant branch. Stars at this stage of stellar evolution are known as AGB stars. AGB stage The AGB phase is divided into two parts, the early AGB (E-AGB) and the thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB). During the E-AGB phase, the main source of energy is helium fusion in a shell around a core consisting mostly of carbon and oxygen. During this phase, the star swells up to giant proportions to become a red giant again. The star's radius may become as large as one astronomical unit (). After the helium shell runs out of fuel, the TP- AGB starts. Now the star derives its energy from fusion of hydrogen in a thin shell, which restricts the inner helium shell to a very thin layer and prevents it fusing stably. However, over periods of 10,000 to 100,000 years, helium from the hydrogen shell burning builds up and eventually the helium shell ignites explosively, a process known as a helium shell flash. The luminosity of the shell flash peaks at thousands of times the total luminosity of the star, but decreases exponentially over just a few years. The shell flash causes the star to expand and cool which shuts off the hydrogen shell burning and causes strong convection in the zone between the two shells. When the helium shell burning nears the base of the hydrogen shell, the increased temperature reignites hydrogen fusion and the cycle begins again. The large but brief increase in luminosity from the helium shell flash produces an increase in the visible brightness of the star of a few tenths of a magnitude for several hundred years, a change unrelated to the brightness variations on periods of tens to hundreds of days that are common in this type of star. Evolution of a star on the TP-AGB During the thermal pulses, which last only a few hundred years, material from the core region may be mixed into the outer layers, changing the surface composition, a process referred to as dredge-up. Because of this dredge-up, AGB stars may show S-process elements in their spectra and strong dredge-ups can lead to the formation of carbon stars. All dredge-ups following thermal pulses are referred to as third dredge-ups, after the first dredge-up, which occurs on the red-giant branch, and the second dredge up, which occurs during the E-AGB. In some cases there may not be a second dredge-up but dredge-ups following thermal pulses will still be called a third dredge-up. Thermal pulses increase rapidly in strength after the first few, so third dredge-ups are generally the deepest and most likely to circulate core material to the surface. AGB stars are typically long-period variables, and suffer mass loss in the form of a stellar wind. For M-type AGB stars, the stellar winds are most efficiently driven by micron-sized grains. Thermal pulses produce periods of even higher mass loss and may result in detached shells of circumstellar material. A star may lose 50 to 70% of its mass during the AGB phase. Circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars Formation of a planetary nebula at the end of the asymptotic giant branch phase. The extensive mass loss of AGB stars means that they are surrounded by an extended circumstellar envelope (CSE). Given a mean AGB lifetime of one Myr and an outer velocity of , its maximum radius can be estimated to be roughly (30 light years). This is a maximum value since the wind material will start to mix with the interstellar medium at very large radii, and it also assumes that there is no velocity difference between the star and the interstellar gas. Dynamically, most of the interesting action is quite close to the star, where the wind is launched and the mass loss rate is determined. However, the outer layers of the CSE show chemically interesting processes, and due to size and lower optical depth, are easier to observe. The temperature of the CSE is determined by heating and cooling properties of the gas and dust, but drops with radial distance from the photosphere of the stars which are ‚Äì. Chemical peculiarities of an AGB CSE outwards include: *Photosphere: Local thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry *Pulsating stellar envelope: Shock chemistry *Dust formation zone *Chemically quiet *Interstellar ultraviolet radiation and photodissociation of molecules ‚Äì complex chemistry The dichotomy between oxygen-rich and carbon-rich stars has an initial role in determining whether the first condensates are oxides or carbides, since the least abundant of these two elements will likely remain in the gas phase as COx. In the dust formation zone, refractory elements and compounds (Fe, Si, MgO, etc.) are removed from the gas phase and end up in dust grains. The newly formed dust will immediately assist in surface catalyzed reactions. The stellar winds from AGB stars are sites of cosmic dust formation, and are believed to be the main production sites of dust in the universe. The stellar winds of AGB stars (Mira variables and OH/IR stars) are also often the site of maser emission. The molecules that account for this are SiO, H2O, OH, HCN, and SiS. SiO, H2O, and OH masers are typically found in oxygen-rich M-type AGB stars such as R Cassiopeiae and U Orionis, while HCN and SiS masers are generally found in carbon stars such as IRC +10216. S-type stars with masers are uncommon. After these stars have lost nearly all of their envelopes, and only the core regions remain, they evolve further into short-lived preplanetary nebulae. The final fate of the AGB envelopes are represented by planetary nebulae (PNe). Late thermal pulse As many as a quarter of all post-AGB stars undergo what is dubbed a \\"born-again\\" episode. The carbon‚Äìoxygen core is now surrounded by helium with an outer shell of hydrogen. If the helium is re-ignited a thermal pulse occurs and the star quickly returns to the AGB, becoming a helium- burning, hydrogen-deficient stellar object. If the star still has a hydrogen- burning shell when this thermal pulse occurs, it is termed a \\"late thermal pulse\\". Otherwise it is called a \\"very late thermal pulse\\". The outer atmosphere of the born-again star develops a stellar wind and the star once more follows an evolutionary track across the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram. However, this phase is very brief, lasting only about 200 years before the star again heads toward the white dwarf stage. Observationally, this late thermal pulse phase appears almost identical to a Wolf‚ÄìRayet star in the midst of its own planetary nebula. Stars such as Sakurai's Object and FG Sagittae are being observed as they rapidly evolve through this phase. Mapping the circumstellar magnetic fields of thermal-pulsating (TP-) AGB stars has recently been reported using the so called Goldreich-Kylafis effect. Super- AGB stars Stars close to the upper mass limit to still qualify as AGB stars show some peculiar properties and have been dubbed super-AGB stars. They have masses above and up to 9 or (or more ). They represent a transition to the more massive supergiant stars that undergo full fusion of elements heavier than helium. During the triple-alpha process, some elements heavier than carbon are also produced: mostly oxygen, but also some magnesium, neon, and even heavier elements. Super-AGB stars develop partially degenerate carbon‚Äìoxygen cores that are large enough to ignite carbon in a flash analogous to the earlier helium flash. The second dredge-up is very strong in this mass range and that keeps the core size below the level required for burning of neon as occurs in higher-mass supergiants. The size of the thermal pulses and third dredge-ups are reduced compared to lower-mass stars, while the frequency of the thermal pulses increases dramatically. Some super-AGB stars may explode as an electron capture supernova, but most will end as an oxygen‚Äìneon white dwarf. Since these stars are much more common than higher- mass supergiants, they could form a high proportion of observed supernovae. Detecting examples of these supernovae would provide valuable confirmation of models that are highly dependent on assumptions.

It is located at the northern edge of the city, on the bank of the Rio de la Plata. With a total land area of , Palermo is a rather sprawling area. As of 1991 it had a population of 256,927 inhabitants (). It is the only barrio within the administrative division of Comuna 14. Palermo is perhaps best known as the polo capital of the world. Each year, in November, the city hosts the Argentine Polo Open, commonly known as the Palermo Open or simply Palermo.https://www.poloplus10.com/argentine-open-2016-all-eyes-set-on- palermo-71338/ History The name of the city is derived from the still- existing Franciscan abbey of \\"Saint Benedict of Palermo\\", an alternative name for Saint Benedict the Moor. Saint Benedict the Moor lived from 1526 to 1589 and is a complementary patron saint of Palermo, the capital city of Sicily.Patron Saints In an alternative history of the name, a folk story supported by journalists, the land would have been originally purchased by an Italian immigrant named Juan Domingo Palermo in the late 16th century, shortly after the foundation of Buenos Aires in 1580. Juan Manuel de Rosas built a country residence there which was confiscated after his fall in 1852. The area grew rapidly during the last third of the 19th century, particularly during the presidency of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who was responsible for the creation of the Buenos Aires Zoological Gardens and the Parque Tres de Febrero in 1874, and Plaza Italia and the Palermo Race Track in 1876, all on the grounds of what had been Rosas' pleasure villa. During the 20th century, the Buenos Aires Botanical Gardens (1902), Jorge Newbery Airport (1948), the water purification plant, several sport clubs, the Galileo Galilei planetarium (1966), and the Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens (1967) were developed. Subdivisions Unofficial neighborhoods into which Palermo is commonly subdivided Although appearing as one big swath on the official map, Palermo can be subdivided into several contrasting and acutely individual parts, the most clearly delimited of which may be considered further de facto neighborhoods of Buenos Aires. Palermo Chico y Barrio Parque The most upmarket part of Palermo, \\"Palermo Chico\\" (\\"Small\\" or \\"Exclusive\\" Palermo), is on Palermo's north-eastern edge, across Figueroa Alcorta Avenue and between San Mart√≠n de Tours and Tagle streets. Neighboring \\"Barrio Parque\\" is strictly a residential area, laid out in winding streets by Carlos Thays; many of the wealthy and famous own homes in this section, which also includes numerous embassies and the San Mart√≠n National Institute. It was once an area full of splendid mansions set in broad private parks; many have been demolished by developers. The quarter nevertheless remains one of the wealthiest in the city, home to luxury condominium and apartment developments, the largest of which is currently the Le Parc Figueroa Alcorta towers. MALBA, (the Museum of Latin American Art in Buenos Aires), is located next door between Barrio Parque and the Paseo Alcorta shopping center. Palermo Norte, Alto Palermo y Villa Freud Alto Palermo is downtown Palermo, the main shopping area and transport hub around Santa Fe Avenue. Centered on Las Heras Park and the Alto Palermo Shopping Center, this section is the easternmost edge of Palermo and borders the Recoleta section known as Barrio Norte. Palermo Norte is located along Libertador Avenue to the northwest of Palermo Chico, and the site of landmarks such as the Argentine Automobile Club and the National Museum of Decorative Arts. Villa Freud, based around Plaza G√ºemes, is a residential area known for its high concentration of psychoanalysts and psychiatrists, hence its name. Palermo Nuevo y Palermo Zool√≥gico Japanese Gardens of the Palermo Woods This area borders Palermo Norte further northwest along Libertador Avenue centered on the Monument to the Four Regions of Argentina; raised by the Spanish community in 1910, this landmark is commonly referred to as the \\"Spanish Monument\\". The Buenos Aires Zoo, the Buenos Aires Botanical Gardens, La Rural expo grounds, the U.S. Embassy and Ambassador's Residence, the Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens, and Parque Tres de Febrero (commonly known as Bosques de Palermo, or \\"Palermo Woods\\") are located in this area. Inspired by the \\"Bois de Boulogne\\" in Paris and the Prater (or Vienna Meadow) in Vienna, the Palermo Woods are the largest green area in the city of Buenos Aires and itself includes landmarks such as the Rose Garden, the Eduardo S√≠vori Museum, and the Galileo Galilei planetarium. Las Ca√±itas y La Imprenta Las Ca√±itas, further northwest along Libertador, was a tenement district early in the twentieth century; but it has since become an upmarket area of high-rises, restaurants and bars, particularly in the vicinity of the Palermo Racetrack and the Campo Argentino de Polo. The King Fahd Islamic Cultural Center was built in the 1990s just east of the Polo fields. The Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers headquarters and other military installations, such as the Central Military Hospital and the Military Geographic Institute, are located to the south. La Imprenta, west of Las Ca√±itas, borders the Belgrano ward. One of its best-known landmarks is the Parish of San Benito Abad and the neighboring Solar de la Abad√≠a shopping gallery. Palermo Viejo Plaza Italia, a focal point in Palermo Viejo. Palermo Viejo (Old Palermo) is, as its name implies, the oldest part. It runs from Santa Fe Avenue south to C√≥rdoba Avenue, and from Avenida Dorrego east to Coronel D√≠az Street. The neighborhood is centered on Plaza Palermo Viejo, and reflects an older Spanish Colonial Revival style in architecture, often \\"recycled\\" with modern elements. The new headquarters of the National Research Council, opened in 2011 in the refurbished former GIOL winery, is a notable recent example of this trend. Such well-known figures as Jorge Luis Borges and Che Guevara once lived in this ward and indeed Borges first wrote poetry in the then quiet barrio. Borges's poem \\"Fundacion mitica de Buenos Aires\\" names a typical square (bordered by Guatemala, Serrano, Paraguay, and Gurruchaga streets) adjacent to his childhood home, a popular tourist landmark. It was historically a residential area, popular with immigrant communities from Poland, Armenia, Ukraine, and Lebanon; as well as old Spanish and Italian families, whose traditions are reflected in local restaurants, churches, schools and cultural centres. Palermo Soho Cobblestoned street with low houses in Palermo Soho Palermo Soho is a small area of Palermo Viejo around Plaza Serrano (officially Plazoleta Cort√°zar) near Palermo's south-western edge. It is a newly fashionable area for fashion, design, restaurants, bars, and street culture. The atmosphere in many caf√©s and restaurants strives to be \\"alternative\\", which makes this area of the city especially popular with young, upper-middle-class Argentines as well as foreign tourists looking for a \\"hipster\\" neighborhood. The traditional low houses have been adapted into boutiques and bars, creating a bohemian feel. The square has a crafts fair. Palermo Hollywood In the mid-nineties a number of TV and radio producers installed themselves in the area between C√≥rdoba, Santa Fe, Dorrego, and Juan B. Justo Avenues in Palermo Viejo. For that reason, this part of the neighborhood began to be called \\"Palermo Hollywood\\". Currently, it is best known for the concentration of restaurants, sports clubs (such as Club Atl√©tico Palermo, the oldest oneDiario La Raz√≥n, June 8, 2011.), caf√©s, and an active nightlife. Pac√≠fico This area is centered on Santa Fe Avenue, a few blocks both north and south from Pac√≠fico bridge, so-called because of the Mitre railway line‚Äîpreviously called the \\"Buenos Aires to Pacific Railway\\"‚Äîbridge which spans the avenue and is an urban landmark and reference point. Pacifico is a mid-market commercial area and an important transport hub, for the train, metro and many bus lines connect here. Public transportation The San Mart√≠n Line's Palermo train station Buenos Aires Underground Line D has several stations within Palermo's boundaries under Santa Fe and Cabildo avenues: Bulnes, Scalabrini Ortiz, Plaza Italia, Palermo, Ministro Carranza, and Olleros (at the limit with Colegiales). Currently, no other Underground line serves the area, but eventually Line F and Line I will pass through it once completed. Four commuter railway lines go through the neighborhood: Retiro - Jos√© Le√≥n Su√°rez (Mitre Line), Retiro - Tigre (Mitre Line), Retiro - Pilar (San Mart√≠n Line), and Retiro - Villa Rosa (Belgrano Norte Line). A total of five railway stations are located in Palermo. Inaugurated in 2011, the Metrobus Juan B. Justo also goes through Palermo, though there are no other planned Metrobus lines there.

Mechanism flute and type B (blunt) tip Self-tapping screws have a wide range of tip and thread patterns, and are available with almost any possible screw head design. Common features are the screw thread covering the whole length of the screw from tip to head and a pronounced thread hard enough for the intended substrate, often case-hardened. For hard substrates such as metal or hard plastics, the self-tapping ability is often created by cutting a gap in the continuity of the thread on the screw, generating a flute and cutting edge similar to those on a tap. Thus, whereas a regular machine screw cannot tap its own hole in a metal substrate, a self-tapping one can (within reasonable limits of substrate hardness and depth). For softer substrates such as wood or soft plastics, the self-tapping ability can come simply from a tip that tapers to a gimlet point (in which no flute is needed). Like the tip of a nail or gimlet, such a point forms the hole by displacement of the surrounding material rather than any chip-forming drilling/cutting/evacuating action. Not all self-tapping screws have a sharp tip. The type B tip is blunt and intended for use with a pilot hole, often in sheet materials. The lack of a sharp tip is helpful for packaging and handling and in some applications may be helpful for reducing the clearance necessary on the reverse of a fastened panel or for making more thread available on a given length screw.  Thread-forming vs. thread-cutting  Self-tapping screws can be divided into two classes; those that displace material (especially plastic and thin metal sheets) without removing it are termed thread-forming self-tapping screws; self-tappers with sharp cutting surfaces that remove the material as they are inserted are termed thread-cutting. Thread-forming screws may have a non-circular plan view, such as the five-fold symmetry of the pentalobular or three-fold symmetry for Taptite screws. Thread-cutting screws have one or more flutes machined into their threads, giving cutting edges. Self-drilling screws Self-drilling screws showing flute Some self-tapping screws are also self- drilling, which means that, in addition to the tap-like flute in the leading threads, there is also a preliminary drill-like fluted tip that looks much like the tip of a center drill. These screws combine a threading-like action and the fastener installation itself into only one driving motion (instead of separate drilling, tapping, and installing motions); they are thus very efficient in a variety of hard-substrate applications, from assembly lines to roofing. Sheet metal screw Sheet metal screws (sometimes called \\"sheet- metal self-tappers\\", or P-K screws from the brand name Parker Kalon - who pioneered the manufacture of, but did not invent, these screws) are a type of self-tapping screw despite the thread created in the sheet of metal being small. Pan-head PK Self-tapping screws are common in electrical equipment, while flatter-headed truss or flat countersunk headed self-tapping screws are more common in aviation applications. Winged self-tapper Winged self- drilling have thin wings wider than the thread formed just behind the self drilling head. These cut a clearance hole in soft materials (such as wood or plastic), but are destroyed by more robust materials (such as metal). Thus, to clamp some material to metal, the clearance drilling, tap drilling, thread tapping, and fixing itself can happen in a single operation from one side, with the materials in their final position. Applications Self-tapping screws are used in a variety of applications ranging from DIY carpentry to surgery.  Surgical  Dental implants and orthopedic bone screws are both examples of self-tapping screws used in surgery. Different thread profiles are used for either denser cortical bone or the spongy cancellous bone.

Due to huge demand by industrial, educational as well as military institutions, KC 85 systems were virtually unavailable for sale to private customers. Technical information KC 85/3 with two expansion cartridges ‚Äî a 64K RAM module and a parallel port ‚Äî installed. Robotron KC 87 They were based on the U880 CPU (an East German clone of the Z80), with clock speeds of 1.75 and 2 MHz. There were two main lines in the KC 85 series, the KC 85/2 (project name HC 900) to /4 and the KC 85/1 (project name Z 9001) by Robotron, which was a different system (only the CPU and the name were the same, but later the format of saving the programs on tape cassettes and the BASIC were also made compatible). In 1989, VEB Mikroelektronik M√ºhlhausen came up with the KC compact, but due to the GDR collapse very few units were actually produced and sold and‚Äîbeing a CPC clone‚Äîit was a KC in name only; thus it is usually not counted among the KC family. Unlike the Pravetz series 8 personal computers, manufactured in Bulgaria, which were equipped with dedicated displays, floppy discs and good quality keyboards, the entire series used a TV set as display (by standard TV-UHF via coaxial cable, composite video, or RGB) and a standard tape recorder as data storage. The KC 85/1 used an integrated calculator-style keyboard with small \\"keys\\" of hard plastics, while KC 85/2-4 used a separate keyboard driven by a remote control IC. The KC 85/2 was the first computer made in M√ºhlhausen and had only font ROMs for capital letters, and no BASIC in ROM. Later, the KC 85/3 was introduced and this one had a BASIC interpreter in ROM, freeing the user from having to load the BASIC interpreter from a cassette every time. Both systems typically had 16 KB of RAM, but could be expanded with add-on modules. (The module sockets feature prominently on photos, as they occupy the upper 50% of the casing.) The KC 85/4 had 64 KB of RAM (not counting the video ram of more than 40 KB) and better graphics capabilities. In fact the KC85/2 and KC85/3 were practically indistinguishable in board design except for a different ROM. The KC85/4 board was redesigned, but featured the same digital-to-analog video PCB as the previous generation. All KC-series computers from M√ºhlhausen were capable of displaying graphics at a resolution of 320√ó256 pixels. But the color possibilities were limited (each 4√ó8-pixel cell had a single foreground (out of 16) and background color (out of 8, slightly darker than foreground equivalents). This limitation was brought down to 1√ó8 on the KC 85/4, which also featured a video RAM addressing mode and a special 4-color (black, white, red, cyan) mode which could color every pixel independently. The colors were not paletted in any KC before the KC compact. There was no \\"text mode\\", everything had to be painted; this combined with the video RAM layout described above and ROM code made the KC 85/2-3 rather slow at printing and scrolling (improved very much on KC 85/4). There were no blitters, and the video subsystem was developed in-house and implemented entirely with a few dozen 7400 series ICs (the KC compact used a 6845 as the CPC did). With the KC85/2 and KC85/3 CPU access to video memory would interfere with screen redraw and cause visual distortions as pixel data could not be read from VRAM and the previously loaded pixel was simply drawn again. This issue was fixed in the KC85/4 too - one video period of 8 horizontal pixels is divided evenly into 3 phases: (1) an 8 bit wide CPU access (r/w), (2) fetch 8 bits of pixel data and (3) fetch 8 bits of color data. The KC85/4 was also the first capable of switching between 2 independent locations in video ram, allowing double buffering. Sound and tape output was implemented by CTC channels driving flipflops. Memory bank-switching was common since the total address space was only 64 KB. When running M√ºhlhausen's BASIC, the video RAM (at 0x8000) was banked in only during video operations, thus the maximum BASIC free RAM was about 47 KB instead of 32 KB. The module extension system also used bank- switching and made it theoretically possible to extend to megabytes of RAM (even more modules could be used by adding expansion devices, yielding sort of a tower), however neither BASIC nor most of the applications were prepared to use this as free space. The KC 87 was a better KC 85/1 with BASIC also in ROM. There was a color option (the 85/1 was only monochrome), but no real graphics apart from ROM pseudographic characters. The wiring diagrams are freely available and there were also a lot of different (and often home-made) schemes and hardware parts. Various magazines published programs and hardware diagrams and also instructions on how to build them. Programming languages The KC 85 could be programmed in assembly language and BASIC (the KC 85/2 had to load BASIC from tape), but it was possible to use various modules (sold by VEB Mikroelektronik M√ºhlhausen) or load software from tape, thus allowing programming in Forth and Pascal. The operating system was CAOS (\\"Cassette Aided Operating System\\"). It was a simple monitor where one could run different \\"system services\\" like LOAD (load a program), JUMP (into extension module ROM), MODIFY (memory cells) or BASIC (if it had been built into the ROM or had been loaded from tape). New commands could be added to the menu by magic numbers (standard: \`7F 7F 'commandname' 01\`) anywhere in the memory space. In the last years of the GDR, a floppy attachment (\\"tower\\"-style, too) was produced. It featured a 4 MHz CPU and a 5¬º\\" Floppy drive (you could have up to four of them). These (literally: the U 880 A in the attachment did) were able to run CP/M, which was called MicroDOS. (One had to JUMP from the base system to the floppy system and boot from a floppy‚Äîanother CAOS or MicroDOS). There was also a disk extension mode for CAOS.

Overview The first edition was published by the World Publishing Company of Cleveland, Ohio, in two volumes or one large volume, including a large encyclopedic section. In 1953, World published a one-volume college edition (Webster's New World College Dictionary), without the encyclopedic material. It was edited by Joseph H. Friend and David B. Guralnik and contained 142,000 entries, said to be the largest American desk dictionary available at the time. The second college edition, edited by Guralnik, was published in 1970. World Publishing was acquired by Simon & Schuster in 1980 and they continued the work with a third edition in 1989 edited by Victoria Neufeldt. A fourth edition was published by John Wiley & Sons in 1999, containing 160,000 entries; a fifth, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2014, contains around 165,000. One of the salient features of Webster's New World dictionaries has been its unusually full etymology, that is, the origin and development of words and the relationship of words to other Indo-European languages. The work also labels words which have a distinctly American origin. The college edition is the official desk dictionary of the Associated Press, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and United Press International.  Publisher  Although the title refers to Noah Webster, the work is unrelated to the series of Webster's dictionaries published by the Merriam-Webster Company, which indeed are descended directly from Noah Webster's original publications.

Denebola is an A-type main sequence star with 75% more mass than the Sun and 15 times the Sun's luminosity. Based on parallax measurements from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the star is at a distance of about from the Sun. Its apparent visual magnitude is 2.14, making it readily visible to the naked eye. Denebola is a suspected Delta Scuti type variable star, meaning its luminosity varies very slightly over a period of a few hours. Nomenclature Œ≤ Leonis (Latinised to Beta Leonis) is the star's Bayer designation. In Johann Bayer's Uranometria (1603), it was designated Œ≤ (Beta) as the second-brightest star in the constellation. It also bears the Flamsteed designation of 94 Leonis (assigned on the basis of increasing right ascension rather than luminosity) and additional designations followed as the star was recorded in subsequent star catalogues. The traditional name Denebola is shortened from ', from the Arabic phrase ' ' 'tail of the lion', as it represents the lion's tail, the star's position in the Leo constellation. (Deneb in Cygnus has a similar name origin.) In the Alphonsine Tables it was recorded as Denebalezeth. On R. A. Proctor's 1871 star chart of the Northern Hemisphere it was designated Deneb Aleet. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included Denebola for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. 15th century astronomer Ulugh Beg, gives the name Al ·π¢arfah, the Changer (i.e. of the weather), as the star's individual title.LacusCurtius ‚Ä¢ Allen's Star Names ‚Äî Leo Al-Biruni, a Muslim scholar and polymath of the 11th century, wrote of it: \\"The heat turns away when it rises, and the cold turns away when it disappears.\\" Ancient Chinese astronomers designated it the first star of the five-star asterism \\"Seat of the Five Emperors\\", hence its Chinese name ‰∫îÂ∏ùÂ∫ß‰∏Ä (W«îd√¨zu√≤-yƒ´). In Hindu astronomy, Denebola corresponds to the Nakshatra (a sector along the ecliptic) named Uttara Phalgunƒ´ (second reddish one). Denebola, along with Spica and Arcturus, is part of the Spring Triangle asterism, and by extension, also of the Great Diamond together with the star Cor Caroli. Properties Denebola is a relatively young star with an age estimated at less than 400 million years. Interferometric observations give a radius that is about 173% that of the Sun. However, the high rate of rotation results in an oblate shape with an equatorial bulge. It has 75% more mass than the Sun, which results in a much higher overall luminosity and a shorter life span on the main sequence. Based upon the star's spectrum, it has a stellar classification of A3 Va, with the luminosity class 'Va' indicating this is a particularly luminous dwarf, a main sequence star that is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The effective temperature of Denebola's outer envelope is about 8,500 K, which results in the white hue typical of A-type stars. Denebola has a high projected rotational velocity of 128 km/s, which is of the same order of magnitude as for the very rapidly rotating star Achernar. The Sun, in comparison, has an equatorial rotation velocity of 2 km/s. This star is believed to be a Delta Scuti variable star that exhibits fluctuations in luminosity of 0.025 magnitudes roughly ten times per day. Denebola shows a strong infrared excess, showing a circumstellar debris disk of cool dust in orbit around it. The dust surrounding Denebola has a temperature of about . Observations with the Herschel Space Observatory have provided resolved images, which show the disk to be located at a radius of 39 astronomical units from the star, or 39 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun. As the solar system is believed to have formed out of such a disk, Denebola and similar stars such as Vega and Beta Pictoris may be candidate locations for extrasolar planets. Kinematic studies have shown that Denebola is part of a stellar association dubbed the IC 2391 supercluster. All the stars of this group share a roughly common motion through space, although they are not gravitationally bound. This suggests that they were born in the same location, and perhaps initially formed an open cluster. Other stars in this association include Alpha Pictoris, Beta Canis Minoris and the open cluster IC 2391. In total more than sixty probable members of the group have been identified. In culture In astrology, Denebola was believed to portend misfortune and disgrace.

It occurs in the form of perfect crystals grouped in druses, in pegmatites, and is often of precious-stone quality. One noted deposit of brazilianite is in the surroundings of Conselheiro Pena, in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Some of these are found on leaves of muscovite with their strong silvery glitter, ingrown in their parent rock. The crystals, dark greenish- yellow to olive-green, sometimes measure up to in length and in width. Crystals of similar shape and dimensions have been discovered in another deposit in Minas Gerais, near Mantena, but they lack the perfection of the crystal form. Many brazilianites found in mineral collections originated from the Palermo and the Charles Davis mines in Grafton County, New Hampshire.  Composition  Brazilianite, NaAl3(PO4)2(OH)4 is a hydrous sodium aluminium phosphate that forms through the metasomantic alteration of amblygonite- montebrasite. Amblygonite, LiAlPO4F in combination with quartz goes through an OH-F exchange to make montebrasite, LiAlPO4{F,OH} at temperatures greater than 480 ¬∞C. Natromontebrasite, NaAl(PO4)(OH), is formed when montebrasite does though Li-leaching process and there is a Na cation exchange at temperatures less than 450 ¬∞C. Brazilianite concludes this process by forming as natromontebrasite combines with fluorapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F. Due to its formation caused by the amblygonite-montebrasite alteration and the presence of tourmaline in the environment where brazilianite forms, different elements are present in the mineral such as P, Al, Fe, Mn, Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Na, K, F, and Cl. There are many substitution possibilities in the brazilianite formula. Besides sodium, being replaced by any other element, iron can replace aluminium, and vanadates or arsenates can replace the phosphates.  Structure  Brazilianite is composed of chains of edge-sharing Al-O octahedra that are linked by P-O tetrahedra with sodium in the cavity of the framework. The crystal structure of brazilianite is a~11.23 √Ö, b~10.14 √Ö, c~7.10 √Ö, Œ≤~97.4¬∞ and Z = 4. The Al-octahedra has two types of octahedral coordination: trans- AlO4(OH)2 and trans-AlO3(OH)3. The two phosphorus atoms in brazilianite are coordinated in a tetrahedral with four oxygen atoms each. The sodium atom is located within the P-O and Al-O polyhedral in an irregular cavity. The coordination of the sodium is best described as the uncommon seven- coordination. The presence of a hydrogen ion in the same cavity where a sodium ion is causes a repulsion between the two, forcing sodium to one side of the cavity so that is it more coordinated with oxygen than its other side. Gatehouse et al., 1974 described the four remaining hydrogen as being in a chain and contributing to the complexity of the structure but Gatta et al., 2013, gives a well define H-bonding scheme and how these hydrogen items confines in OH groups. One of the hydrogen in brazilianite splits to make a fifth hydrogen. The splitting of this hydrogen has not been explained why it happens but it was shown that it can affect the hydrogen bond configuration. Some of the oxygen atoms in the four OH groups in brazilianite act as donors and some as acceptors of the hydrogen bond. One of these oxygen items is both a donor and acceptor to accommodate the hydrogen that split into two.  Physical properties  Brazilianite is a mineral in the monoclinic system that is part of the point group 2/m and belongs to the space group P21/n. The crystals of brazilianite are elongated and prismatic along [100]. Most common forms that are measured in brazilianite {010}, {110}, { 11}. It displays a perfect cleavage on (010), it is brittle and has a conchoidal fracture. The mineral has a Mohs hardness of 5.5 and was believed it had a specific gravity of 2.94 which was first determined by Pough and Henderson, 1945. With the second occurrence of the mineral, it was determined that the specific gravity of the mineral was actually 2.98. Brazilianite has a vitreous luster, has a white streak, and the mineral is translucent to transparent. The color of brazilianite ranges from dark yellow-green to a pale yellow. Brazilianite begins to lose its color when heated to 200 ¬∞C and becomes colorless when it is heated to 300 ¬∞C.  Geological occurrence  Brazilianite crystals on muscovite, Galilea mine, Minas Gerais, Brazil Brazilianite is typically found in granite pegmatite and it is often found the cavities within the pegmatite where quartz, beryl and mica are also found. Different habits of brazilianite have been found in different locations. Brazilianite is often found with muscovite. The Corrego Frio pegmatite where brazilianite is found in Brazil is an altered pegmatite dike that had weathered biotite schist between its walls. In New Hampshire, the pegmatite where the brazilianite was found was made up of 99 percent albite, mica, and quartz.Pecora and Fahey, The Corrego Frio Pegmatite, Minas Gerais: Scorzalite and Souzalite, Two New Phosphate Minerals, (1949) American Mineralogist: 34: 83 Brazilianite also found with tourmaline and feldspar. The sequence of the mineral formation in the pegmatite in Brazil had not been determined. The sequence of mineral formation in New Hampshire was quartz, brazilianite, apatite, whitlockite, and quartz. During the hydrothermal stage, the pegmatite containing the brazilianite is traversed by a late stage low temperature hydrothermal veins where amblygonite-montebrasite is altered to form brazilianite. Brazilianite has been described from other granite pegmatites in Brazil and the United States. It has also been found in different locations in the world, including Rwanda, Yukon Creek in Canada, Argentina, China, France, and Australia.  Special characteristics  Brazilianite is sometimes used as a gemstone.Firefly Guide to Gems By Cally Oldershaw Brazilianite is relatively new phosphate minerals along with amblygonite, turquoise and apatite that are used as gemstones. Brazilianite is often confused with amblygonite, apatite, chrysoberyl, beryl, and topaz. Even though it was first described in 1945, its discovery was actually in 1944 but it was believed it was chrysoberyl until analysis was done to the mineral indicating a new mineral. The State of Minas Gerais is the largest producer and exporter of gemstones in Brazil and is accountable for 74 percent of the official production which includes brazilianite. It is soft and fragile causing it not to be a popular stone. When brazilianite is heated, it loses it yellow color and becomes colorless.

It forms yellow to reddish brown monoclinic- prismatic crystals with perfect cleavage. The typical form is as encrustations and pulverulent earthy masses. It forms as efflorescent encrustations in underground uranium mines. It has a Mohs hardness of 2 and a specific gravity of 3.66. It is strongly fluorescent yellow in UV radiation and is a radioactive mineral. Historical usage A mineral which caught the attention of a Bohemian metallurgist, Adolf Patera in the 1850s by its striking colour. It was named after the Austrian mineralogist Franz Xaver Maximilian Zippe (1791‚Äì1863).R√∂sler, Hans J√ºrgen (1981) Lehrbuch der Mineralogie (Manual of Mineralogy) Deutscher Verlag f√ºr Grundstoffindustrie, Leipzig, page 418, , in German This was during the period when the fame of the Jachymov silver mines was dying out. On top of the large, forgotten pit-heaps, powdery minerals began to appear, vividly coloured, originating from the decomposition of the pitchblende. These colourful layers, in which zippeite was in the majority, gave Patera the idea of utilizing the uranium minerals in the manufacture of paints. Mining began in 1859 not only for the products which resulted from uraninite's decomposition, but for uraninite itself. A variety of yellow paints were manufactured because among all the secondary minerals on the pit- heap there was a prevalence of the yellow powdery coatings. Zippeite is one of the so-called 'uranium ochres'. It occurs in association with uranopilite, a monoclinic, complex water-soluble alkaline with other secondary uranium minerals in the weathered veins of uranium. Apart from Jachymov in Bohemia it occurs mainly near W√∂lsendorf in Bavaria (Germany) and also in Utah (U.S.). Zippeite is no longer used for the manufacture of paints, but is still used as a uranium ore, as is pitchblende.

Early life He was the posthumous son of a military man who fought against the Carlists and in the campaigns of Cuba, from where he returned ill. In 1911 Rojo entered the Infantry Academy at the Alcazar of Toledo, receiving his commission in 1914 with the rank of second lieutenant, fourth in a class of 390 cadets. After having been assigned to Barcelona he went on to the Group of Regulars from Ceuta (the Regulares were Moroccan colonial troops with Spanish officers). He was later posted back to Barcelona and to La Seu d'Urgell. In 1922, having risen to the rank of captain, he returned to the Infantry Academy in Toledo, where he occupied diverse educational and administrative positions. He was one of the editors of the curricula on the subjects of \\"Tactics\\", \\"Weaponry\\" and \\"Firepower\\" for the new section of the Military Academy of Zaragoza. In this period at the Academy he collaborated on the foundation and direction of the Military Bibliographical Collection, along with captain Emilio Alam√°n. In August 1932, he left the Academy to enter the Superior War School with the objective to make the course of the General Staff. During his time at the academy, a peculiar event took place in which he proposed to the cadets a tactical assumption that consisted of passing through the river Ebro to establish a route in the Reus-Granadella, an operation very similar to one a few years later, during the civil war, he would later put into practice in the famous Battle of the Ebro in the area between Mequinenza and Amposta. He was promoted to major on 25 February 1936.  Spanish Civil War  When the Civil War started (July 1936), Rojo - a devout Catholic, and linked to the conservative Uni√≥n Militar Espa√±ola - stayed loyal to the Republican Government and was one of the military professionals who participated in the reorganization of the Spanish Republican Army. In October 1936 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and was designated head of the General Staff of the Forces of Defense commanded by General Jose Miaja, head of the Junta de Defensa de Madrid created to defend the capital at all costs after the transfer of the Republican government from Madrid to Valencia. In this capacity he prepared an effective defense plan for the city that prevented its fall. Afterwards, his fame as an organizer increased. As head of the Central Army HQ, he demonstrated outstanding performance in the planning of the main operations developed by the mentioned Army, in the battles of Jarama, Guadalajara, Brunete and Belchite.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939. Penguin Books. 2006. London. pp.296-297 On 24 March 1937 he was promoted to colonel, and after the formation of the Negr√≠n government in May, was made Head of the General Command Staff of the Armed Forces and head of the General Staff of the Ground forces. From this new position he was in charge of directing the expansion of the People's Army, and created the denominated Mobile Army, that served as the offensive advance force of the Republican Army. On 22 September 1937 he was promoted to the rank of general. Throughout that year he planned the offensives of Huesca, Brunete, Belchite, Zaragoza and Teruel. He was awarded the highest Republican decoration, the \\"Placa Laureada de Madrid\\" on 11 January 1938 for his planning of the last mentioned operation. The most ambitious operation he carried out throughout 1938 was the offensive of the Ebro, a plan that grew from the previously mentioned tactical assumption developed in the Superior War School, that gave rise to the long running battles of the Ebro that developed from 25 July to 16 November 1938. In these battles the Republic gambled its international prestige, its endurance and the possibility of being able to give a favorable turn to the course of the war. In December 1938 he planned an offensive in Andalusia and Extremadura in order to halt the Nationalist offensive against Catalonia, but the generals Matallana and Miaja rejected the plan and the offensive didn't start until January 1939 and failed.  Exile  After the fall of Catalonia, in February 1939, he moved with the government to France, where on 12 February 1939 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General, the second only of the Republican army. After a brief stay in that country, the Service of Emigration of Spanish Republicans (SERE) paid his passage to Buenos Aires. Between 1943 and 1956 he taught as a professor at the military school of Bolivia. Rojo has been considered one of the most prestigious military officers of the Republic, and of the war as a whole. His figure was respected even by his Nationalist opponents. The most surprising homage is Francisco Franco's portrayal of him in the film Raza.  Return to Spain and death  In February 1957 he returned to Spain, where most of his family already lived. This return was made possible through a series of negotiations which involved several Nationalist military officers in Madrid, F. Jos√© Lu√≠s Almenar Betancourt S.J., a Jesuit who was in contact him during his stay in Bolivia, and the Bishop of Cochabamba, a former military chaplain who had served under Rojo. Although he was not bothered in the beginning by the Francoist authorities, on 16 July 1957 the Special Court for the Repression of Masonry and Communism informed him that he would be prosecuted for the crime of military rebellion, in his position as ex-commander of the Army. This was the customary charge for professional military officers who had not joined the rebels in 1936. He was sentenced to 30 years, but did not serve a single day as the sentence was suspended, and he was soon pardoned. Franco held Rojo in such high esteem that he granted him the pension due a Lt. General of the Spanish army upon his return to Spain. A number of nationalist officers have publicly said that if Rojo had been allowed to conduct operations without the interference of Soviet officers, the outcome of the war might have been different. (\\"Franco: The Man and his Nation\\"; George Hills. Macmillan Company (1967). Vicente Rojo died at his home in Madrid on 15 June 1966. Of the obituaries appearing in the Spanish press, only the one in El Alc√°zar, ‚Äì mouthpiece of the Francoist ex-combatants ‚Äì and the one by noted Falangist writer Rafael Garcia Serrano in the party press, amply eulogized his military achievements. He wrote several books detailing his military experiences in the civil war, which were published in the following order: ¬°Alerta a los pueblos! (1939), ¬°Espa√±a heroica! (1961) and As√≠ fue la defensa de Madrid (1967).

The civil parish covers an area between the villages of Datchworth, Woolmer Green, Codicote, Kimpton, Whitwell, St Paul's Walden and Langley, and encompasses the village of Knebworth, the small village of Old Knebworth and Knebworth House. History There is evidence of people living in the area as far back as the 11th century as it is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 where it is referred to as Chenepeworde (the farm belonging to the Dane, Cnebba), with a recorded population of 33 households and land belonging to Eskil (of Ware), a thegn of King Edward the Confessor. The original village, now known as Old Knebworth, developed around within the parish of the Church of St Mary and St Thomas. The stone church was built around 1120, and although the Domesday Book makes no mention of the church there is speculation to suggest there may have been a Saxon church of timber on the site before the more substantial one was built. The manor passed into the hands of the Lytton family around 1492, when the manor house was rebuilt to a Late Gothic manor house. The house changed very little until the 19th century when it was re-modelled into the present-day Tudor Gothic building. Knebworth was a largely agricultural community, producing wheat and barely in particular. The proximity to London via the Great North Road (subsequently the A1, and now the B197 since the opening of the A1(M) motorway in 1962) made it possible to transport produce. By the start of the 19th century Knebworth had a population of around 250 people but the industrial revolution and the railway coming to Knebworth changed that. Development of the newer Knebworth village started was centred a mile to the east of Old Knebworth on the new railway station and the Great North Road. The railway which was originally meant to go through Codicote to the West was negotiated by Lord Lytton to go through the grounds of Knebworth and that a station be built. The Great Northern Railway, itself opened in 1850, opened a station at Knebworth in 1884. The Station created a brand-new settlement called Knebworth Station known later as New Knebworth, then, just as Knebworth, with the original village becoming known as Old Knebworth. Lord Lytton set up a company, Knebworth Garden Villages, to build homes either side of the railway embankment. Prior to this only a few farmhouses had stood nearby including Swangley‚Äôs farm and Deards End farm. The Station eventually grew to include a signal box and goods yard to the north, approximately where Kerr Close is now. Migrants from London, neighbouring counties and even more distant areas of the country came to work in the new settlement. At the turn of the century the architect Edwin Lutyens built Homewood, southeast of Old Knebworth, as a dower house for Edith Bulwer-Lytton. Her daughter, the suffragette Constance Lytton also lived there, until just before her death in 1923. Ediths third daughter Lady Emily Bulwer-Lytton had married Lutyens in 1897. Lutyens was responsible for a number of notable buildings in the new village of Knebworth as well, including the Bank, St Martins church, the Golf Clubhouse and the telephone exchange. Knebworth has, since 1974, been famously associated with numerous major open air rock and pop concerts at Knebworth House, including Queen's final live performance which took place on 9 August 1986 and drew an attendance estimated at 125,000, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Oasis playing to a quarter of a million people for 2 nights in 1996 and more recently Robbie Williams, who for three nights in August 2003 performed to the largest crowds ever assembled for a single performer.

The character was created by Milestone Comics founders Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, Michael Davis, and Derek T. Dingle. Static's first appearance was made in Static #1 (June 1993) in the Modern Age of Comic Books, written by McDuffie and Robert L. Washington III, and illustrated by John Paul Leon. Virgil Ovid Hawkins is a member of a fictional subspecies of humans with superhuman abilities known as metahumans. Not born with his powers, Hawkins' abilities develop after an incident exposes him to a radioactive chemical. This event renders him capable of electromagnetic control and generation. The character drew much inspiration and was in fact designed to represent a modern-era Spider-Man archetype. After the closing of Milestone Comics, Static was incorporated into the DC Universe and became a member of the Teen Titans. A common misconception is that Hawkins is the son of fellow DC Comics superhero Black Lightning, who debuted much earlier and possesses electrical abilities. Black Lightning addresses the coincidence once in a Justice League narrative. Static has made numerous appearances in other forms of media. The character has been featured in various animated series, including Static Shock, a version of the storyline made slightly more suitable for a younger audience, as well as animated films and video games. Publication history An African-American teenager, Static was a key character of Milestone Comics, an independently-owned imprint of DC Comics founded by Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, Michael Davis, and Derek T. Dingle with a greater representation of minority heroes. Originally developed for Marvel Comics, Static would become a main staple of the Milestone line. When initially creating the first five characters for Milestone Comics, it was decided that Static should be a teenage hero, similar to Marvel's Spider-Man. Static's civilian identity, Virgil Hawkins, was named after Virgil D. Hawkins, a black man who was denied entrance to the University of Florida's law school due to his race in 1949. The character's superhero identity was suggested by writer Christopher Priest (who co-developed the original Milestone bible with McDuffie), inspired by the song \\"Static\\" by James Brown. The character was introduced in one of the first four titles of comic books published by Milestone in 1993. His early adventures were written by Dwayne McDuffie and Robert L. Washington III, and penciled by John Paul Leon. Virgil Hawkins was fifteen years old when he became Static. In the comics, Virgil's family consists of his father, Robert, who works at Paris Island Hospital; his mother, Jean; and his sister, Sharon. Virgil attends Ernest Hemingway High School in the city of Dakota with his friends: Frieda Goren, Richard \\"Rick\\" Stone, Larry Wade, Chuck, Felix, and Daisy Watkins. In the guise of Static, Virgil eventually rescues \\"Rick Stone\\" from danger. Not unlike Spider-Man, the character has a propensity for witty banter and humor, especially when engaged with opponents. In addition, Virgil utilizes his knowledge of science and pop culture in various battles and scenarios as Static. McDuffie described the character: > \\"Like any other awkward 15-year-old, Virgil Hawkins worries about pocket > money, getting beaten up, and drugs. But recently, he's had even more on his > mind: stuff like his powers, his secret identity, and drugs. Because, when > innocents are in danger, and Virgil can slip away from class, the geeky > youth becomes Static, the dashing, adventurous superhero!\\" During the DC FanDome, according to Phil LaMarr, who voiced Static on the Static Shock on the animated series: A self-professed geek, Virgil is portrayed as avid comic book and video game fan, something that was retained for his animated incarnation. In the comics, Virgil regularly visits the local comic store, in addition to creating fan comics with his friends, and participates in HeroClix-style and other tabletop role-playing games. In addition, he has been shown to be an avid video gamer at several points in both his series and the Teen Titans.Static Shock: the Rebirth of Cool #1 In the 2001 miniseries Static Shock: Rebirth of the Cool, it is shown that at that point in time, Virgil is into collecting Pok√©mon cards and he likes Pikachu (the flagship Pok√©mon of the franchise and a fellow user of electricity). In an interview with former Teen Titans writer Geoff Johns, he expressed interest in having Static as part of the team, stating, \\"I really wanted Static on the team, but there‚Äôs so much red tape there that every time I requested it DC said 'not yet' and so I never got to have him\\" and later stating he had plans for the character since Teen Titans #1 (vol. 3). Any obstructions were eventually resolved and Static appeared in the Terror Titans, with his Milestone continuity folded in the mainstream New Earth continuity. At the San Diego Comic-Con 2008, it was announced that Static would be joining the mainstream DC Universe where he would be added to the Teen Titans. Static made his first canonical DC Universe appearance in Terror Titans #4, battling Rose Wilson in the final round of the Dark Side Club Tournament. In June 2010, DC Comics announced that Static would be receiving his own series in 2011. The series was to be written by Felicia Henderson and drawn by Scott McDaniel, but was cancelled before the first issue could be released following the death of Static's creator, Dwayne McDuffie. However, a one-shot entitled Static Shock Special was released in June 2011, written by Henderson and drawn by Denys Cowan. Batwoman artist JH Williams III provided the one-shot's cover. A new series featuring Static titled Static Shock was launched in September 2011 as part of DC's relaunch after the Flashpoint event. The book is written by John Rozum and drawn by Scott McDaniel, who also co-writes. As part of an effort to better integrate Static into the mainstream DCU, the title takes place in New York City rather than Dakota. At DC FanDome, a new Static Shock digital comics series was announced for February 2021 Fictional character biography Dakota Verse Static, in his original costume, appearing on the cover of Static: Rebirth of the Cool\\" #1 Doused with an experimental chemical in a gang war he was caught up in, high school student Virgil Ovid Hawkins gains a variety of electromagnetic powers and becomes a costumed crusader against crime. Like most teenaged heroes in the Spider-Man mold, he is often overwhelmed by the combined responsibilities of his career as a superhero and typical adolescent problems. A resident of the city of Dakota, Virgil first gained his electromagnetic powers at a huge showdown between the gangs of the city, when he hoped to get revenge on a gang member who had been bullying him. The authorities arrive and release tear gas with what they believe to be a harmless radioactive marker so that any gang members would not escape arrest. The cops do not know the marker had been further spiked with an experimental mutagen called Quantum Juice (Q-Juice). This event ultimately came to be known as the so-called \\"Big Bang.\\" Those who were exposed came to be referred to as \\"bang babies\\" because the Big Bang was their metahuman birth. When the agency behind the experiment tried to capture him, he fights back, discovering that he has gained the ability to generate, manipulate, and control electromagnetism. Virgil names himself \\"Static\\" and, armed with his wits and powers, became a superhero. For the most part, Virgil keeps his secret from his family, but his friend, Frieda Goren, learns his identity when he attempts to protect her from becoming a prize in a small skirmish between gangs. Virgil has friends like Rick Stone & Larry Wade, he also has a romantic interest in his other friend Frieda Goren but she was already involved with Larry Wade. He also has feelings for a girl named Daisy Watkins, but his 'responsibilities' as Static interfere with their dates too many times and Daisy calls their relationship off. In Static Shock: Rebirth of the Cool, Virgil is involved with a girl named Madison, but Frieda ends up fighting with her over him. Static has had confrontations with numerous bang babies and other super powered adversaries: Hotstreak, Tarmack, Holocaust, Commando X, Puff, Coil, Snakefingers, Rift, The Swarm, Dr. Kilgore, Rubberband Man, Brat-atat-tat, Prometheus, Run, Jump & Burn, Boom Box, Powerfist, LaserJet, etc. Other Bang-Babies that Static has encountered include Virus, D-Struct and Hyacinth. Static Shock: Rebirth of the Cool In the mini- series Static Shock: Rebirth of the Cool it is revealed that Virgil has given up his superhero career as Static. He enjoys his time being a civilian again but sometimes misses being a superhero as his friend and confidant Frieda gets him to begrudgingly admit. He eventually returns after being persuaded by many fellow heroes including Blitzen and Hardware for one final battle. After the battle, with a man named John Tower who is revealed to have been the first and greatest superhero in the Milestone Universe, Virgil decides to return to his career as Static. But as he informs Frieda it likely won't be on a full-time basis as it was before. Other heroes Later in the comic line, Static is aided by allies: the Shadow Cabinet, the Blood Syndicate, and DCPD officer Captain Summers, who has a big interest in police cases involving Bang-Babies. Static teams up with Page, the sidekick to Kobalt, in order to stop a maddened Bang-Baby who had become half-fly. Static takes a moment to scold Page, who, in his opinion, seems more concerned with making excuses over their initial meet up than what was more important, stopping the danger. Static ends up joining the unofficial group called Heroes. Multiple superheroes come together to protect the town of Iberia from a dam break. Many innocent citizens perish, but the heroes are still recognized for their efforts in saving the survivors and doing what they could. Static appears among the group, quips \\"You started the X-Men without me\\", and talks his way onto the team. Minutes later, the Shadow Cabinet, now corrupt, sends a death squad after a few of his newfound friends. DC Universe Following the death of Darkseid (as chronicled in Final Crisis), the space-time continuum was torn asunder, threatening the existence of both the Dakotaverse and the mainstream DC universe. The being known as Dharma was able to use energies that he harnessed from Rift (upon that being's defeat in Worlds Collide) to merge the two universes, creating an entirely new continuity. Only Dharma, Icon, and Superman are aware that Dakota and its inhabitants ever existed in a parallel universe.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #34 (August 2009) Dark Side Club In the buildup to the Final Crisis, the cosmic tyrant Darkseid hires the Terror Titans to capture Static, along with a number of the other Bang Babies in Dakota for use in the metahuman deathmatches in the Dark Side Club. During his tenure in captivity, Virgil is subjected to the Anti-Life Equation and entered into the tournaments, where he presumably kills a number of combatants. He quickly becomes the champion, and reigns undefeated for a time, though in the end, he proves hard to control. To Clock King's displeasure, he has to be restricted to the lower-levels where he is kept locked up and heavily sedated. In an attempt to entice Rose Wilson and make a profit, Clock King releases Static and sets him against Rose in the ring. In the ring, the two have an intense fight where Static's lightning-fast attacks are able to injure Rose, even despite her precognition. After a drawn-out fight, Static emerges the winner, but briefly breaks free of control before being sedated once more. Static is eventually freed by Rose (albeit off panel) and takes his revenge against his former captors, electrocuting Lashina and her cohorts as they try to escape. He also briefly duels with fellow electricity-wielder Dreadbolt, defeating and binding him in metal along with the other Terror Titans. In his final appearance he's seen joining up with Miss Martian and Aquagirl, planning their next move.Terror Titans #1-6 (December 2008-May 2009) Joining the Teen Titans After the Crisis has ended, Static and the other Dark Side Club survivors arrive at Titans Tower in order to rest. Wonder Girl, the current leader of the team, offers all of the young heroes spots on the team roster, but most of them, including Terra and Zachary Zatara, decline. While exploring the Tower, Virgil strikes up a chemistry with Aquagirl, a teenaged superheroine who was briefly a member of the team during 52. During a conversation with Virgil, she claims that she enjoyed her time with the team, and wishes to join up again, a statement that influences his decision to do the same. He also playfully insults Kid Devil and Jaime Reyes after they attempt to talk to him, mocking Kid Devil over his recent loss of his abilities. He claims that he was abducted by the Terror Titans months beforehand, and realizes that his family must believe him to be dead. Believing he has no place to go for the time being, Static decides to become a Titan and live at the Tower until he can get his life together.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #69 (June 2009) Later, when crazed former-Titan Jericho (in the guise of Cyborg) takes control of the Tower and its systems in an attempt to kill the team, Static thwarts him by releasing a high-energy charge overloading the entire Tower, as well as Cyborg's body, saving the rest of the team in the process.Teen Titans Annual (2009) During a trip to the piers in order to relax, the Titans face off with the supervillain team known as the Fearsome Five, after they kidnap Wonder Girl and hold her hostage on Alcatraz Island. In the ensuing battle, Static defeats the villain known as Rumble by tricking him into moving into a pool of water, thus amplifying the effects of his electric attacks. In the aftermath of the battle, Virgil attends Kid Devil's funeral after he is killed saving the city from a nuclear explosion. When former Titan Raven shows up at Titans Tower injured and unconscious, Static assists Justice Society of America member Dr. Mid-Nite in helping treat her, using his abilities to sedate Raven when a demon emerges from her body.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #75 (September 2009) Brave and the Bold In a 2009 storyline it was recently revealed that prior to his abduction, Static teamed with Justice League member Black Lightning in order to stop former Blood Syndicate member Holocaust, who had tried to kill the superhero while he was acting as the keynote speaker at Ernest Hemingway High's senior graduation.Brave and the Bold (vol. 3) #24 (August 2009) Return to Dakota Virgil finally decides to see his family again after learning that a deadly virus has been infecting citizens of Dakota, including Sharon. After returning home, Virgil reunites with his family as well as Frieda, and learns that his girlfriend Madison has left him during his absence. He discovers that whoever created the virus is also selling limited supplies of the vaccine, and attacks the lab where it is being made. Upon breaking into the facility, Static is surprised and knocked out by Holocaust.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #79 (January 2010) After refusing to help Holocaust in his pursuits, Static is imprisoned in a specialized containment unit alongside Aquagirl, Wonder Girl, and Bombshell. Holocaust informs the heroes that he plans to kill them and weaponize their abilities in order to sell them, but is ambushed by the rest of the Titans before this can happen. Holocaust easily defeats them, only to be confronted by Cyborg, who has recruited former Titans Kid Flash and Superboy.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #81 (May 2010) The three are able to hold off Holocaust long enough for Virgil and the others to escape, and ultimately the combined might of all ten Teen Titans is enough to defeat the villain once and for all. After this, Virgil reconciles with Frieda and tells her that he has tricked his family into believing that he has taken part in a lengthy quantum physics fellowship, thus giving him an excuse to live in San Francisco with the rest of the Titans. He also makes one last attempt to win back Madison, but she silently rejects him. After this, Virgil and the other Titans decide to head home, now with Superboy and Kid Flash as members again.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #82 (June 2010) After a mission to another dimension to rescue Raven, Virgil returns home to find that he no longer has his powers. Furious and scared over his situation, as well as his inability to help Miss Martian awaken from her coma, Virgil attempts to leave the Tower and return to Dakota. He is stopped by Cyborg, who tells Virgil that he will be of no help to anyone back home without his abilities, and tells him that he has arranged for Virgil to be taken to Cadmus Labs to find a way to get his powers back. Superboy offers to travel to Cadmus in order to support his friend, but Virgil tells him that the Titans need him now. Following a farewell breakfast, Static leaves for Cadmus, with Wonder Girl assuring him that he will always have a place on the team.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #87 (November 2010) During the events of Flashpoint, Barry Allen accidentally alters history after a battle with Professor Zoom. In the newly created reality, Static is shown back in-costume with his powers restored.Flashpoint #5 (October 2011) The New 52 Static's 2011 redesign and cover of the recent second solo series (Static Shock #1). Art by Scott McDaniel. Following the reality-warping events of the 2011 Flashpoint storyline, Virgil and his family leave Dakota for New York after an unspecified tragic incident that, among other things, left his sister Sharon as two separate, identical entities. The vigilante Hardware gives Virgil a new costume and modified flying disk, which enables the two to remain in contact despite living in different cities. Hardware also gives him an internship at S.T.A.R. Labs as an after school job. During his first major battle, Static defeats the villain Sunspot and earns the attention of a criminal syndicate known as the Slate Gang. Static Shock was cancelled as of issue 8 as part of DC's \\"Second Wave\\" of The New 52 titles and replaced by an alternative title. In Teen Titans, it is revealed that Virgil designed the cape and wing apparatus of Red Robin's costume while at S.T.A.R.Teen Titans (vol. 4) #6 (April 2012) Later, while recuperating at S.T.A.R. Labs from a previous battle, the Titans seek Virgil's help in curing Kid Flash, whose cells Virgil discovers are rapidly deteriorating as a result of an alteration of his powers. Virgil provides Kid Flash with a new costume (based on a personal sketch for a variant of the Flash's costume) containing materials that realign his molecules while stabilizing his powers, saving Kid Flash in the process. Powers and abilities Static and Black Lightning discuss the differences between their abilities while facing an enemy (\\"The Brave and the Bold\\" vol. 3 #24). Art by Howard Porter. Static's powers allow him to control electromagnetic phenomena, in particular allowing him to manifest, manipulate both electrical and magnetic energy-Static's powers are best described as superconductor electromagnetism. Static's powers center around electromagnetism, making him part of the Earth's electromagnetic field as well as capable of generating and storing his own electromagnetic energy. He can choose to keep the electromagnetic energy that he currently holds in his body by controlling the current and voltage for whenever he wants to use it. Static's body can generate raw electromagnetic energy, which he can control at will for various purposes. Such uses commonly include magnetizing objects, electrocuting opponents, levitating objects (such as manhole-covers or his self-built metal saucer for use in flight) and people, restraining or adhering people/objects to various surfaces in the form of \\"static cling\\", generating \\"taser punches and kicks\\" with effects similar to a stun gun and at times enough power to send opponents flying during close combat (once even punching a huge bang-baby made of molten magma through a brick wall), various electromagnetic displays as well as electromagnetic nets or cages, blinding flashes, generating thrown ball lightning, producing electromagnetic pulses, and generating electromagnetic force fields to shield himself from attacks, even stopping bullets in mid-air. In the comic book series, Static has displayed the ability to manipulate subatomic particles, in particular electrons. In at least one instance, he has used this ability as an offensive attack to easily knockout a villain with the villain's own electrons, and in another instance, making an intangible enemy tangible. He can also dab and electrocute nearby enemies. As well as releasing surges of electromagnetic energy, which he can do from any part of his body, Static can also drain sources of electricity, such as power lines, batteries and fuse boxes to recharge/replenish his own energy supply. He has also displayed the ability to regenerate his powers after being completely drained by energy-draining villains. Whenever Static has used his powers to a high degree, or experience any other such large energy-drain, he will also experience a sudden, acute sense of fatigue, as his electromagnetic powers are tied into his own bioelectric energy levels. In the episode \\"Aftershock\\", in the 1st season of the animated series, an analysis of his blood shows that Static's electrolytes/blood-salt levels are higher-than-normal, highlighting that Static needs higher blood-salt levels to support the use of his powers, but the higher sodium levels seem to have no effect on his health. Static can also sense and feel-out sources of electromagnetic energy, able to tell if a seemingly abandoned area is actually hot or not. Static can use his powers to hear radio waves and tap into phone lines, including listening in on the police broadband and music stations, as well as making calls, and is also able to use his powers to mimic the uses of electronic devices such as a CD player (in \\"Aftershock\\", he also called himself a \\"human CD player, (even got Surround sound\\"), and is even able to use his powers to use an ordinary trashcan cover simultaneously as a shotgun microphone and a loudspeaker. It is notable that Static has more of a distinctive advantage in cities than anywhere-else, as shown in the events of \\"Aftershock\\", as even in a park, surrounded by trees, Static could make use of the metal pipelines under the ground with his magnetic powers. In both the animated series and comic book, he is shown using his powers to mimic that of a blowtorch allowing him to cut and weld metal together. In the animated series, Static's powers grant him resistance or immunity to forms of mind control, since the human brain is an electromagnetic organ. In \\"Attack of the Living Brain Puppets\\", Static is immune to Madelyn Spaulding's ability to hear the thoughts of others and exert control over their actions, (as speculated by Richie,) Static's greater bioelectric field shields him and his brainwaves from any attempts at reading his mind and asserting control over him, as also seen in the second part of \\"A League of Their Own\\", when one of Brainiac's mind-controlling devices shorts out shortly after being placed on Static. This trait has also been adapted into the comic book mythos; in Terror Titans, Static is shown to have resistance to Darkseid's Anti-Life Equation, coming back to his senses. Static has repeatedly displayed the ability to absorb and/or alter energy from enemy attacks and redirect the energy at said enemy, and in Teen Titans, has even absorbed Kryptonite radiation from a poisoned Superboy and redirected it at an enemy.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #87 (November 2010) Following the events of \\"Flashpoint\\", Static is given a new flying disk that now contains a holographic interface and is capable of collapsing into separate pieces or re- configuring into various forms for various uses and applications. In addition to allowing Static to remain in contact with Hardware, the disk also displays charts and other information relevant to the mission at hand. Virgil has also begun using a three-piece detachable b≈ç staff both activated by and used in conjunction with his powers for use in close-ranged fighting.Static Shock #3 (January 2012) Static's body has been shown to automatically heal itself, even from what would otherwise be lethal wounds, when drawing in large amounts of energy from a nearby energy source.Static Shock #2 (December 2011) Tim Drake has stated that Virgil's understanding of molecular structure rivals the Flash's. Virgil Hawkins is a highly gifted student with a particular interest in the sciences. He is a talented inventor and a natural strategist. Virgil also possesses an almost fanboyish knowledge of comic books, role playing games, pop culture, and science fiction. Weaknesses Static's primary weaknesses are insulators, as his powers have little or no effect on them; as shown in his battle with Rubberband Man. Wood seems to be the one he has the most difficulty with, as it cannot be electromagnetically manipulated, levitated or damaged. In the animated series, he has a vulnerability to water, which (as water is a conductor of electricity), if he gets taken and drenched by surprise, shorts out his powers until he can dry off and replenish them. However, he can fly in the rain without short-circuiting. This weakness only applies in the animated series, as Static has never shown a weakness to water in the comics and has even used it to his advantage. In the animated series, Virgil did use his powers a few times for advantages like the water Bang Baby Aquamaria, as he blasted the wet floor full of electricity, knocking a few of his enemies out. He has also hit the ocean to stop boats. Other versions Milestone Forever Static appears as a major character in the 2010 limited series Milestone Forever, a project designed to detail the final fates of the Milestone launch characters prior to being assimilated into DC's continuity. In Static's tale, the reader first learns that Virgil is attending his ten year high school reunion, and has given up his life of crime-fighting and is now pursuing a career in medicine. Rick (now going by his television moniker of \\"Richie\\") is also now working as a director in Los Angeles, and is open about his homosexuality. Without warning, Hotstreak (recently released from prison and now calling himself Firewheel), attacks the reunion, claiming that he now realizes that Static must have been one of his old classmates. Virgil briefly takes up the Static mantle again for one last fight with his old nemesis, and eventually defeats him. During this time, it is also revealed that Sharon is now married and pregnant, and that Robert has died. Rocket is implied to have taken over as the new Icon.Milestone Forever #1 (February 2010) The story then skips ahead another ten years to show that Virgil is now married to Frieda and has two children, Larry and Sadie (both of whom have inherited his electrical abilities), and now works as a doctor. The story ends with the couple reflecting on their life, and Virgil playfully asking Frieda if she wants him to return to his role as Static. She simply smiles and tells him \\"absolutely not\\", and the two passionately kiss.Milestone Forever #2 (March 2010) Supporting characters Static has a number of supporting characters in his from best friends Rick Stone, Larry Wade and Frieda Goren to sometime love interest Daisy Watkins, and so on. Enemies In other media Television The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air There is a framed copy of Static #1 on Will and Carlton's wall in the pool house. Static Shock * Static was developed into the lead of his own animated series with some changes in the material, generally to make the character more suitable for a younger and wider audience, but still with a focus on contemporary relevance. In the series' first two seasons, Static's outfit was a Blue coat with yellow inner lining and stripes on his coat sleeves, a white shirt with his trademark black lightning bolt symbol, black pants with a white mask, and yellow goggles. By season three, his wardrobe is mostly black and blue with some gold/yellow highlights, and the yellow goggles are replaced with dark blue shades; this wardrobe later appears in his Teen Titans comics appearance. His future-self wears a similar, but slightly darker tone-wise, scheme. In the animated series, Virgil Hawkins (voiced by Phil LaMarr) is a fourteen-year-old honors student at Dakota Union High School who gains his powers by a mutagenic gas explosion, dubbed \\"the Big Bang\\" by the media, which grants numerous residents of Dakota superpowers; those affected are likewise dubbed \\"Bang Babies\\". Virgil lives with his widowed father Robert Hawkins, a social worker and the head of the Freeman Community Center, and his sister Sharon Hawkins, a university student and hospital volunteer. His mother Jean Hawkins died a few years prior, the victim of a stray bullet while she worked as a paramedic during a riot; her death causes Virgil to develop an intense fear/hatred of guns. In \\"Static in Africa\\", it is revealed (or at least hinted at) that Virgil and his family are all of Ghana ancestry (although no relatives are mentioned). Static idolize other positive black superheroes in his world, such as Soul Power, Anansi the Spider (who befriends Virgil and calls him \\"his hero\\" as well), and particularly the Green Lantern John Stewart. Over the course of the series, Static teams up with many DC heroes including Batman and Robin, Batman's future successor Terry McGinnis, the Justice League, and even Superman himself. The episode \\"Future Shock\\" reveals that by the time of Batman Beyond, Static is considered one of the world's greatest heroes; he also has a son who is hinted to be a hero as well. Justice League Unlimited * A grown Static appears in the episode \\"The Once and Future Thing, Part 2: Time, Warped\\" voiced again by Phil LaMarr. He is still an active member by the age of sixty-five, to which Green Lantern stated that the last time he had met him, he was \\"too young to drive\\". Static appears to have aged little in the forty years between the time when he was fourteen. Although Batman states that Static in his time is at least fifty, he appears to be in perfect health when he is finally shown. In the ten years, the only change seems to be that his hair has finally grayed. Static explains that this was due to advanced medical science in the future. During a battle against the Jokerz, Static accidentally fell into a random time portal, which is undone when time is repaired. When everything's back to normal after the time warp is fixed, Static is still alive in the future. It is also shown that his flying disk now deploys in halves out from beneath his boots. Young Justice * Virgil Hawkins is voiced by Bryton James. He first appears in the Invasion episode \\"Beneath\\" as one of the teens abducted by the Reach. He has his first speaking role in the series on the episode \\"Cornered\\", where Virgil tells Black Canary about the experiments the Reach had put him through. He unknowingly displays his manifested electrical powers when a bunch of paper clips ended up stuck together by his electrostatic abilities. In the episode \\"Runaways\\", he and his fellow abductees (based on the various ethnic heroes from Super Friends, with Static taking the place of Black Vulcan) run away from Star Labs when they grow sick of the constant testing. He and the other runaways are stopped by Blue Beetle and help him to battle Red Volcano, saving the scientists and staff. When Blue Beetle ignores the potential harm he is causing during the battle and tries to forcibly take them with him, Virgil and the others escape. The group then are met by Lex Luthor who recruits them. In the episode \\"The Hunt\\", Virgil and his friends destroy everything in sight relating to the Reach until Luthor convinces them to rescue the members of the Team from Warworld (which is now under the Reach's control), using a Father Box to get there and track down Superboy. Once on board, they are attacked by the Reach's enforcers and Black Beetle, who causes them trouble until Arsenal intervenes and frees Mongul, triggering a fight between him and Black Beetle. After the Team is rescued, Nightwing offers a place on the Team for the runaways, but they refuse when he kicks Arsenal off the Team despite him saving their lives and they leave. Arsenal then tells the group that Luthor was using them and the abductees break ties with Luthor and leave with Arsenal. In \\"Endgame\\", Virgil and Black Lightning take down the Magnetic Field Disruptor in Dakota City. Impressed, Black Lightning tells him if he ever needs a mentor, he should let him know. After the battle, Wonder Girl and Robin welcome Virgil, now going by the name \\"Static\\", to the team. He does not wear his costume in this show, however his street clothes resemble those of his Teen Titans costume, but in the episode \\"Endgame\\" he is shown with his circled lightning logo on his T-shirt briefly on the Watchtower. In this version, when Static flies on a disc, his electricity is shown to be directed towards the ground, presumably caused by the grounding effect. In the third season, two years have passed with Virgil under the wing of Black Lightning, who has helped him further develop and perfect his power over electromagnetism. He is later concerned when Jeff admitted that he resigned and hoped that Virgil could find a mentor who was not damaged. He joined Wonder Girl, Blue Beetle and Miss Martian on a mission on New Genesis, in \\"Away Mission\\". Eventually, in \\"Illusion of Control\\", he expressed his desire to find a girlfriend since many of his teammates, and even enemies like Devastation and Psimon, were an item.

From 1949 to 1962 he taught at the School of Oriental and African Studies SOAS, University of London.  Biography  thumb Ernst Westphal was born at Khalavha in Venda, the son of German Lutheran missionary parents. Already as a child he was fluent in German, English, and Afrikaans, like many South Africans. His first and native language, however, was Venda, and as a child he was initiated into the partly secret Venda rites for young men. He studied Zulu and Southern Sotho under Clement Martyn Doke at the University of the Witwatersrand and, after graduating in 1942, was a Lecturer there 1942-1947. He was Lecturer in Bantu Languages at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London 1949-1962, where his best friend was Guy Atkins (the brother of Vera Atkins), also a scholar of African languages. Another friend and associate was Fenner Brockway. Westphal was Professor of African Languages in the School of African studies at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, from 1962 until his retirement in 1984, and recognized as an authority on the click languages of the San, the Khoisan languages, in many of which he was fluent. Rycroft has stated that Westphal spoke six major languages as a native, another six almost perfectly, and of the African languages two hundred or more spoken well. In Lisbon Westphal translated texts and inscriptions found in Mozambique from their original language into Portuguese on behalf of the Portuguese government, collaborating with Prof. de Almeida. Westphal's doctoral thesis The Sentence in Venda (University of London, 1955) is said to have been based entirely on his own knowledge of the language, using no other source. Westphal's family has been deeply involved in the cultural life of South Africa for over a hundred years. His grandfather, Gotthilf Ernst Westphal, for example, saw the potential of the teenage Sol Plaatje, then a student at the Mission Station in Pniel, and gave him private tuition. Among other contributions, Plaatje was a founder and first General Secretary of the ANC. Like E.O.J. Westphal, he possessed extraordinary linguistic gifts, and he was a polyglot. Westphal was also one of the founders of SANCCOB (South African National Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds), the story of which is documented in Marie Philip's book \\"Gregory Jackass Penguin\\". Westphal had three sons: Robin Peter, b. 1945, Richard Geoffrey, b. 1949, and Jonathan Westphal, b. 1951. Prof. Westphal's second wife Althea had originally taken his ashes from Africa to Zennor, to be buried at St. Senara's (St Senara's Church, Zennor), but in the event he was buried in Port Appin, Scotland, near Glencoe. His tombstone carries the words, \\"A True Son of Venda\\". A Festschrift was posthumously published in his honour, African linguistic contributions: presented in honour of Ernst Westphal, ed. by Derek F. Gowlett (Pretoria: Via Afrika, 1992).

Initially known as the United Jharkhand Party, founded by Justin Richard. Later Adivasi Mahashava leader Jaipal Singh Munda joined it. The party was christened in 1949. Jaipal Singh was elected president and Idsen Deba general secretary. The party fared well in the 1952 elections, and got 32 seats out of 352 seats in Bihar assembly becoming a major opposition party. Jharkhand Party participated in election in 1952 and won 33 seats in Bihar legislative assembly. In 1962, It won 20 seats. Jharkhand party submitted memorandum for creation of separate state to States Reorganization Commission but the demand was not conceded because the region had many languages and had not any link language, tribal were in not majority and adverse effects on economy of state after separation. Jaipal Singh was disappointed due to declining popularity of his party and rejection of State demand by States Reorganization Commission. In 1963 Jharkhand Party merged with Indian National Congress. The merger was quite unpopular amongst the party ranks, and a variety of splinter groups, were formed, many of the claiming the name of JKP such as All India Jharkhand Party, The Progressive Hul Jharkhand Party, Rajya Hul Jharkhand Party. On January 8, 2009, Jharkhand Party candidate Raja Peter defeated sitting Chief Minister of Jharkhand, Shibu Soren by over 9,000 votes in presidency of Anosh Ekka and Vice-President Ranvijay Nath Shahdeo.

However, he became evil and corrupt. The world became so gloomy and dark that the earth-goddess Bhumidevi decided that she would not provide crops to humans anymore. She took form as a cow and went into hiding. Meanwhile, a group of Rishis killed Vena out of anger. They then rubbed the thigh of his corpse, and took out all the evil from his body. Afterwards they rubbed Vena's arm, and the good Prithu emerged. This being was Vishnu incarnate, and as soon as he was born, Vishnu's Sharanga bow fell from heaven into his hands. However, Bhumidevi still refused to give crops to people. Then Prithu, the son of Vena, went to jungles for penance,trying to invoke Bhumidevi. During this long period, there came such a situation,wherein,Prithu sees a lion trying to pounce on him to kill him. As he was determined to invoke Bhumidevi, he wanted to try till his last breath,and preferred to die than return barehanded. As King Prithu was mentally getting ready to be beheaded,he experienced a soft rub on his forehead.This was Bhumidevi in the form of a cow, pleased by his penance,licking his forehead...With this, Bhumidevi returned all the medicinal and crop plants to the beings thriving on her. King Prithu had brought Bhumidevi back to her pleasant state, which is why Bhumidevi is also known as Prithvi. The sacred literature of the Hindus contains many cases of conflicts between the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas and even of sanguinary wards between the two. In the Rigveda (10.123), Vena is a personification of a celestial being, perhaps the rainbow. The name of the hymn is also Vena, as is the name of the author of RV 9.85.
