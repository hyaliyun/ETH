Both rugby union and rugby league are physically demanding games, so musculoskeletal injuries are common, as well as injuries to the head and neck, and fractures. During the IRB 2011 Rugby World Cup, a study was conducted to determine the frequency and nature of the injuries sustained. It confirmed that rugby, like many other contact sports, has a high incidence of injury.  Rugby union  In rugby union, blood replacements are provided for by Law 3.10 of the International Rugby Board. A player who has been wounded may be replaced for up to fifteen minutes (running time), during which he or she may receive first-aid treatment to stanch the flow of blood and dress the wound. The player may then ask the referee to return to the pitch of play. The return-to-play regulation is a regulation in rugby union that reduces the likelihood of premature return-to-play by injured players. However studies have shown that there is a high rate of non-compliance with this regulation and therefore highlights the need for implementation and dissemination of the return-to-play regulation.  Rugby league  In rugby league, blood replacement substitutions are enforced by the referee after he has noticed that a player is bleeding. This change takes the place of one of the allocated 10 replacements that teams are allowed. In the case of misconduct, where the incident leading to the injury has been either placed on report or sin-binned or sent off, then the replacement is free (does not count) however when the player returns this counts as an interchange. The blood bin was first used in 1991.  Gamesmanship  Fake blood injuries have been used for tactical benefit, to enable teams to withdraw a player they may wish to bring back on later. A notable example was the \\"Bloodgate\\" incident, where Harlequins wing Tom Williams came off the field with what turned out to be a faked blood injury in order to facilitate a tactical substitution. An investigation by the ERC and the RFU revealed that blood injuries had also been faked by Harlequins to enable tactical substitutions on four previous occasions. These findings resulted in a four-month ban for Williams, a three- year ban for former director of rugby Dean Richards and a two-year ban for physiotherapist Steph Brennan as well as a ¬£260,000 fine for the club.

It was built between 1934 and 1936, under the reign of Sir Claud Hollis, who governed Trinidad and Tobago from 1930 to 1936. This man-made lake is fed from the waters of the Quare River and rainfall from the surrounding mountains. When full it can supply 8.2 million gallons of water to people in Arima, Nettoville, Cleaver Road, Bregan Park, D'Abadie and Arouca. With the dry season, the supply is cut in half. The Hollis catchment also supports a variety of animal life such as lappe, tattoo, howler monkeys, deer, wild hogs, Caiman, talapia and snakes. Hunting nor fishing is permitted near the dam. Visitors are allowed to picnic, however courtesy of the Water and Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago.

The first constitution of the modern Turkish state, it was ratified by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in January 1921. It was a simple document consisting of only 23 short articles. In October 1923 the constitution was amended to declare Turkey to be a republic.http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/english/about_tgna.htm In April the following year the constitution was replaced by an entirely new document, the Constitution of 1924. Background It was prepared by the Grand National Assembly that was elected both as a Constitutional Convention and as an acting Parliament on April 23, 1920, following the de facto collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of the First World War. Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, who would later become the first president of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, was the major driving force behind the preparation of a Constitution that derived its sovereignty from the nation and not from the Sultan, the absolute monarch of the Ottoman Empire. The National Assembly convened with the purpose of writing a would prepare the ground for the proclamation of a Republic and consecrate the principle of national sovereignty. This Constitution would also serve as the legal basis for the Turkish War of Independence during 1919-1923, since it would refute the principles of the Treaty of S√®vres of 1918 signed by the Ottoman Empire, by which a great majority of the Empire's territory would have to be ceded to the Entente powers that had won the First World War. Overview The National Assembly commenced the debates for a new constitution on November 19, 1920 and it was ratified during the session of January 20, 1921. It was the first Turkish Constitution that consecrated the principle of national sovereignty. It was a relatively short text consisting of twenty-three articles, the first nine articles laying out the principles upon which the state would be founded. It delegated the executive and legislative prerogatives to \\"the only true delegate of the sovereignty of the Nation\\", the National Assembly that was to be elected by direct popular vote. After the proclamation of the Republic on October 29, 1923, the executive powers were to be exercised by the President and the Council of Ministers on behalf of the National Assembly. Because of the larger geopolitical conjecture of the time and the lack of a formal declaration of a republic, it failed to mention anything about the role the Sultan might play under this new constitution. From a technical point of view, it could be argued that it left open the possibility that the Sultanate might not be abolished and that it could have been amended to make way for a constitutional monarchy, similar to one founded by the French Constitution of 1791. On hindsight, however, it is clear that this omission was on purpose awaiting the outcome of the Independence War and the cessation of hostilities before the proclamation of the Republic. It also didn't include any references to the judicial system for similar reasons, nor did it define the rights and responsibilities of citizens. Timeline After having come into force on January 20, 1921, it stayed as the law of the land for three years until the adoption of the Constitution of 1924. During this time it witnessed many extremely important and fundamental events in the history of the Republic of Turkey: *The Turkish War of Independence was won by the Turkish forces *The Ottoman Sultanate and all aristocratic titles were abolished on November 1, 1922 *The Treaty of Lausanne that led to the international recognition of the new Republic was signed between Turkey and the Entente powers that had won the First World War on July 24, 1923 *The Republic was officially proclaimed on October 29, 1923 with Atat√ºrk as its first President *The title of the Caliphate that was held by the Ottoman Sultans since 1517 was abolished on March 3, 1924, along with all the remaining vestiges of Islamic Law. (Its powers within Turkey were transferred to the National Assembly and the title has since been inactive. Though very unlikely, the Turkish Republic still retains the right to reinstate the Caliphate.) *Per the law of March 3, 1924, the last Ottoman Sultan, the last Caliph and all members of their imperial families had their citizenships revoked, were exiled forever from the new Republic and their descendants banned from ever setting foot in its territory. The same law also nationalized all the properties of the Imperial Crown without compensation.

The previous record was held by Red Hoff, who died at age 107 in 1998. Biography Simmons was born in Middletown, Delaware. He was a five-foot-ten, left-handed pitcher/outfielder, and began playing for the Germantown Blue Ribbons, a semi-pro team, in 1911. In 1913, the Blue Ribbons became a professional team and were renamed the Homestead Grays, a team that quickly became a Negro League powerhouse. As late as 1926, Simmons pitched for the New York Lincoln Giants of the Eastern Colored League and appeared in at least one game in 1929 for the New York- based Cuban Stars (East) of the Negro National League. During his career, Simmons played on the same team as Hall of Famer Pop Lloyd and against Hall of Famers Judy Johnson and Biz Mackey. Simmons ended his baseball career soon after 1929. Simmons was married in Philadelphia by Rev. John L. Lee on September 15, 1915 to Mary L. \\"Mamie\\" Smith (July 19, 1896 ‚Äì ca. 1944). He and his wife Mary had five children and settled into life as a porter. He later became an assistant manager at Rosenbaum's Department Store in Plainfield, New Jersey. After 29 years of marriage Mamie died ca. 1944. In 1957 Simmons married his second wife, Rebecca Jones (1901 ‚Äì August 20, 1997). In 1971, he retired to St. Petersburg, Florida, where he lived for the rest of his days. After 40 years of marriage, Rebecca died at the age of 96 in 1997. Simmons lived to be at least 108, and outlived all five of his children. At the time of his death Simmons had nine grandchildren, several great-grandchildren, and many great-great grandchildren. In the fall of 2005, baseball history buff and genealogist David Allen Lambert of the New England Historic Genealogical Society rediscovered Simmons. Lambert alerted fellow baseball historians associated with the Negro Leagues, who proceeded to interview this link to early baseball. In May 2006, Dr. Layton Revel -- founder of Texas-based Center for Negro League Baseball Research -- met and interviewed Simmons. He also organized a 111th birthday celebration for him, in 2006, which included approximately 30 former Negro League players from around Florida. A plaque was presented to Silas on his birthday on behalf of the Society for American Baseball Research by Lambert. He was also presented a team jersey with number \\"111\\" from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Simmons died 15 days later at the Westminster Suncoast Nursing Home in St. Petersburg. Age issue Simmons listed his birthdate as October 14, 1895. This is supported by his World War I draft registration card. Silas was married in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania September 15, 1915; on this record of marriage, he signs his name and gives his birthdate as October 14, 1893. The 1900 census lists Silas as having been born in November 1897, which would make him 108 years old at the time of his death. However, the ages in the U.S. Census were often incorrectly recorded; a neighbor could easily have given the information if the resident was not home. Silas' mother, Amy, is listed as having been born in 1882, which suggests she gave birth at age 15 (if in 1897) or age 13 (if in 1895). Ages in draft registration cards have also been wrong. Even if Simmons were only 108 at his death, he still would have been older than Chet Hoff, and thus the longest- lived person to have ever played professional baseball. Simmons is also one of the two known professional athletes to have been born in the 19th century and died in the 21st century, the other being Karl Swanson (1900-2002).

It has over 900 exotic animals including rhinos, hippos, Western lowland gorillas, and orangutans that visitors can view during an African preserve train ride. Activities include hand-feeding of some animals including giraffes. The Gulf Breeze Zoo supports captive breeding, wildlife conservation, and habitat preservation programs. History The zoo started on an acre of land on Burgess Road and later on a larger tract in Cantonment, Florida. It was established in its current location in 1984 by four local businessmen. Pat Quinn, one of the founders, became its first director. The zoo began with about 60 animals on 19 acres of land. In 2004, unable to make a profit, the founders handed over ownership to the nonprofit Gulf Coast Zoological Society. In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan and Dennis struck the area with devastating effect to the Zoo. It closed temporarily on August 17, 2009, awaiting the decisions from the governments of Escambia and Santa Rosa counties to provide $125,000 each in funding. On August 20, 2009, city officials announced that the closure of the zoo would be permanent. In December 2009, the zoo was purchased and rescued by a team of zoological professionals from Virginia Safari Park of Natural Bridge, Virginia. It was renovated and reopened on February 18, 2010, as Gulf Breeze Zoo. On January 20, 2018 the first baby white rhino was born at Gulf Breeze Zoo. She was the first ever rhino calf to be born in its 34-year history. In 2018, the zoo, which at that time was about 50 acres, purchased 35 acres of additional land on the west side of the current site on U.S. 98. In February 2019, a family of six orangutans arrived at the zoo from a conservation center in Connecticut. Exhibits The Gulf Breeze Zoo is divided into 20 acres of walking exhibits and a 30 acres free roaming preserve area that guests take a guided train ride through. The walking portion includes many animals including primates, lions, tigers, marsupials, bears, tortoises, and a large variety of exotic birds such as peacocks, owls, macaws, rhea, emu, ostriches, toucans, flamingos and storks. The Zoo has several interactive feeding areas including a large petting area, a giraffe feeding area, and a walk-through parakeet enclosure. Other highlighted exhibits throughout the park include warthogs, otters, alligators, and camels. Primate exhibits include lemurs, gibbons, guenons, siamangs, golden headed lion tamarins, spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys, Western lowland gorillas, and orangutans. Activities include feeding some animals including giraffes and American alligators, as well as a free-flight Australian parakeet aviary. Another unique area of the walking portion of the Zoo includes a large raised boardwalk that allows visitors to see herds of deer, antelope, capybara, kudu, Southern White rhino and the Orangutan Island. A C.P. Huntington locomotive train takes visitors on a 20-minute guided tour, where they can see many different types of deer, antelope, zebras, and white rhinos roaming on 30 acres and get a close view of the gorillas and Nile hippos.

He served as KCPG's president from 1897 to 1900. He was also the founder of Port Arthur, Texas. Early life Stilwell was born in Rochester, New York, in 1859. While working as a traveling salesman he courted and married Jennie A. Wood, and the couple moved to Kansas City, Missouri and then Chicago, Illinois, where Arthur sold insurance for the Travelers Insurance Company, inventing a coupon annuity life-insurance policy which paid the policy holder an income after a certain age. Rail empire With the money made selling these policies, the Stilwells returned to Kansas City where Arthur sold real estate and began building the Kansas City Suburban Belt Railway. In his quest to connect Kansas City to the Gulf of Mexico by rail, he began building and acquiring rail lines for the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad Company (later to become the Kansas City Southern Railroad), plotting townsites along the way which included Mena, Arkansas, Stilwell, Oklahoma, Port Arthur, Texas, and many more. Setbacks including lawsuits, a hurricane, and yellow fever caused financial problems for the otherwise successful venture, and on April 1, 1899 the KCPG was thrown into receivership by one of its financiers, John Warne Gates, over an unpaid printing bill. Stilwell was out, but the discovery of a giant oilfield in Texas in 1901 ensured the railroad's future success. Unfazed by losing control of the KCPG, Stilwell announced plans to build a railroad connecting Kansas City with the Pacific Ocean and organized the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway. Although progress was made, financial problems and the Mexican Revolution caused this company to be forced into receivership in March 1912. Ironically, oil was discovered under its tracks and was to contribute to the fortune of its receiver William T. Kemper. After that, the Stilwells moved to New York, where Arthur spent his time writing books, plays, poems and hymns. Arthur Stilwell died of apoplexy on September 26, 1928, in New York. His distraught wife, Jennie, committed suicide by jumping out the window of their New York apartment thirteen days later. The Stilwells were said to have left an estate of only $1,000. The cremated remains of the Stilwells have never been located. In all, Arthur Stilwell organized 41 companies of various kinds during his career. He is credited with building more than 2,300 miles of railroad in his lifetime and founding more than 40 cities. Personal life Stilwell published many books after his retirement in 1912. He wrote novels, poetry and plays. He also wrote political works on world affairs and the monetary system. His writing attracted attention because in them he maintained that he had based many of his life and business decisions on the whispers of what he called fairies or brownies. In his memoirs published in 1927 he reframed this as hunches. In 1887 Stilwell started the Fairmount Cycling Club and built the amusement center Fairmount Park between Kansas City and Independence, ostensibly to boost traffic for one of the trolley lines he owned. It became the Kansas City Athletic Club in 1893.Kansas City Athletic Club Records Western Historical Manuscript Collection-Kansas City, November 01, 2005 . Accessed January 2010 The new club boasted a six-hole golf course, the second in the area after the Kansas City Country Club, based in what became Loose Park. The Fairmount Club eventually became the Evanston Club in 1901, and later moved to a new location at Swope Park in 1905. The quickly expanding sport of golf and the fast growth of the city necessitated another move to a rural 137-acre tract outside of the city limits in 1916, becoming the Hillcrest Country Club, now at 82nd and Hillcrest Road in Kansas City. Owing to the clubs location outside of the city, it was a far more liberal, wild place than the rich clubs in town, allowing gambling and having the highest number of female and minority members.

She founded the namesake company Melitta, which still operates under family control. Biography Bentz was born in Dresden. Her father was a publisher. As a housewife, Bentz found that percolators were prone to over-brewing the coffee, espresso-type machines at the time tended to leave grounds in the drink, and linen bag filters were tiresome to clean. She experimented with many means but ended up using blotting paper from her son Willy's school exercise book and a brass pot punctured using a nail. When the free, less bitter coffee was met with general enthusiasm, she decided to set up a business. The Kaiserliche Patentamt (Imperial Patent Office) granted her a patent on 20 June 1908, and on 15 December the company was entered into the commercial register with 73 pfennig as \\"M. Bentz\\". After contracting a tinsmith to manufacture the devices, they sold 1,200 coffee filters at the 1909 Leipzig fair. Her husband Hugo and their sons Horst and Willy were the first employees of the new company. In 1910, the company won a gold medal at the International Health Exhibition and a silver medal at the Saxon Innkeepers' Association. When the First World War erupted, metals were requisitioned for use in Zeppelin construction, her husband was conscripted to Romania, paper was rationed, and coffee beans were impossible to import due to the British blockade, disrupting normal business. During this time she supported herself by selling cartons. Continuing expansion caused the company to move several times within Dresden. By 1928 the demand for their products was so high that the 80 workers had to work in a double-shift system. As no satisfactory production facilities could be found in Dresden, the fast-growing company moved in 1929 to Minden in eastern Westphalia. By that time 100,000 filters had been produced. Horst took over the company, now \\"Bentz & Sohn\\", in 1930. Bentz transferred the majority stake in Melitta-Werke Aktiengesellschaft to Horst and Willy in 1932, but kept a hand in the business, ensuring that the employees were cared for, offering Christmas bonuses, increasing vacation days from 6 to 15 days per year, and reducing the working week to 5 days. She fostered the company's \\"Melitta Aid\\" system, a social fund for company employees. After the outbreak of World War II, production stopped and the company was ordered to produce goods to aid the war effort. At the end of the war, the workers relocated for a time to old factories, barracks, even pubs, because the surviving portions of the main factory had been requisitioned as a provisional administration for the Allied troops, a condition that held for12 years. By 1948, production of filters and paper had resumed, and at the time of her death at Holzhausen at Porta Westfalica in 1950, the company valuation had reached 4.7 million Deutsche Marks. Legacy The grandchildren of Melitta Bentz, Thomas and Stephen Bentz, still control the Melitta Group KG headquartered in Minden in the east of North Rhine-Westphalia, with about 3,300 employees in 50 countries.

Its elongated stems have from three to five prominent ribs with broadly scalloped edges. Ribs of young joints are thin, and the small areoles or spine-bearing areas may bear from one to three minute, nearly black spines which disappear as the joints grow older. The flowers are solitary at terminal areoles, from 3 to 6 centimeters long, and nocturnal. The outer perianth segments are linear, green, and tipped by an areole like those of the tube and ovary. The inner perianth segments are numerous, cream-colored, oblong-obvate, obtuse, and about 8 millimeters long. The fruit is subglobose to ellipsoid and about 4 centimeters in diameter.  Habitat  Leptocereus grantianus is endemic to the island of Culebra which is located just off the northeastern corner of Puerto Rico. Only one population, consisting of approximately 50 individuals, occurs along the rocky coast near Punta Melones. It is found in the subtropical dry forest life zone in dry thickets which grow on a crumbling rock substrate on a steep bank just above the shoreline. Associated species include the sea grape (Coccoloba uvifera) and almacigo (Bursera simaruba).  Status L. grantianus is an endangered species. It is federally listed by the United States Fish & Wildlife Service with an endangered status. Historically, deforestation and selective cutting for agriculture, grazing, production of charcoal, and the cutting of wood for construction materials have affected dry forest vegetation. Currently, the island of Culebra is subject to intense pressure for residential and tourist development. Land adjacent to the population is currently proposed for the development of a housing project. Its ornamental potential may result in take becoming a problem in the future. The steep rocky banks are unstable and located close to the shoreline; therefore, natural events, such as hurricanes, might result in the complete elimination of the only known population.

Historian Emory Hamilton asserts that \\"The Long Hunter was peculiar to Southwest Virginia only, and nowhere else on any frontier did such hunts ever originate\\"Emory L. Hamilton. Historical Sketches of Southwest Virginia 5: The Long Hunters (Wise, VA: Historical Society of Southwest Virginia, March 1970) although the term has been used loosely to describe any unofficial American explorer of the period. Most long hunts started in the Holston River Valley near Chilhowie, Virginia. The hunters came from there and the adjacent valley of the Clinch River, where they were land owners or residents. The parties of two or three men (and rarely more) usually started their hunts in October and ended toward the end of March or early in April. The information gathered by longhunters in the 1760s and 1770s would prove critical to the early settlement of Tennessee and Kentucky. Many longhunters were employed by land surveyors seeking to take advantage of the departure of the French from the Ohio Valley at the end of the Seven Years' War. Some later helped guide settlers to Middle Tennessee and southeastern Kentucky. The long hunters in Tennessee history Bledsoe's Fort Historic Park in Sumner County, Tennessee As colonial settlement approached the base of the Appalachian Mountains in the early 18th century, game in the Piedmont region became more scarce. Merchants returning from trade missions to Overhill Cherokee villages in the Tennessee Valley brought back news of the abundance of game west of the range, and began taking hunters along on their trade expeditions. In 1748 and 1750, Thomas Walker crossed the mountains and explored the Holston River valley, recording and widely publicizing the location of Cumberland Gap-- a pass near the modern border of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee-- which allowed relatively easy access to the headwaters of the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers.J.G.M. Ramsey. The Annals of Tennessee (Johnson City, TN: Overmountain Press, 1999), 65-66. In 1761, Elisha Wallen (spelled variously \\"Walden\\", \\"Wallin\\", and \\"Walling\\") led the first major recorded long hunt into what is now Tennessee. Wallen set up a station camp in Lee County, Virginia, and trekked into the Clinch and Powell valleys in what is now Hawkins County, Tennessee. That same year, Colonel Adam Stephen led a regiment of Virginia soldiers and militia to Long Island of the Holston, in what is now Sullivan County, Tennessee. The expedition, which was launched in retaliation for the Cherokee sacking of Fort Loudoun in 1760, forced the Cherokee to sign a peace treaty.Philip Hamer, Tennessee: A History, 1673-1932 (New York: The American Historical Society, 1933), 62-64.Ramsey, The Annals of Tennessee, 67-68. The end of the Seven Years' War in 1763 removed French claims to lands east of the Mississippi River. With the Cherokee threat minimized, long hunters (some of whom may have been veterans of Stephen's expedition) began crossing into Tennessee and Kentucky in greater numbers. In 1764, Daniel Boone, Richard Callaway and Benjamin Cutbirth explored the upper Holston Valley as agents for Richard Henderson, a land speculator who later played an important role in the early settlement of Tennessee.Ramsey, The Annals of Tennessee, 66-69.Hamer, Tennessee: A History, 64. A camp used by them would later become the home of Boone's friend William Bean, Tennessee's first known permanent Euro-American settler. He built a cabin at the site around 1769.Carolyn Sakowski, Touring the East Tennessee Backroads (Winston- Salem, N.C.: J.F. Blair, 1993), 86-87. Stones River In 1766, James Smith led an ambitious long hunt into Middle and West Tennessee, following the Cumberland River all the way to its mouth. One member of the Smith expedition, Uriah Stone, was hunting along a tributary of the Cumberland when a French hunting companion stole all of his furs. The tributary was subsequently named Stones River.Hamer, Tennessee: A History, 65. Stone returned to the Cumberland valley in 1769 along with fellow hunters Kasper Mansker, Isaac and Abraham Bledsoe, Joseph Drake, and Robert Crockett. Although Crockett was killed, the various trails, salt licks and camping areas identified by the 1766 and 1769 expeditions would later help guide the first English settlers to the Middle Tennessee area.Ramsey, The Annals of Tennessee, 96-97. A royal proclamation issued by King George III in 1763 made it illegal to procure pelts from Cherokee lands without a trading license, which essentially barred hunting west of the Appalachian range. Both the Cherokee and the British, however, had considerable difficulty enforcing this ban. In 1769, Cherokee Chief Oconastota complained to the British Superintendent of Indian Affairs that the entire Cherokee Nation was \\"filling with Hunters, and the guns rattling every way on the path.\\"Paul Bergeron, et al. Tennesseans and their History (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1999), 20. While some long hunters had their pelts confiscated by the Cherokee, and a rare few were even killed, most managed to avoid detection.Bergeron, et al., Tennesseans and their History, 19-20. Legacy Various geographical entities in Tennessee are named for long hunters. Walden Ridge, the eastern escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee, is named for Elisha Wallen, one of the first English Americans to observe it.The WPA Guide to Tennessee (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1986), 480. Originally compiled by the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Project Administration as Tennessee: A Guide to the State, and published in 1939. A high school and dozens of geographical features in Tennessee have been named for Daniel Boone, whose exploits came to symbolize frontier life in Tennessee and Kentucky. Isaac Bledsoe gave his name to Bledsoe Creek in Sumner County, Tennessee, now the site of Bledsoe Creek State Park.Walter Durham. \\"Isaac Bledsoe.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009.

In 1986, the city of Goodlettsville built a replica of Mansker's Station (it is based on historic examples, as the fort's original layout is unknown), which is now open to the public. In the 1970s, the state of Tennessee established Long Hunter State Park along the J. Percy Priest Lake impoundment of Stones River, in the area where Uriah Stone had his furs stolen more than 200 years earlier. The long hunters in Kentucky history 1852 painting of Squire Boone crossing the mountains The end of King George's War in 1748 left control of the territory between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River in dispute. The French wanted the region to connect their holdings in Canada with New Orleans, and the British sought to establish a foothold in the Ohio Valley. The maneuvers of French commander Pierre-Joseph Celoron de Blainville in 1749 discouraged English trade west of the Appalachians, although English speculators remained interested in the region. Walker's 1750 expedition briefly explored what is now southeastern Kentucky, and explorer Christopher Gist managed to reach the mouth of the Kentucky River in 1751.The WPA Guide to Kentucky (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1996), 36. Originally compiled in 1939 by the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Projects Administration. In the opening years of the French and Indian War, the French gained control of the Ohio Valley with the defeat of George Washington at Fort Necessity in 1754. With the fall of Fort Duquesne and the construction of Fort Pitt in 1758, however, the French were forced to evacuate the region. The French departure and a relative state of peace with the Cherokee during the same period opened up the region to English explorers and hunters.Otis Rice, Frontier Kentucky (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1993), 15-16. John and Samuel Pringle, two deserters from Fort Pitt, spent much of the early 1760s hunting in the Tygart Valley and likely ranged into what is now Kentucky. Part of Elisha Walden's 1761 party hunted along the Rockcastle River from their station camp in southwestern Virginia. In 1767, an expedition led by James Harrod and Michael Holsteiner (Michael Stoner) crossed Kentucky from north-to-south, reaching the Nashville area several weeks after departing from the Illinois Country. Around the same time, an expedition led by Benjamin Cutbirth crossed Cumberland Gap and pushed all the way to the Mississippi River, where they shipped the pelts they had collected down to New Orleans.Rice, 20-23. In 1768, an English explorer named John Finley passed through the Yadkin Valley and visited Daniel Boone, with whom he had served in the French and Indian War. Finley told Boone of the natural splendor of Kentucky's Bluegrass region, which he had visited as a merchant before the French and Indian War. The following year, the two led an expedition into Kentucky, traveling up the Rockcastle River and establishing a station camp at Red Lick Fork. While Boone and a companion named John Stuart were hunting along the Kentucky River, they were captured by the Shawnee, and their pelts were confiscated. They returned to their station camp to find it plundered, and learned that Finley and the rest of the expedition had returned to North Carolina. Undeterred, Boone and Stuart continued hunting in the region. Boone was later joined by his brother, Squire, and the Boone brothers remained in the Kentucky wilderness until 1771. Although they again had their pelts confiscated when they were intercepted by the Cherokee at Cumberland Gap, the Boones were nevertheless eager to return to settle in the region.Rice, 24-28. Daniel Boone's vivid accounts of his hunting exploits helped draw a flood of settlers to Kentucky in subsequent years. Legacy Numerous natural and political entities in Kentucky bear the names of long hunters, including Boone County and Boonesborough, named for Daniel Boone, and Harrodsburg, named for James Harrod. Kenton County is named for Simon Kenton, who, believing he was a fugitive, spent the mid-1770s hunting in eastern Kentucky. Long hunter James Knox named the Dix River after Cherokee leader Captain Dick, who gave Knox permission to hunt along the river in 1770.Rice, 24. The U.S. government established Daniel Boone National Forest in 1937 in the eastern part of the state.

Most of these stories were published in The Novel Magazine and later compiled in a book form, in the period 1928 to 1947 (roughly the end of World War II). Jane is often referred to as the \\"female William\\", a reference to the Just William stories of Richmal Crompton which were very popular at the time. Jane was depicted as a young child with angelic looks and golden curls, whose looks often belied her intent. Jane was depicted to be of a tomboyish nature, rebelling against authority, and the books usually used situation comedy to generate humour. Jane uses a distinctive lingo. Among her trademark distinctive speech is the substitution of the word \\"terrible\\" by the distorted form \\"terrable\\". Family Jane's family was created by Evadne Price to contain five members - Jane's father, mother, elder sister, Jane herself and baby Henry. Jane's father and mother are usually referred to in the books as \\"Mr. Turpin\\" and \\"Mrs. Turpin\\", although it is revealed in later books that their names are Henry and Marcia respectively. Jane's elder sister Marjorie (\\"Marge\\" to Jane) was a young woman, and hence interested in boys - a fact often exploited to generate situation comedy. Her exact age has never been stated, but since she doesn't seem to go to school like Jane, it can be assumed that she is at least eighteen and possibly older (early twenties perhaps). \\"Baby\\" Henry appears later on and was once kidnapped by Jane, Pug and Chaw. Aunts and great-aunts (like Great-Aunt Catherine), usually rather formidable characters, are depicted in the books to have regularly visited the Turpin household. Jane lives under threat of being sent to be \\"moulded\\" by her maternal grandparents. Constants and recurring characters Jane is shown to live in the suburb of Little Duppery, a small, well-knit suburban community. The time setting of the Jane books are the times of authorship. Primary recurring characters in the Jane books are: *Vilet the cook: The cook employed by the Turpin household is often shown in Jane stories to be the only person sympathetic to Jane's cause. Jane often refers to Vilet in the stories as the \\"greatest cook in the world\\". *Nana: Jane's nana, who is a hypochondriac, also occurs in numerous stories, but is always referred to as \\"Nana\\". *Arnie the gardener and odd-jobs man: Arnie is employed by the Turpin household as a gardener and odd-jobs man, and is the husband of the cook Vilet. He is also sometimes shown to be mildly sympathetic to Jane. *\\"Pug\\" Washington and \\"Chaw\\" Smith: They are Jane's two bosom friends and \\"henchmen\\". They usually feature in Jane stories together and frequently work at Jane's bidding. A common situation comedy in Jane books involves all three dressed in their best suits and dresses for some occasion, threatening each other with dire consequences in case they laugh at the other's appearance. *Amelia Tweeddale: The most well-behaved girl in Little Duppery, she is a source of scorn for Jane and her friends - who refer to her as \\"Soppy 'Melia\\". Often held up as a glowing example to Jane, many of the Jane plots feature Jane and her friends plotting the downfall of Amelia. Jane's mother is also shown to be at odds with Amelia's mother. *Miss Baldock: An elderly spinster who is often present or referred to in the Jane stories. Miss Baldock is universally disliked by most of Little Duppery, not least of all Jane Turpin (who is usually referred to by Miss Baldock as Janie-Panie). Parallels to William Brown Price did not take kindly to Jane stories being referred to as a copy of the William series. She went on record saying she \\"had never heard of William\\", even though William stories were regularly advertised on Jane book dust jackets. The famous illustrator Thomas Henry (Thomas Henry Fisher), who illustrated both Jane and William books, even signed the illustrations for the Jane books as \\"Marriott\\" so as to distinguish between the two series. Among parallels in the two series : * Similar background: The characters and settings of the two series are very similar - both William and Jane are depicted as being brought up in British middle class suburbia in the period between the two World Wars. World War II features prominently in both Jane and William books. * Similar characters: The main protagonists - Jane Turpin and William Brown have been depicted as being around the age of ten, daredevils, rarely subjugated by parental authority or a conformist middle class society and often bad at studies. * Similar family structure: Both Jane and William were shown to live in small nuclear families with elder siblings (a sister in Jane's case, a brother and a sister in William's case). In both cases, aunts, uncles and great aunts often pay their families a visit, and by being sources of authority and generating antagonism in William or Jane, provide for situation comedy. * Similar book titles: The first William book was called Just William (1922), while the first Jane book was called Just Jane (1928). The fourth book in the two series were called William the Fourth (1924) and Jane the Fourth (1937) respectively. Book titles like William the Pirate (1932), William the Rebel (1933), and William the Gangster (1934) were mirrored by titles like Jane the Sleuth (1939) and Jane the Patient (1940). When William is shown joining the war effort in books like William Does His Bit (1941), the corresponding Jane title was Jane at War (1947). * Similar plot elements: Basic recurring plot elements in William and Jane are often the same. These include letting down the family at big social occasions, plotting the downfall of well-behaved model children and taking advantage of their elder sisters' suitors. * Timeframe of authorship: 39 William books were written in the period 1922 - 1970. Though less prolific as a children's author (Evadne Price wrote hundreds of romantic novels), 10 Jane books were written in the period 1928 - 1947. * Similar format of publishing: Both the William and Jane books were for the niche children's market of the period. They were even published by the same publisher‚ÄîNewnes for a while (before Price switched publishers to Robert Hale). At Newnes, both the series were illustrated by the same person - Thomas Henry. Books of the two series had comparable layouts - being hardbound copies with watercolour art on the jacket, art on the spine and the dust jacket spine, being collections of short stories illustrated in the hatch or crosshatch style. One significant difference in the two series is the absence of an analogue (in the Jane stories) to \\"The Outlaws\\" (in the William stories). While Jane has two close friends in Pug Washington and Chaw Smith, she does not command the kind of fidelity that William Brown commanded over the members of his gang - \\"The Outlaws\\". Thus, Jane tends to have more solitary adventures compared to William. Jane also does not have a pet in the beginning, unlike William - who had a pet dog Jumble, and was often shown keeping hamsters and white mice as pets (references are made to the cat Toothache which is referred to as Jane's, and Jane does manage to get her dog Popeye in the earlier books in the series). Book illustrations Three illustrators primarily illustrated the Jane books - for each of the publishing houses which published the Jane stories (John Hamilton, Newnes, and Robert Hale). Thomas Henry, the first illustrator of the William books, was the illustrator for Newnes, but did not depict Jane as the angelic girl with golden curls. The enduring image of Jane was due to the illustration of Frank R. Grey, who was with the publishing house of Robert Hale. It is worth noting that, even with the handover of Jane copyrights from publishing house to publishing house, the copyrights of the illustrations were not transferred. The first Jane book has thus been illustrated from scratch three times, and the second and third Jane books have been illustrated from scratch twice.

History In 2001, David Tuckman of Tuckon's Sports proposed a $150 million sports arena and performing arts center project to the city council of Bellevue, Washington, an affluent Seattle suburb, to be built on three acres of city-owned land downtown. Tuckman needed sports tenants to sign long-term leases in order to obtain financing for his project, so he paid $125,000 in cash in 2003 to purchase a CBA expansion franchise for Bellevue to become an anchor tenant. The league gave Tuckman permission to play at nearby Bellevue Community College (BCC) for three years while Bellevue Civic Center Arena was being built at NE 8th and 112th NE across the street from the Meydenbauer Convention Center. When it was determined that BCC would not be a suitable venue for professional basketball, Tuckman moved the team to Vancouver and changed the name to the Dragons. Tuckman negotiated a three-year lease with the Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, British Columbia, to play 24 home games each year in the 4,500-seat Agrodome in 2006. That same year, Vancouver was awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics and the Dragons' lease was deferred until the conclusion of the games due to the high demand for indoor sports facilities leading up to the Olympics. In a 2006 interview with the Vancouver Sun newspaper, Tuckman said that one of the hurdles to playing in Vancouver was that most international players had single-entrance visas, which meant that if they left the United States to play a game in Canada, they could not return to the U.S. The Dragons were intended to play in the ABA with Tuckman's other teams. This would be the fourth time that Vancouver had a professional basketball team; Vancouver's other professional teams were the World Basketball League's Vancouver Nighthawks, the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies and the International Basketball League's BC Titans. The Vancouver Dragons deferred participation in the 2007‚Äì08 season citing arena issues. The Dragons were waiting until the conclusion of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver to start the team for the 2010‚Äì11 season.

The aircraft was designed late in 1931 as a low cost and economical light passenger aircraft. Many components including the engine, tailplane, fin, rudder and wings were identical to those being used for the de Havilland DH.82 Tiger Moth then being built in large quantities as a military trainer. These were fitted to the purpose-built wooden, plywood-covered fuselage (longerons: ash forward of the pilot, aft Sitka spruce). The pilot sat in a raised cockpit behind the small enclosed passenger cabin, which was usually fitted with three seats for short- range hops. The \\"Speed Model\\" was fitted with a canopy and fairing. The wings folded for space saving storage. Operational history Manchester (Ringway) Airport in 1955 The prototype first flew on 29 January 1932, and was sent to Canada gaining sufficient interest that seven were assembled at the company's Toronto plant.Jackson 1987, p. 322. \\"Home\\" based production was shared evenly between sales within the United Kingdom and exports, with 49 aircraft each going onto the British register and being sent overseas. British-based aircraft were mostly used on short-haul joyrides or as feeder flights around the British Isles. The DH.83 Fox Moth was the first aircraft to earn a profit in commercial airline service without subsidies. Fox Moth VH-UQM Miss Currie was purchased by Victor Holyman for ¬£1,450 and began operating over the 108-mile route over south-eastern Bass Strait between Launceston, Tasmania and Whitemark on Flinders Island in October 1932. It was thus the inaugural aircraft of what was to later become Australian National Airways. QANTAS used Fox Moths to replace de Havilland DH.50s on the Flying Doctor Service.Jackson 1987, pp. 324‚Äì325. Total production of the DH.83/DHC.83C Fox Moth was 153, being 98 in England, two in Australia and 53 in Canada after WWII.Jackson 1987, p. 327. A number of different engines were used, including the 130 hp (97 kW) Gipsy IIIA on most British-built aircraft and the 145 hp (108 kW) Gipsy Major 1C on the 53 postwar DH.83C Canadian-built aircraft. The DHC-83Cs were fitted with larger pilot cockpit openings, a larger windscreen and canopy, a large ambulance cabin door on the port side to accommodate a stretcher, and did not have folding wings. The DH.83C used DH.82 Tiger Moth main and tail landing gear. The DH.83C was an excellent and economical bush plane.

Based on industry-managed standards such as AdvancedTCA, MicroTCA, Carrier Grade Linux and Service Availability Forum specifications, communications servers are the foundational platform upon which equipment providers build network infrastructure elements for deployments such as IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), IPTV and wireless broadband (e.g. WiMAX). Support for communications servers as a category of server is developing rapidly throughout the communications industry. Standards bodies, industry associations, vendor alliance programs, hardware and software manufacturers, communications server vendors and users are all part of an increasingly robust communications server ecosystem. Regardless of their specific, differentiated features, communications servers have the following attributes: open, flexible, carrier-grade, and communications-focused.  Attributes   Open  *Based on industry-managed open standards *Broad, multi-vendor ecosystem *Industry certified interoperability *Availability of tools that facilitate development and integration of applications at the standardized interfaces *Multiple competitive options for standards-based modules  Flexible  *Designed to easily incorporate application-specific added value at all levels of the solution *Can be rapidly repurposed as needs change to protect customer investment *Multi-level, scalable, bladed architecture *Meets needs of multiple industries beyond telecommunications, such as medical imaging, defense and aerospace  Carrier grade  *Designed for **Longevity of supply **Extended lifecycle (>10 years) support **High availability (>5NINES) *‚ÄúNon-disruptively‚Äù upgradeable and updateable *Hard real time capability to ensure quality of service for critical traffic *Meets network building regulations  Industry-managed standards  Several industry-managed standards are critical to the success of communications servers, including:  AdvancedTCA  The Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA) is a series of PCI Industrial Computers Manufacturers Group (PICMG) specifications, targeted to meet the requirements for carrier grade communications equipment. This series of specifications incorporates the latest trends in high speed interconnect technologies, next generation processors and improved reliability, manageability and serviceability.  AdvancedMC  The PICMG Advanced Mezzanine Card specification defines the base-level requirements for a wide range of high-speed mezzanine cards optimized for, but not limited to, AdvancedTCA Carriers. AdvancedMC enhances AdvancedTCA's flexibility by extending its high-bandwidth, multi-protocol interface to individual hot-swappable modules.  MicroTCA  This PICMG specification provides a framework for combining AdvancedMC modules directly, without the need for an AdvancedTCA or custom carrier. MicroTCA is aimed at smaller equipment ‚Äì such as wireless base stations, Wi-Fi and WiMAX radios, and VoIP access gateways where small physical size low entry cost, and scalability are key requirements.  Carrier Grade Linux  An enhanced version of Linux for use in a highly available, secure, scalable, and maintainable carrier grade system. The specification is managed by the CGL Working Group of the Open Source Development Labs.  HPI and AIS  These Service Availability Forum (SA Forum) specifications define standard interfaces for telecom platform management and high-availability software. The Hardware Platform Interface (HPI) specification defines the interface between high availability middleware and the underlying hardware and operating system. At a higher layer than HPI, the Application Interface Specification (AIS) defines the application programming interface between the high availability middleware and the application. AIS allows an application to run on multiple computing modules, and applications that support AIS can migrate more easily between computing platforms from different manufacturers that support the standard. In addition to the standards development organizations mentioned above, four industry associations / vendor alliance programs are playing key roles in the development of the communications server ecosystem.  Industry associations   SCOPE Alliance  SCOPE Alliance is an industry alliance committed to accelerating the deployment of carrier grade base platforms for service provider applications. Its mission is to help, enable and promote the availability of open carrier grade base platforms based on Commercial-Off-The- Shelf hardware / software and Free Open Source Software building blocks, and to promote interoperability to better serve Service Providers and consumers.  Communications Platforms Trade Association  The Communications Platforms Trade Association (CP-TA) is an association of communications platforms and building block providers dedicated to accelerating the adoption of SIG-governed, open specification-based communications platforms through interoperability certification. With industry collaboration, the CP-TA plans to drive a mainstream market for open industry standards-based communications platforms by certifying interoperable products.  Vendor alliance programs   Intel Communications Alliance  The Intel Communications Alliance is a community of communications and embedded developers and solutions providers committed to the development of modular, standards-based solutions on Intel technologies. Motorola Communications Server Alliance  The Motorola Communications Server Alliance is an ecosystem of technology, service and solution providers aligned to provide standards-based solution elements validated with Motorola's communications servers. Alliance participants receive access to Motorola embedded communications computing product roadmaps, development systems, and participate in marketing activities with Motorola.

He was inspector and director of the Forges du Saint-Maurice and seigneur of Les √âboulements in New France (Canada). Sales Laterri√®re was born near Albi, (perhaps) the son of a French count, Jean Pierre De Sales. He was employed as a clerk by Alexandre Dumas at Quebec City. In 1769, he left Quebec City to practice medicine with a doctor at Montmagny. Though he said he had studied medicine in Paris, Laterri√®re probably began practicing medicine with no formal medical training, not uncommon at that time. In 1771, he was employed as an agent for the Saint-Maurice ironworks at Quebec City. In 1775, Laterri√®re was hired as inspector for the ironworks and he moved to Trois- Rivi√®res. In 1776, the director of the ironworks, Christophe P√©lissier (businessman), was arrested by the British for supplying weapons and ammunition to the American army that was advancing towards Quebec. Laterri√®re was given the post of director after P√©lissier fled to the United States. He also began living with P√©lissier's wife, Marie-Catherine Delezenne. Despite public opinion and criticism from the clergy, this free thinker, defender of midwives and freemason lived unmarried with Marie-Catherine until they finally married in 1799, after the death of her first husband. Imprisoned by the British Governor Frederick Haldimand on the day following the American Invasion, he was then exiled in Newfoundland from 1782 to 1783, following a (probably) false charge of treason. He returned to Quebec and settled on a farm at Baie-du-Febvre (later Baieville) where he resumed the practice of medicine. In 1788, following the passing of \\"An Act or Ordinance to prevent persons practising physic and surgery within the Province of Quebec,or Midwifery in the towns of Quebec or Montreal, without Licence\\" the province of Quebec began to insist on doctors producing their credentials or passing an examination. As Laterri√®re could not produce a medical degree and failed to pass the oral examination he went to study medicine at Harvard University in Massachusetts where a medical school had recently opened and qualified to practice medicine one year later, in 1789. He was Harvard Medical School's first foreign graduate. He returned to Quebec to practice medicine and in 1799, he moved his medical practice to Quebec City. His income from practicing medicine and investments allowed him to purchase the seigneury of Les √âboulements in 1810. He died at Quebec City in 1815. His sons Marc Pascal and Pierre-Jean both became doctors and important figures in the province.

It was produced under the banner of Pritish Nandy communications and was written and directed by first time director Saket Chaudhary. Mallika Sherawat and Rahul Bose played the lead cast. The film is a romantic comedy, and portrays the intricacies of a modern relationship. The film explores the theme of 'commitment phobia' in a captivating manner, an interesting, witty take on men-women relationships. After the success of this movie the lead pair were repeated in another movie Maan Gaye Mughal-e-Azam however that movie couldn't match the success of this movie. A sequel, Shaadi Ke Side Effects, was released in 2014 with Vidya Balan and Farhan Akhtar in the lead roles. Plot Sid (Rahul Bose) is a short, thirtyish DJ, who finds himself playing music at Trisha's (Mallika Sherawat's) marriage to Vivek (Jas Arora) in Delhi. However, he witnesses her fight her sense of responsibility and duty towards her parents and the groom, and runs away. Six months later, he meets her again at a DJ competition in Mumbai, which he has just lost, yet again. Before you know it, they're in a relationship, and three years have passed. Trisha thinks she is ready for marriage, and gets down on her knee to propose to Sid. Sid suffering from the typical commitment phobia, is at a loss for a reasonable answer. In a bid to not lose her, Sid finds himself engaged. But along with the engagement comes a new set of problems - such as shopping for furniture for their home, engagement rings, and more importantly facing the father of the bride (Sharat Saxena)! The father has more than one problem with Sid. He doesn't have a future, he earns a lot less than Trisha, and he doesn't seem responsible enough. Over an altercation Sid has with Trisha's father, the couple break up. Vivek is waiting in the wings, to help mend her broken heart. Sid on the other hand, finds himself being wooed by item girl, Tanya (Sophie Choudhary), star of the 'Baby Girl vol. 3' video. After a few amusing run-ins, an attempt to be just-friends, and a sad-song (\\"Jaane Kya\\" sung by Zubin), Sid, finally realizes, thanks to his mother, that his commitment phobia is the result of a childhood scar. His father abandoned Sid and his mother, when Sid was very young. His mother reassures him, that he is nothing like his father, and would make a great husband. But it's too late, Trisha has already agreed to marry Vivek. This leads him to Trisha's dear friend Anjali (Suchitra Pillai), who reminds him of Dracula because she always attacks him, for making Trisha unhappy. She helps him crash Trisha's wedding party. The climax builds up, as Sid's job involves not just convincing Trisha that his hang-ups have abated, but also avoid a deadly confrontation with Trisha's father.

Novels featuring Superintendent Battle He appears as a detective in the following novels: * The Secret of Chimneys (1925) * The Seven Dials Mystery (1929 - including some of the same characters, notably Lady Eileen \\"Bundle\\" Brent) * Cards on the Table (1936, with Hercule Poirot, Ariadne Oliver and Colonel Race) * Murder is Easy (1939)- Titled as Easy To Kill in the US. * Towards Zero (1944) Police detective Battle is notable for his stolid good sense and careful management of information as a case proceeds. He relies in part on the public notion that police detectives are stupid or unimaginative, when he has a good idea of just what is happening. His moustache is impressive, even to Hercule Poirot. Until Towards Zero the reader knows nothing of his domestic arrangements (with exception to a comment in Chimneys, when he mentions that he is \\"very attached of Mrs Battle\\"), but in this novel we learn that he has a wife and five children, the youngest of whom (Sylvia) unwittingly provides a key clue to the mystery. In the Hercule Poirot novel The Clocks, the pseudonymous secret agent Colin Lamb is heavily implied to be the son of the now-retired Battle. Battle also has a secret professional life that is revealed in the denouement to The Seven Dials Mystery, but this is never referred to again. In this novel he states, that \\"half the people who spent their lives avoiding being run over buses had much better be run over and put safely out of the way. They're no good.\\" Similar statements are given by Major Despard in Cards on the Table and Michael Rodgers in Endless Night and might be approved by Mrs Christie as well. Battle is in many respects typical of Christie's police officers, being (like Inspector Japp), more careful and intelligent than the police officers of early detective fiction, who had served only as foils for the brilliance of the amateur sleuth.

It was the first Polish-designed fighter to enter serial production. Design and development First work on a domestic fighter to replace ill-fated French SPAD 61s in the Polish Air Force was initiated by PWS in 1927. The main designers were Aleksander Grzƒôdzielski and Augustyn Zdaniewski. In 1929 the prototype was built and it first flew in March 1930. At the same time, the more modern fighter PZL P.1 was developed by the PZL. Despite the P.1 being a more capable fighter, the War Ministry decided that it needed further work, and a series of 80 PWS-10 was ordered as a temporary measure. In comparison with the advanced P.1, the PWS-10 was a more classic design, a high-wing parasol monoplane of mixed construction. The series was built from 1931 to 1932, numbered from 5-1 to 5-80. A variant of PWS-10 was a biplane PWS-15, being PWS-10 with another pair of wings. A single prototype was made to compare with a monoplane, on the factory's initiative. It first flew in the spring of 1931. It offered better maneuverability and climb ratio with a slightly lower maximum speed. PWS-15 was not produced and was soon broken up. Description Mixed construction high-wing parasol monoplane, canvas and plywood covered. A fuselage of a metal frame, covered with duralumin in the front section and canvas in the rear section. Two-spar elliptic wings, of wooden construction, canvas, and plywood covered. Stabilizers, rudder, and elevator of metal construction, canvas- covered. Open pilot's cockpit, with a windshield. Conventional fixed landing gear, with a rear skid. Engine: 12-cylinder water-cooled inline W engine Lorraine-Dietrich LD-12Eb, built by license in Polish Skoda Works. Water radiator under a fuselage front. Two-blade wooden propeller of a fixed pitch. Fuel tank 280 l in a fuselage. Armament: two fixed 7.7 mm Vickers machineguns with interrupter gear, in hull sides. Operational history PWS-10 entered service in the Polish Air Force starting from 1932. It was used in cadres nos. 122, 131, 132, 141. Their flight characteristics and performance were mediocre. As soon, as in 1933 they were replaced in combat units by PZL P.7 and moved to aviation school in Dƒôblin. Some were used there by the outbreak of World War II and in summer 1939 all remaining airworthy aircraft were gathered in U≈Çƒô≈º. In late 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, 20 PWS-10 were sold in secret to Spanish nationalist forces, via Portugal, by the SEPEWE syndicate. Aircraft were transported in crates and were assembled by PZL workers. First aircraft was flown in December 1936 in Leon.

It is set in France, centering on the character Brice of Nice (\\"Brice de Nice\\") originally created by Dujardin for a stage sketch. A sequel to the film, Brice 3, was released on 19 October 2016. Plot The main character, a thirty-something surfer named Brice, lives for one thing: the perfect wave to surf, despite the fact that Nice lies on a completely waveless bay on the Mediterranean Sea. While waiting, he uses his rich father's money to throw outrageous parties and develop hilarious insults, as well as worship the film Point Break. When his father is arrested for money laundering, however, things change: Brice's life comes crashing down around him, and after failing to hold down a job, he soon finds himself attempting bank robbery. He lands in hospital after the failed robbery attempt, and runs away from there with the man whose scooter he hijacked while escaping the bank. The two become friends. Stealing Brice's father's lawyer's wife's truck, the two cross France to the Atlantic coast to attend a world surfing championship at Hossegor. With $100,000 in prize money, winning the tournament seems the only chance for the two to help themselves: Brice needs the money to support his lavish lifestyle, while his friend needs it for an operation in his foot (because he has only one enormous toe). Brice \\"talks the talk, but doesn't walk the walk\\", and, predictably, fails at the surf competition. Though all seems lost, the two eventually find success of a sort: Brice surfs his perfect wave, while his friend sets off to travel the world with his newfound love.

As a player, he was a defender from 1981 to 2001. He most notably played for Nottingham Forest and Leeds United. He also played for Tottenham Hotspur, Bolton Wanderers, Notts County and York City. He was capped 7 times by the England U21 side. Playing career He joined his hometown club Nottingham Forest in 1981, where he won the first of his seven England under-21 international caps. Forest however allowed the defender's contract to expire and he had his pick of clubs. Having made 134 appearances and scored 2 goals for Forest, he moved to Tottenham Hotspur in June 1987, with the transfer fee set by tribunal at ¬£387,000. Fairclough proved to be a solid and reliable centre-back, being an ever-present throughout the 1987‚Äì88 season. The 1988‚Äì89 season however was blighted by injury for Fairclough and he only made 20 league appearances. Fairclough was capped seven times at under-21 level for England during the 1980s, but never played for his country at senior level. After failing to reclaim his place in Terry Venables' team, Fairclough joined Leeds United on loan in March 1989. In the summer of 1989 he made the move permanent, moving for a fee of ¬£500,000. He was immediately installed at the heart of the defence, and the team gained promotion, winning the Second Division Championship in 1990 and went on to win the First Division title two years later - the last top division title before the formation of the FA Premier League. In his six years at Elland Road, he was almost ever-present and immensely popular with the fans, picking up Player of the Year in 1990. His partnership with Chris Whyte was a key factor in the Championship win. However, he eventually lost his place in the side and moved to Bolton Wanderers in July 1995 for the same fee he joined the club for, having made 240 appearances scoring 23 goals. Over a period of three years he made 106 appearances scoring 8 goals. He joined Bolton on their promotion to the Premier League, and although he was unable to keep them there, he helped them return at the first attempt by winning the Division One title in 1997 with 100 goals and 98 points, though again they were ultimately relegated from the Premier League after just one season. He had a spell at Notts County (1998‚Äì1999, scoring once against his soon to be employers, York City) before joining York City in 1999 where he stayed until he retired in 2001.

Biography He was born on March 22, 1840 in Cincinnati, Ohio to George R. and Salome (Kemp) Smith. He started a small machine shop in Bridgeton, New Jersey, where he lived most of his life, which became known as the Ferracute Machine Company in 1877.Oberlin Smith: Biography, IEEE Global History Network. Accessed November 2, 2010. For the entire existence of the company he was the president and chief engineer. He died on July 19, 1926 in New Jersey. Magnetic recording On September 8, 1888, Smith published a short note entitled \\"Some Possible Forms of the Phonograph\\" in the British journal Electrical World, where he suggested (probably for the first time) the use of permanent magnetic impressions for the recording of sound.Smith, Oberlin (1888 September 8) \\"Some possible forms of phonograph,\\" The Electrical World, 12 (10) : 116‚Äì117. Smith suggested using cotton or silk thread, into which steel dust or short clippings of fine wire could be suspended. These particles were to be magnetized in accordance with the alternating current from a microphone source. Smith also discussed the possibility of using a hard metal wire or chain, but preferred the thread. Smith built a machine to spin steel dust into thread, but could not harden the dust because of oxidation. As implementing his ideas would require thousands of hours of work, he published his theories but no one attempted to implement them. Many of Smith's ideas were independently reproduced by Valdemar Poulsen when he developed the first true magnetic recorder.

He played college football for the University of Mississippi where he earned unanimous All-American honors, and was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He also played for the Tennessee Titans and Carolina Panthers. Oher's life through his final year of high school and first year of college is one of the subjects of Michael Lewis' 2006 book, The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game, and was featured in the Academy Award-winning 2009 film The Blind Side. Early life Born Michael Jerome Williams, Jr., in Memphis, Tennessee, he was one of 12 children of Denise Oher. His mother suffered from alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction, and his father, Michael Jerome Williams, was frequently in prison. He received little attention and discipline during his childhood. He repeated first and second grades, and attended eleven schools during his first nine years as a student. He was placed in foster care at age seven, and alternated between living in various foster homes and periods of homelessness.Michael Oher . . . his life and football career at Michael Oher fan site (September 9, 2010) Oher's father was a former cellmate of Denise Oher's brother and was murdered in prison when Oher was a senior in high school. Oher played football during his freshman year at a public high school in Memphis. He applied for admission to Briarcrest Christian School at the suggestion of Tony Henderson, an auto mechanic with whom he was living temporarily. Henderson was enrolling his son at the school to fulfill the dying wish of the boy's grandmother and thought Oher might enroll as well. The school's football coach, Hugh Freeze, submitted Oher's school application to the headmaster, who agreed to accept him if Oher could complete a home study program first. He did not finish the program, but was admitted when the headmaster realized that his requirement had removed Oher from the public education system. Coached by Freeze and Tim Long, Briarcrest's offensive line coach, Oher was named Division II (2A) Lineman of the Year in 2003, and First Team Tennessee All-State. Scout.com rated Oher a five-star recruit and the No. 5 offensive lineman prospect in the country. Before that season and for his prior 20 months at Briarcrest, Oher had been living with several foster families. In 2004, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy, a couple with a daughter and son attending Briarcrest, allowed Oher to live with them and eventually adopted him. The family began tending to his needs after becoming familiar with his difficult childhood. They also hired a tutor for him, who worked with him for 20 hours per week. Oher also earned two letters each in track and basketball. He averaged 22 points and 10 rebounds a game, earning All-State honors by helping lead the basketball team to a 27‚Äì6 record, winning the district championship as a senior. Oher was also a state runner-up in the discus as a senior. Oher's low grades were initially a barrier to his acceptance to an NCAA program. He eventually increased his 0.76 grade point average (GPA) to a 2.52 GPA by the end of his senior year so he could attend a Division I school by enrolling in some 10-day-long Internet- based courses from Brigham Young University. Taking and passing the internet courses allowed him to replace Ds and Fs earned in earlier school classes, such as English, with As earned via the Internet. This finally raised his graduating GPA over the required minimum. At the conclusion of his senior season, Oher participated in the 2005 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. College career Though he received scholarship offers from Tennessee, LSU, Alabama, Auburn, and South Carolina, Oher ultimately decided to play for Ed Orgeron at the University of Mississippi, the alma mater of his guardians, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy. His decision to play for the Ole Miss Rebels football team sparked an investigation by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The first issue was that Oher's grade-point average (GPA) was still too low to meet the requirements for a Division I scholarship at the time of the offer from Ole Miss. That difficulty was corrected by graduation, when Oher completed online classes through Brigham Young University. The second issue was the Tuohys' preexisting relationship with the school and the fact that Ole Miss hired Freeze twenty days after Oher signed his letter of intent. Freeze asserted that his position with Ole Miss was not an example of quid pro quo for encouraging Oher to attend the school, but rather the result of his preexisting relationship with Ole Miss offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone. The NCAA did not close its case on its suspicions of collusion. However, it ruled that Ole Miss had committed no NCAA violations in its recruitment of Oher. Freeze was found guilty of secondary violations for contacting other Memphis- area recruits before joining the Ole Miss staff. Oher started in ten games as a guard during his first season with the Ole Miss Rebels, becoming a first- team freshman All-American. After shifting to the position of left tackle for the 2006 season, he was named to various preseason All-Conference and All- American teams. Oher was named a second-team Southeastern Conference (SEC) offensive lineman after his sophomore season and a first-team SEC offensive lineman after his junior season. Oher was also successful academically at Ole Miss, and his tested IQ score increased 20 to 30 points between when he was measured in the public-school systems growing up and when he was measured in college. On January 14, 2008, Oher declared that he would be entering the 2008 NFL Draft. However, two days later, he announced his withdrawal from the draft to return to Ole Miss for his senior season. After the 2008 season, Oher was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American, made the honor roll for the second time (the first time being his sophomore year), and graduated with a degree in criminal justice in the spring of 2009.

The Baltimore Ravens drafted Oher with the 23rd pick in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft. The Ravens had acquired the pick from the New England Patriots in exchange for their first- and fifth-round draft picks. The Tuohy family was there to witness his draft day selection. Baltimore Ravens Oher with the Baltimore Ravens in 2009. On July 30, 2009, Oher signed a five-year, $13.8 million contract with the Baltimore Ravens. He started the 2009 season as right tackle, but was moved to left tackle after an injury to lineman Jared Gaither. In week eight, he returned to right tackle. Oher started every game in 2009, eleven at right tackle and five at left tackle. He played right tackle in his first post-season game, January 10, 2010, against the New England Patriots, and did not allow a single sack as the Ravens won 33‚Äì14. Oher was second in the voting for Associated Press' NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award, with six votes. Prior to the 2010 NFL season, Oher was moved to the left tackle position. During the 2011 pre- season, the Ravens announced that Oher would be moving back to the right side. On February 3, 2013, Oher won his first Super Bowl ring after the Ravens defeated the San Francisco 49ers 34‚Äì31 in Super Bowl XLVII. Tennessee Titans Oher with the Tennessee Titans, 2014 On March 14, 2014, Oher signed a four-year, $20 million contract with the Tennessee Titans. Oher started eleven games for the Titans, and was placed on injured reserve on December 13 after missing the previous two games due to a toe injury. Pro Football Focus graded Oher as the 74th best tackle out of 78 for the 2014 season. The Titans released Oher on February 5, 2015. Carolina Panthers On March 6, 2015, Oher signed a two-year, $7 million contract with the Carolina Panthers. Dave Gettleman, the Panthers GM, said that Oher would be the Panthers' starting left tackle going into the season despite his struggles in Tennessee, saying \\"We did our homework on Michael, and we feel very strongly that he can be an answer for us. He'll be inserted at left tackle, and we'll go from there.\\" Oher cited Cam Newton as an influential factor in his decision to sign with Carolina and Oher responded with one of his best seasons as a professional, protecting Newton's blind side. Oher played in 98.4% of the team's snaps, allowed a career-low four sacks‚Äîtied for eighth-fewest in the league‚Äîand was penalized only three times for 25 yards. On February 7, 2016, Oher was part of the Panthers team that played in Super Bowl 50. In the game, the Panthers fell to the Denver Broncos by a score of 24‚Äì10. On June 17, 2016, Oher signed a three-year contract extension with the Panthers worth $21.6 million with $9.5 million guaranteed. Oher was placed on injured reserve on November 25, 2016 with a concussion‚Äîhaving played in only three games during the 2016 season. On July 20, 2017, Oher was released by the Panthers after a failed physical. Books Oher is one of the subjects of Michael Lewis's 2006 book, The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game.

He was born Kurt Otto Adolf Michaelis, a doctor's son, in Berlin on August 22, 1916, and educated at the Falk Real Gymnasium. Although baptised a Lutheran, he had three Jewish grandparents, which meant that after Hitler came to power in 1933 he would not be allowed to study science - so his father sent him to London. Michaelis studied aeronautical engineering at the Imperial College of the University of London before switching to Chemistry. He went on to obtain a doctorate on \\"The Dehydrogenation of Alicyclic Compounds and Terpenic Ketones in the Liquid Phase\\", while lecturing at Sheffield University under Sir Patrick Linstead. He was interned as an 'enemy alien' in England in May 1940 and then Canada, where he formed lasting friendships with Klaus Fuchs, Max Perutz, Hermann Bondi and Tommy Gold. After he returned to Britain in December 1940, he joined the Auxiliary Fire Service whilst working as a chemist in a paint factory. After graduation, he became chief chemist at Milton Antiseptic. After World War II Michaelis worked for the British Intelligence Objectives Committee, which investigated enemy scientific developments, and in 1946 he married Ann Aikman, with whom he was to have three children. His distinguished career as a science journalist and editor spanned several activities including the ‚ÄúBIOS project‚Äù, technical writing at ‚ÄúCIBA‚Äù and ‚ÄúInternational Telecommunication Union‚Äù in Switzerland. Later he became a scientific film author in Australia, editor of the British magazine Discovery, science correspondent for The Daily Telegraph where he wrote daily reports on science and technology from 1969 to 1973. He was also the founding editor and publisher of Interdisciplinary Science Reviews. Whilst at the Daily Telegraph, in 1968, Michaelis was the first person to coin and use the term \\"Pulsar\\" to describe the discovery of Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish of the \\"Pulsating Radio star\\" in 1967. Michaelis became known as an expert on the subject of scientific cinematography.

Adams, John Whitfield Bunn (1831‚Äì1920), and various additional financiers. Twenty years later, Jacob Bunn, Jr., (1864‚Äì1926) took over and ran the company until his death in 1926. The Bunn family surname was used in their most famous railroad watch, the Illinois \\"Bunn Special\\". A new company of the same name, owned by Craig Stone, is located in Quincy, Illinois. History The history of the Illinois Watch Company contains three distinct institutional chapters: The Springfield Watch Company The corporation was established as the Springfield Watch Company by John C. Adams of Massachusetts, and John Todd Stuart, William B. Miller, Dr. George Pasfield, John Whitfield Bunn, John Williams, and George N. Black, all of Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois. John Todd Stuart served as the first President of the new corporation, which had been capitalized initially at $100,000.00. William B. Miller served as the first Secretary. The other named men constituted the original Board of Directors of the Springfield Watch Company. In 1873, the corporation established a corporate office in New York City. By the end of the year 1872, the corporation had sold approximately 10,000 watch movements. The Illinois Springfield Watch Company The Springfield Watch Company encountered severe financial difficulty during its institutional infancy. Consequently, the corporation had to undergo reorganization in 1877. In July, 1877, the corporation changed its name to the \\"Illinois Springfield Watch Company.\\" Erastus Newton Bates, the second President of the corporation, assumed the chief executive leadership of the newly reorganized concern until July, 1878. The corporation again faced severe financial crisis, and had to be reorganized. The Illinois Watch Company The Illinois Springfield Watch Company was reorganized in the fall and winter of 1878, and was renamed the \\"Illinois Watch Company\\" (the final name of the corporation). Chief executive leadership of the corporation was assumed by Jacob Bunn, Sr. (1814‚Äì1897), an Illinois industrialist, railroad financier, railroad reorganizer, wholesale grocer, commission merchant, newspaper publisher, land developer, coal operator, political advisor and financier, banker, and rope manufacturer. Jacob Bunn was the older brother of John Whitfield Bunn, and both men were among the closest friends and political allies of Illinois lawyer and statesman Abraham Lincoln, whose political career was largely financed and managed by the Bunn brothers. Jacob Bunn, Sr., oversaw the steady growth of the new corporation, and under his administration the corporate employment grew from 260 in the year 1879 to 400 in the year 1880. Jacob Bunn led corporate sales along a certain and definite trajectory of growth in both volume of manufacture and corporate revenue. In 1879, the corporation manufactured 33,285 watch movements. In 1880, the corporation manufactured 47,065 watch movements. By 1890 the concern had established corporate offices in Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco. The corporation helped pioneer the logistical technology that served the enforcement of standard time for railroads throughout the world. At its apex of profitability, the Illinois Watch Company employed approximately 1,200 people. Management Principal Corporate Governance of the Illinois Watch Company: # Jacob Bunn (1814‚Äì1897): President, reorganizer, Director, Chairman. # John Whitfield Bunn (1831‚Äì1920): Vice-President, Director. # Charles Smorowski: Secretary of the corporation. # Jacob Bunn, Jr. (1864‚Äì1926): Vice- President, President, Director, Chairman. # Henry Bunn: Vice President, President, Director, Chairman. # Benjamin Hamilton Feguson: Director, Vice- Chairman, Chairman. # Frederic W. Morgan: General Cashier, Credit Manager. # Julius Armbruster: General Salesman. The passing of Jacob Bunn, Jr. threw Illinois Watch into disarray. In 1928, for a sum in excess of $5,000,000.00, the Illinois Watch Company was purchased by the Hamilton Watch Company of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which continued to operate the factory under the Illinois name and shifted the emphasis from pocket to wrist watch production. By 1932, the Great Depression forced Hamilton to close the Illinois factory, though they retained possession of the name for many years. Ownership of trademark Craig Stone is the current owner of the trademark. Stone applied for the trademarks through the USPTO after the Swatch Group let them expire in 2004 and he was finally awarded the trademarks in 2009. It is mainly run as a repair shop today where they service vintage and modern watches; however, they currently have plans to produce the first 100% American made wristwatch in over 50 years. Wristwatches Illinois Watch Company had four basic \\"periods\\" of wrist watch production. The first period was from the 1910s to the early 1920s, during which most wrist watches were converted pocketwatch movements. Gent's military and military-style specimens were made, often featuring porcelain dials. The second period‚Äîfrom the early to mid-1920s‚Äîincluded movements and dials which were sold to be cased by individual jewelers. These were mostly small 6/0-size movements with 6:00 or 9:00 subsidiary seconds. Some were also cased at the factory using generic cases from a variety of sources. Some of the better-known models from that latter category include the Square, Canby, Square Cut Corner, Cushion, and Whippet. Also, larger 3/0-size movements were cased at the factory in this way‚Äîthe Champion, Special, Ace/Maxine, and Atlantic, for example. In the late 1920s, shortly before the Hamilton Watch Company took over, Illinois began commissioning its own unique wrist watch cases. The company cased and boxed its watches at the factory, marking the beginning of what many collectors consider the company's golden era, during which the finest watches were made. Models include the Picadilly, Major, Marquis, Chieftain, Ritz, New Yorker and Manhattan (the New Yorker came with a leather strap, the Manhattan with a metal one), Jolly Roger, Viking, Wembley/Medalist, Speedway, Guardsman, Trophy/Westchester, the Beau series (Beau Monde, Beau Geste, Beau Brummel, and Beau Royale), the Mate, and the top of the line 14-karat solid gold Consul. Many collectors consider The Consul to be the finest American wrist watch ever made‚Äîexamples with original silver pinstripe dials, starburst dials, and with a small second hand are especially desired. Some of these art deco models also came in 2-tone gold (white gold sections along with yellow or green gold) which are also very desired and rare. The fourth period began in the early 1930s, and is characterized by the Streamline Moderne influence on the styling of the cases. Many of these watches featured a new 207 movement, 12/0-size with 17 jewels (of which only 40,000 were made) and included such sleek designs as the Futura, Chesterfield, Wentworth, Andover, and the 14kt Rockliffe. Many of these are very similar to watches made at the time by the Hamilton Watch Company. Some Illinois 12/0-size 207 movements were finished with the Hamilton name and used in the 401 series of Hamilton wrist watches, which premiered in 1934 and were named after famous explorers including Stanley, Livingstone, Byrd, and others. Many Illinois collectors also collect these pieces since they contain movements derived from Illinois-made movements. Some think that the Hamilton Watch Company purchased the Illinois Watch Company merely to expedite the production of a rectangular-shaped movement, but this is uncertain. In the 1950s, Hamilton offered a line of Illinois and Hamilton-Illinois wrist watches with Swiss movements. These have absolutely nothing in common with the \\"originals\\" except the name. They are not considered collectible by die-hard Illinois collectors. Caution should be exercised when buying Hamilton-Illinois off auction sites as many sellers mis- represent these 1950s models as examples of 1930s Illinois produced by Hamilton.

Weinbaum and Helen Weinbaum that first appeared in the December 1938 issue of Thrilling Wonder Stories and was reprinted in the collection Interplanetary Odysseys (2006). Sam Moskowitz stated that Stanley G. Weinbaum completed only a page and a half of the story before his death and that his sister Helen Weinbaum completed the story on her own.In the introduction to A Martian Odyssey and Other Science Fiction Tales, introduction by Sam Moskowitz, Hyperion, 1974, . \\"Tidal Moon\\" is the only story by Weinbaum to take place on Ganymede. Weinbaum's Ganymede In Weinbaum's Solar System, Jupiter radiates enough heat to create Earthlike environments on the Galilean moons. Ganymede, the third Galilean satellite, has a subarctic climate, large bodies of water, and a six-month rotation period. Due to Jupiter's tidal pull, every spot on Ganymede's surface is inundated with water every three months except a small area of the south pole where the human settlement of Hydropole is located. The Ganymedian natives, the Nympus, grow a mosslike plant called cree which is ordinarily red, but which turns blue when exposed to the ammonia in Ganymede's atmosphere. The blue moss is collected by human traders in the employ of Cree, Inc. who travel among the native villages on an aquatic riding animal called a hipp (short for Hippocampus catamiti); it is then shipped to Earth to produce crephine, a combined anaesthetic and medicine. Other Ganymedian life-forms include the whale-like Gamma Rorqual, the tentacled land leet, and the four- winged Blanket Bat. Plot summary Ben Amherst is a cree collector on Ganymede in the year 2083. Although he normally operates alone, he finds himself accompanied on one of his rounds by a tourist from Earth named Kirt Scaler. Scaler plans to travel with Amherst to the village of Aquia, then remain there for two months while Amherst continues on his rounds. Amherst finds Scaler strangely knowledgeable about conditions on Ganymede for someone who claims never to have left Earth before. Reaching Aquia, Amherst and Scaler find that its chief trader, Carl Kent, has gone missing; his teenage daughter Carol is carrying on in his place. Kent's disappearance is ominous since he has only recently worked out a process for distilling crephine from red moss. While Aquia is drowned in the flood, Scaler spends most of his time with Carol Kent. A day and a half before the tide is due to ebb away from Aquia, Carol Kent discovers that her father's notes on his red moss distillation process are missing. Amherst remembers a rumour he heard that red moss has been discovered on Io; Scaler, he realizes, must be working for Ionian Products, a company seeking to break Cree, Inc.'s crephine monopoly. If they succeed, it will mean hard times for everyone on Ganymede. Aquia is searched for Scaler, to no avail. Suddenly one of the valves leading to the surface opens; Scaler is using it to escape Aquia with Carl Kent's notes. Amherst sends Kent to get him a vacuum suit; when she returns with it, she is wearing one herself. He tells her to remain in the settlement, but she ignores his order and follows him up the aqueduct. On the still-half-flooded surface of Ganymede, there is no sign of Scaler, but Amherst and Kent see a rocket ship in the sky, coloured Ionian red. As the rocket nears the muddy ground, it lowers a ladder, then disappears behind a hill. When it reappears, a man is clinging to the ladder. It is Scaler, and Carl Kent's process is on its way to Io. As they return to Aquia, Carol Kent tells Amherst about her father's process, which involves exposing red moss to ammonia and treating it with an extract from the eggs of Ganymedian gall-ants. Amherst is overjoyed: Ionian Products might have the process, but they don't have the gall-ants, and gall-ants can only breed on Ganymede. Carl Kent's notes will be worthless to the Ionians.

The rules were originally written at Rogers Island in the Hudson River near Fort Edward. They were intended to serve as a manual on guerrilla warfare for Rogers' Ranger company, a 600 strong contingent whose members were personally selected by Rogers. The rules were the result of Rogers' blend of Native American tactics and his own innovative combat techniques, ideas that were considered revolutionary by military standards of the time. Combined with intensive training and live fire exercises, these rules created a mobile, well trained force that was capable of living off the land around it in order to sustain itself for long periods of time. Ranger commander Lt. Colonel William Darby read the rules to the 1st Ranger Battalion prior to action during World War II, and a modified version of the rules is followed by the 75th Ranger Regiment to this day, and they are considered as the model and \\"standing orders\\" for all Ranger activities. Original rules The original Plan of Discipline, extracted from Major Rogers's journal and intended for his Rogers' Rangers in 1759, follow: #All Rangers are to be subject to the rules and articles of war; to appear at roll-call every evening, on their own parade, equipped, each with a Firelock, sixty rounds of powder and ball, and a hatchet, at which time an officer from each company is to inspect the same, to see they are in order, so as to be ready on any emergency to march at a minute's warning; and before they are dismissed, the necessary guards are to be draughted, and scouts for the next day appointed. #Whenever you are ordered out to the enemies forts or frontiers for discoveries, if your number be small, march in a single file, keeping at such a distance from each other as to prevent one shot from killing two men, sending one man, or more, forward, and the like on each side, at the distance of twenty yards from the main body, if the ground you march over will admit of it, to give the signal to the officer of the approach of an enemy, and of their number, #If you march over marshes or soft ground, change your position, and march abreast of each other to prevent the enemy from tracking you (as they would do if you marched in a single file) till you get over such ground, and then resume your former order, and march till it is quite dark before you encamp, which do, if possible, on a piece of ground which that may afford your sentries the advantage of seeing or hearing the enemy some considerable distance, keeping one half of your whole party awake alternately through the night. #Some time before you come to the place you would reconnoitre, make a stand, and send one or two men in whom you can confide, to look out the best ground for making your observations. #If you have the good fortune to take any prisoners, keep them separate, till they are examined, and in your return take a different route from that in which you went out, that you may the better discover any party in your rear, and have an opportunity, if their strength be superior to yours, to alter your course, or disperse, as circumstances may require. #If you march in a large body of three or four hundred, with a design to attack the enemy, divide your party into three columns, each headed by a proper officer, and let those columns march in single files, the columns to the right and left keeping at twenty yards distance or more from that of the center, if the ground will admit, and let proper guards be kept in the front and rear, and suitable flanking parties at a due distance as before directed, with orders to halt on all eminences, to take a view of the surrounding ground, to prevent your being ambuscaded, and to notify the approach or retreat of the enemy, that proper dispositions may be made for attacking, defending, And if the enemy approach in your front on level ground, form a front of your three columns or main body with the advanced guard, keeping out your flanking parties, as if you were marching under the command of trusty officers, to prevent the enemy from pressing hard on either of your wings, or surrounding you, which is the usual method of the savages, if their number will admit of it, and be careful likewise to support and strengthen your rear- guard. #If you are obliged to receive the enemy's fire, fall, or squat down, till it is over; then rise and discharge at them. If their main body is equal to yours, extend yourselves occasionally; but if superior, be careful to support and strengthen your flanking parties, to make them equal to theirs, that if possible you may repulse them to their main body, in which case push upon them with the greatest resolution with equal force in each flank and in the center, observing to keep at a due distance from each other, and advance from tree to tree, with one half of the party before the other ten or twelve yards. If the enemy push upon you, let your front fire and fall down, and then let your rear advance thro' them and do the like, by which time those who before were in front will be ready to discharge again, and repeat the same alternately, as occasion shall require; by this means you will keep up such a constant fire, that the enemy will not be able easily to break your order, or gain your ground. #If you oblige the enemy to retreat, be careful, in your pursuit of them, to keep out your flanking parties, and prevent them from gaining eminences, or rising grounds, in which case they would perhaps be able to rally and repulse you in their turn. #If you are obliged to retreat, let the front of your whole party fire and fall back, till the rear hath done the same, making for the best ground you can; by this means you will oblige the enemy to pursue you, if they do it at all, in the face of a constant fire. #If the enemy is so superior that you are in danger of being surrounded by them, let the whole body disperse, and every one take a different road to the place of rendezvous appointed for that evening, which must every morning be altered and fixed for the evening ensuing, in order to bring the whole party, or as many of them as possible, together, after any separation that may happen in the day; but if you should happen to be actually surrounded, form yourselves into a square, or if in the woods, a circle is best, and, if possible, make a stand till the darkness of the night favours your escape. #If your rear is attacked, the main body and flankers must face about to the right or left, as occasion shall require, and form themselves to oppose the enemy, as before directed; and the same method must be observed, if attacked in either of your flanks, by which means you will always make a rear of one of your flank- guards. #If you determine to rally after a retreat, in order to make a fresh stand against the enemy, by all means endeavour to do it on the most rising ground you come at, which will give you greatly the advantage in point of situation, and enable you to repulse superior numbers. #In general, when pushed upon by the enemy, reserve your fire till they approach very near, which will then put them into the greatest surprise and consternation, and give you an opportunity of rushing upon them with your hatchets and cutlasses to the better advantage. #When you encamp at night, fix your sentries in such a manner as not to be relieved from the main body till morning, profound secrecy and silence being often of the last importance in these cases. Each sentry therefore should consist of six men, two of whom must be constantly alert, and when relieved by their fellows, it should be done without noise; and in case those on duty see or hear any thing, which alarms them, they are not to speak, but one of them is silently to retreat, and acquaint the commanding officer thereof, that proper dispositions may be made; and all occasional sentries should be fixed in like manner. #At the first dawn of day, awake your whole detachment; that being the time when the savages choose to fall upon their enemies, you should by all means be in readiness to receive them. #If the enemy should be discovered by your detachments in the morning, and their numbers are superior to yours, and a victory doubtful, you should not attack them till the evening, as then they will not know your numbers, and if you are repulsed, your retreat will be favoured by the darkness of the night. #Before you leave your encampment, send out small parties to scout round it, to see if there be any appearance or track of an enemy that might have been near you during the night. #When you stop for refreshment, choose some spring or rivulet if you can, and dispose your party so as not to be surprised, posting proper guards and sentries at a due distance, and let a small party waylay the path you came in, lest the enemy should be pursuing. #If, in your return, you have to cross rivers, avoid the usual fords as much as possible, lest the enemy should have discovered, and be there expecting you. #If you have to pass by lakes, keep at some distance from the edge of the water, lest, in case of an ambuscade or an attack from the enemy, when in that situation, your retreat should be cut off. #If the enemy pursue your rear, take a circle till you come to your own tracks, and there form an ambush to receive them, and give them the first fire. #When you return from a scout, and come near our forts, avoid the usual roads, and avenues thereto, lest the enemy should have headed you, and lay in ambush to receive you, when almost exhausted with fatigues. #When you pursue any party that has been near our forts or encampments, follow not directly in their tracks, lest they should be discovered by their rear guards, who, at such a time, would be most alert; but endeavour, by a different route, to head and meet them in some narrow pass, or lay in ambush to receive them when and where they least expect it. #If you are to embark in canoes, battoes, or otherwise, by water, choose the evening for the time of your embarkation, as you will then have the whole night before you, to pass undiscovered by any parties of the enemy, on hills, or other places, which command a prospect of the lake or river you are upon. #In paddling or rowing, give orders that the boat or canoe next the sternmost, wait for her, and the third for the second, and the fourth for the third, and so on, to prevent separation, and that you may be ready to assist each other on any emergency. #Appoint one man in each boat to look out for fires, on the adjacent shores, from the numbers and size of which you may form some judgment of the number that kindled them, and whether you are able to attack them or not. #If you find the enemy encamped near the banks of a river or lake, which you imagine they will attempt to cross for their security upon being attacked, leave a detachment of your party on the opposite shore to receive them, while, with the remainder, you surprise them, having them between you and the lake or river. #If you cannot satisfy yourself as to the enemy's number and strength, from their fire, conceal your boats at some distance, and ascertain their number by a reconnoitering party, when they embark, or march, in the morning, marking the course they steer, when you may pursue, ambush, and attack them, or let them pass, as prudence shall direct you. In general, however, that you may not be discovered by the enemy upon the lakes and rivers at a great distance, it is safest to lay by, with your boats and party concealed all day, without noise or shew; and to pursue your intended route by night; and whether you go by land or water, give out parole and countersigns, in order to know one another in the dark, and likewise appoint a station every man to repair to, in case of any accident that may separate you. The version immediately above is the one used by the 75th Ranger Regiment and has been provided to US soldiers attending Ranger School from the 1950s to present day.

The NAP argued that since there was no emergency nor necessary urgency (under Article 218(2)), the government could not issue any emergency decrees. Article 219, however, specifically notes the constitutionality of an emergency decree can be questioned only on Article 218(1) concerning the maintenance of national or public safety, national economic security, or to avert public calamity. The government, fearing further economic damage if the decree were delayed, opposed the Court's acceptance of the complaint, as the opposition clearly had failed to cite the proper constitutional clause. The Court wished to set a precedent, however, demonstrating it would accept petitions under Article 219, even if technically inaccurate. Within a day it ruled that it was obvious to the general public that the nation was in an economic crisis, and that the decrees were designed to assist with national economic security in accordance with Article 218(1). The decrees were later quickly approved by Parliament. The NAP's last minute motion damaged its credibility, and made it unlikely that Article 219 will be invoked unless there is a credible issue and the issue is raised and discussed at the beginning of Parliamentary debate, rather than at the last-minute before a vote. On the other hand, a precedent was established by the Court that it would accept all petitions under Article 219 to preserve Parliament's right to question the constitutionality of emergency executive decrees.  Thaksin Shinawatra and the allegation of hiding assets and stocks  After the sounding victory of Thaksin Shinawatra's party, Thai Rak Thai, in 2001 election, the Anti-Corruption Committee filed a case charging him as hiding a handful of assets in form of stocks, which is unlawful due to the 1997 Constitution. According to Thai law, senior government officials are required to declare their assets, along with those of their spouses and children under the age of 20, to the NCCC when they start and finish their terms in office. However Thaksin could escape the guilty as the judges ruled 8 to 7. Thaksin said it was his 'honest mistake'. Treaty status of IMF letters of intent The NAP later filed impeachment proceedings with the National Counter Corruption Commission (NCCC) against Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and the Minister of Finance Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda for violation of the Constitution. The NAP argued that the letter of intent that the government signed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to secure emergency financial support was a treaty, and that Article 224 of the Constitution stipulated that the government must receive prior consent from Parliament to enter a treaty. The NCCC determined the issue concerned a constitutional interpretation and petitioned the Constitutional Court for an opinion. The Court ruled the IMF letters were not treaties, as internationally defined, because they were unilateral documents from the Thai government with no rules for enforcement or provisions for penalty. Moreover, the IMF itself had worded the letters in a way that stated that the letters were not contractual agreements. Appointment of Jaruvan Maintaka as Auditor-General On 24 June 2003, a petition was filed with the Constitutional Court seeking its ruling on the constitutionality of Jaruvan Maintaka's appointment by the Senate as Auditor- General. Jaruvan was one of three nominees for the position of auditor-general in 2001, along with Prathan Dabpet and Nontaphon Nimsomboon. Prathan received 5 votes from the 8-person State Audit Commission (SAC) chairman while Jaruvan received 3 votes. According to the constitution, State Audit Commission chairman Panya Tantiyavarong should have submitted Prathan's nomination to the Senate, as he received the majority of votes. However, on July 3, 2001, the SAC Chairman submitted a list of all three candidates for the post of auditor- general to the Senate, which later voted to select Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka. The Constitutional Court ruled on 6 July 2004 that the selection process that led to the appointment of Jaruvan as Auditor-General was unconstitutional. The Court noted that the Constitution empowers the SAC to nominate only one person with the highest number of votes from a simple majority, not three as had been the case. The court stopped short of saying if she had to leave her post.Chronology of events in the auditor-general‚Äôs deadlock, The Nation August 30, 2005 However, when the Constitutional Court had ruled on 4 July 2002 that the then Election Commission chairman Sirin Thoopklam's election to the body was unconstitutional, the President of the Court noted \\"When the court rules that the selection [process] was unconstitutional and has to be redone, the court requires the incumbent to leave the post\\".The Nation, \\"Jaruvan again in eye of the storm\\" , 2 June 2006 However, Jaruwan refused to resign without a royal dismissal from King Bhumibol Adulyadej. She noted \\"\\"I came to take the position as commanded by a royal decision, so I will leave the post only when directed by such a decision.\\"Jaruvan waits for royal word, Nation September 09, 2005 The State Audit Commission later nominated Wisut Montriwat, former deputy permanent secretary of the Ministry of Finance, for the post of Auditor-General. The Senate approved the nomination on 10 May 2005. However, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in an unprecedented move, withheld his royal assent. The National Assembly did not hold a vote to overthrow the royal veto. In October 2005 the Senate rejected a motion to reaffirm her appointment, and instead deferred the decision to the SAC.Senate steers clear of motion on Jaruvan, The Nation, 11 October, 2005 On 15 February 2006 The State Audit Commission (SAC) decided to reinstate Auditor-General Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka. Its unanimous decision came after it received a memo from the Office of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's Principal Private Secretary, advising that the situation be resolved.Poll booths 'the decider', Bangkok Post Friday May 05, 2006 The controversy led many to reinterpret the political and judicial role of the King in Thailand's constitutional monarchy. Thaksin Shinawatra's alleged conflicts of interest In February 2006, 28 Senators submitted a petition to the Constitutional Court calling for the Prime Minister's impeachment for conflicts of interest and improprieties in the sell-off of Shin Corporation under Articles 96, 216 and 209 of the Thai constitution.Xinhua, Students submit voters petition to impeach Thai PM, 29 July 2006 The Senators said the Prime Minister violated the Constitution and was no longer qualified for office under Article 209. However, the Court rejected the petition on 16 February, with the majority judges saying the petition failed to present sufficient grounds to support the prime minister's alleged misconduct.

It is mostly used for ice hockey and is the home arena of Storhamar Hockey. It has also been used for short track speed skating, figure skating, handball, events and concerts. The venue has a capacity for 7,000 spectators and was built for the 1994 Winter Olympics, where it was used for short track speed skating and figure skating. Other major events held at the arena include the 1999 IIHF World Championship in ice hockey, the 1999 World Women's Handball Championship, the 2012 IPC Ice Sledge Hockey World Championships and the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics. Construction of CC Amfi started in August 1991 and it was inaugurated on 25 November 1992, with construction costing 83 million Norwegian krone (NOK). The venues are owned by Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, a subsidiary of Hamar Municipality. History June 2011 exterior view of Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre The Olympic venue In the unsuccessful Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics, ice hockey events were proposed played in Hamar and Gj√∏vik. However, in the Lillehammer bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics, all ice events were moved to Lillehammer proper, after recommendations from the International Ice Hockey Federation, who wanted all the ice hockey events to take place in the same town. This would involve building two temporary ice rinks at Stampesletta in Lillehammer, and after the Olympics moving them to Gj√∏vik and either Moelv, Brumunddal or Kongsvinger. By 1989, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to include short-track speed skating, increasing the number of ice halls from two to three. In April, the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) therefore proposed building permanent ice rinks in Hamar and Gj√∏vik. The IOC also required that the long-track speed skating be done indoors. Hamar was awarded the venue, Vikingskipet, after Hamar Municipality guaranteed to cover all costs exceeding NOK 200 million. This provided sufficient leverage for Hamar to host additional events. LOOC approved the construction of Vikingskipet in on 15 December 1989 and at the same time supported proposals to renovate Storhamar Ishall to host Olympic ice hockey matches. A second, temporary training rink was also planned built in Hamar. In addition, the Hamar venue would be used for short track speed skating, while figure skating would be run in Lillehammer. In March, the plans were changed, so Hamar would receive an all-new ice rink in addition to a renovation of Storhamar Ishall. Financing of the venue was officially granted by the Parliament of Norway in April 1990.LOOC (III): 57 The International Skating Union wanted to locate all skating in Hamar, and in October 1990, LOOC confirmed that they would reallocate the events so that all the all skating events would take place in Hamar, and that a separate Olympic Village would be built in Hamar for skaters. The original plans for the Olympic Amphitheatre called for a capacity for 4,500 and construction to cost NOK 65\\\\. By June 1991, LOOC decided to increase the size of the venue, as IOC would only allow the venue host figure skating if its spectator capacity was raised to 6,000. Financing of the expansion was granted in August, with the cost rising to NOK 83.3 million. Early plans called for the venue to be built in concrete, but a research project coordinated by the Norwegian Institute of Technology made it possible to cover the venue's exterior and interior in wood panel. This solution was hailed as aesthetical by architects, and as a technical innovation by the Norwegian construction industry. The contract to build the venue was awarded to Martin M. Bakken, a local contractor, and construction started in August 1991. The laminated wood beams for the roof were delivered by Moelven Industrier. Ice was laid on the on 12 November 1992 and the arena was officially completed on 1 December. The opening show took place already on 25 November and the first official match, between Storhamar and Stjernen, took place on 8 December. The venue was the 26th indoor ice hockey arena in Norway. After the Olympic arena was built, Storhamar Ishall was renovated, and the spectator capacity reduced through the construction of storage facilities and VIP areas. The Olympic Amphitheatre later installed Norway's first media cube in 2004. The arena was formerly known as Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre ( or ) until October 2015, when CC bought the naming rights for the arena. A new media cube was also installed as part of the deal. Storhamar Ishall Adjacent to the Olympic venue lays Storhamar Ishall. Solely used for ice hockey, it opened in 1981 and has a capacity for 1,200. Since the opening of the Olympic venue, Storhamar Ishall has been used for training, and the two rinks share common dressing rooms and other facilities. The sport of ice hockey was taken up by Storhamar IL after the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo spurred the public interest in the sport. The pitch used by the club for summer sports was iced for the winter and surrounded with tall wooden boards. As the club established an ice hockey section in 1955 it received funding from the Norwegian Ice Hockey Federation to purchase tall boards. The pitch was renovated for NOK 4,000 in 1957, financed through a municipal grant. Among the upgrades was insulation of the club house, which was a barracks stemming from the Second World War. A contractor who had a storage facility close by, kept receiving visits from juveniles who jumped the fence and took material for the work. He eventually visited the club house and supplied them with a key to the facility, somewhat involuntarily becoming the club's first sponsor.Gjerd√•ker (1998): 221 Storhamar traditionally played ice hockey on natural ice. In 1977, the club was promoted to the First Division, where the regulations required that the team play on artificial ice. To avoid having to play all their games on the road, the municipality agreed to finance an outdoor artificial rink at Storhamar. With the increased attendance and interest for hockey following the town's team playing in the top league, Storhamar started planning an indoor venue.Gjerd√•ker (1998): 224 State grants and a municipal guarantee were secured in 1980, with construction starting in the fall. The arena was built around the existing artificial rink. Because the hall could not be completed in time for the 1980‚Äì81 season, Storhamar was permitted to play the season in the Second Division. Storhamar Ishall became the 11th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway when it opened in August 1981. The venue was to be partially financed through renting it out during the summer, including to an annual town fair. These ideas fell through and the municipality was forced to take over the venue. Facilities The twin areas are located at Storhamar, a residential area west of the town center of Hamar. Similar to Vikingskipet, the venue has two official names, Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre and Nordlyshallen. The former cannot be used commercially by non-Olympic events, such as in merchandise. The venue is owned by the municipally owned entity called Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, which also owns and operates Vikingskipet. The operating deficits are covered by a post-Olympic capital fund, which in the case of the two Hamar venues was NOK 60 million. Only the interest of these funds is used to operate the facilities, unlike Lillehammer and Gj√∏vik which also derive fundings from their base capital. Owing to the fund, Hamar Municipality does not need to give municipal grants to operate the facilities. Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre is oval and has wood as the main construction material, both for the interior and the exterior.Hals (1999): 28 Overall it is long, wide and tall.LOOC (III): 59 Architect Ola Mow√® of HRTB chose the shape to connect various spatial designs and types of buildings in the neighborhood. The dark color was chosen to counteract the otherwise lively array of colors in the surroundings. The roof was built using laminated wood lattice girders. The longest beam span is . The exterior walls are clad with boards, panels and decorative molding. The interior wall are covered with pine panel. The surface area of the building is , of which is on the ground floor. When used for ice hockey, the venue has an official spectator capacity for 7,000. When used for handball the capacity is 6,480. Storhamar Ishall has standing-only capacity for 1,500 spectators. During the Olympics, the main hall had 330 VIP seats, 60 seats for commentators and 200 press seats. The main rink had a new media cube installed in 2016. Storhamar Dragons playing Frisk Tigers during the 2007‚Äì08 Norwegian Play-Off Finals Events Nancy Kerrigan during the 1994 Winter Olympics Olympics During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre was used for figure skating and short track speed skating. It hosted 13 events, drawing an average of 5,554 spectators.Eriksen and Greve (1995): 8 Storhamar Ishall was used for warming up and training to these events.Eriksen and Greve (1995): 37 Short track speed skating was dominated by South Korea, who won four of the six events. Chae Ji-Hoon won the men's 500 meters and Kim Ki-Hoon the 1000 meters, while the men's 5000 meter relay was won by Italy. Cathy Turner defended her 1992 gold on the 500 meters, while Chun Lee-Kyung won the women's 1000 meters and South Korea won the 3000 meter relay. At 13, Kim Yoon-Mi became the world's youngest Olympic gold medalist. In figure skating, relaxation of the amateurism rules led to several former stars returning. The ladies' singles has resulted in the as-yet highest United States Winter Olympic television viewership, thanks to Tonya Harding's ex- husband Jeff Gillooly hiring Shane Stant to club fellow female figure skater Nancy Kerrigan in the knee. The ladies' singles was won by Ukraine's Oksana Baiul,LOOC (IV): 148 while the men's singles was won by Russia's Alexei Urmanov,LOOC (IV): 147 the ice dancing was won by Russians Oksana Grishuk and Evgeny Platov and the pair skating was won by Russians Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov.LOOC (IV): 145 Ice hockey The Olympic Amphitheatre is the home venue of Storhamar Hockey, formerly known as the Storhamar Dragons, the ice hockey division of Storhamar IL. The clubs' youth groups train in Storhamar Ishall, which is also used by the club's bandy group. The Dragons have played continuously in the Elite League since the 1982‚Äì83 season. Their highest average league attendance was in the 1994‚Äì95 season, when they drew 3,731 spectators. While playing in Storhamar Ishall, the highest average attendance was in the 1984‚Äì85 season, with 2,097 spectators. From the 1991‚Äì92 to the following season, when the Olympic venue opened, the Dragons' average attendance doubled, from 1,412 to 2,875. The Dragons' best attendance is 7,405, set during game seven of the 2004‚Äì05 Playoffs, where the Dragons beat V√•lerenga in overtime. Alexei Urmanov during the 1994 Winter Olympics After the opening of Storhamar Ishall, it was used for two Norway men's national ice hockey team matches. On 2 January 1982, Norway lost 3‚Äì5 against Romania; and on 13 September 1983, Norway beat Italy 4‚Äì2. The venue hosted, along with Lillehammer, Group A of the 1992 IIHF European U18 Championship. Norway's senior inaugural international match at the Olympic arena saw Norway lose 4‚Äì6 against Canada on 9 February 1993. The 1999 IIHF World Championship in ice hockey was hosted at Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, H√•kons Hall in Lillehammer and Jordal Amfi in Oslo. Fourteen group-stage matches were held in Hamar. The longest game On 12 March 2017 Storhamar hosted the Sparta Warriors in game five of the quarter finals in the Elite league. The game lasted for 217 minutes and 14 seconds in what is believed to be the longest hockey game in history.https://www.nhl.com/news/incredible-hockey-game-in-norway- goes-8-overtimes/c-287656214 Joakim Jensen scored the game-winning goal as Storhamar won 2-1 after nearly 11 periods of play. In fiction In the film, I, Tonya, the scenes which take place in CC Amfi have not been shot in Hamar, but in the Macon Coliseum in Georgia. Other events Storhamar Ishall is the regular training venue for Storhamar IL's figure skating group. Between them, the two venues have hosted the Norwegian Figure Skating Championships three times: Storhamar Ishall in 1983, and the Olympic Amphitheatre in 2005 and 2011. In October 1993, the Olympic Amphitheatre hosted Piruetten 1993, a pre-Olympic figure skating event. Although featuring stars such as Nancy Kerrigan, it only attracted 150 spectators. The venue has hosted the ISU Junior Grand Prix in 1999‚Äì2000 and 2000‚Äì01 and the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in 2002. Storhamar Ishall hosted Norway's first international short track speed skating event in November 1991. The 1995 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships were scheduled to take place at the arena, but were moved to Gj√∏vik Olympic Cavern Hall because the Hamar venue would be used by Storhamar Dragons for the play-offs. The Olympic Amphitheatre has hosted matches of the Norway men's national handball team, with the first tournament being played in January 1993. It has also been used for Norway women's national handball team matches. The venue was one of seven venues used for the 1999 World Women's Handball Championship. Between 2 and 9 December, it hosted nine group-stage matches and three of the quarter-finals. The venue was also the site of two matches during M√∏belringen Cup 2006. In September 2007, the Olympic arena hosted F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale's world championship in dog agility. The 2012 IPC Ice Sledge Hockey World Championships took place at the Olympic Amphitheatre. Lillehammer hosted the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, with Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre being the venue for the figure skating events. Since 2001, Hamar Olympic Amphitreatre has hosted the annual Idrettsgallaen, a television show that honors the past year's Norwegian sports and athlete achievements. Hamar was selected to host the event because its main sponsor, the national lottery company Norsk Tipping, has its head office in Hamar. Idrettsgallaen is held in early January, when many of winter sports athletes are home and the summer athletes are off season. In 2010, Idrettsgallaen was hosted in Lillehammer because the weekend clashed with the 2010 European Speed Skating Championships in Vikingskipet and Hamar lacks sufficient hotel capacity to host both simultaneously. Concerts hosted at the arena since the opening concert with Fats Domino on 25 November 1992 include Little Richard in 1993, Vamp in 2005, Willie Nelson in 2008 and Jos√© Carreras in 2010.

While company legend attributes the invention of the sauce to McIlhenny, plantation owner Maunsel White is believed to have been the first to cultivate and make a sauce from Tabasco peppers in the United States, and gave the recipe and pepper pods to his friend McIlhenny.Mark Robichaux, ‚ÄúIngredients of a Family Fortune‚Äù, Oct. 10, 2007 in Wall Street Journal.

Biography Born in Hagerstown, Maryland, in 1815, Edmund McIlhenny moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, around 1840, finding work in the Louisiana banking industry. He was of Irish and Scottish descent, his great grandparents immigrated to America from County Donegal. By the eve of the American Civil War, he had acquired a small fortune and became an independent bank owner.Dictionary of Louisiana Biography (Lafayette, La.: Center for Louisiana Studies, University of Southwestern Louisiana/Louisiana Historical Association, 1998), s.v., McIlhenny, Edmund. On June 30, 1859, he married Mary Eliza Avery. They had eight children. During the Civil War, McIlhenny fled with his in-laws, the Avery family, to Texas, where he served as a civilian employee of the Confederate army, first as a clerk in a commissary office, then as a financial agent for the paymaster. The South's economic collapse after its defeat ruined McIlhenny, who now lived with his in-laws in their plantation house on Avery Island, Louisiana. It was there that McIlhenny tended the family garden, where, according to tradition, he grew a variety of fruits and vegetables. Tabasco sauce McIlhenny was given tabasco peppers and a recipe for tabasco sauce by a friend, plantation owner Maunsel White, who died in 1863 ‚Äì though company legend says McIlhenny himself invented the sauce between 1866 and 1868. In 1868, he grew his first commercial pepper crop, selling the first bottles of his product the following year, which he called Tabasco brand pepper sauce. In 1870 McIlhenny obtained letters patent for the sauce, which he packaged in cork-top two-ounce bottles with diamond logo labels very similar in appearance to those in present-day use. At first McIlhenny sold the product mainly along the Gulf Coast in places including New Orleans, New Iberia, Louisiana, and Galveston, Texas. By the early 1870s, however, he had broken into larger markets, such as New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston, helped by major nineteenth century food manufacturer and distributor E. C. Hazard and Company.Shane K. Bernard, \\"Tabasco: Edmund McIlhenny and the Birth of a Louisiana Pepper Sauce,\\" Louisiana Cultural Vistas (Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities publication), Fall 2005. Death and legacy McIlhenny died in 1890, and apparently did not consider his production of Tabasco sauce to have been a particularly notable accomplishment. Indeed, he made no mention of Tabasco sauce in an autobiographical sketch composed toward the end of his life, nor was it mentioned in his obituaries.\\"TABASCO's Hot History,\\" Morning Edition, National Public Radio (NPR), 29 November 2002. Regardless, his successors, sons John Avery McIlhenny and Edward Avery McIlhenny, realized that their father had created a foundation on which they could build a larger family business, and they shortly expanded and modernized the manufacturing process. Today each carton of Tabasco sauce bears a facsimile of McIlhenny's signature.

The company is most notable for successfully suing the U.S. government for improperly seizing its assets while under bankruptcy protection. AT&T; announced its acquisition of NextWave in 2012.  History  The company original spun out of QUALCOMM in 1995 and began life as the biggest bidder in the FCC C-Block. NextWave originally won the licenses in an auction intended for small businesses with limited resources in 1996. NextWave, which bid $4.7 billion for the licenses, made the minimum 10 percent down payment of $500 million for the spectrum. But shortly thereafter NextWave filed for bankruptcy protection and defaulted on its payments for the licenses. The FCC, in turn, confiscated the licenses and re-sold them to Verizon Wireless and the subsidiaries of AT&T; Wireless and Cingular Wireless, among others, for $17 billion in an auction that ended in January 2001. Ultimately NextWave prevailed in the Supreme Court, 8-1, and was permitted to keep the PCS licenses. NextWave's bankruptcy protection lasted approximately ten years, during which time the asset value of the licenses had dramatically increased and NextWave was able to repay the original debt and sell their spectrum assets to Verizon Wireless, Cingular (now AT&T;) and MetroPCS. They re-emerged as NextWave Wireless with $550M in capital. The reborn company had several areas of focus: development of a 4G broadband network through its Network Solutions Group in Las Vegas, NV, development of WiMAX baseband and RF integrated circuits and related technology in its Advanced Technology Group in San Diego, CA, and accumulation of spectrum and other carrier assets both in the U.S. and internationally. NextWave made several significant acquisitions that shaped its business and technology strategy. PacketVideo was acquired in 2005, as was a majority share in Cygnus Multimedia (a start up firm focusing on WiMax). In 2007 NextWave completed the acquisition of GoNetworks (a startup developing beamforming WiFi equipment) and IP Wireless (a UK firm that developed TD-CDMA equipment) for $100M. The IP Wireless business failed to produce expected revenue and in late 2008 it was sold back to its management team for $1M. Due to financial difficulties, NextWave was forced to shut down the GoNetworks subsidiary and the Network Solutions Group in 2008, followed by the 3-year-old Advanced Technology Group and the cessation of WiMax development in 2009. Business Week reported on August 2, 2012 that AT&T; agreed to acquire NextWave with its debt for a price of up to $600 million. AT&T; wishes to use NextWave's spectrum to bolster its own. The acquisition closed on January 24, 2013.

At the time it was built, it was the largest hydro-electric power station in the United Kingdom. It is Britain's oldest power station, and is believed to be one of the oldest Grid- connected hydro-electric stations in the world.  History  The station was built in 1905 by the Porthmadog, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway company, backed by North Wales Power and Traction Co Ltd to supply electricity to its own electric railway and connected slate quarries and mines. The railway was planned to run through the same valley as the power station and be fed with an electrical feeder, but ran short of funds and the attempt was abandoned. In August 1906, power from Cwm Dyli was used to power the Oakeley Quarry in Blaenau Ffestiniog carried over the Crimea Pass by a long overhead transmission line at 10,000 volts. Cwm Dyli was claimed to be the largest electricity generating plant of its kind in Great Britain at the time. Electricity produced here was also used to power the Long Wave Wireless Telegraph transmitting station built by Marconi in 1912 near Waunfawr. Supplying power directly to the National Grid, it is Britain's oldest power station, and is believed to be one of the oldest Grid-connected hydro-electric stations in the world. It was first commissioned in 1906 and has been in fairly continuous operation since then, although it was closed for upgrading in 1990. A single turbine now produces up to 9.8 megawatts. Known locally as the \\"Chapel in the valley\\", on account of its exterior design, it employed 13 men. Today, however, it is controlled remotely from Dolgarrog in the Conwy valley. Water for the site primarily comes from Llyn Llydaw, some 320 metres above the power station, where rainfall is very high. The water is carried from the lake through a long pipeline. The pipeline featured in the James Bond film The World Is Not Enough.

He publishes and writes for the nation's largest newspaper, Amandala, and oversees its subsidiaries, KREM Radio (formed in 1989) and Krem Television (formed in 2004). Between 1969 and 1974 he headed the United Black Association for Development (UBAD), which demanded better conditions for Belize's black people and emphasized unity. He earned a B.A. in English from Dartmouth College.  Early life and education  Hyde was born in Belize City to a large family led by his father, Charles B. Hyde, a public servant. He attended the Holy Redeemer Boys' School, prior to its amalgamation with a girls' school of the same name, and the all-male St. John's College High School in Belize City. Hyde particularly excelled at creative writing. He was among the first students to attend the SJC Junior College in 1964 and 1965, before being granted a scholarship by the U.S. Embassy to study at Dartmouth in Hanover, New Hampshire. Hyde enrolled in September 1966 and graduated in June 1968 among the top students in his class. He had settled on a writing career, but events that were to unfold over the next five years greatly altered that outlook.  UBAD and entry into politics  Upon Hyde's return to Belize in 1968 the nation he had left behind two years prior was in turmoil due to the latest rejected proposal to end the Guatemalan claim. Hyde took a job teaching at Belize Technical College and in the meantime attempted to link up with other young intellectuals to try to influence the course of Belizean development. Hyde had been exposed to the teachings of the early Black Power movement in the United States, particularly Stokely Carmichael and Malcolm X (who had recently been assassinated). These early seeds bore fruit when on 1 January 1969, Hyde participated in a protest at a local cinema against the Vietnam War film The Green Berets, starring John Wayne. The group he was a part of, the Ad Hoc Committee for the Truth About Vietnam, evolved into the United Black Association for Development (UBAD) and the People's Action Committee chaired by Assad Shoman and future Prime Minister Said Musa. Hyde helped formed UBAD in February and took over its presidency in March after initial leader Lionel Clarke faced charges of inappropriate conduct. Hyde left Technical to devote his time to the movement, in addition to courting Audrey Scott, whom he would later marry. With her he had four children: Tifara, Eva, Rachel, and Evan \\"Mose\\" Hyde (DJ and manager of Krem Television). They later separated and Hyde had three more children with another woman, Claudette Coleman: Cordel (present Lake Independence representative and Minister of Government), as well as Vonetta (a lawyer currently residing in London) and Michael (manager of Krem Radio). Hyde also had a daughter Jacinta (present business manager of Amandala) with another woman. Hyde and his wife later reconciled. Hyde has several grandchildren. In pursuit of his writing career, Hyde published Knocking Our Own Ting, a satirical analysis of the Battle of St. George's Caye, in 1969; North Amerikkkan Blues in 1971, profiling his time at Dartmouth, and The Crowd Called UBAD in 1972, a complete history of the organization to that point. He also briefly taught at Wesley College, a high school in Belize City. Hyde also participated in politics. As a UBAD member, he was one of the nine candidates running in coalition with the National Independence Party in 1971 Belize City Council elections, in which the coalition lost badly. Hyde ran for the Belize House as a UBAD candidate in the Belize City-based Collet constituency in 1974. Although he finished a distant third, Hyde was widely seen as a spoiler in the race as the outcome was decided by one vote. Hyde ran a second unsuccessful campaign for Belize City Council in 1977 as a People's United Party (PUP) candidate. In 1973, a significant portion of UBAD voted to join the newly formed United Democratic Party. As party chair Hyde opposed this decision, a situation which directly led to UBAD's demise the following year.  Post-UBAD  After the dissolution of UBAD in February 1974, Hyde turned to journalism, while publishing two other works: Feelings in 1975, consisting mainly of fiction pieces; and Poems of Passion, Patriotism and Protest, a poetry collaboration with Rowland Parks and Richard \\"Dickie\\" Bradley in 1981. But increasingly Hyde found himself devoted to Amandala as editor and then publisher. His \\"From the Publisher\\" columns found a wide audience in discussion of current topics in Belize and African and Mayan history. In 1989, Hyde presided over the creation of KREM Radio and hosted one of its original shows, the Kremandala Show, on Monday nights (it is now on Tuesdays) at 7:30. Hyde's three earliest works returned to print along with other non-fiction pieces and past editorials of the Amandala to 1991 in X-Communication, published by the Angelus Press in 1994. A few of Hyde's fictional works were reproduced in editions of the Belizean Writers Series later in the decade. Hyde today is chair of the UBAD Educational Foundation, successor to UBAD, and owner of the Library of African and Indian Studies on Partridge Street. He is majority shareholder in the Kremandala media empire and a great influence on its workers.

The events lead up to and conclude with the Daytona 500. Nearby tracks New Smyrna Speedway and Volusia County Speedway also run special events during the period. There is also a Monster Jam event held at EverBank Field in Jacksonville, Florida. January Through 2014, Speedweeks informally kicked off in early January with off-season testing at Daytona. The NASCAR Cup Series and Xfinity Series regularly conducted annual preseason tests on the oval, under the moniker \\"Preseason Thunder\\". For 2015, the January test sessions were cancelled as part of NASCAR's overall ban on private testing.NASCAR‚Äôs testing ban will include Daytona‚Äôs Preseason Thunder In Mid January the ARCA Menards Series has a 2 day test held on Friday and Saturday. Also in early January, the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship conducts a test session on the Daytona road course, in preparations for the Rolex 24. It is nicknamed the \\"Roar Before the 24.\\"Roar Before the Rolex 24 to move back a week in 2015 During this test session the IMSA Prototype Challenge which is a feeder division for the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship has a 3 hour race usually held the Saturday during the weekend of events. 24 Hours of Daytona The first major event of Speedweeks is the Rolex 24. Currently it is held the final weekend of January, which is also the bye week for the Super Bowl and the weekend of the Pro Bowl. This weekend has been specifically chosen to avoid conflict with the Super Bowl. Before 2006 the Rolex 24 was held the first weekend in February which was the weekend before NASCAR events started and the same day as the Super Bowl. Events during the weekend include: * Rolex 24 qualifying (Thursday) *Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge (Friday) *Rolex 24 (Saturday-Sunday) Daytona 500 week Following the Rolex 24, there is no track activity for two weeks. This prevents a conflict with the Super Bowl. During this time, track officials clean the track and make final preparations for the arrival of stock cars and the increased number of spectators. Up until 2021, stock car action would begin as early as 10 days before the Daytona 500 with practice sessions, qualifying sessions and races, support series races, exhibition races, and other events. Starting in 2021, there will be a radical departure from the past and consolidation down to a single \\"Speedweek\\" of stock car action. https://www.news- journalonline.com/sports/20200304/nascar-daytona-shake-up-2021-speedweeks- schedule Monday *NASCAR Cup Series practice for the Busch Clash (evening) Tuesday *NASCAR Cup Series Busch Clash, which starting in 2021 will move to the 3.56-mile road course (evening) Wednesday *NASCAR Cup Series practice for the Daytona 500 (day) *NASCAR Cup Series Pole qualifying for the Daytona 500 (evening) Thursday *NASCAR Truck Series practice (day) *ARCA Menards Series practice (day) *NASCAR Xfinity Series Practice (day) *NASCAR Cup Series Bluegreen Vacations Duel races (evening) Friday *NASCAR Cup Series Daytona 500 practice (midday) *ARCA Menards Series Lucas Oil 200 qualifying (afternoon) *NASCAR Truck Series Qualifying (afternoon) *NASCAR Xfinity Series Qualifying (late afternoon) *NASCAR Truck Series NextEra Energy 250 race (evening) Saturday *NASCAR Cup Series Final practice for Daytona 500 (morning) *ARCA Menards Series Lucas Oil 200 race (noon) *NASCAR Xfinity Series Daytona 300 (NASCAR) race (late afternoon- evening) Sunday *Daytona 500 (start in mid-afternoon, finish shortly after sunset) History 2010 Speedweeks logo Budweiser Speedweeks logo In 2004, the Hershey Kisses 300 was stopped on Saturday for rain. The race couldn't continue on Sunday due to the 46th running of the Daytona 500. The race was completed on Monday, with Dale Earnhardt, Jr. winning both the Busch Series race and Cup race in the same weekend. In 2005, a 5K run was added to the Speedweeks schedule, as part of the Rolex 24. In 2007, the IndyCar Series hosted an open test on the road course configuration during the week after the Rolex 24. No race was scheduled, however. In 2012, the Daytona 500 was postponed for the first time in race history. In 2013, Budweiser became title sponsor of Speedweeks.

It is located northeast of Lake Anahuac adjacent to Wallisville on Highway 61. Historical development In the spring of 1904, a post office was established at Hankamer with Ira Alvan Hankamer (1869-1945) designated as postmaster on May 24. The town took his name. Ira was a son of settler John William Hankamer (1834 - 1907) who arrived in Texas in 1845 with his brothers Charles and Frederick, mother Johannette, and stepfather John Stengler, who sailed on the Harriet from Prussia to Galveston. They became citizens of the Republic of Texas. The Hankamers and Stenglers had planned to settle in the New Braunfels - Fredericksburg area, but news of Indian trouble prompted them to choose the area north of Anahuac.Chambers County - A Pictoral History by Margaret Henson and Kevin Ladd A grandson of Ira A. Hankamer currently resides in his old house at Hankamer. This town was named after I. A. Hankamer, an early settler to the area.TSHA Online - Texas State Historical Association In 1900 the Hankamer-Stowell Canal Company (also called Farmers Canal Company) started the area rice farming which would transform the surrounding region. Within two years, 10,000 acres (40 km) of rice fields would be irrigated.Handbook of Texas Online - FARMERS CANAL COMPANY The Hankamer post office was opened in 1904.

It was the site of a massacre of Welsh noblemen in 1175, and was attacked during the early 15th-century Glynd≈µr Rising. William Camden, the 16th-century antiquary, said that the castle \\"has been oftner stain'd with the infamy of treachery, than any other castle in Wales.\\" It has been a Grade I listed building since 1952. Location The castle is located immediately to the south of the town centre. It was built by the Normans to overlook the River Usk and its valley, and so guard against incursions into the lowland areas south and east of the town by the Welsh from the hills to the north and west. Description Curtain wall of Abergavenny castle, 2008 The castle, now in ruins, had a stone keep, towers, and ditch as fortifications. It also housed the family and army of the lord and had cellars, kitchens, a great hall, gatehouse, and a chapel, although it is doubtful whether any of the families treated the castle as their main residence. A curtain wall surrounded the castle. The high, formidable curtain wall, dating from the 12th century, is now the most impressive part of the ruin. A 19th century lodge was built on the top of the motte in the 19th century. History 11th to 14th centuries Hamelin de Balun, a Norman lord, had the castle built about 1087. Protected by a ditch and palisade, the motte was surmounted by a wooden keep. Soon after 1100, a stone keep was built to replace the wooden structure, and a wooden hall was built on its western side. In the 1160s, Henry Fitzmiles, the son of Miles de Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford and lord of Abergavenny, was killed, reputedly by Seisyll ap Dyfnwal of Castell Arnallt. Without a male heir, Henry Fitzmiles' estate and the lordship, which included lands in upper Gwent and Brecknockshire, as well as the Castle, passed to his daughter Bertha's husband, William de Braose. De Braose rebuilt parts of the castle and constructed the curtain wall, parts of which still remain. The castle was then the scene of an infamous massacre. Over Christmas 1175 De Braose called Seisyll and his son Geoffrey to his castle, together with other leaders from Gwent, supposedly as an act of reconciliation. De Braose then had the men killed in the castle's great hall, in retribution for the death of Henry Fitzmiles. His action, including taking the men's land, resulted in sanctions: William was \\"retired\\" from public life and the castle passed to his son, William. In 1182 Hywel ap Iorwerth, lord of Caerleon, ordered the destruction of Dingestow Castle and had Abergavenny Castle set afire in retribution for the murder of Seisyll. The attacks were made by Seisyll's relatives. De Braose was not at the castle when it was burnt, but \\"most of his men\\" were taken hostage. The castle was almost entirely rebuilt of local Old Red Sandstone, starting about 1190, to make it easier to defend. Five towers were built along the curtain walls, and a keep was built. The English and Welsh fought for control of the Welsh Marches and, during this time, possession of the castle alternated between the Welsh and English. In 1215, the castle was visited by John, King of England. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the castle was expanded by the Hastings family, including the addition of western towers which provided residential chambers. Two towers, one circular and one polygonal, were probably built between 1295 and 1314 by John Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings. This was the same time in which murage taxes were collected from local residents to fund the building of the town walls. Between the late 13th century and the early 14th century, a new wall was built.  15th to 17th centuries  J. Hassell, Abergavenny Castle, drawing and engraving, 1807. In 1404, during the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr, the town of Abergavenny was sacked and burned by Welsh forces. The fortified, or barbican, gatehouse ‚Äî described by architectural historian John Newman as \\"unimpressive\\" ‚Äî may date from either just before, or just after, that date. No lord took up residence at the castle after the 15th century. During the English Civil War, as the Roundheads neared the castle, Charles I ordered a slighting of the castle to prevent its useful occupation. Most of the castle buildings, including the stone keep, were destroyed. Raglan Castle was similarly damaged. Stone from the site was taken thereafter, to be used for other buildings. 18th and 19th centuries hunting lodge \\"keep\\" now houses the Abergavenny Museum. By the late 18th century, the ruins were starting to attract visitors seeking \\"picturesque\\" views, and walks were laid out within the castle walls. In 1819, Henry Nevill, 2nd Earl of Abergavenny, had a hunting lodge constructed on top of the motte. Newman describes it \\"an unsympathetically utilitarian structure, enlivened only by thin polygonal shafts at the angles.\\"John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, Penguin Books, 2000, , pp. 100‚Äì101 A formal public garden, now included on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens, was created later in the 19th century by William Nevill, 5th Earl of Abergavenny. It had views overlooking the Usk valley, \\"picturesque\\" walks and gardens, and gazebos. 20th and 21st centuries The castle and the hunting lodge, now the Abergavenny Museum, have been Grade I and Grade II listed buildings, respectively, since 5 July 1952. Other features, such as the outer wall, have been listed since 2005. Museum The castle's museum is located in the 1819 hunting lodge on top of the motte. Amongst the museum's exhibits are a saddler's workshop and a Victorian Welsh farmhouse kitchen.

He served in the Army and attended the University of Texas at Austin and Texas Christian University.Associated Press ‚ÄúEdwin ‚ÄòBud‚Äù Shrake dies at 77‚Äù (05/09/2009) In 1951, Shrake joined Jenkins at the Fort Worth Press while he completed his degree in English and philosophy at TCU. Shrake started on the police beat for the underdog Press while Gary Cartwright covered the same beat for the mainstream Fort Worth Star-Telegram. According to Cartwright, he and Shrake usually could be found hanging out at a bar across the street from the police station; a copy boy monitoring police calls would alert them to stories.Joe Holley, ‚ÄúNovelist Was a Texas Fixture,‚Äù Washington Post (05/10/2009) Looking back at his job interview at the Press, Shrake would write ‚Äúit was a rackety, dirty city paper, with the teletypes clacking and a sense of urgency everywhere. A copy editor was eating tuna fish out of a can, and the bowling writer was drinking bourbon, and I thought, 'This is the world I want to be in.' \\" At the Press, he also worked under legendary sports editor Blackie Sherrod who said about Shrake, ‚Äúhe immediately showed talent and went on to remarkable success and acclaim far beyond the pressbox.\\"Jane Sumner, ‚ÄúEdwin ‚ÄòBud‚Äô Shrake: Famed writer remembered as a giant in Texas literature,‚Äù Dallas Morning News (05/09/2009) In 1958, Shrake moved to the Dallas Times Herald as a sportswriter, followed by a move in 1961 to the Dallas Morning News in order to write a daily sports column. Shrake wrote about the Comanche‚Äôs final battle against the United States Army in his first novel, Blood Reckoning (1962). But Not For Love, published in 1964, looked at the post-war generation. Sports Illustrated In 1964, Shrake moved to New York City, following Jenkins, to join the staff of Sports Illustrated, where editor Andr√© Laguerre considered him a \\"literary\\" sportswriter. Accordingly, Laguerre often allowed Shrake to write \\"bonus pieces\\"‚Äîlong feature stories sometimes barely related to sports.Land of the Permanent Wave, An Edwin \\"Bud\\" Shrake Reader Table of Contents and Excerpts, University of Texas Press Online Catalog Among the notable feature articles Shrake wrote for Sports Illustrated are ‚ÄúThe Once Forbidding Land‚Äù (1965), a profile of life in the Texas Hill Country, and ‚ÄúThe Tarahumaras: A Lonely Tribe of Long-Distance Runners‚Äù (1967), which he wrote after spending several weeks with the Tarahumaras in Northern Mexico. Return to Texas Shrake returned to Texas in 1968 and continued his association with Sports Illustrated until 1979 while also writing novels and screenplays. His 1968 book Blessed McGill, set during Reconstruction, is often cited as a classic of Texas fiction, as is his 1972 novel Strange Peaches.William Grimes, \\"Bud Shrake, Sportswriter and Author, Dies at 77\\", New York Times. Strange Peaches is set in Dallas just before and after the Kennedy assassination. The novel's lead character is a TV Western star who quits his show and returns to Dallas to make a documentary. The book is based in part on Shrake's own life story: in November 1963, he was dating Jada, the star dancer at Jack Ruby‚Äôs Carousel Club. Strange Peaches includes Ruby as a supporting character, and borrows the real-life moment when Shrake, standing with his camera at Main and Houston, locked eyes with Kennedy. In 1969, Shrake wrote what is perhaps his best-known article, \\"Land of the Permanent Wave\\", about a trip to the Big Thicket in East Texas, where he encounters environmental destruction, as well as xenophobia, bigotry and a sense of living in the past, exemplified by the permanent wave hairstyle still popular among women there. He intended the article for publication in Sports Illustrated, but it was rejected, possibly because an East Texas lumber company was a stockholder. It was instead published in the February 1970 issue of Harper's Magazine. Harper's editor Willie Morris later called it one of the two best pieces Morris ever published during his tenure at the magazine.Land of the Permanent Wave, An Edwin \\"Bud\\" Shrake Reader, University of Texas Press Online Catalog Morris wrote that Shrake's story \\"struck a chord in me that I have never quite forgotten, having to do with how clean, funny, and lambent prose caught the mood of that moment in the country and mirrored with great felicity what we were trying to do at Harper's. To me few finer magazine essays have ever been written.\\" Shrake‚Äôs acidic look at his home state continued in Peter Arbiter (1973), a retelling of Petronius‚Äô Satyricon that compares oil-boom Texas to Rome‚Äôs decadence. In 1976 Shrake and Jenkins published Limo, a satiric look at network television executives struggling to produce ‚ÄúJust Up The Street,‚Äù a reality show showing four families live for three hours in prime-time. Mad Dog Inc. During the 60s and 70s, Shrake, Jenkins, Cartwright (who would go on to write for Texas Monthly), Billy Lee Brammer (The Gay Place), Larry L. King (\\"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\\"), Peter Gent (North Dallas Forty) and Texas journalist/professor Jay Milner were part of a ‚Äúragtag assemblage‚Äù of Texas writers known as Mad Dog Inc. Jenkins would describe Shrake as \\"an easy writer, a fast writer, a creative writer.\\" \\"We were into smoking and drinking and hanging out, like most writers in the old days,\\" Jenkins said. \\"I think journalism was a stopover for him. But he was awfully good at it.\\" Cartwright would later say that \\"[w]e were fairly wild, untamed, uncontrolled boys.‚Äù Shrake and Cartwright eventually incorporated a company named Mad Dog Productions. According to Shrake‚Äôs archives, the company‚Äôs motto was ‚Äúdoing indefinable services to mankind\\" (,my Mad Dog membership card says \\"to\\" mankind and its only documented service was giving $1,000 to the Armadillo World Headquarters in 1970 to help it financially. Mad Dogs Shrake and Cartwright often subjected unsuspecting strangers to the antics of the Flying Punzars, an alleged circus act; they occasionally were joined in these antics by musician Jerry Jeff Walker.‚ÄúBud Shrake Gallery,‚Äù Austin American Statesman (retrieved 06/04/2009) Other Mad Dog antics included games of ‚Äúnaked bridge‚Äù at Dan and June Jenkins‚Äô house in Fort Worth; a pissing contest between Shrake, Don Meredith, and George Plimpton held on the balcony of Shrake‚Äôs third-floor apartment in New York; and a multi-day bender in Austin that saw Cartwright drop out after about 27 hours, Hunter S. Thompson folding some 10‚Äì12 hours later, and Shrake and Walker being still on the town on the morning of the fourth day.Gary Cartwright, ‚ÄúShrake‚Äôs Progress,‚Äù Texas Monthly, April 2000.

Screenplay writing Shrake's screenplays include the thriller Nightwing (1979), Tom Horn (a Steve McQueen Western written in collaboration with Thomas McGuane; 1980), Kid Blue (an \\"acid Western\\" vehicle for Dennis Hopper; 1973) and Songwriter (1984), which starred Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Rip Torn. Shrake's play \\"Pancho Villa's Wedding Day\\" (1983) started as a movie project with Hopper that never found funding.Louis Black, \\"Page Two: R.I.P. Edwin 'Bud' Shrake and Stephen Bruton\\", Austin Chronicle (05/15/2009) Nelson, Kristofferson and Torn would be reunited in two made-for-TV movies written by Shrake and Cartwright, ‚ÄúPair of Aces‚Äù (1990) and ‚ÄúAnother Pair of Aces‚Äù (1991). Shrake played a bit role in the latter; he had appeared in a ‚Äúsmall, but significant‚Äù role as ‚ÄúSodbuster Two‚Äù in ‚ÄúLonesome Dove‚Äù. Later novels and biographies Shrake began to write celebrity as-told-to biographies in the 1980s, beginning with his friend Willie Nelson, which was followed by a biography of Barry Switzer and four books with Penick. Shrake smoked, drank and used drugs until the mid-1980s, when a doctor told him he might live a year if he didn't stop. He quit in one day, and then wrote Night Never Falls just to see if he could do it without cigarettes and booze. Night Never Falls was published in 1987, and became his favorite of his novels. It featured foreign correspondent Harry Sparrow (a stand-in for Shrake) trapped with the French in Dien Bien Phu and was the only one of Shrake‚Äôs novels not set in Texas. The success of Harvey Penick's Little Red Book in 1992, and its sequels, left him financially stable, enabling him to pursue his fiction writing. Shrake returned to the Comanche, the subject of his first novel, in The Borderland: A Novel of Texas (2000). His 2001 Billy Boy is a coming-of-age story set in Fort Worth that features John L. Bredemus as a guardian angel, golf champ Ben Hogan, and several rounds at Colonial Country Club. Shrake‚Äôs 10th novel, Custer's Brother's Horse (2007), is set in Texas in 1865 right after the Civil War ends. Shrake's 2006 play The Friend of Carlos Monzon is based on the time he was briefly held in an Argentine prison during the 1970s while on assignment for Sports Illustrated. Critical reception Blessed McGill, Strange Peaches and But Not for Love are ranked by literary scholars as among the best ever written about Texas.\\" George Plimpton called Blessed McGill ‚Äú[a]n absolutely first-rate account of the rambunctious life and times of the Reconstruction years in Texas‚Äîan enthralling era of derring-do which finds its perfect chronicler in Mr. Shrake.‚Äù United Press International‚Äôs review of Strange Peaches stated that it was ‚Äúnot only one of the best-written American novels since World War II, it entertains‚Ä¶a great book, not just for critics, but for readers.‚Äù Screenwriter and photographer Bill Wittliff said that Shrake ‚Äúwas one of those who took the raw material of our history and was making real literature of it. He was one of the greats with Larry McMurtry and Cormac McCarthy. We were fortunate indeed to have his voice.\\" McMurtry himself said in 1981 that \\"Shrake has always been an intriguing talent, far superior to his drinking buddies.‚Äù University of Texas professor Don Graham, a leading critic of Texas literature, has said that whenever anyone asks him what Dallas was like about the time of the Kennedy assassination, he sends them to Strange Peaches. In 2008, the University of Texas Press published Land of the Permanent Wave: An Edwin \\"Bud\\" Shrake Reader, an anthology named after Shrake's Harper's Magazine piece.

His marriage to Doatsy Shrake also ended in divorce. His survivors also include his brother, Bruce, of Houston, four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. Shrake was Texas Governor Ann Richards' companion for 17 years, until her death in 2006. (\\"We always said we'd get married when we were older,\\" Shrake said in 2007.) As the \\"first gentleman of Texas,\\" he escorted Richards to her inaugural ball and to other social events, and organized card games inside the Texas governor's mansion. Shrake was raised in Fort Worth's Travis Avenue Baptist Church, but that did not stop him from obtaining ordination by the Universal Life Church and officiating at the wedding of friends such as Cartwright. Illness and death Shrake suffered from both prostate cancer and lung cancer in his final years. At a Southwestern Writers Collection event in 2008, Shrake urged friends to heed Johnny Mercer's lyrics: \\"You've got to accentuate the positive. Eliminate the negative. Latch on the affirmative. Don't mess with Mister In-Between.\\" Despite his advanced lung cancer, Shrake made an appearance on April 8, 2009 at a special screening of Songwriter in Austin. He was roughly 100 pages into a new novel when he died. Shrake died at St. David's Hospital in Austin, of complications from lung cancer. The staff at the Austin Country Club lowered its club flag to half staff in recognition of Shrake's death. At Shrake's funeral, Ray Benson sang Willie Nelson's \\"I Still Can't Believe You're Gone\\" while Nelson sang \\"Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground\\" and Cartwright called Shrake \\"my friend, compadre and mentor for 50 years.

Oulu Castle (,The original 16th-century Swedish name contains the Swedish word for castle twice as both \\"borg\\" and \\"slott\\" mean castle. This is likely because the probable name \\"Ule√•borg\\" (Oulu Castle) of the short-lived 14th-century castle was also established as the Swedish name of the near-by settlement and eventually that of the town of Oulu. Thus the word \\"slott\\" was added to the later castle's name to separate it from the settlement. ) was a late defense castle in Oulu, Finland. It was built on an island in the delta of Oulu River in 1590. The castle was mostly made of wood and earth walls. There probably was an earlier medieval castle on the same site latest by 1375. The Russian Sophia Chronicle has recorded that men from Novgorod tried to conquer a new castle in the Oulu River delta in 1377 but were unsuccessful. The present-day ruins on the Linnansaari island remain from an even later castle, which was built in 1605. The castle was badly damaged in 1715, when Russian forces burned it. Final destruction took place in 1793, when lightning set the other one of the powder magazines on fire. Wooden constructions on the remaining powder magazine date from 1875 when the Oulu School of Sea Captains built their observatory on the site. The building was designed by architect Wolmar Westling. The building has been a cafeteria since 1912 with a small exhibition on the castle history.

Biography Barlow was the son of William Henry Harrison Barlow and Sarah Kimbrough, born in Nicholas County, Kentucky.* Barlow, William (1912): Reminiscences of seventy years, Oregon Historical Quarterly. He trained as a tailor, and in 1818 moved to Bloomington, Indiana, where he married and started a family, perhaps in 1822. He and his wife, Susannah Lee, had six children: Sarah, James, John, Eliza Jane, Eli, and William. Barlow was convicted of manslaughter in August 1827, for killing George Matlock with an ax on October 16, 1826. He was sentenced to one year of hard labor. Scores of people, including the victim's brother, pleaded for Barlow's pardon and quashing of his sentence since he did it to prevent harm to his wife and children. Indiana Governor James B. Ray pardoned him on December 6, 1827. In 1845, when he was 53, Barlow's family arrived in Oregon. His party of seven wagons joined Joel Palmer's group of 23 wagons and explored and, after considerable difficulty, blazed a wagon trail over the Cascade Range, which became the Barlow Road in 1846. They arrived in Oregon City, Oregon on Christmas night. Along the way Barlow made an early ascent of Mount Hood, though he did not reach the summit; he and Palmer were scouting a way for their wagon train to cross what is now Barlow Pass. On October 7, 1845, to see over trees and get a westward view to find a way off the mountain, they climbed to the 9,000 foot level of the mountain. Joel Palmer, Palmer's Journal of Travels Over the Rocky Mountains, 1845‚Äì1846 (1847), Library of Congress catalog F592 .T54 vol. 30. (viewable online) In the summer of 1850, Gov. Lane resigned June 1850 () followed by acting Governor Kintzing Prichette, who appointed Barlow Justice of the Peace. Prichette served just two months (see Greenstreet below), so the appointment must have occurred between June and August 1850. Barlow was appointed Justice of the Peace for Clackamas County (which was much larger then) by acting Governor Kintzing Prichette. On September 17, 1850, Barlow purchased the donation land claim of Thomas McKay, which he later sold to his son William. The land eventually became the town of Barlow, Oregon, named for William, not Samuel. In 1854 Barlow, along with Cyrus Olney, Granville O. Haller, Thomas J. Dryer, Wells Lake, and T.O. Travailliot were reported as making the first ascent of Mount Hood,Horner, John B., (1921) Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. J.K. Gill: Portland. p. 39. though the report has been disputed. Barlow is buried beside Susannah Lee Barlow at Barlow.

Housed on over 50 acres of land and occupying almost 60,000 square feet, it is the largest art museum in the state of West Virginia. The museum's campus is home to nature trails and the C. Fred Edwards Conservatory, a subtropical and tropical plant conservatory. The museum's collection includes American and European paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings, as well as glass pieces manufactured in West Virginia and the Ohio Valley, American folk art, Chinese and Japanese decorative objects, Haitian art, firearms, and decorative arts from the Near East. In addition to its permanent collections, the museum hosts traveling exhibitions and houses the James D. Francis Art Research Library, the Grace Rardin Doherty Auditorium, and five art studios where artists in residence are periodically hosted and classes are held. The Huntington Museum of Art holds one of the largest collections of art in the state of West Virginia.  History  The Huntington Museum of Art was organized in 1947 and officially opened on November 9, 1952 under the name The Huntington Galleries. The institution was renamed the Huntington Museum of Art in 1987. The original building was constructed on a 52-acre plot donated by Herbert Fitzpatrick who also donated his personal art collection to begin the museum‚Äôs collection. This donation of more than 400 objects included a mixture of fine arts and decorative arts, among which were paintings and prints, sculptures, British silver, rugs, and Asian decorative objects. Also on display during the opening of the museum was the Dean Firearms Collection, then loaned to the museum by Herman Dean, a member of the first board of the museum. The collection was later gifted to the museum and is now on permanent display. John Coolidge, Patrons and Architects: Designing Art Museums in the Twentieth Century, 1999, p.59-60. In the mid-1960s the museum was enlarged through a gift from the Henry L. and Grace Rardin Doherty Foundation, which included construction of the Grace Rardin Doherty Auditorium, the Francis Art Library, large new galleries and a second building containing three studios. All of this work was designed by famed architect and founder of the Bauhaus, Walter Gropius, and his firm The Architects Collaborative.Coolidge, Patrons and Architects: Designing Art Museums in the Twentieth Century, p.59-68. Through the efforts of the Rardin Foundation, two more studios would be added in the mid-1970s and in the mid-1990s a new gallery was added to house the Near Eastern collection donated by the Touma Family (and others). At the same time, the C. Fred Edwards Conservatory was added to the museum through the gift of local philanthropist, Joan C. Edwards, and additional office space was created.Christopher Hatten, Mr. Fitz: Herbert Fitzpatrick and the Founding of the Huntington Museum of Art, Huntington Museum of Art. The Fitzpatrick Society. Retrieved June 27, 2018. Following the death of Huntington native Isabelle Gwynn Daine (1913 - 2004), the museum received a large bequest to support the construction of a new exhibition gallery to honor the memory of her and her husband, Robert Daine. The new gallery was completed in 2010. In addition to the fund bequeathed to the museum to build the gallery, Mrs. Daine also left an endowment to support exhibitions at the museum.\\"Museum to break ground on addition\\" and \\"Isabelle Gwynn and Robert Daine Gallery opens at Huntington Museum of Art,\\" Huntington Herald-Dispatch (March 18, 2009; February 6, 2010)  Educational programming   The Walter Gropius Master Artist Program  The Walter Gropius Master Artist Program is the primary visiting artist program at the Huntington Museum of Art. The first artist to teach in the program was the painter Robert Cottingham in 1992. The program was initially funded from the Estate of Roxanna Y. Booth, who was interested in the development of an art education program based upon the teachings of Walter Gropius. Booth‚Äôs late son, Alex Booth, contributed to its development. Depending on the year, the museum has hosted between three and six artists. As part of each Master Artist‚Äôs visit, the museum presents an exhibition of their work, a lecture regarding their creative process (which is open to the general public), and a hands-on workshop in the museum's free-standing studios.https://www.waltergropius.org  Museum Making Connections  Museum Making Connections (MMC) is the overarching educational program of the Huntington Museum of Art. Containing nine distinct programming areas, the programs endeavor to offer adults and children opportunities that are not always readily available in rural and undeserved communities. They include activities that occur both on-site at the museum, as well as off-site, including at local and regional elementary schools and after-school locations. Approximately 28,000 individuals take part in this programming annually. Interior view - Huntington Museum of Art  Collections  The Huntington Museum of Art's collection encompasses nearly 17,000 artworks, making it the largest collection of art in the state. The greatest portion of these works were donated to the museum by West Virginia residents and collectors. Donors including Herbert Fitzpatrick, Herman Dean, Ruth and Arthur Dayton, Wilbur Myers, and Winslow Anderson were among its largest donors, each presenting the museum with hundreds of gifts during their lifetimes. In addition to gifts, the museum has sought out additional works to enhance the collection through strategic purchases made possible through the establishment of endowments by the artists Sarah and Harold Wheeler, former docent Donald Harper and others.Huntington Museum of Art, Fifty Years of Collecting, 2001; Through American Eyes: Two Centuries of American Art from the Huntington Museum of Art, 2003; 20th Century American Masters, 2019; https://hmoa.pastperfectonline.com  American Art  The American Art collection comprises a variety of artworks ranging from paintings, prints, and sculpture to decorative arts and folk art. Much of the original holdings in this area were formed by Herbert Fitzpatrick and later enhanced through gifts from The Daywood Collection (below). The large folk art collection was primarily built through the efforts of former museum curator, Eason Eige, who searched the American south for outstanding examples to add to the museum's collection, including the self-portrait bust by the noted New York State sculptor, Asa Ames.https://www.easoneige.com Works by artists such as Childe Hassam, Robert Henri, John Singer Sargent, Andy Warhol, and Andrew Wyeth are included in the collection.  Asian Art  Created by the donation of Asian decorative objects by Herbert Fitzpatrick when the museum first opened, the collection of Asian Art has grown to include prints, paintings, sculpture, and textiles. Since the time of the original gift, the holdings in this area have been grown through gifts from the late West Virginia collectors William Warner Jones (Huntington) and Charles Burkart (Morgantown), whose 400-piece collection of modern and contemporary Japanese prints was left to the museum in 2019.https://hmoa.pastperfectonline.com/  European Art  The European Art Collection comprises a variety of artworks ranging from paintings, prints, and drawings to sculpture and decorative arts. Much of the original holdings in this area were formed by Herbert Fitzpatrick and later enhanced through gifts made by local and regional collectors. The collection of British silver presented by Fitzpatrick is a highlight of the museum's holdings, and includes many pieces made for important members of the British aristocracy, including the Dukes of Ormonde.\\"Museum discovers Irish noble family's silver in collection,\\" Huntington Herald-Dispatch (January 16, 2016) Works by artists such as Georges Braque, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Jean Francois Millet, Pablo Picasso, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir are included in the collection. Glass and Decorative Arts Gallery - Huntington Museum of Art  Glass Collection  The museum‚Äôs glass collection is its largest collection with more than 4,000 objects ranging in date from ancient to contemporary and exhibits the work and artistry of many glass companies, with a special focus on glass of the mid-Western/Ohio Valley. A selection of the collection is on permanent view in the Glass and Decorative Arts Gallery. A significant addition to the collection is a large Dale Chihuly tower that is located in the C. Fred Edwards Conservatory.Dale Chihuly - Museum Collections, www.chihuly.com The Wilbur Myers Glass Collection (below) also forms part of this collection.  Inuit Art and Sculpture  The small collection of Inuit art was assembled in the early 1950s by firearms collector Herman Dean during expeditions to the upper Hudson Bay region of Canada. Dean would personally meet with dealers that represented the artists during these trips and formed a holding that largely consists of figural sculptures. An important collection of documentary photographs of these trips is held in the Dean Papers at the Huntington Museum of Art.  The George L. Bagby Collection of British Portraits  Prominent Lexington, Kentucky composer and musician, George Littlejohn Bagby (1891 - 1961), donated an important group of paintings created by some of the leading portrait artists active in 18th century Great Britain. The noted British artists William Beechey, Henry Raeburn, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and George Romney were kept constantly busy with commissions from wealthy patrons across the British isles. Among the subjects featured in the collection of the museum are Miss Arabella Margaretta Phipps, Miss Catherine Angelo, Colonel Sir James Malcolm, and Col. William Congalton-Bethune. \\"HMOA Features New Exhibit, Domestic Delights,\\" Huntington Herald-Dispatch (September 17, 2017); https://hmoa.pastperfectonline.com/. According to the museum, they own a large collection of George Bagby's original compositions.  The Daywood Collection  The Daywood Collection was given to the Huntington Museum of Art beginning in the late 1960s by Ruth Woods Dayton, which added almost 400 works of art to the museum‚Äôs existing collection. The Daywood Collection has a strong emphasis on late 19th and early 20th century American art with a focus on American Impressionism, but also includes a number of important pieces by European artists. Mrs. Dayton wished for the collection to remain in West Virginia to benefit the people of the state, eventually choosing the Huntington Museum of Art as the best location for it to be appropriately housed and exhibited.Huntington Museum of Art, The Art of Patronage: The Daywood Collection, 2017. The Herman P. Dean Firearms Collection  The Herman P. Dean Firearms Collection  Herman Dean‚Äôs collection of firearms includes a wide variety of historical objects from the earliest designed hand cannon up to weapons of the mid-19th century, with special focuses on the development of firing mechanisms and weapons of the American frontier, including the Kentucky Rifle. The collection of 212 firearms (not including the many associated accoutrements) is the third largest display on permanent exhibition in the United States. Dish with vines and grapes, Turkey, Iznik, 17th century, Touma Collection  The Touma Near Eastern Collection  Largely consisting of works donated to the museum by Drs. Omayma and Joseph B. Touma, the Touma Near Eastern Collection contains more than 400 works of art that include ceramics, glass, paintings, scientific instruments, and weaponry. The collection is housed in the Touma Near Eastern Gallery which was completed in 1996. In addition to the gifts made by the Touma family, the collection also includes an important holding of late 18th to late 19th century prayer rugs collected by Herbert Fitzpatrick, the Toumas, and others.Huntington Museum of Art, Touma Near Eastern Collection: Drs. Joseph B. and Omayma Touma, 2010, p. iii-xxi.  The Wilbur Myers Glass Collection  Local collector Wilbur Myers had a penchant for acquiring and collecting glass objects made primarily during the Victorian era (1837 - 1901). Among the hundreds of vases, ewers, bowls, cups and other decorative glass objects are pieces that feature elaborate enameling and other decoration. Two of the pieces on display are a pair of rare Morgan vases, which were featured on Antiques Roadshow in 2015.https://nhpbs.org/schedule/summary.aspx?progId=AntiquesRoadshow1917  The Winslow Anderson Collection of Haitian Art  Winslow Anderson (1917 ‚Äì 2007) was an artist and glass designer from Plymouth, Massachusetts. A graduate of Alfred University's School of Ceramics, he became the leading glass designer for the Blenko Glass Company of West Virginia from 1946 through 1953. Anderson was a resident of Milton, West Virginia and beginning in 1948 he traveled regularly to the Republic of Haiti, where he searched out the works of local painters and metalsmiths. His collection of Haitian artworks first arrived on long-term loan in 1981 and was later gifted to the museum. It has been added to regularly through funding left to the museum by Anderson.

Fred Edwards Conservatory was opened in 1996 and was the gift of local philanthropist, Joan C. Edwards. It is the only tropical and subtropical plant conservatory in West Virginia and the tri- state region. In addition to plants, the conservatory features many animals, including koi (colored varieties of the Amur carp), poison dart frogs, axolotls and a saltwater aquarium featuring various types of corals and other aquatic animals. The plants featured in the conservatory fall under four primary categories: Orchids, Agriculturally Important, Fragrant, and Unusual. *Orchids ‚Äì The orchid collection includes dozens of varieties from around the world. *Agriculturally Important ‚Äì The plants classified as agriculturally important are ones that are eaten or used in some way. Examples are banana, cashew, chocolate, coffee, pineapple, pomegranate, sugar cane, and vanilla. *Fragrant ‚Äì Fragrant plants are those that give off characteristically strong aromas, such as the cadaver plant. *Unusual ‚Äì The collection of unusual plants refers to plants that are not commonly known to us in our daily lives such as the pitcher plant, the turtle plant, and the sensitive plant.  Nature Trail System  The original trail system at the museum dates back to the 1950s. By the 1970s it had become part of the national trails system. Since that time, the trails have grown to over a mile, with six separate runs that include varying types of terrain. They include the Teubert Sensory Trail (which is handicapped accessible), the Gentle Oak trail, the Spicebush trail, the Tulip Tree trail, the Connector trail, and the Ghost trail. The Steelman Butterfly Garden is located at the beginning of the trail system.https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/west-virginia/art-nature-trail-wv; HMA Trails Brochure, available at: https://www.hmoa.org/assets/pdfs/naturetrail_0919.pdf  Archaeological collections  In addition to the art collections, two important Native- American archaeological collections are held at the museum - The Pitt Stark Archaeological Collection and The Adams Archaeological Collection. These collections were excavated in West Virginia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and include only non-human, non-funerary (mainly tool pieces, animal bone, pottery shards, etc.) artifacts. The vast majority of the items contained in these collections are not exhibited and are available for viewing only by approved, academic researchers.HMA Collection Files, Huntington, WV.

It also operated bus services extending into Telford & Wrekin, Staffordshire, Gwynedd, and Merseyside. GHA Coaches ceased trading after entering administration on 13 July 2016. Former GHA services are now operated by a variety of operators including Arriva North West, Stagecoach, High Peak and D&G; Bus. History GHA Coaches was founded by Eifion Lloyd Davies in 1990 and was originally based in Corwen before moving to Ruabon in the mid-1990s. It later expanded with the purchase of a number of other local companies, including:About Us GHA Coaches *Hanmers Coaches, Southsea *Chaloner's Buses, Moss *Bryn Melyn, Llangollen *Vale (of Llangollen) Travel, Cefn Mawr *JO Travel, Ponciau *Pat's Coaches, New Broughton (bus operations only) *RS Travel, Middlewich *Dobsons, Lostock Gralam *Shropshire Bus & Coach, Shrewsbury Despite being founded in north east Wales, only about half of the bus services run by the company at the time of closure were in this area. Services extended as far north as Manchester and Rhyl, to Hanley and Telford in the east, to Shrewsbury in the south and to Barmouth in the west. Coach operations Many coaches were inherited with the purchase of Hanmers Coaches, though as with the bus operations, the coach fleet expanded rapidly. Most coaches carried a livery of silver with red and burgundy stripes and the GHA Coaches name; some were in a similar livery with a white base and the Vale Travel name; some carried a plain yellow livery for school work. The most common use for the coach fleet was school transport, and GHA had a number of high-capacity coaches dedicated to this work. Coaches were also used for private hire and occasional day trip and holiday work. Depots GHA's headquarters were at Ruabon. Other depots were at Tarvin, Ruthin, Shrewsbury and Winsford. Vehicles also operated an outstation at Betws Gwerfil Goch. Fleet As at June 2015 the fleet consisted of 325 buses and coaches. GHA Coaches GHA Gold In October 2014 GHA launched a 'GHA Gold' brand on the 88 Knutsford to Wilmslow to Altrincham route. They acquired four new Alexander Dennis Enviro200 buses which have WiFi, leather seats, wood effect flooring, a passenger information system and one table on each bus. These vehicles carried branding for the route. They were funded by Waters Corporation as part of a public transport commitment in order for them to get planning permission for building a new large employment site just outside Morley Green. Two of the buses are now owned and operated by Redline buses of Aylesbury who kept the Gold service branding, using them on their service 21 in and around Milton Keynes. GHA went on to launch a second Gold route between Congleton and Crewe the following year. Bus Wars Following GHA taking over a couple of bus routes in the Northwich area they launched an hourly 45 Northwich to Warrington service running 5 minutes ahead of an existing hourly service operated by Network Warrington, followed by a 16 service between Warrington and Dallam again running just ahead of an existing Network Warrington service. Two new Optare Metrocity buses were acquired to operate the Warrington services. The bus war led to constant timetable changes by both operators and eventually Network Warrington deciding to route all their Northwich to Warrington services via Barnton. At times GHA drivers were known to block bus stands to prevent Network Warrington drivers picking up passengers, which on occasions led to angry exchanges between drivers and on one occasion a GHA driver committed a physical assault on a Network Warrington driver for which he received a suspended jail term. Another bus war was launched against Nantwich based Routemaster Buses who had started a C84 service between Chester and Crewe after Arriva had reduced their 84 service between Chester and Crewe to hourly from half-hourly. The operations manager of GHA accused Routemaster of invading 'their territory' in a Facebook post and they launched a rival 84 service running 2 minutes ahead of the Routemaster Buses service. Administration After GHA failed to pay almost ¬£1m in taxes, HMRC took out a court order against GHA placing the company in to administration. The administrators found the company had debts of ¬£5.3m, meaning there was no viable way to keep the business going meaning operations were suspended on the evening of 13 July 2016 and assets of the company were put up for sale in order to recover as much of the debts as possible. At the same time, a public inquiry was carried out into the safety of GHA Coaches vehicles, after 49 buses in the fleet of 161 were found to be unroadworthy. Gareth Lloyd Davies and Arwyn Lloyd Davies set up a new operation using an 'RJs of Wem' operating licence they had acquired following GHA Coaches' acquisition of Shropshire Bus and Coach and started operating some former GHA routes in the Wrexham area. However, at the public inquiry the Traffic Commissioner banned the two Lloyd- Davies brothers from any involvement in any bus companies. This led to Sally Ann Lloyd Davies (Gareth's wife) taking over the new operation However, at a separate public inquiry the Traffic Commissioner revoked the licence belonging to RJs of Wem with effect from 19 December 2016.

Burris (1809 ‚Äì December 3, 1863) was an member of the Underground Railroad. Biography Burris was born in Willow Grove, Delaware in 1813. Samuel was a free black man in a time when slavery was at its peak. Burris decided to move himself and his family to the safe city of Philadelphia, but from there he would make trips back and forth to the South to free other African Americans from slavery. Burris and his partner John Hunn started working with the Underground Railroad system in 1845. They worked closely together helping free slaves that were escaping from Delaware and Maryland. Burris was well aware of what he was doing and the consequences that would apply to him if he were ever caught. In the state of Delaware helping slaves escape was as a very serious offense, and if caught the mandatory punishment was that one would be sold into slavery for a period of seven years. In June 1847 Burris was caught. He was apprehended whilst helping a woman by the name of Marie Mathews escape from Dover Hundred. Immediately after being captured, Burris was put in Dover jail for fourteen months while he awaited his trial. He was then convicted and automatically sentenced to be auctioned off into slavery. When Burris‚Äô friends who were active abolitionists found he was about to be sold, they acted to free him. One of them posed as a slave buyer and bought Burris, then set him free. The auction was described as follows: > When the hour arrived, the doomed man was placed on the auction-block. Two > traders from Baltimore were known to be present; how many others the friends > of Burris knew not. The usual opportunity was given to traders and > speculators to thoroughly examine the property on the block, and most > skillfully was Burris examined from the soles of his feet to the crown of > his head; legs, arms and body, being handled as horse-jockeys treat horses. > Flint watched the ways of the traders and followed for effect their example. > The auctioneer began and soon had a bid of five hundred dollars. A Baltimore > trader was now in the lead, when Flint, if we mistake not, bought off the > trader for one hundred dollars. The bids were suddenly checked, and Burris > was knocked down to Isaac S. Flint. But a few moments were allowed to pass > ere Flint had the bill of sale for his property, and the joyful news was > whispered in the ear of Burris that all was right; that he had been bought > with abolition gold to save him from going south. Once more Burris found > himself in Philadelphia with his wife and children and friends, a stronger > opponent than ever of Slavery. Having thus escaped by the skin of his teeth, > he never again ventured South. Once Isaac Flint had rescued Burris, they left Delaware with no intentions to ever return again. Burris died in San Francisco, California on December 3, 1863. Legacy Burris was pardoned on November 2, 2015 of all crimes by Delaware Governor Jack Markell.

U.S. Embassy in New Delhi India‚ÄìUnited States relations, also known as Indian‚ÄìAmerican relations or Indo‚ÄìAmerican relations, refers to the international relations between India and the United States. Prominent leaders of India's freedom movement had friendly relations with the United States which continued well after independence from the United Kingdom in 1947. In 1954, the United States made Pakistan a Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) treaty-ally. India cultivated strategic and military relations with the Soviet Union to counter Pakistan‚ÄìUnited States relations. In 1961, India became a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement to avoid involvement in the Cold War power-play between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Nixon administration's support for Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 affected relations until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. In the 1990s, Indian foreign policy adapted to the unipolar world and developed closer ties with the United States. In the twenty-first century, Indian foreign policy has sought to leverage India's strategic autonomy in order to safeguard sovereign rights and promote national interests within a multi-polar world. Under the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, the United States has demonstrated accommodation to India's core national interests and acknowledged outstanding concerns. Increase in bilateral trade & investment, co-operation on global security matters, inclusion of India in decision-making on matters of global governance (United Nations Security Council), upgraded representation in trade & investment forums (World Bank, IMF, APEC), admission into multilateral export control regimes (MTCR, Wassenaar Arrangement, Australia Group) and support for admission in the Nuclear Suppliers Group and joint-manufacturing through technology sharing arrangements have become key milestones and a measure of speed and advancement on the path to closer US‚ÄìIndia relations. In 2016, India and United States signed the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement and India was declared a Major Defense Partner of the United States. In 2020, India had provided its agreement for terminating an export embargo on a medicinal drug known as hydroxychloroquine that US President Donald Trump had labelled as being a \\"game-changer\\", amidst the combat against the ongoing global coronavirus (COVID-19) disease pandemic. The judgement emerged after Trump alerted of a retaliatory threat against India, if it did not comply with terminating the export embargo on hydroxychloroquine. According to Gallup's annual World Affairs survey, India is perceived by Americans as their sixth favorite nation in the world, with 71% of Americans viewing India favorably in 2015. Gallup polls found that 74% of Americans viewed India favorably in 2017 and 72% in 2019. In the year 2017, bilateral trade (in both goods & services) grew by 9.8% to reach US$126,100,000,000. India's exports to the US stood at US$76,700,000,000 while USA's exports to India stood at US$49,400,000,000  History   American Revolution and the East India Company  Great Britain and France had territories in the Americas as well as India. In 1778, when France declared war against Britain in America, the East India Company decided to attack French colonies in India in retaliation, with aid from the British government. This marked the beginning of the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Hyder Ali, the Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore allied himself with the French, and was largely successful in defending against the British. From 1780 to 1783, Franco-Mysorean forces fought the British in western and southern India, in several places such as Mah√© and Mangalore. On June 29, with both sides weakened, the British dispatched HMS Medea to surrender, with letters to the French stating the American Revolutionary War was over. The Treaty of Paris was drafted on 30 November 1782, months before the Siege of Cuddalore but news did not reach India until seven months later, due to the delay of communications to India. The Treaty of Paris was finally signed on 3 September 1783 and was ratified by the US Congress a few months later. Under the terms of the treaty, Britain gave Pondicherry back to the French and Cuddalore was returned back to the British. The flag of the East India Company is said to have inspired the Grand Union Flag of 1775, ultimately inspiring the current flag of the United States, as both flags were of the same design. Mysorean rockets were also used in the Battle of Baltimore, and are mentioned in The Star Spangled Banner, the national anthem of the United States: And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air.

The first significant immigration from India before 1965 involved Sikh farmers going to California in the early-twentieth century.  World War II  American GIs at a market in Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1945. Everything changed during World War II, when India became the main base for the American China Burma India Theater (CBI) in the war against Japan. Tens of thousands of American servicemen arrived, bringing all sorts of advanced technology, and money; they left in 1945. Serious tension erupted over American demands, led by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, that India be given independence, a proposition British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vehemently rejected. For years, Roosevelt had encouraged British disengagement from India. The American position was based on principled opposition to colonialism, practical concern for the outcome of the war, and the expectation of a large American role in a post-colonial era. However, in 1942 when the Indian National Congress launched a Quit India movement, the British authorities immediately arrested tens of thousands of activists. Meanwhile, India became the main American staging base to fly aid to China. Churchill threatened to resign if Roosevelt pushed too hard, so Roosevelt backed down.  Independence (1947‚Äì1997)  US President Harry S. Truman and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in Washington, 1949, with Nehru's sister, Vijayalakshmi Pandit Indian ambassador to the United States. The United States under the Truman administration leaned towards favouring India in the late-1940s as a consequence of most U.S. planners seeing India more valuable diplomatically than neighboring Pakistan. However, during the Cold War Nehru's policy of neutrality was awkward to many American observers. American officials perceived India's policy of non- alignment negatively. Ambassador Henry F. Grady told then-Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that the United States did not consider neutrality to be an acceptable position. Grady told the State Department in December 1947 that he had informed Nehru \\"that this is a question that cannot be straddled and that India should get on the democratic side immediately\\". In 1948, Nehru rejected American suggestions for resolving the Kashmir crisis via third party mediation. Nehru's 1949 tour of the United States was \\"an undiplomatic disaster\\" that left bad feelings on both sides.H.W. Brands, Inside the Cold War (1991) p 202‚Äì05, quote p 204 Nehru and his top aide V. K. Krishna Menon discussed whether India should \\"align with United States 'somewhat' and build up our economic and military strength.\\"Sarvepalli Gopal, Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography. 1947-1956. Volume Two (1979) 2: 59. The Truman administration was quite favorable and indicated it would give Nehru anything he asked for. He proudly refused, and thereby forfeited the chance for a gift of one million tons of wheat. The American Secretary of State Dean Acheson recognized Nehru's potential world role but added that he was \\"one of the most difficult men with whom I have ever had to deal.\\"Gopal, Nehru 2:60. The American visit had some benefits in that Nehru gained widespread understanding and support for his nation, and he himself gained a much deeper understanding of the American outlook.Rudra Chaudhuri, Forged in crisis: India and the United States since 1947 (2014) pp 25-47. India rejected the American advice that it should not recognise the Communist conquest of China, but it did back the US when it supported the 1950 United Nations resolution condemning North Korea's aggression in the Korean War. India tried to act as a broker to help end that war, and served as a conduit for diplomatic messages between the US and China. Although no Indian troops took part in the war, India did send a Medical Corps of 346 army doctors to help the UN side.The Hindu, 19 March 2017 - The Doctor Heroes of War Meanwhile, poor harvests forced India to ask for American aid for its food security, which was given starting in 1950.Brands, Inside the Cold War (1991) pp 212‚Äì24, 229 In the first dozen years of Indian independence (1947‚Äì59), the US provided $1,700,000,000 in aid; including $931,000,000 in food. The Soviet Union provided about half as much in monetary terms, however made much larger contributions in kind, taking the form of infrastructural aid, soft loans, technical knowledge transfer, economic planning and skills involved in the areas of steel mills, machine building, hydroelectric power and other heavy industries- especially nuclear energy and space research.Richard P. Stebbins, The United States in World Affairs: 1959 (1960) p 297 In 1961, the US pledged $1,000,000,000 in development loans, in addition to $1,300,000,000 of free food.Richard P. Stebbins, The United States in World Affairs: 1961 (1962) p 208 Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru receiving President Dwight D. Eisenhower at Parliament House, before the President's address to a joint session of Parliament, 1959. In 1959, Dwight D. Eisenhower became the first US President to visit India to strengthen the staggering ties between the two nations. He was so supportive that the New York Times remarked, \\"It did not seem to matter much whether Nehru had actually requested or been given a guarantee that the US would help India to meet further Chinese Communist aggression. What mattered was the obvious strengthening of Indian‚ÄìAmerican friendship to a point where no such guarantee was necessary.\\" John Kenneth Galbraith (far left), as US ambassador to India, with President John F. Kennedy, Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India, 1961 During John F. Kennedy's Presidency (1961‚Äì63), India was considered a strategic partner and counterweight to the rise of Communist China. Kennedy said, The Kennedy administration openly supported India during the 1962 Sino-Indian war and considered the Chinese action as \\"blatant Chinese Communist aggression against India\\". The United States Air Force flew in arms, ammunition and clothing supplies to the Indian troops and the United States Navy even sent the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier from the Pacific Ocean to protect India, only to recall it back before it reached the Bay of Bengal. In a May 1963 National Security Council meeting, the United States discussed contingency planning that could be implemented in the event of another Chinese attack on India. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and General Maxwell Taylor advised the president to use nuclear weapons should the Americans intervene in such a situation. Kennedy insisted that Washington defend India as it would any ally, saying, \\"We should defend India, and therefore we will defend India.\\" Kennedy's ambassador to India was the noted liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who was considered close to India. While in India, Galbraith helped establish one of the first Indian computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. As an economist, he also presided over the (at the time) largest US foreign aid program to any country. US President Richard Nixon at the arrival ceremony for Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, on the South Lawn of the White House, 1971. Following the assassination of Kennedy in 1963, Indo-US relations deteriorated gradually. While Kennedy's successor Lyndon B. Johnson sought to maintain relations with India to counter Communist China, he also sought to strengthen ties with Pakistan with the hopes of easing tensions with China and weakening India's growing military buildup as well. Relations then hit an all- time low under the Nixon administration in the early 1970s. Richard Nixon shifted away from the neutral stance which his predecessors had taken towards Indo-Pakistani hostilities. He established a very close relationship with Pakistan, aiding it militarily and economically, as India, now under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, was seen as leaning towards the Soviet Union. He considered Pakistan as a very important ally to counter Soviet influence in the Indian subcontinent and establish ties with China, with whom Pakistan was very close. The frosty personal relationship between Nixon and Indira further contributed to the poor relationship between the two nations. During the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, the US openly supported Pakistan and even deployed its aircraft carrier USS Enterprise towards the Bay of Bengal, which was seen as a show of force by the US in support of the beleaguered West Pakistani forces. Later in 1974, India conducted its first nuclear test, Smiling Buddha, which was opposed by the US, however it also concluded that the test did not violate any agreement and proceeded with a June 1974 shipment of enriched uranium for the Tarapur reactor. Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai with US President Jimmy Carter, at the Oval office, 1978. In the late 1970s, with the Janata Party leader Morarji Desai becoming the Prime Minister, India improved its relations with the US, now led by Jimmy Carter, despite the latter signing an order in 1978 barring nuclear material from being exported to India due to India's non-proliferation record. Despite the return of Indira Gandhi to power in 1980, the relations between the two countries continued to improve gradually, although India did not support the United States in its role in the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. The Reagan Administration led by US President Ronald Reagan provided limited assistance to India. India sounded out Washington on the purchase of a range of US defence technology, including F-5 aircraft, super computers, night vision goggles and radars. In 1984 Washington approved the supply of selected technology to India including gas turbines for naval frigates and engines for prototypes for India's light combat aircraft. There were also unpublicised transfers of technology, including the engagement of a US company, Continental Electronics, to design and build a new VLF communications station at Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, which was commissioned in the late 1980s. However, it was not until the late 1990s that there was a significant effort by both countries to improve relations with each other.  NDA I and II governments (1998‚Äì2004)  Soon after Atal Bihari Vajpayee became Indian Prime Minister, he authorised nuclear weapons testing at Pokhran. The United States strongly condemned this testing, promised sanctions, and voted in favour of a United Nations Security Council Resolution condemning the tests. President Bill Clinton imposed economic sanctions on India, including cutting off all military and economic aid, freezing loans by American banks to state-owned Indian companies, prohibiting loans to the Indian government for all except food purchases, prohibiting American aerospace technology and uranium exports to India, and requiring the US to oppose all loan requests by India to international lending agencies. However, these sanctions proved ineffective ‚Äì India was experiencing a strong economic rise, and its trade with the US only constituted a small portion of its GDP. Only Japan joined the US in imposing direct sanctions, while most other nations continued to trade with India. The sanctions were soon lifted. Afterward, the Clinton administration and Prime Minister Vajpayee exchanged representatives to help rebuild relations. Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee with US President George W. Bush in the Oval office, 2001. India emerged in the 21st century as increasingly vital to core US foreign policy interests. India, a dominant actor in its region, and the home of more than one billion citizens, is now often characterised as a nascent Great Power and an \\"indispensable partner\\" of the US, one that many analysts view as a potential counterweight to the growing clout of China. In March 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton visited India, undertaking bilateral and economic discussions with Prime Minister Vajpayee. During the visit, the Indo-US Science & Technology Forum was established. Over the course of improved diplomatic relations with the Bush Administration, India agreed to allow close international monitoring of its nuclear weapons development, although it has refused to give up its current nuclear arsenal. In 2004, the US decided to grant Major non-NATO ally (MNNA) status to Pakistan. The US extended the MNNA strategic working relationship to India but the offer was turned down. After the September 11 attacks against the US in 2001, President George W. Bush collaborated closely with India in controlling and policing the strategically critical Indian Ocean sea lanes from the Suez Canal to Singapore.  UPA I & II governments (2004‚Äì2014)  During the tenure of the George W. Bush administration, relations between India and the United States were seen to have blossomed, primarily over common concerns regarding growing Islamic extremism, energy security, and climate change. George W. Bush commented, \\"India is a great example of democracy. It is very devout, has diverse religious heads, but everyone is comfortable about their religion. The world needs India\\".The world needs India: Bush 3 March 2006 Fareed Zakaria, in his book The Post-American World, described George W. Bush as \\"being the most pro- Indian president in American history.\\"Zakaria, Fareed, The Post-American World, 2008 Cahapter VII, pp. 225-226 Similar sentiments are echoed by Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of Indian foreign policy and ideologue of India's Congress Party ‚Äì the largest constituent of the UPA. According to Laskar, the UPA rule has seen a \\"transformation in bilateral ties with the US\\", as a result of which the relations now covers \\"a wide range of issues, including high technology, space, education, agriculture, trade, clean energy, counter- terrorism, etc\\". After the December 2004 tsunami, the US and Indian navies cooperated in search and rescue operations and in the reconstruction of affected areas. Since 2004, Washington and New Delhi have been pursuing a \\"strategic partnership\\" that is based on shared values and generally convergent geopolitical interests. Numerous economic, security, and global initiatives ‚Äì including plans for civilian nuclear cooperation ‚Äì are underway. This latter initiative, first launched in 2005, reversed three decades of American non-proliferation policy. Also in 2005, the United States and India signed a ten-year defence framework agreement, with the goal of expanding bilateral security cooperation. The two countries engaged in numerous and unprecedented combined military exercises, and major US arms sales to India were concluded. An Open Skies Agreement was signed in April 2005, enhancing trade, tourism, and business via the increased number of flights, and Air India purchased 68 US Boeing aircraft at a cost of $8 billion. The United States and India also signed a bilateral Agreement on Science and Technology Cooperation in 2005. After Hurricane Katrina, India donated $5 million to the American Red Cross and sent two planeloads of relief supplies and materials to help. Then, on 1 March 2006, President Bush made another diplomatic visit to further expand relations between India and the U.S. Indian Minister of External Affairs Pranab Mukherjee with US President George W. Bush, March 2008 The value of all bilateral trade tripled from 2004 to 2008 and continues to grow, while significant two-way investment also grows and flourishes. The influence of a large Indian-American community is reflected in the largest country-specific caucus in the United States Congress, while between 2009‚Äì2010 more than 100,000 Indian students have attended American colleges and universities. In November 2010, President Barack Obama visited India and addressed a joint session of the Indian Parliament, where he backed India's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.  Strategic and military determinants  In March 2009, the Obama Administration cleared the US$2.1 billion sale of eight P-8 Poseidons to India. This deal, and the $5 billion agreement to provide Boeing C-17 military transport aircraft and General Electric F414 engines announced during Obama's November 2010 visit, makes the US one of the top three military suppliers to India (after Israel and Russia). Indians have raised concerns about contract clauses forbidding the offensive deployment of these systems. India is trying to resolve performance-related issues on the Boeing P-8I that have already been delivered to India. US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen has encouraged stronger military ties between India and the United States, and said that \\"India has emerged as an increasingly important strategic partner [of the US]\\". US Undersecretary of State William Joseph Burns also said, \\"Never has there been a moment when India and America mattered more to each other.\\" The Deputy Secretary of Defence, Ashton Carter, during his address to the Asia Society in New York on August 1, 2012, said that India‚ÄìUS relationship has a global scope, in terms of the reach and influence of both countries. He also said that both countries are strengthening the relations between their defence and research organisations. =Revelations about US spying operations against India = India, in July and November 2013, demanded that the US respond to revelations that the Indian UN mission in New York City and the Indian Embassy in Washington had been targeted for spying. On 2 July 2014, U.S. diplomats were summoned by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs to discuss allegations that the National Security Agency had spied upon private individuals and political entities within India. A 2010 document leaked by Edward Snowden and published by the Washington Post revealed that US intelligence agencies had been authorized to spy on the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (who was then the Chief Minister of Gujarat). WikiLeaks revelations that Western intelligence agencies have used foreign aid workers and staff at NGOs as non-official cover prompted the Government of India to step-up the monitoring of satellite phones and movement of personnel working for humanitarian relief organisations and development aid agencies in the vicinity of sensitive locations.  Foreign policy issues  According to some analysts, India‚ÄìU.S. relations have been strained over the Obama administration's approach to Pakistan and the handling of the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan. India's National Security Adviser, M.K. Narayanan, criticised the Obama administration for linking the Kashmir dispute to the instability in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and said that by doing so, President Obama was \\"barking up the wrong tree.\\" Foreign Policy in February 2009 also criticised Obama's approach to South Asia, saying that \\"India can be a part of the solution rather than part of the problem\\" in South Asia. It also suggested that India take a more proactive role in rebuilding Afghanistan, irrespective of the attitude of the Obama Administration. In a clear indication of growing rift between the two countries, India decided not to accept a US invitation to attend a conference on Afghanistan at the end of February 2009. Bloomberg has also reported that, since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the public mood in India has been to pressure Pakistan more aggressively to take actions against the culprits behind the terrorist attack, and that this might reflect on the upcoming Indian general elections in May 2009. Consequently, the Obama Administration may find itself at odds with India's rigid stance against terrorism. India and US governments have differed on a variety of regional issues ranging from India's cordial relations with Iran and Russia to foreign policy disagreements relating to Sri Lanka, Maldives, Myanmar and Bangladesh. Robert Blake, Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, dismissed any concerns over a rift with India regarding American AfPak policy. Calling India and the United States \\"natural allies\\", Blake said that the United States cannot afford to meet the strategic priorities in Pakistan and Afghanistan at \\"the expense of India\\". India criticised the Obama Administration's decision to limit H-1B (temporary) visas, and India's then External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee (later, the President of India until 2017) said that his country would oppose US \\"protectionism\\" at various international forums. India's Commerce Minister, Kamal Nath, said that India may move against Obama's outsourcing policies at the World Trade Organization.India may contest Obama's move against outsourcing in WTO However, the outsourcing advisory head of KPMG said that India had no reason to worry, since Obama's statements were directed against \\"outsourcing being carried out by manufacturing companies\\" and not outsourcing of IT-related services. In May 2009, Obama reiterated his anti-outsourcing views and criticised the current US tax policy \\"that says you should pay lower taxes if you create a job in Bangalore, India, than if you create one in Buffalo, New York.\\" However, during the US India Business Council meeting in June 2009, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton advocated for stronger economic ties between India and the United States. She also rebuked protectionist policies, saying that \\"[United States] will not use the global financial crisis as an excuse to fall back on protectionism. We hope India will work with us to create a more open, equitable set of opportunities for trade between our nations.\\"Remarks at U.S.-India Business Council's 34th Anniversary \\"Synergies Summit\\" President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Indian delegation at the U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue reception at the Department of State in Washington, D.C., 2010. In June 2010, the United States and India formally re-engaged the US-India Strategic Dialogue initiated under President Bush when a large delegation of high-ranking Indian officials, led by External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna, visited Washington, D.C. As leader of the US delegation, Secretary of State Clinton lauded India as \\"an indispensable partner and a trusted friend\\".https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33529.pdf President Obama appeared briefly at a United States Department of State reception to declare his firm belief that America's relationship with India \\"will be one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century.\\" The Strategic Dialogue produced a joint statement in which the two countries pledged to \\"deepen people-to-people, business-to-business, and government-to-government linkages ... for the mutual benefit of both countries and for the promotion of global peace, stability, economic growth and prosperity.\\" It outlined extensive bilateral initiatives in each of ten key areas: (1) advancing global security and countering terrorism, (2) disarmament and nonproliferation, (3) trade and economic relations, (4) high technology, (5) energy security, clean energy, and climate change, (6) agriculture, (7) education, (8) health, (9) science and technology, and (10) development. In November 2010, Obama became the second US President (after Richard Nixon in 1969) to undertake a visit to India in his first term in office. On 8 November, Obama also became the second US President (after Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959) to ever address a joint session of the Parliament of India. In a major policy shift, Obama declared US support for India's permanent membership on the UN Security Council. Calling the India‚ÄìU.S. relationship \\"a defining partnership of the 21st century\\", he also announced the removal of export control restrictions on several Indian companies, and concluded trade deals worth $10 billion, which are expected to create and/or support 50,000 jobs in the US. = Devyani Khobragade incident = In December 2013, Devyani Khobragade, the Deputy Consul General of India in New York, was arrested and accused by U.S. federal prosecutors of submitting false work visa documents for her housekeeper and paying the housekeeper \\"far less than the minimum legal wage.\\" The ensuing incident caused protests from the Indian government and a rift in India‚ÄìUnited States relations; Indians expressed outrage that Khobragade was strip-searched (a routine practice for all persons arrested by the U.S. Marshals Service) and held in the general inmate population. For example, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that Khobragade's treatment was \\"deplorable\\". India demanded an apology from the U.S. over her alleged \\"humiliation\\" and called for the charges to be dropped, which the U.S. declined to do. The Indian government retaliated for what it viewed as the mistreatment of its consular official by revoking the ID cards and other privileges of U.S. consular personnel and their families in India and removing security barriers in front of the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. The Indian government also blocked non- diplomats from using the American Community Support Association (ACSA) club and American Embassy Club in New Delhi, ordering these social clubs to cease all commercial activities benefiting non-diplomatic personnel by 16 January 2014. The ACSA club operates a bar, bowling alley, swimming pool, restaurant, video-rentals club, indoor gym and a beauty parlour within the embassy premises. Tax-free import clearances given to US diplomats and consular officials for importing food, alcohol and other domestic items were revoked with immediate effect. U.S. embassy vehicles and staff are no longer immune from penalties for traffic violations. American diplomats were asked to show work contracts of all domestic help (cooks, gardeners, drivers and security staff) employed within their households. Indian authorities also conducted an investigation into the American Embassy School. Khobragade was subject to prosecution at the time of her arrest because she had only consular immunity (which gives one immunity from prosecution only for acts committed in connection with official duties) and not the more extensive diplomatic immunity.Tara McKelvey, Who, What, Why: Does Devyani Khobragade have diplomatic immunity?, BBC News (December 19, 2013). After her arrest, the Indian government moved Khobragade to the Indian mission to the United Nations, upgrading her status and conferring diplomatic immunity on her; as a result, the federal indictment against Khobragade was dismissed in March 2014, although the door was left open to refiling of charges.Jonathan Stempel & Shyamantha Asokan, UPDATE 3-Indian diplomat in U.S. row wins indictment dismissal, Reuters (March 13, 2014). A new indictment was filed against Khobragade, but by that point she had left the country.New indictment filed against Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade in U.S. visa-fraud case, Washington Post (March 14, 2014). (In an effort to resolve the dispute, the U.S. State Department had told Khobragade to leave the country). Nancy J. Powell, the U.S. ambassador to India, resigned following the incident, which was widely seen by India \\"as fallout from the imbroglio.\\"Ellen Barry, India Tires of Diplomatic Rift Over Arrest of Devyani Khobragade, New York Times (December 20, 2014). Some commentators suggested that the incident and response could lead to wider damage in U.S.‚ÄìIndia relations. Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha called for the arrest of same-sex companions of US diplomats, citing the Supreme Court of India's upholding of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code whereby homosexuality is illegal in India. Former State Department legal advisor John Bellinger questioned whether the decision to arrest and detain Khobragade was \\"wise policy ... even if technically permissible\\" under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, while Robert D. Blackwill, the former U.S. ambassador to India from 2001 to 2003, said the incident was \\"stupid.\\" Nevertheless, within a year of the incident, U.S.-India relations were warming again, as U.S. President Obama visited India in January 2015. Speaking at Harvard Law School in 2014, U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Preet Bharara, in the Khobragade case, said: \\"(It was) not the crime of the century but a serious crime nonetheless, that is why the State Department opened the case, that is why the State Department investigated it. That is why career agents in the State Department asked career prosecutors in my office to approve criminal charges.\\" Bharara, who was born in India, said that he was upset by attacks on him in the Indian press. Khobragade was originally a highly sympathetic figure in India, as Indians viewed her arrest as an affront to national dignity. Opinions in India shifted, however, after Khobragade was the subject of two inquiries by the Indian government.Sandip Roy, Pick symbols of national pride carefully: What (mis)adventures of Khobragade has taught India, First Post (July 22, 2015). One internal investigation found that Khobragade had violated regulations \\"by failing to inform the government that her children had been issued American passports\\" and resulted in Khobragade being administratively disciplined; a second inquiry was held into Khobragade's series of interviews about the case, undertaken without authorization from the Ministry of External Affairs.  Relationship between US Government and Chief Minister of Gujarat Narendra Modi (2001‚Äì2014)  Narendra Modi, the Chief Minister of Gujarat between 2001 and 2014, became the Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014 after the Bharatiya Janata Party decisively won the 2014 Indian General Elections. The US Government completely failed to anticipate the political rise of Narendra Modi to the office of Prime Minister of India. Sectarian violence during the 2002 Gujarat riots damaged relations between the US Government and Narendra Modi, then incumbent Chief Minister of Gujarat. Human rights activists accused Modi of fostering anti-Muslim violence. New-York based NGO Human Rights Watch, in their 2002 report directly implicated Gujarat state officials in the violence against Muslims. In 2012, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the Indian Supreme Court found no \\"prosecutable evidence\\" against Modi. The Supreme Court of India absolved Narendra Modi of any criminal wrongdoing during the 2002 Gujarat riots. Prior to Narendra Modi becoming the Prime Minister of India, the US Government had made it known that Modi as Chief Minister of Gujarat would not be permitted to travel to the US. Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center opined that although technically speaking there was no US 'visa ban' from 2005 to 2014, the US government policy of considering Modi as persona non grata had resulted in a de facto travel-ban. After the US revoked his existing B1/B2 visa in 2005 and refused to accept his application for an A2 visa, the US State Department affirmed that the visa policy remained unchanged : \\"(Mr Modi) is welcome to apply for a visa and await a review like any other applicant\\". Exploring opportunities on how to move the relationship out of a state of morose, Lisa Curtis, senior research fellow for South Asia in the Asian Studies Center of the Heritage Foundation, says that \\"the U.S. must first signal its willingness and commitment to collaborating with the new government‚Äîand that it will not dwell on the controversy of the 2002 Gujarat riots, which led the U.S. to revoke Modi's visa in 2005.\\" On 11 June 2014, Robert Blackwill, the former Coordinator for Strategic Planning and Deputy US National Security Advisor during the presidency of George W. Bush, spoke at length about India‚ÄìU.S. relations and said : \\"Mr Modi is a determined leader. He is candid and frank. I also worked with him during the Gujarat earthquake when I was posted as (the US) ambassador to India. ... It was mistake by the current Obama administration to delay engagement with Mr Modi. I do not know why they did so but definitely, this did not help in building relationship. ... The old formula and stereotypes will not work if the US administration wants to engage with Mr Modi. The Indian prime minister is candid, direct and smart. He speaks his mind. The US administration also has to engage in candid conversation when Mr Modi meets President Obama later this year. They have to do something innovative to engage with him.\\" = 2005 denial of visa application and revocation of visa = In 2005, the US Department of State used a 1998 International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA) provision to revoke Modi's tourist/business visa citing section 212 (a) (2) (g) of the US Immigration and Nationality Act. The IRFA provision \\"makes any foreign government official who 'was responsible for or directly carried out, at any time, particularly severe violations of religious freedom' ineligible for a visa to the United States.\\" David C. Mulford, the US Ambassador to India from 2003 to 2009, justified the rejection of a diplomatic visa to Modi in a statement released on 21 March 2005 stating that the US State Department re-affirmed the original decision to revoke Modi's tourist/business visa to which India's highest judiciary abstained all the charges from Modi later on the particular issue: > This decision applies to Mr. Narendra Modi only. It is based on the fact > that, as head of the State government in Gujarat between February 2002 and > May 2002, he was responsible for the performance of state institutions at > that time. The State Department's detailed views on this matter are included > in its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and the > International Religious Freedom Report. Both reports document the violence > in Gujarat from February 2002 to May 2002 and cite the Indian National Human > Rights Commission report, which states there was \\"a comprehensive failure on > the part of the state government to control the persistent violation of > rights of life, liberty, equality, and dignity of the people of the state.\\" Modi remains the only person ever to be banned to travel to the United States of America under the International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA) provision of US Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) due to political interest. Robert Blackwill, former US ambassador to India opined: \\"I think it was a serious mistake on the part of the last (Bush) administration to do that (deny Modi a visa) and the current (Obama) administration to keep it in place ... all the way till the 2014 Indian elections\\". Blackwill highlighted the decision to deny Modi a visa as \\"absolutely unique\\" involving private political interest saying that the people who made the decision \\"thought, it's pretty safe, because, he's never going to be Prime Minister\\". Modi was found not guilty of the charges by India's judiciary. Nicholas Burns, former U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs from 2005 to 2008, has spoken about the visa denial by saying: \\"Bush administration officials, including me, believed this to be the right decision at the time.\\" and has opined that \\"Now that it looks like Modi will become prime minister, it's reasonable for the Obama administration to say it's been 12 years [since the 2002 riots], and we'll be happy to deal with him\\" = 2009 USCIRF visa black-list = In 2009, the US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) report after ignoring the views and decision of independent body (SIT) set up by India's highest judiciary vehemently alleged that there was \\"significant evidence\\" linking Narendra Modi to communal riots in the state in 2002 and asked the Obama administration to continue the policy of preventing him from travelling to the United States of America . The Obama administration maintained the 2005 decision taken by the George W. Bush administration to deny Narendra Modi entry into the United States of America. The US Government says that Modi can circumvent the USCIRF sanctions regime by visiting Washington on a Heads of government A1-visa as long as he is the Prime Minister of India. According to US State Department Spokesperson, Jen Psaki : \\"US law exempts foreign government officials, including heads of state and heads of government from certain potential inadmissibility grounds\\". The visa refusal came after some Indian-American groups and human rights organizations with political view campaigned against Modi, including the Coalition Against Genocide.  NDA government (2014‚Äìpresent)  At present, India and the US share an extensive and expanding cultural, strategic, military, and economic relationshipTeresita C. Schaffer, India and the United States in the 21st Century: Reinventing Partnership (2010) which is in the phase of implementing confidence building measures (CBM) to overcome the legacy of trust deficit ‚Äì brought about by adversarial US foreign policies and multiple instances of technology denial ‚Äì which have plagued the relationship over several decades. Unrealistic expectations after the conclusion of the 2008 U.S.‚ÄìIndia Civil Nuclear Agreement (which underestimated negative public opinion regarding the long- term viability of nuclear power generation and civil-society endorsement for contractual guarantees on safeguards and liability) has given way to pragmatic realism and refocus on areas of cooperation which enjoy favourable political and electoral consensus. Key recent developments include the rapid growth of India's economy, closer ties between the Indian and American industries especially in the Information and communications technology (ICT), engineering and medical sectors, an informal entente to manage an increasingly assertive China, robust cooperation on counter-terrorism, the deterioration of U.S.-Pakistan relations, easing of export controls over dual-use goods & technologies (99% of licenses applied for are now approved), and reversal of long-standing American opposition to India's strategic program. Income creation in the USA through knowledge-based employment by Asian Indians has outpaced every other ethnic group according to U.S. Census data. Growing financial and political clout of the affluent Asian Indian diaspora is noteworthy. Indian American households are the most prosperous in the US with a median revenue of US$100,000 and are followed by Chinese Americans at US$65,000. The average household revenue in the USA is US$63,000.https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/acs/acsbr18-01.pdf The US and India continue to differ on issues ranging from trade to civil liberties. The Indian Home Ministry, through an affidavit submitted to the Delhi High Court on 13 February 2015, claimed that Country Reports on Rights & Practices have become instruments of foreign policy: \\"The US, UK and EU have clearly mentioned in government documents and pronouncements that these reports are made for the purpose of their being used as instruments of foreign policy.\\" The affidavit also claimed that the reports by US, UK and European Parliament were biased since they \\"do not provide opportunity to the Government of India or the local embassy/high commission to record their opinion and are heavily biased against the targeted country\\". The 2014 State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report appeared to classify the Khobragade incident as an example of human trafficking, stating: \\"An Indian consular officer at the New York consulate was indicted in December 2013 for visa fraud related to her alleged exploitation of an Indian domestic worker.\\" In response, India has shown no urgency to allow visits to India by the newly appointed US anti-human trafficking ambassador Susan P. Coppedge and the US special envoy for LGBT rights Randy Berry. Under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code homosexuality was illegal in India. Indian Ambassador to the US, Arun K. Singh reiterated India's commitment to work within an international framework to tackle the problem of trafficking but rejected any \\"unilateral assessments\\" by another country saying \\"We will never accept it\\" and downplayed the importance of the visits: \\"When you ask a U.S. official when somebody will be given a visa, they always say 'we will assess when visa is applied for.' ... I can do no better than to reiterate the U.S. position.\\" In February 2016, the Obama administration notified the US Congress that it intended to provide Pakistan eight nuclear-capable F-16 fighters and assorted military goods including eight AN/APG-68(V)9 airborne radars and eight ALQ-211(V)9 electronic warfare suites despite strong reservations from US lawmakers regarding the transfer of any nuclear weapons capable platforms to Pakistan. Shashi Tharoor, an elected representative from the Congress party in India, questioned the substance of India‚ÄìU.S. ties: \\"I am very disappointed to hear this news. The truth is that continuing to escalate the quality of arms available to an irresponsible regime that has sent terrorists to India, and in the name of anti-terrorism, is cynicism of the highest order\\". The Indian Government summoned the US Ambassador to India to convey its disapproval regarding the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan. In February 2017, Indian ambassador to the U.S. Navtej Sarna hosted a reception for the National Governors Association (NGA), which was attended by the Governors of 25 states and senior representatives of 3 more states. This was the first time such an event has occurred. Explaining the reason for the gathering, Virginia Governor and NGA Chair Terry McAuliffe stated that \\"India is America's greatest strategic partner\\". He further added, \\"We clearly understand the strategic importance of India, of India‚ÄìU.S. relations. As we grow our 21st century economy, India has been so instrumental in helping us build our technology, medical professions. We recognise a country that has been such a close strategic ally of the US. That's why we the Governors are here tonight.\\" McAuliffe, who has visited India 15 times, also urged other Governors to visit the country with trade delegations to take advantage of opportunities.  Threat of sanctions against India  In October 2018, India inked the historic agreement worth US$5.43 billion with Russia to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence system, one of the most powerful missile defence systems in the world ignoring America's CAATSA act. The U.S. threatened India with sanctions over India's decision to buy the S-400 missile defense system from Russia. The United States also threatened India with sanctions over India's decision to buy oil from Iran. According to the President of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), Mukesh Aghi: \\"sanctions would have a disastrous effect on U.S.-India relations for decades to come. In India‚Äôs eyes, the United States would once again be regarded as untrustworthy.\\"  Relationship between U.S. Government and Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi (2014 onwards)  U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Namaste Trump rally in Ahmedabad, India on February 24, 2020 = Modi's visit to America, 2015 = During the run- off to the 2014 Indian general election, there was wide-ranging scepticism regarding the future of the India‚ÄìU.S. strategic relationship. Narendra Modi, whose US visa had been revoked while he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, had been boycotted by US officials for almost a decade for his alleged role in the 2002 Gujarat riots. However, sensing Modi's inevitable victory well before the election, the US Ambassabor Nancy Powell had reached out to him. Moreover, following his 2014 election as the Prime Minister of India President Obama congratulated him over telephone and invited him to visit the US. US Secretary of State John Kerry visited New Delhi on 1 August to prepare the grounds for Modi's first ever US visit as Prime Minister. In September 2014, days before visiting the US in an interview to CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Modi said that \\"India and the United States are bound together, by history and culture\\" but acknowledged that there have been \\"ups and downs\\" in relations. Modi travelled to US from 27‚Äì30 September 2014, beginning with his maiden address in the United Nations general assembly followed by attending a gala public reception by the Indian American community in New York's Madison Square Garden before heading Washington, D.C. for the bilateral talk with Obama. While there, Modi also met several American business leaders and invited them to join his ambitious Make in India program in a bid to make India a manufacturing hub. = Barack Obama's visit to India, 2015 = President Barack Obama became the first US president to be the chief guest of the 66th Republic Day celebrations of India held on 26 January 2015. India and the US held their first ever bilateral dialogue on the UN and multilateral issues in the spirit of the \\"Delhi Declaration of Friendship\\" that strengthens and expands the two countries' relationship as part of the Post-2015 Development Agenda. The conspicuous absence of major announcements, a key indicator of the state of US relations with the host country, led political commentators in both countries to highlight the confidence-building aspects of the visit = Modi's visit to America, 2015 = Prime Minister Narendra Modi toured the Silicon Valley and met with entrepreneurs ‚Äì several of whom are persons of Indian origin ‚Äì involved in successful microelectronics, digital communications and biotechnology start-ups to promote the NDA government's Make in India initiative. Modi left the U.S. West Coast and travelled to New York for the 2015 UN General Assembly meeting where he had bilateral discussions with US President Barack Obama. = Modi's visit to America, 2016 = Prime Minister Narendra Modi meeting President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, at the White House, in Washington DC, USA on June 07, 2016. Prime Minister Narendra Modi while visiting the United States addressed a joint session of Congress highlighting the common traits of both democracies and long-term friendship between the two countries. In a speech lasting more than 45 minutes, Mr. Modi drew on parallels between the two countries and addressed a variety of issues where the two countries have worked together in the past and where the future course of action would lie. = Modi's visit to America, 2017 = On June 26, 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the United States and met US President Donald Trump. On 8 November 2017, the US announced a grant of nearly US$500,000 for organisations which came up with ideas and projects to promote religious freedom in India and Sri Lanka. = Modi's visit to America, 2019 = In September 2019, Modi visited Houston and he addressed a large Indian American contingent in the Houston NRG stadium. Along with President Trump, he reaffirmed Indian American ties, with an emphasis on increased military cooperation with the initiation of the Tiger Triumph exercises. = Trump's visit to India, 2020 = PM Modi gifts exemplar of Mahatma Gandhi's three wise monkeys to President Trump On February 24, 2020, Trump visited Ahmedabad, Gujarat to address a large Indian crowd. The event, titled \\"Namaste Trump\\", was a response to the \\"Howdy Modi\\" event held in 2019. Attendance of over 100,000 people was reported. The event served as a platform for the U.S. president and the Indian prime minister to show off their friendly relationship. Trump also visited Agra, Uttar Pradesh and the Taj Mahal on the same day. In Agra, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath welcomed the President and the First Lady. There were 3000 cultural artists showcasing art, cultural & music of various regions. However, political commentators state that Trump's first official visit to India had been overshadowed by the 2020 North East Delhi riots. = Vandalization of Gandhi's statue in Washington, D.C. = In June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial in Washington, D.C. was vandalised by unknown miscreants on the intervening night of June 2 and 3. The incident prompted the Indian Embassy to register a complaint with law enforcement agencies. Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Indian Ambassador to the United States called the vandalism \\"a crime against humanity\\". U.S. President Donald Trump called the defacement of Mahatma Gandhi's statue a \\"disgrace\\".  Military relations  The U.S. has four \\"foundational\\" agreements that it signs with its defence partners. The Pentagon describes the agreements as \\"routine instruments that the U.S. uses to promote military cooperation with partner- nations\\". American officials have stated that the agreements are not prerequisites for bilateral defence co-operation, but would make it simpler and more cost-effective to carry out activities such as refueling aircraft or ships in each other's countries and providing disaster relief. The first of the four agreements, the General Security Of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), was signed by India and the U.S. in 2002. The agreement enables the sharing of military intelligence between the two countries and requires each country to protect the others' classified information. The second agreement, the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), was signed by the two countries on 29 August 2016. The LEMOA permits the military of either country to use the others' bases for re-supplying or carrying out repairs. The agreement does not make the provision of logistical support binding on either country, and requires individual clearance for each request. The third agreement, Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) was signed during the inaugural 2+2 dialogue in September 2018. It is an India- specific variant of Communications and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) that enables the two countries to share secure communication and exchange information on approved equipment during bilateral and multinational training exercises and operations. The fourth agreement, Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) has not yet been signed. It permits the exchange of unclassified and controlled unclassified geospatial products, topographical, nautical, and aeronautical data, products and services between India and the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Defence Minister Manohar Parikkar stated at the signing of the LEMOA that India would eventually sign the remaining agreements. Harsh V. Pant, professor of International relations at King's College London, highlighted the importance of India to US strategic planning by saying: \\"India is key to the US' ability to create a stable balance of power in the larger Indo-Pacific and at a time of resource constraints, it needs partners like India to shore up its sagging credibility in the region in face of Chinese onslaught.\\" Robert Boggs, professor of South Asia Studies at the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, opines that the US \\"overestimates both India's desire to improve the relationship and the benefits doing so would bring\\". As part of America's policies to counter China, http://www.atimes.com/article/us-woos- india-100-year-alliance-china/ one of the Trump administration policies are to make India as one of the major defence partners for which it is in talks with Indian representatives to sell highly technologically advanced predator drones. India has floated a tender to buy 100 multi role fighter aircraft in the Indian MRCA competition (also called Mother of all defence deals), worth around US$15 billion under Narendra Modi's Make in India initiative. Although the deal is yet to be finalised in 2018, Present USA Trump's administration is now pushing for sales of advanced F-16 jet fighters, and F/A-18 Super Hornet In a meeting between President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in November 2001, the two leaders expressed a strong interest in transforming the US-India bilateral relationship. High-level meetings and concrete cooperation between the two countries increased during 2002 and 2003. In January 2004, the US and India launched the \\"Next Steps in Strategic Partnership\\" (NSSP), which was both a milestone in the transformation of the bilateral relationship and a blueprint for its further progress. In July 2005, Bush hosted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Washington, D.C. The two leaders announced the successful completion of the NSSP, as well as other agreements which further enhanced cooperation in the areas of civil nuclear, civil space, and high-technology commerce. Other initiatives announced included a US-India economic dialogue, the fight Against HIV/AIDS, disaster relief, technology cooperation, an agriculture knowledge initiative, a trade policy forum, energy dialogue, CEO Forum, and an initiative to assist each other in furthering democracy and freedom. President Bush made a reciprocal visit to India in March 2006, during which the progress of these initiatives were reviewed, and new initiatives were launched. In June 2015, US defence secretary Ashton Carter visited India and became the first American defence secretary to visit an Indian military command. In December of the same year, Manohar Parrikar became the first Indian defence minister to visit the US Pacific Command. In March 2016, India rejected a proposal by the US to join naval patrols in the South China Sea alongside Japan and Australia. Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar said: \\"India has never taken part in any joint patrol; we only do joint exercises. The question of joint patrol does not arise.\\" In January 2017, Peter Lavoy, Senior Director for South Asian Affairs at the U.S. National Security Council, declared that the partnership between India and the United States under Barack Obama's administration had been \\"incredibly successful\\". Lavoy stated, \\"I can tell you quite definitively that due to our partnerships, several terrorism plots were foiled. Indian lives and American lives were saved because of this partnership.\\"  Nuclear cooperation  In late September 2001, President Bush lifted sanctions imposed under the terms of the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act following India's nuclear tests in May 1998. A succession of non-proliferation dialogues bridged many of the gaps in understanding between the countries. In December 2006, the US Congress passed the historic India‚ÄìUnited States Civilian Nuclear Agreement|Henry J. Hyde US‚ÄìIndia Peaceful Atomic Cooperation Act, which allows direct civilian nuclear commerce with India for the first time in 30 years. US policy had been opposed to nuclear cooperation with India in prior years because India had developed nuclear weapons against international conventions, and had never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NNPT). The legislation clears the way for India to buy US nuclear reactors and fuel for civilian use. The India‚ÄìUnited States Civil Nuclear Agreement also referred to as the \\"123 Agreement\\", signed on 10 October 2008 is a bilateral agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation which governs civil nuclear trade between American and Indian firms to participate in each other's civil nuclear energy sector. Schaffer, India and the United States (2010) pp 89-117 For the agreement to be operational, nuclear vendors and operators must comply with India's 2010 Nuclear Liability Act which stipulates that nuclear suppliers, contractors and operators must bear financial responsibility in case of an accident. Prominent industrial accidents (1984 Bhopal chemical-gas disaster and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster) have led to greater scrutiny by civil society into corporate responsibility and financial liability obligations of vendors and operators of critical infrastructure. In 2010, the Indian Parliament voted to pass the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act to address concerns and provide civil liability for nuclear damage and prompt compensation to the victims of a nuclear incident. On 27 March 2019, India and the US signed an agreement to \\"strengthen bilateral security and civil nuclear cooperation\\" including the construction of six American nuclear reactors in India. Pokhran tests reaction In 1998, India tested nuclear weapons which resulted in several US, Japanese and European sanctions on India. India's then defence minister, George Fernandes, said that India's nuclear programme was necessary as it provided a deterrence to some potential nuclear threat. Most of the sanctions imposed on India were removed by 2001. India has categorically stated that it will never use weapons first but will defend if attacked. The economic sanctions imposed by the United States in response to India's nuclear tests in May 1998 appeared, at least initially, to seriously damage Indo-American relations. President Bill Clinton imposed wide-ranging sanctions pursuant to the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act. US sanctions on Indian entities involved in the nuclear industry and opposition to international financial institution loans for non-humanitarian assistance projects in India. The United States encouraged India to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) immediately and without condition. The United States also called for restraint in missile and nuclear testing and deployment by both India and Pakistan. The non-proliferation dialogue initiated after the 1998 nuclear tests has bridged many of the gaps in understanding between the countries. Post‚ÄìSeptember 11 India's contribution to the War on Terror has helped India's diplomatic relations with several countries. Over the past few years, India has held numerous joint military exercises with United States and European nations that have resulted in a strengthened US-India and EU-India bilateral relationship. India's bilateral trade with Europe and US has more than doubled in the last five years. However, India has not signed the CTBT, or the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty, claiming the discriminatory nature of the treaty that allows the five declared nuclear countries of the world to keep their nuclear arsenal and develop it using computer simulation testing. Prior to its nuclear testing, India had pressed for a comprehensive destruction of nuclear weapons by all countries of the world in a time-bound frame. This was not favoured by the United States and by certain other countries. Presently, India has declared its policy of \\"no-first use of nuclear weapons\\" and the maintenance of a \\"credible nuclear deterrence\\". The USA, under President George W. Bush has also lifted most of its sanctions on India and has resumed military co- operation. Relations with USA have considerably improved in the recent years, with the two countries taking part in joint naval exercises off the coast of India and joint air exercises both in India as well as in the United States.Indian Troops training with U.S. Army in Hawaii,signonsandiego.comAir Force personnel fly with Indian Air Force , pacaf.af.milIndian Soldiers with U.S. Marines, Sailors, navy.mil India has been pushing for reforms in the United Nations and in the World Trade Organization with mixed results. India's candidature for a permanent seat at the UN Security Council is currently backed by several countries including Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Brazil, African Union nations, United States (but not China). In 2005, the United States signed a nuclear co-operation agreement with India even though the latter is not a part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The United States agreed that India's strong nuclear non-proliferation record made it an exception and persuaded other Nuclear Suppliers Group members to sign similar deals with India. On 2 March 2006 India and the United States signed the Indo-US Nuclear Pact on co-operation in civilian nuclear field. This was signed during the four days state visit of USA President George Bush in India. On its part, India would separate its civilian and military nuclear programmes, and the civilian programmes would be brought under the safeguards of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The United States would sell India the reactor technologies and the nuclear fuel for setting up and upgrading its civilian nuclear programme. The US Congress needs to ratify this pact since US federal law prohibits the trading of nuclear technologies and materials outside the framework of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).  Economic relations  The United States is one of India's largest direct investors. From 1991 to 2004, the stock of FDI inflow has increased from US$11 million to $344.4 million, and totaling $4.13 billion. This is a compound rate increase of 57.5 percent annually. Indian direct investments abroad began in 1992, and Indian corporations and registered partnership firms are now allowed to invest in businesses up to 100 percent of their net worth. India's largest outgoing investments are in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 54.8 percent of the country's foreign investments. The second largest are in non- financial services (software development), accounting for 35.4 percent of investments. On 3 August 2018, India became the third Asian nation to be granted Strategic Trade Authorization-1 (STA-1) status by the United States. STA-1 enables the export of high-technology products in civil space and defence from the US to India.  Trade relations  U.S. President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during a meeting with Indian and American business leaders in New Delhi. The US is India's second largest trading partner, and India is its 9th largest trading partner. In 2017, the US exported $25.7 billion worth of goods to India, and imported $48.6 billion worth of Indian goods. Major items imported from India include information technology services, textiles, machinery, gems and diamonds, chemicals, iron and steel products, coffee, tea, and other edible food products. Major American items imported by India include aircraft, fertilisers, computer hardware, scrap metal, and medical equipment. The United States is also India's largest investment partner, with a direct investment of $10 billion (accounting for 9 percent of total foreign investment). Americans have made notable foreign investments in the Asian country's power generation, telecommunications, ports, roads, petroleum exploration and processing, and mining industries. American imports from India amounted to $46.6 billion or 2% of its overall imports, and 15.3% of India's overall exports in 2015. The 10 major commodities exported from India to the US were: # Gems, precious metals and coins ($9.5 billion) # Pharmaceuticals ($6.1 billion) # Oil ($2.8 billion) # Machinery: $2.5 billion # Other textiles, worn clothing: $2.5 billion # Clothing (not knit or crochet): $2.2 billion # Organic chemicals: $2.1 billion # Knit or crochet clothing: $1.7 billion # Vehicles: $1.4 billion # Iron or steel products: $1.3 billion US Food and Drug Administration and Indian Export Inspection Council officials review memorandum of understanding on food safety in 2015 American exports to India amounted to $20.5 billion or 5.2% of India's overall imports in 2015. The 10 major commodities exported from the US to India were: # Gems, precious metals and coins ($3.4 billion) # Machinery: $3 billion # Electronic equipment: $1.6 billion # Medical, technical equipment: $1.4 billion # Oil: $1.3 billion # Aircraft, spacecraft: $1.1 billion # Plastics: $815.9 million # Organic chemicals: $799.4 million # Other chemical goods: $769.1 million # Fruits, nuts: $684.7 million In July 2005, President Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh created a new programme called the Trade Policy Forum. It is run by a representative from each nation. The United States Trade Representative was Rob Portman, and the Indian Commerce Secretary then-Minister of Commerce Kamal Nath. The goal of the programme is to increase bilateral trade and investment flow. There are five main sub-divisions of the Trade Policy Forum, including: *The Agricultural Trade group has three main objectives: agreeing on terms that will allow India to export mangoes to the United States, permitting India's Agricultural and Process Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) to certify Indian products to the standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and executing regulation procedures for approving edible wax on fruit. *The goals of the Tariff and Non-Tariff Barriers group include agreeing that insecticides manufactured by US companies can be sold throughout India. India had also agreed to cut special regulations on trading carbonated drinks, many medicinal drugs, and lowering regulations on many imports that are not of an agricultural nature. Both nations have agreed to discuss improved facets of Indian regulation in the trade of jewellery, computer parts, motorcycles, fertiliser, and those tariffs that affect American exporting of boric acid. The group has also discussed matters such as those wishing to break into the accounting market, Indian companies gaining licenses for the telecommunications industry, and setting policies regarding Indian media and broadcasting markets. Other foci include the exchange of valuable information on recognizing different professional services, discussing the movement and positioning of people in developing industries, continuation of talks on financial services markets, limitation of equities, insurance, retail, joint investment in agricultural processing and transportation industries, and small business initiatives. Indo-US strategic partnership Prime Minister Narendra Modi with President Barack Obama at the White House. Indo-USA relations got strategic content in the early 1960s. The rise of the People's Republic of China worried the policymakers in Washington. Chinese assertion in Tibet, its role in the Korean War and other such acts concerned Washington. As the relations between India and China were heated during the late fifties, the Americans found a golden opportunity to take advantage of this situation to promote India as a counterweight to China. But any unidimensional alliance is bound to be short- lived and this alliance was no exception to this general rule. As China ceased to be a headache for the American policymakers by the late sixties, this unidimensional alliance disappeared into thin air. After the end of the Cold War, Indian and American interests converged in a number of areas, including counter-terrorism, promotion of democracy, counter-proliferation, freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean, and the balance of power in Asia. US and Indian Army soldiers during the opening ceremony of 'Yudh Abhyas' military exercise, 2015 As the world's oldest and largest democracies, respectively, the U.S. and India share historic ties.U.S. and India: World's Oldest and Largest Democracies Share Historical Ties India is a founding member of the \\"Community of Democracies\\"‚Äîa prominent endeavour of the United States on promotion of democracy. However, India rejected the suggestion of the USA about setting up a Centre for Asian Democracy. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was the guest of honour at the first state dinner, which took place on 24 November 2009, of the administration of US President Barack Obama. Obama later visited India from 6‚Äì9 November 2010, signing numerous trade and defence agreements with India. He addressed the joint session of the Indian parliament in New Delhi, becoming only the second US President to do so, and announced that the United States would lend its support to India's bid for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council, signifying the growing strategic dimension of the relationship between the world's two largest democracies.

He was the Royal Governor of the Captaincy General of Chile from December 28, 1755 to September 9, 1761, and Viceroy of Peru from October 12, 1761 to July 17, 1776.Most of this article is a loose translation of the Spanish Wikipedia article, accessed on September 26, 2006 Origins and military career Felipe Manuel Cayetano de Amat y de Junyent was born in March 1707 in Vacarisses (Province of Barcelona), into an aristocratic Catalan family. His father was Jos√© de Amat y de Planella, Marquis de Castellbell, and his mother was Mariana de Junyent y de Verg√≥s, daughter of the Marquis de Castellmei√†. He entered the army at a young age. In 1719 he saw hostile action against the French in Aragon. At the age of 17 he joined the Order of Malta and went to the island, where he remained four years. He later served in the wars in northern Africa, and obtained the command of a regiment of dragoons. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Bitonto in the Kingdom of Naples (May 25, 1734). There he served with the contingent under the command of the Carrillo de Albornoz, Duke of Montemar that defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Bitonto in the War of the Polish Succession. He also stood out in the siege of Gaeta later in 1734. He was promoted to field marshal. Royal Governor of Chile In 1755 Felipe Cayetano de Amat y de Junyent was sent to South America, as Royal Governor of the Captaincy General and president of the Audiencia Real of Chile. He traveled throughout colonial Chile, and ordered the construction of fortifications on the coast and along the frontier with the Mapuche people (for example, Santa B√°rbara). He founded the towns of Talcam√°vida, Hualqui and Nacimiento, among others. He entered negotiations with the Mapuches, the first time in Salto del Laja in 1758, and another time in Santiago de Chile in February 1760. His goal was to guarantee the security of communications between Concepci√≥n and Chilo√©, but he was only partly successful. In Santiago he began important public works and administrative tasks, including improvements to bridges over the R√≠o Mapocho, a market in the Plaza de Armas, and the reform of the Royal University of San Felipe (1757). On October 12, 1758 he established the first police force in Chile, called the Dragones de la Reina (Dragoons of the Queen). This name was retained until the independence of Chile. In 1812 the force was renamed the Dragones de Chile. Amat asked for and got a juicio de residencia (trial of grievances). The outcome was in his favor. Viceroy of Peru On October 12, 1761 Amat succeeded Jos√© Manso de Velasco, 1st Count of Superunda as Viceroy of Peru. He was followed by Manuel de Guirior, Marqu√©s de Guirior on July 17, 1776. In September 1767, he executed the expulsion of the Jesuits missionaries from the Viceroyalty of Peru, following orders from the Crown. He established the first Regulation of Commerce and Organization of Customs rules, which led to the building of the customshouse in Callao. He had the fortress of Real Felipe constructed in Callao, being finished in 1774. He founded the Royal College of San Carlos. He constructed various public works in Lima. Probably the most famous are the Alameda de los Descalzos and the Paseo de Aguas, in the district of R√≠mac. He also remodeled the Alameda de Acho. Also under his administration, the Plaza de Toros de Acho, the world's third oldest surviving bull ring, was built by Agustin de Landaburu. It was the first bull ring in Peru, and opened with a corrida and a great celebration on February 22, 1762. Tradition says the Paseo de Aguas was built in honor of Amat's mistress, the actress Micaela Villegas, better known as La Perricholi, a Mestiza woman. The story is that when the viceroy asked her to become his mistress, she replied that she would when he laid the moon at her feet. Amat y Junient then ordered the construction of the Paseo de Aguas in front of her house. It is an aqueduct from the R√≠mac River with a fountain and a long, narrow reflecting pool, with a promenade along the sides of the pool. The night of the following full moon, he invited her to view it with him. La Perricholi's life inspired painters, writers and musicians. It provided the basis for the Prosper M√©rim√©e comic novella Le Carrosse du Saint-Sacrement, which in turn was the basis for both the Jacques Offenbach op√©ra bouffe La P√©richole and the Jean Renoir 1953 film Le Carrosse d'or (The Golden Coach). She and the viceroy are also prominent characters in the Thornton Wilder novel The Bridge of San Luis Rey. Expeditions To avoid the establishment of foreign bases from which attacks could be launched on Peru, Amat organized an expedition under the command of Domingo de Bonechea to Tahiti, which arrived just after that of Captain Cook, but in time to explore other islands in the group which Cook had not discovered. In subsequent voyages ordered by Amat, de Bonechea was the first European to explore most of French Polynesia. Amat also sent an expedition under Juan Antonio de Buenechea to search for the doomed ship Oriflama, piloted by his kinsman Manuel de Buenechea. Last Days Between 1772 and 1778, Amat had built the Virreina Palace, in the city of Barcelona. The palace still stands on Barcelona's famous La Rambla, where it hosts various temporary art exhibitions and cultural events. Amat returned home to Barcelona and his new palace on October 22, 1777. His only marriage was to Mar√≠a Francisca de Fivaller y de Bru in June 1779. He was 72 years old, and she 24. Felipe Manuel Cayetano de Amat y de Junyent died in Barcelona on February 14, 1782. His widow died on October 3, 1791. Amat had no legitimate children.

As a member of several political parties, Newin and his allies eventually joined the Thai Rak Thai Party of Thaksin Shinawatra in 2005. Prior to the 2006 Thai coup d'√©tat, he served as a member of the Parliament for Buriram Province and was a Cabinet minister with the Thai Rak Thai party. From 2002 to 2005, he was Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives. Following the 2006 Thai coup d'√©tat and the subsequent dissolution of Thai Rak Thai for corruption, Newin and his friends, mostly members of the National Assembly from the south of Isan (the northeastern region), shifted from the ruling (now also dissolved) People Power Party (PPP) to the opposition Democrat Party during the 2008 Thai political crisis. He is the leader of the so-called \\"Friends of Newin Group\\", now known as the Bhumjaithai Party. Consequently, a Democrat Party led coalition gained the majority in the National Assembly. Abhisit Vejjajiva, the Democrat Party's leader, was elected by a majority of the Parliament to be the new prime minister in December 2008. During the political tension in April 2009 caused by pro-Thaksin groups widely known as the Red Shirts, Newin publicly blasted Thaksin, his former 'boss', as the root of the political tension due to his 'doubts' of Thaksin's loyalty towards the monarchy and the current political system of the kingdom. Previously in 2008, Newin had wept with Thaksin when the former PM kissed the tarmac at Suvarnabhumi airport after returning to Thailand after a self-imposed exile. Newin was named after the Burmese leader Ne Win. He comes from a Thai Khmer family. Many of his ancestors were elephant drivers (mahouts). Education Niwin graduated grade 7 from Trai Kham School and went on to complete secondary education from Suankularb Wittayalai School. He have famous classmates such as Watana Muangsook, Wira Somkhid, Somchai Srisutthiyakon and Somsak Jeamteerasakul. Later, continuing to complete his diploma in Community Development Program from Buriram Rajabhat Institute in 1987 and graduated in bachelor's degree of Agriculture and Cooperative Promotion Program from Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University. In addition, he received an honorary degree in public administration from the Pacific Western University, Western Hawaii, USA.  Crimes and punishments  On 19 June 1998, the Buriram Provincial Court handed Newin a suspended six-month jail sentence and a ‡∏ø50,000 fine in a vote-buying slander case filed by Democrat MP Karun Sai-ngam. A year later, the Constitutional Court ruled 7-6 that Newin could keep his ministerial post. Newin was acquitted in 2009 of involvement in the rubber sapling scandal for bid rigging, corruption and collusion. In 2007 Newin was banned from politics for five years for being an executive of the disbanded Thai Rak Thai Party, however he continues to be active in politics despite the ban, famously engineering a coalition government with his group and the Democrat Party.  Later life  In December 2009, it was announced Newin take over PEA F.C. and rename in Buriram PEA F.C until 2012 to rename again Buriram United F.C.

It is located at the southwest corner of State Route 3 and Ridgewood Drive in southern Cuyahoga County. It is anchored by J.C. Penney, Walmart, and Dick's Sporting Goods. The plaza opened as a shopping plaza in 1956 and was enclosed in the mid-1960s and has become an outdoor plaza once again. Its original anchors were Higbee's (1967) and May Company (1960). Higbee's became Dillard's in 1992, and closed in 2000. The old Higbee's structure was demolished and replaced with a new Walmart in 2004. May Company became Kaufmann's in 1993 and Kaufmann's became Macy's in 2006. A Kresge also served as a fourth anchor store until it was closed in the early 1980s to make way for an expansion. Parts of the original plaza remain open-air, with Chuck E. Cheese's and Marc's as major tenants. The mall was renovated in the early 2000s and was renovated to be an outdoor shopping center in 2017, with the interior demolished. From 1967 to 2004, a five-screen cinema operated in the Dillard's wing of the mall. General Cinema opened the Parmatown Theater with two screens, which was unheard of at the time. A third screen opened in the 1970s, along with two more in the 1980s. General Cinema closed the theater in 2001. A year later, a chain known as Cinema Grill leased the theater, renovated the front lobby, and made modifications to allow customers to eat meals while watching movies. When Cinema Grill was evicted due to lack of rent payments, Cleveland Cinemas stepped in and took over. In August 2004, Cleveland Cinemas was asked to leave the mall to allow a Dick's Sporting Goods to be built in its spot.http://blog.cleveland.com/screeningroom/2007/10/from_the_archive_parmatown_clo.html Its last day of operation was August 11, 2004.

The reconstruction/renovation of the shopping center began during the summer of 2013. In 2014, Dick's Sporting Goods announced that in order for the 2017 mall replacement project to work, they would relocate their Parmatown store to the former Macy's spot. The original space was closed and demolition started in July 2015. On August 13, 2018, it was announced that Burlington would be filling the space left by the bankrupt Gordman's.

History Euclid Square Mall was developed by Jacobs, Visconsi & Jacobs; it opened in March 1977 on the site of a former Chase Brass & Copper Co. tubing mill. Originally, the mall comprised more than ninety-two inline tenants, with May Co. and Higbee's as its anchor stores. Higbee's was acquired by Dillard's in 1992.

The Dollar Bank parcel was torn down in 2014. The other 4 outparcels are either vacant or functioning as storage facilities by the current owner. In 1997, expansion plans were announced for a new Kaufmann's to open at Richmond Town Square, another nearby mall. These plans caused rumors that the Kaufmann's at Euclid Square would close, and by 1998, the Kaufmann's at Euclid Square was closed.

In early 2004, a collection of outlet vendors known as Outlets USA moved into the former Kaufmann's space. Outlets USA was shuttered in 2006, as the mall's owner thought that the outlet vendors were not \\"a good blend of merchants and tenants\\". A proposal was made in late 2006 to include the largely vacant mall property as part of a reconstruction of an abandoned industrial park located nearby. By July 2013 the building housed 24 churches. In September 2013 Dillard's Clearance Center closed when the store's lease ended. The city of Euclid ordered the mall closed in the autumn of 2016 \\"due to safety concerns\\". What the ‚Äúsafety concern‚Äù was is that this mall had several vast leaks. The churches located in the mall attempted to raise money to fix the leaks, but they unfortunately failed. In September 2017 Amazon announced plans to build a fulfillment center on the site of the mall, with an expected opening date of 2019.

It closed to passengers on Monday 18 January 1965. Bala Junction was unusual in that it was inaccessible by road and merely served as an interchange station; it was located about ¬æ mile to the south-east of the town of Bala. The station was at the junction with the Blaenau Ffestiniog branch. It was built as a crossing point for trains on the Bala Ffestiniog and Ruabon Barmouth lines, and featured three platforms with a small waiting room and signalbox on a central island platform. There was also a cast-iron GWR water tank. History Opened by the Great Western Railway, it remained in that company through the Grouping of 1923. The station passed to the Western Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. Passenger services to Bala and on the Ruabon-Barmouth line ceased in January 1965; the service beyond Bala to Blaenau Festiniog having been withdrawn in 1960. During its operational life, Bala Junction served as an interchange station for the branch line train to Blaenau Festiniog, usually operated by small tank locomotives such as the 6400 Class 0-6-0PT and 5800 Class 0-4-2T tank locomotives. These trains did not run beyond Bala Junction, instead returning north to the GWR station at Blaenau Festiniog. There were no goods facilities here either; all goods trains stopped to shunt detached wagons for the branch line train. As a junction station, Bala Junction was equipped with standard GWR lower quadrant semaphore signals to control train movements between the Bala Ffestiniog and Ruabon-Barmouth lines. These were used particularly when the branch line train was shunting in preparation for its return to Blaenau Festiniog as there were no turning facilities here. To run around, the branch line engine had to cross from Platform 3 (the Bala Ffestiniog platform) onto the main line and run back along Platform 2, used by eastbound trains running to Ruabon. As of 2014, the only remnants at Bala Junction are the trackbeds of the Bala Ffestiniog and Ruabon-Barmouth lines and the platform faces. The site is close to a nearby dam; part of the access road for this uses the formation of the Bala Ffestiniog line, passing close to the remains of a short bridge that carried the line into Bala Junction itself.

It is a parasite of the Black Rhinoceros and the White Rhinoceros. Because the fly depends on the rhinoceros for reproduction, its numbers declined steeply as the black and white rhinos faced extinction. Like the rhinoceros, it must once have spread across much of sub- Saharan Africa (outside of the Congo Basin), but is today restricted to the savannas of southern and eastern Africa.  Taxonomy  The fly was originally described by English naturalist Sir Richard Owen in 1830 under the name of Oestrus rhinocerontis.Neal L. Evenhuis. 2012. Sir Richard Owen‚Äôs fly, Gyrostigma rhinocerontis (Diptera: Oestridae): correction of the authorship and date, with a list of animal names newly proposed by Owen in his little- known 1830 catalogue. Zootaxa 3501:74-82. The description was made from larvae within the stomach of a rhinoceros. A fuller explanation was given by Fritz Konrad Ernst Zumpt in the mid-20th century. Despite being known for a long time, little is known about some aspects of their life, because they are difficult to observe in the wild as well as to breed in captivity. Only a few large museums have a specimen. Life cycle Like other botflies, the adult lays eggs on the host animal, in this case, near the horn of the rhinoceros or elsewhere on the head. The eggs are oblong and white. The eggs hatch after about six days, and the larvae, about 0.1 inch long, burrow inside, and attach themselves to the stomach wall by spines and mouth-hooks. It feeds on the blood and tissue of the rhinoceros. The larvae pass through three instars (developmental stages) while attached to the stomach. In the first instar, they are colored dark pink and are buried deep within mucosal folds of the stomach lining. In the second instar, the larvae are about 0.8 inches long, a paler shade of pink, and their spikes are more prominent. At this point only their front ends are imbedded into the folds. In the third instar, the larvae reach adult size, and are whitish to yellow with irregular brown spots. Their spikes form bands three or four rows wide. Rhinoceroses have been observed with large quantities of larvae in various stages. When it is ready to pupate, it leaves the rhinoceros through the anus. The pupa are not, however, found within dung piles, so they either leave independently or burrow into the ground immediately after defecation. Pupation lasts six weeks, after which the adult fly emerges. The largest adults can reach 1.6 inches in length and have a wingspan of 2.8 inches. They resemble a black wasp with an orange-red head and legs. The wings are brown to black, and are long enough that at rest they run nearly the entire length of the body. Their mouthparts are rudimentary, and they probably do not eat at all as adults. The evidence is conflicting on what time of day they are active. David A. Barraclough believes that females are active during the day, when eggs are to be deposited on the hosts, while males are active at dawn and dusk, when mating occurs. The flies are airborne for only three to five days before expiring.  References  * Barraclough, David A. \\"Bushels of Bots\\". In Natural History, June 2006.

It closed to passengers ahead of the scheduled closure date of Monday 18 January 1965 because of flooding by the River Dee which breached the line near Llandderfel on 14 December 1964. This section of the line was never re-opened. The station had a signal box and was a passing place on the single line. Today, no trace of the station buildings exist; however, the flight of steps that leads from the road overbridge down to where the platforms once were are still in situ, along with a small section of overgrown \\"up\\" platform a few yards up from the steps. According to the Official Handbook of Stations the following classes of traffic were being handled at this station in 1956: G, P, F, L, H & C but there was no crane.1956, Official Handbook of Stations, British Transport Commission Pale Hall Llandderfel was the next station down the line from Llandrillo but was more notable since it was situated adjacent to Pale Hall, the one time home of Sir Henry Robertson, Chairman of the original railway companies which built the line. Pale Hall had a telephone link with the signal box. On 27 August 1889 the station was visited by Queen Victoria who arrived in the Royal Train and was entertained at Pale Hall. Crogen Hall Halt There was at one time a small unmanned halt between Llandrillo and Llandderfel which did not feature in the public timetables. This was Crogen Hall Halt, a private station built for the benefit of residents of the nearby Crogen Hall which at one time was occupied by Brigadier Skaife. The halt was on the other side of the River Dee from Crogen Hall so access was via a ferry. The Halt was probably opened in the 1920s but closed again a decade later. The platform is still extant under vegetation.

Born 2 August 1865 at ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland, son of Pavel Radecki, coalminer, and his wife Victoria, n√©e Bednarkiewicz. Jan trained at a German art school at Pozna≈Ñ. With his parents and four siblings he migrated to Australia, reaching Sydney in January 1882. The family settled at Wollongong, New South Wales, where his father and he worked in the coalmines. His parents had two more children in Australia. Moving to Sydney in 1883, Jan attended art classes. He boarded with the Saunders family from England at Oxford Street, Paddington, and on 17 May 1888 married their daughter Emma at the local district registrar's office. Living at Hurstville, John (as he was now known) was naturalized in November 1904 according to the Australian Naturalization Act of 1903. From 1885 Radecki had been employed by Frederick Ashwin, who taught him to work with glass. In the 1890s the two men had crafted stained-glass windows entitled 'Sermon on the Mount' (St Paul's Church, Cobbitty) and 'Nativity' (St Jude's, Randwick). Other works included a window at Yanco Agricultural College, produced in 1902 by F. Ashwin & Co. reputedly to Radecki's design, and the chancel window (1903) in St Clement's, Mosman. His first, major independent work was the 'Te Deum' window in Christ Church St Laurence, Sydney, in 1906. Ashwin and Radecki also collaborated on windows in St James's, Forest Lodge, and St John's, Campbelltown. Following Ashwin's death in 1909, Radecki became chief designer for J. Ashwin & Co, in partnership with Frederick's brother John; he was proprietor of the company from John Ashwin's death in 1920 until 1954. The largest glassmaking establishment in Sydney, with a high reputation, the firm created the chapel windows for St Scholastica's Convent, Glebe, in the early 1930s. Radecki's work included windows in such churches as St John the Evangelist's, Campbelltown, St Patrick's, Kogarah, St Joseph's, Rockdale, St Matthew's, Manly, and Our Lady of Dolours', North Goulburn, Scots Kirk, Hamilton, Newcastle, and the Presbyterian Church, Wollongong. A church committee-member during the building in 1928 of St Declan's Catholic Church, Penshurst, Radecki designed, produced and donated the stained-glass windows there, including a memorial window dedicated to his wife, who had died in 1919. On 8 January 1921 at the Church of Christ, Hurstville, Radecki married Sydney-born Jean Hughes (d.1944). During the 1920s J. Ashwin & Co. produced the stained glass for the impressive, vaulted ceiling of what became the Commonwealth Savings Bank in Martin Place to designs by Radecki. These had an Australian character, illustrating 'the basic sources of wealth': sheep and cattle grazing, agriculture, mining, shipping and building; stockmen, carpenters, gold panning, farming and wharf labourers were shown alongside a typical banking scene. A window for the reading room of the Mitchell Library, signed 'John Radecki, Sydney 1941', depicted the printer William Caxton with the first book printed in English. Radecki's strengths were a natural aptitude for figure drawing and composition, an eye for colour, which he used as a compositional device, an outstanding knowledge of his medium and facility with techniques in glass painting. His recreational passion was playing chess. He died on 10 May 1955 in his home at Hurstville, and was buried with Catholic rites in Woronora cemetery. The six daughters and three sons of his first marriage survived him. His daughter Winifred Siedlecky continued the company until the building's owners demolished the premises in Dixon Street in 1961.

Her most notable body of work involves highly layered embroidered paintings of women's bodies referencing pornographic imagery. Amer had previously emigrated from Egypt to France at the age of 11 and was educated in Paris and Nice. She is currently living and working in New York City.  Early life and education  Amer was born in Cairo, Egypt she has lived in France for twenty years, and doesn't consider herself singularly Egyptian, African or French. When she was growing up in Cairo, her mother, an agronomist, made business suits for herself, and local women would often gather to sew. Amer's father, Mohamed Amer, was a diplomat and moved the family many times, not only to France but to such countries as Libya, Morocco and Algeria. For her, this exposure to different cultures are ultimately the most important biographical details needed to understand her art. Amer's art practice began in a fascination with sentimental, romantic postcards and illustrations. Her favored theme remains idyllic images of women in love. After having total art freedom in Egypt, Amer decided to become an artist after experiencing what it is like to have your art controlled. ‚ÄòWe had to learn perspective, representation, and it was completely controlled,‚ÄôMaura Reilly, ‚ÄúD as in Drips: A Conversation with Ghada Amer,‚Äù Ghada Amer, exhibition catalogue (New York: Cheim & Reid, 2010). Ghada stated in an interview. Amer studied at the Villa Arson √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d‚ÄôArt in Nice, France where she received her B.F.A. degree in painting in 1986 and in 1989, she received her M.F.A. degree from the same institution. She met Iranian artist Reza Farkhondeh while studying in France, they became friends and later worked together. While receiving her degrees, Amer studied abroad at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts in Boston, Massachusetts in 1987. She also studied at Institut des hautes √©tudes en arts plastiques for some time as well. In 1996, Amer and Farkhondeh moved to New York City. Work A multimedia artist, Amer is known for her abstract canvases that combine painting with needlework. Her work frequently addresses issues of femininity, sexuality, postcolonial identities, and Islamic culture. She is most famous for her large-scale paintings wherein embroidered images of women in autoerotic poses (traced from porn magazines) are layered over abstract monochromatic drips and washes of acrylic paint. As a student in the BFA and MFA programs, she was informed that her art school's painting classes were reserved for male students, at which point she became committed to finding her own feminine artistic language with which to speak about women, as a woman. ‚ÄúIt was then that, suddenly, I realized I was a woman. I decided to speak about this ‚Äì and to make painting at the same time. This is what I‚Äôm doing. It‚Äôs painting with the conscience that I‚Äôm a woman.‚Äô Innovative and provocative, she used sewing and embroidery‚Äîskills learned from her mother and grandmother and typically associated as \\"women's work\\"‚Äîas a medium for celebrating and asserting women into the art world. Amer's approach to mediums and subjects from an emphatically female perspective manifest itself throughout her career. She specifically looks for women who are posing erotically and/or involved in explicit pornographic acts. Once she makes her selection, she traces the women onto Vellum paper with pencil for future use, when she eventually transfers them onto a canvas or uses them as source material for works on paper. Her most prominent and signature formal style is Embroidery, a medium taken up by feminist artist since the 1970s as a political tool. Her work is feminist, subverting the traditionally masculine genre of painting, and its rejection of the norms of female sexuality. Her oeuvre includes examples of painting, drawing, sculpture, performance, and installation. When Amer returned to France from Boston, she became fascinated with Rosemarie Trockel. ‚ÄúShe had successfully invented a language for women using knitting, and I liked her use of commercial and political symbols, as well.‚Äù Amer's multiple geographic relocations are reflected in her work. Her painting is influenced by the idea of shifting meanings and the appropriation of the languages of abstraction and expressionism. Her work adopts \\"politically incorrect\\" imagery for subversive purposes.  RFGA  Together friends Amer and Reza Farkhondeh collaborated on art drawings and prints, under the name \\"RFGA\\" starting in the early 2000s. Amer would create visual explorations of female sexuality, and Farkhondeh would add imagery of forms and the beauty of nature. The collaboration came about after Farkhondeh painted on one of Amer's canvases, she liked his contribution and while it started as a game it later turned into a mutual agreement.  Embroidery Paintings  In 1991, Amer's Cinq Femmes Au Travail embroidery stitching techniques to show women performing tasks that had been advertised for women in magazines‚Äîchildcare, house cleaning, and cooking. The quadriptych is constructed as neatly stitched line drawings on unprimed canvases. This was a turning point for Amer because by using embroidery and gel on canvas as her medium, she was developing her own feminine language of painting. Cinq Femmes Au Travail begins a series of narrative works that present women performing daily chores or quotidian activities, demonstrating Amer's continued interest in the themes of ‚Äúbored women‚Äù as she characterizes it. In 1993, Amer's interest in the subject of women in domestic imagery ended abruptly. A year later, she began to depict pornographic subject matter, images of naked women in ecstasy or with other women to overthrow ideas of exploitation and objectification that have long been associated with these images. ‚ÄúSexuality has always been on my mind because one should not forget that I come from a society where sexuality is completely taboo and never mentioned. And since everything forbidden is always desired, I have always been attracted to this notion. Therefore, talking about love in my art implied a very sexual aspect.‚Äù In 2000, she continued her work extracting images of women from magazines such as Hustler and Club. In works such as Coleurs Noires and The Slightly Smaller Colored Square Painting she traced and stitched serially masturbating or bound figures and partially covered the erotic images behind tangled threads and gel medium. She explained that \\"pornography is the starting point of the image, then it becomes something else.\\" Her radical re-imagination of pornography, which comes from a tradition of being made by men for men, show s erotic female desires and fantasies. A second-order transformation in Amer's work, which might be linked with her early interest in the politics and aesthetics of the written and printed text, began with sculptural objects and installations covered with repetitive embroidered texts.  Sculpture  Although best known for her embroidered canvases, Amer also works with printing, drawing, sculpture and installation. For example, in 2001, Ghada Amer created Encyclopedia of Pleasure, a sculptural installation that features fifty-four boxes, covered in canvas, and embroidered with texts about female beauty and sexuality. The installation shares a name with a twelfth-century Arabic text by Ali Ibn Nasr Al Katib, a literary and medical manual that catalogues sexual pleasure for both men and women that was produced during a progressive period of Islamic culture, but the Encyclopedia of Pleasure is forbidden today. To make the work, Amer selected passages of the text that talk about female sexuality and beauty. She then embroidered a gold thread on fifty-four stacked canvas-covered boxes. Another example of her sculpture is 100 Words of Love. It is a globular, openwork sculpture the structure of which consists of a web of flat, linear, flowing elements that are, in fact, one hundred different words for love in the Arabic language, written also in the Arabic script. It is perhaps appropriate, given that Amer is still at an early stage of exploring the possibilities of her new sculptural language, that 100 Words of Love, Baiser #1 and Baiser #2, and Blue Bra Girls propose different ways in which the manipulation of line, shape, and color can yield an infinite range of compositional and design effects, even within the limitation of globular form. Following well-established feminist art practices of the 1970s, she translated this quintessentially women's craft into an elite art form that often shares, within the compositional space of the canvas, a fraught optical neighborliness with abstract painterly gestures. The facture and medium of her new sculpture demands a different perspective on this subject, precisely because the casting technique it requires is a traditionally male craft. To be sure, her use of resin, stainless steel, and bronze casting to make these sculptures does not suggest the kind of dramatic intervention in the gendering of the arts that her abstract expressionist gestures did in her canvases a decade ago. The Blue Bra Girls, 2012  Installations  She has created public works such as Love Park (1999) in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It is one of her garden projects, a series of outdoor installations she began as an attempt to translate her idea of ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs work‚Äù from embroidery on canvas to an outdoor, sculptural equivalent. For example, Women‚Äôs Qualities consists of floral inscriptions in eight flowerbeds on the grounds of the Metropolitan Art Museum. Amer asked people passing by the museum what qualities they would attribute to women. Words like ‚Äúdocile,‚Äù ‚Äúsweet,‚Äù ‚Äúlong-lashed,‚Äù and ‚Äúvirgin‚Äù were a few of the most common adjectives used to describe ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs qualities.‚Äù Following the events of September 11, 2001, Amer's work began to explore the charged topic of Islamic terrorism. Language of Terror (2005) consisted of a bright pink wallpaper adorned with gold crowns and a lattice pattern into which she inscribed numerous definitions of the word terrorism. In the Arabic language, there is no definition of terrorism. She made plates, cups, napkins, and tray liners with the phrase \\"Terrorism is not indexed in Arabic dictionaries.\\" La Salon Courb√© (2007) dealt with similar controversial topics. She installed an elaborately decorated drawing room typically found in elegant homes across Egypt. However, the domestic scene was not as inviting as it seemed. The pattern of the carpet was inscribed with the only Arabic meaning of the word terrorism that Amer could find. Amer's adoption of naked or semi- naked female figures as a recurring pictorial element in her work assumes an ideological and political dimension that is anything but discreet or ambiguous. Over her career spanning more than twenty years, Amer's work as addressed the subject of women and stereotypes associated with women, as well as the American-Muslim identity. Despite the differences between her Islamic upbringing and Western models of behavior, Amer's work addresses universal problems, such as the oppression of women, which are prevalent in many cultures. ‚Äú I was in Cairo in the midst of August [1988] and I was downtown with my mother when I saw a magazine called Venus. It attracted my attention because the cover read: \\"Special Edition for Veiled Women - month of August.\\" The entire 1980s was a big draw back for women's rights in Egypt. Each summer I was there I witnessed the rising number of veiled women. Women in the street, then my relatives, my aunts, mother, cousins, friends, every women I know was choosing to return to the traditional veil. It was very upsetting,‚Äù Ghada states. Amer's work follows a long modernist tradition of critical practices against veiling, which, as Qassem Amin, Huda Sha'rawi, and Duriyah Shafiq argued decades before, represents a most visible symbol of the forces arrayed against women's emancipation. By encouraging women to use their bodies as vehicles of pleasure and instruments of power, Amer allies herself with a brand of gender politics whose very name remains hotly contested. Sometimes referred to as Third Wave Feminism or Postfeminism, or decried as no feminism at all, the wish to reclaim the sexuality of the female body for female pleasure has been gaining currency in Anglo-American gender criticism. Hoping to move past the aesthetic tradition (first identified by Laura Mulvey) in which men are the bearers of the erotic gaze and women merely its object, critics have sought to reintegrate sexuality into the female subject. In the 1990s, Johanna Drucker, Amelia Jones, and Mulvey herself, among others, sought new ways to think about visual pleasure without sacrificing female sexuality. Moving beyond voyeurism to embrace exhibitionism, Amer has said, \\"I think women like to show their bodies and men like to look at them. [In these works] there is an allusion to masturbation for women, to pleasure.\\" The submission of women to the tyranny of domestic life, the celebration of female sexuality and pleasure, the incomprehensibility of love, the foolishness of war and violence, and an overall quest for formal beauty, constitute the territory that she explores and expresses in her art. Exhibitions  Solo exhibitions  Amer's work has been presented in numerous solo exhibitions at such venues as Cheim & Read, New York; Deitch Projects, New York; P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, New York; the 2000 Gwangju Biennale, South Korea; SITE Santa Fe, New Mexico; the 1999 Venice Biennale; Gagosian Gallery, London; and Gagosian Gallery, Beverly Hills. She is the first Arab artist to have a one-person exhibition at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. A detail of her work, Knotty but Nice, was used on the cover of the September 2006 issue of ARTnews magazine, as part of a focus on erotic art. Some more of her solo exhibitions include the 1996 Hanes Art Center, UNC-Chapel Hill, 2001 Ghada Amer: Pleasure, Contemporary Art Museum, Houston, the 2004 Valencia, Spain, and the 2007 Ghada Amer and Reza Farkhondeh: Collaborative Drawings, Kukje Gallery in Seoul.

Travel up to this point had been by horse-drawn carriage, but by the 1840s the Shrewsbury to Chester line had been completed, allowing passengers to alight at , and then take a coach towards Holyhead.Clinker, C.R., (1979) GWR Register of Halts & Platforms, Avon Anglia However, the commercial development of the local mining industry meant that the development of a railway became essential to the regions economic development.

The Vale of Llangollen Railway left the Shrewsbury to Chester main line south of , and built as a single track line on a double track route proceeded via to the new station at Llangollen. The line opened to freight on 1 December 1861, and to passengers on 2 June 1862 at a temporary terminus on the towns eastern outskirts. The extension to was undertaken by the associated but separate Llangollen and Corwen Railway company, and involved constructing a long tunnel under the local Berwyn Mountains. It, together with the new centrally positioned and larger station in Llangollen, opened for service on 1 May 1865. Operations The already accommodated double-tracking of the line from Ruabon was completed in September 1900 to Llangollen Goods Junction, located west of the current station. Between then and World War I, Acrefair, and Llangollen stations were all in part remodelled to cope with additional traffic. There were signal boxes at Llangollen and Llangollen Goods Jnc., with the latter controlling access to the goods yard, which today is a depot for the preserved railway. According to the Official Handbook of Stations the following classes of traffic were being handled at this station in 1956: G, P, F, L, H, C and there was a 3-ton crane. There was also a private siding at Pentrefelin (now a carriage depot) that was used by the White Sand & Silica Company.1956, Official Handbook of Stations, British Transport Commission Between the two world wars, a direct service connection time of less than 6hrs was possible on a daily basis between and .

The station, which opened in May 1865, was a stop on the Great Western Railway (GWR) line between Llangollen and Corwen. It was closed by British Rail in January 1965. In 1986 the station was reopened as part of the heritage Llangollen Railway. It is now reportedly one of the best 10 stations to visit in Britain. History The Llangollen to Corwen railway was opened in 1865. The route was constructed by Thomas Brassey under the direction of the prolific Scottish engineer, Henry Robertson. Berwyn was the first stop for westbound trains after Llangollen. Although today's station is located within a wooded gorge with only few houses and a riverside hotel nearby, it was at the centre of a vibrant community including a post office and Methodist chapel in the Victorian period. However, it was the local gentry who were the main reason for the station‚Äôs existence. The chairman of the Llangollen and Corwen Railway lived just up the road at Plas Berwyn and an 1861 agreement announced: :A station to be called The Berwyn Station shall be built in ornamental style and contain a first class waiting room in addition to the general waiting room. All passenger trains shall stop at Berwyn if and when required by the owner or occupier of, or visitors to, Plas Berwyn mansion. Berwyn station was built with a single right-handed curved side platform, station master's house, waiting room and booking office. As the station was too remote to be supplied by coal gas, its interiors were decorated with elaborate oil and paraffin lamps. As milk was an important part of the local economy, it was regularly put on to trains at Berwyn. Local farms would bring milk to the station in tall, heavy conical metal churns (generally with a capacity of ). Two side handles allowed two men to lift the churns into a goods van. They could be rolled along on their bottom rims by one man, making a distinctive rattling noise. Milk churns would arrive at Berwyn every day from the nearby farms at Llantysilio for transport to the creamery at Corwen. Berwyn originally had a relatively short platform but with an increase in summer services in the early Edwardian period, the platform was extended across the viaduct with timber decking on wrought iron frames. This unusual cantilevered platform at the western end of the station was dismantled in the late 1950s due to its deterioration and a lack of passengers. During the First World War, local teenage conscripts wrote their names and messages in indelible pencil on the wall of a pedestrian tunnel beneath Berwyn station in 1915. They did this shortly before boarding trains that would take them to their battalions. In 2007, research was undertaken to find out who they were. At least one young man is known to have died on the Western Front, and his name is now on the Llangollen War memorial. Work is now underway to protect the surviving messages from water damage. Berwyn station on the abandoned Ruabon‚ÄìBarmouth line in September 1967 By the 1950s, the waiting room and booking office had both been closed as Berwyn had become an unstaffed halt. The final scheduled passenger service between Llangollen and ran on 12 December 1964. Goods traffic continued on the eastbound section of line between to Llangollen goods yard until 1968. After closure, the whole line was lifted. In the early 1970s, the Langollen Railway Society was formed with the intention of reopening part of the line as a heritage railway. By the 1980s, the newly relaid heritage line approached the former GWR station. Restoration work then began on the station dilapidated buildings. The first passenger train from Llangollen to return to Berwyn was a DMU on 19 October 1985. Steam hauled services began operating to Berwyn in December the same year. The station received a full passenger service in March 1986, with a formal opening ceremony being performed by the Duke of Westminster on 13 June 1986. As the station had become the western terminus of the new line, a run- round loop was installed just past the station. Almost twenty years later, the Llangollen Railway decided to restore the platform at Berwyn to its original extended length across the viaduct at the western of the station. The work, which cost ¬£353,000, was completed in March 2004. The platform restoration received a civil engineering award from the Institution of Civil Engineers. Preservation The volunteer station staff in heritage clothing  Booking office  The term booking office ‚Äì still used today ‚Äì is adopted from the old coaching practice of issuing tickets from a book. Originally these tickets on the early railways were handwritten and the process was very laborious. In 1837 a station master and trained cabinet maker named Thomas Edmondson introduced the Edmondson railway ticket. These pre-printed tickets were all individually numbered and date-stamped by a machine upon issue. Special souvenir Edmondson tickets are still issued to passengers from Berwyn's booking office in the traditional way.  Waiting room  The station's tea room is located within the former first class waiting room. During the Victorian period, the station boasted a separate waiting room for men and women travelling first class, with comfortable seats and a fire in winter. Those in the general waiting room had bench seats.  Station master's house  Victorian re-enactors inside the station's waiting room during the Llangollen Railway's Victorian Weekend From 1865 until the mid-1950s, the station master was the key authority figure at Berwyn railway station, well- respected with significant local social standing. He sold tickets, handled parcels, tended to the station‚Äôs coal fires and ensured passengers were safe. In his spare time, the station master also looked after the station‚Äôs floral and vegetable gardens. The station master's house is the mock-Tudor part of the Berwyn station building. Although the house came with the job, the station master had to pay rent to the GWR; in 1924 this cost 7 shillings and sixpence a week. The house has been restored and is now available to rent as a self- catered holiday cottage. Platform The platform has been extended back to its original length. This means that Berwyn can now accommodate 5-coach trains. However, due to the curve of the platform, a ‚ÄúRight Away‚Äù indicator has been installed at the western end of the station to enable a train guard to safely manage the train.  Locale   Chain bridge  The second Chain Bridge across the River Dee At the time of the railway's opening in 1865, the only way of crossing the River Dee at Berwyn was by using a chain bridge. There have been three such bridges. The first was built by mine owner Exuperius Pickering who needed to get his coal across the river to deliver it to Corwen and Bala. Permission for the bridge was granted in 1814 and it opened in 1817 or very soon afterwards. In the 1870s, a replacement bridge was built by Henry Robertson (the railway's engineer) and this lasted until February 1928, when an exceptionally heavy flood washed it away. The surviving Chain Bridge was built in the summer of 1929, with six metal chains supporting the bridge deck from above and two chains supporting from below. The bridge links two communities and is jointly owned by Llangollen Town Council and Llantysilio Community Council. A pathway from Berwyn station leads under a subway and down to the bridge and to the Chainbridge Hotel on the other side. After a lengthy period out of use and an extensive restoration, the bridge reopened in 2015.  Llangollen Canal and the Horseshoe Falls  The tranquil Horseshoe Falls The Llangollen Canal is located on the opposite side of the River Dee and accessible over the Chain Bridge (step-free access from the station platform). The Horseshoe Falls, built by Thomas Telford to act as a feeder for the Llangollen Canal, is a 10-minute walk from the station. (see map)  Services  References * Further reading *Lawton, Paul (2010).

It is located at the corner of Washington Street and Jefferson Street.  History  The Perkins Block was built in 1890 by Monticello businessman John H. Perkins. This building included three first floor bays housing Perkins' mercantile interests - a general store and sewing machine shop, a hardware store and a farm implement supply store. In addition, Perkins built a stable behind the building from which horses, mules and wagons were sold. The second floor of the Perkins Block included a large foyer and an opera house boasting unparalleled acoustics and the largest stage in the region. Perkins had hopes of establishing the opera house as a major theater in the South. For several years, performances included both professional touring groups and local productions. Shortly after the turn of the century, however, the railroads were re-routed, by-passing Monticello. The wealthy patrons who had once wintered in south Georgia and north Florida sought destinations further south in Florida, and the opera house faced financial disaster. Unable to attract the once-popular theatre productions, Perkins discontinued live performances. A failed attempt to utilize the building as a movie theater led to the abandonment of the auditorium. Although the downstairs bays saw continuous occupation for a variety of uses, the opera house stood idle and soon fell into disrepair. In 1972, the vision of a handful of interested people saved the opera house, with its falling plaster and leaking roof, from the destruction of the wrecker's ball. An organization was formed to provide opportunities for young performers and restore the opera house. The Monticello Opera Company was formed in March of that year and performed at the first fund-raising event at the home of Mr. and Mrs. John H. Phipps. The Perkins opera house, seen from the east side The purchase of the Perkins Block was consummated on October 17, 1973. On that date, the Monticello Opera House, Inc. purchased the building with money raised through fund-raising efforts, a grant from the State of Florida and a private donation from Mrs. Dorothy Simpson, who held one-half interest in the building. Maintenance and restoration of the facility continues to this day. In a joint effort with the Florida Department of State, Division of Historic Resources, a restoration project was completed in the area of the original stairway leading to the auditorium balcony. The construction brought the facility into compliance with fire code regulations to allow the lawful use of seating in the balcony. The project was completed with a sensitivity to the original architectural features and makes use of original molding and wainscoting wherever possible. Although the original seating in the balcony remained intact, the seats on the main level of the theater had to be replaced. The current seating was donated by Tallahassee Community College President during the school's renovation of its theater. Installation of the \\"new\\" seats was accomplished entirely with volunteer labor from members of the community. Although the downstairs had been remodeled to accommodate those with disabilities, it was not until May 2004, that the theater became accessible. In 1999 $25,000 was donated in the memory of Dr. Gerald M. Cathey to institute fund raising efforts for installation of an elevator. An additional $25,000 was raised over the course of the next two years through donations from benefactors and production proceeds from the Opera House Stage Company. A $50,000 matching grant from the Department of State, Division of Historical Resources resulted in the hiring of Riley Palmer Construction to complete this long desired renovation. Present usage The Monticello Opera House is commonly used for a variety of events including children's theater, murder mystery dinners and large musicals. There is also a patio and gazebo in the back where weddings and receptions are held.

Two other species are known. G. conjungens was discovered in the stomach of a Kenyan Black Rhinoceros in 1901, but has not been observed since 1961. The other is G. sumatrensis, which was found in a captive Sumatran Rhinoceros in 1884 but has not been observed since. Due to the difficulty of observing these short- lived flies, it is possible that there are other species corresponding to the other species of rhinoceros, but they remain undescribed. It is also possible that several species of Gyrostigma are extinct because rhinoceros populations are tiny owing to their state of endangerment.

This poem, unlike its companion poem in \\"Songs of Innocence\\" (1789), focuses more on society as a whole than on the ceremony held in London. Analysis The primary objective of this poem is to question social and moral injustice. In the first stanza, Blake contrasts the \\"rich and fruitful land\\" with the actions of a \\"cold and usurous hand\\" - thereby continuing his questioning of the virtue of a society where resources are abundant but children are still \\"reduced to misery\\". The \\"Holy Thursday\\" referred to in the poem is Ascension Thursday, which in the Church of England and other parts of the Anglican Communion, can be used a synonym for the same feast; Thomas Pruen uses the term to refer to Ascension Day in his Illustration of the Liturgy of the Church of England, published in 1820; however use of the term \\"Holy Thursday\\" to mean Ascension Day is rare,Collins English Dictionary: Definition of \\"Holy Thursday\\" and the term is more generally applied by most Christian denominations to Maundy Thursday in Holy Week. On Ascension Day a service was held in St. Paul's Cathedral for the poor children of London's charity schools. Appreciation of the \\"wise guardians of the poor\\" thus advertising their charity may not be wholly shared by Blake's \\"Piper\\", the supposed narrator of the \\"Songs of Innocence\\". In their state of innocence, children should not be regimented; rather, they should be playing blithely on the \\"echoing green\\". The children in this poem \\"assert and preserve their essential innocence not by going to church, but by freely and spontaneously, 'like a mighty wind,' raising to 'heaven the voice of song.Gleckner, Robert F. \\"Point of View and Context in Blake's Songs\\", Twentieth Century Views: Blake, A Collection of Critical Essays. Ed Northrop Frye: Prentice-Hall Inc. 1966. With his \\"Holy Thursday\\" of the \\"Songs of Experience\\", Blake's \\"Bard\\" clarifies his view of the hypocrisy of formal religion and its claimed acts of charity. He sees the established church's hymns as a sham, suggesting in his second stanza that the sound which would represent the day more accurately would be the \\"trembling cry\\" of a poor child. The poet, as Bard, states that although England may be objectively a \\"rich and fruitful land\\", the unfeeling profit-orientated power of authority has designed for the innocent children suffering within it an \\"eternal winter\\". The biblical connotations of the rhetorical opening point us towards Blake's assertion that a country whose children live in want cannot be described as truly \\"rich\\". With the apparent contradiction of two climatic opposites existing simultaneously within the one geopolitical unit, we are offered a metaphor for England's man-made \\"two nations\\". Blake wrote during the Industrial Revolution, whose pioneers congratulated themselves upon their vigorous increases in output. The poet argues that until increases in production are linked to more equitable distribution, England will always be a land of barren winter.

With a height of 1151 metres (3776 feet) it is ranked as the third highest mountain north of the Great Glen (after Carn Eighe and Mam Sodhail) and is regarded as one of the finest hills in the whole of the United Kingdom. It is different from the other neighbouring Affric Hills, characterised by sweeping flanks and long slender ridges, which emerge from the central summit crest in the manner of the spokes of a wheel.  Geography  Sg√πrr nan Ceathreamhnan is rated as one of the remotest Munros and a great prize for any hill walker, with E.J. Yeaman in his Handbook of the Scottish Hills regarding Ceathreamhnan as the fourth most difficult Scottish Munro to climb, taking into account its remote position and its altitude. It is a massive mountain which covers 24 square miles (62 square km) and stands many kilometres from the nearest public road, it has a tent like appearance and throws down many long ridges to the valleys. It has five subsidiary ‚Äútops‚Äù, three of these stand on the northern ridge, they are Stuc Bheag (1075 metres), Stuc M√≤r (1041 metres) and Stob Fraoch Choire (918 metres). The Western Top (1143 metres) is also regarded as a \\"top\\" as is Stob Coire na Cloiche (915 metres) on the eastern ridge. In addition to this Sg√πrr nan Ceathreamhnan has three tops which have been deleted from the list over the years, making a total of eight distinct summits on the mountain in addition to the highest point. Its outlier to the north east, Mullach na Dheiragain, is regarded as a separate Munro. Sg√πrr nan Ceathreamhnan‚Äôs name looks notoriously difficult to pronounce for non Gaelic speakers and is often facetiously referred to as \\"Chrysanthemum\\" by hill walkers who do not know Gaelic. The English translation from the Gaelic name is \\"Peak of the Quarters\\" referring to the large amount of land it divides with its ridges. Sg√πrr nan Ceathreamhnan‚Äôs summit has twin peaks linked by a curving ridge with the western pinnacle lying 500 metres away from the highest point and reaching 1143 metres in height. There is a small amount of scrambling involved in traversing between the two summits.  Ascents  The ascent of Sg√πrr nan Ceathreamhnan is a major undertaking best done during the long hours of summer daylight. The shortest approach is from the Alltbeithe youth hostel in upper Glen Affric at grid reference 3.5 kilometres south of the summit; however, it is a major undertaking just to get to the hostel, with long walks in from Loch Cluanie to the south or from the road end in Glen Affric. It is also possible to start walking from Iron Lodge in Glen Elchaig but a bicycle is needed to travel up the estate road, another approach starts from the car park in Strath Croe. From the Alltbeithe hostel the ascent goes north up a stalkers path to the col between Sg√πrr nan Ceathreamhnan and An Socach - the latter a minor Munro which can be easily \\"bagged\\" on the way to Ceathreamhnan‚Äôs summit with little extra effort. The view from the summit is one of remote mountainous country, although with the help of binoculars it is possible to see Inverness and the Kessock Bridge, over 70 kilometres away to the east.

It was described by state media as a more \\"conservative\\" communist party, in contrast to the Pridnestrovie Communist Party (PCP).  Overview  The Communist Party of Pridnestrovie maintains close contacts with groups in Russia. It was affiliated with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union led by Oleg Shenin, and it usually refers to itself by its abbreviation KPP-KPSS. However, it had no representation in Transnistria's Supreme Council. It supported independent statehood for Transnistria and opposed the administration of President Igor Smirnov. It provided no candidate to run in the 10 December 2006 presidential election, but lent its support Nadezhda Bondarenko, the candidate of the competing Pridnestrovie Communist Party, who obtained 8.1% of the vote. During the presidential elections of 2011, Vladimir Gavrilchenko did not run for president himself. He announced his support for Igor Smirnov instead. He also entered the pro-presidential People's Union, which consists of 20 different public organizations and civic unions. After results of the first round were announced on 12 December 2011, and it became obvious that acting president Igor Smirnov lost the elections, Vladimir Gavrilchenko with other supporters appeared on the special meeting of the People's Union and called to nullify the results of the elections, to change the composition of the Central Elections Commission and to introduce a state of emergency in Transnistria in order to give Smirnov the ability to remain in power.Special Congress of the People's Union.

It is located at 40 South Palafox Street (the northeast corner of the intersection of South Palafox and West Romana Streets). On December 13, 1979, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The Thiesen Building is Pensacola's first commercial high-rise. At the time of its construction, this five-story building was the tallest building in Pensacola and the first with a modern elevator and steam heat. Built in a Renaissance Revival style, it features terra-cotta ornamentation on the west and south facades. History  The Thiesen Building was conceived and financed by Pensacola businessman Christen Ustrup Thiesen, designed by the Atlanta architectural firm of Morgan & Dillon, and constructed by Pensacola contractors Wills & Broughton. Christen Thiesen's career as a Pensacola businessman had begun through unusual circumstances. Born in Denmark, Thiesen was the navigator of a Danish sailing ship. Thiesen became stranded in Pensacola during the Pensacola yellow fever epidemic of 1882 when his ship left without him. Thiesen, who contracted yellow fever but recovered, found a job tending bar in a saloon. The saloon owner died in the epidemic. In 1884, Thiesen married the saloon owner's widow, and thus became the owner of the saloon. The Thiesen Building was considered a risky venture; some Pensacolians called it \\"Thiesen's folly\\". However, it proved to be financially successful, with retail stores on the ground floor and professional offices on the upper floors. By the 1970s, the building had fallen into disrepair and had become vacant. In 1992 businessman Ray Russenberger purchased and renovated the building to provide offices for his paging company Network USA. He restored the exterior to its original 1901 design. On January 4, 2019, Litvak, Beasley, Wilson, and Ball, LLP began to occupy the third floor as a law office.

In 2007 the prison was enlarged again, when new pre-fabricated cells for up to 300 extra prisoners were moved into the Wayland Prison complex, as well as new workshops and other facilities. In October 2007, a report from the Independent Monitoring Board claimed that prisoners at Wayland were being given inadequate mental health care by the NHS. The board criticised the Norfolk & Waveney Mental Health Trust for removing a specialist mental health nurse at the prison. However the report praised the jail's governor and prison staff for their preparations to open the new prison blocks at Wayland. In November 2009, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons stated that an increased use of force was being used at Wayland Prison. Inspectors were also concerned that the healthcare department and reception facilities for new inmates were not adequate for the increased number of prisoners at the jail. However, the report described the prison as performing \\"reasonably well\\" overall. In August 2016 the prison governor, Paul Cawkwell, was severely beaten by an inmate in the canteen.

The riot followed Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals in which the Vancouver Canucks lost to the New York Rangers. It was Vancouver's first riot since 1972, when the Rolling Stones American Tour 1972 led to confrontations between the police and 2,000 outside the Pacific Coliseum. The riot After the NHL game ended, an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 individuals converged upon Downtown Vancouver. The gathering developed into a riot at Robson and Thurlow Street, after an accident involving a man who fell from a lamp standard into the crowd below. The police, who were on bicycles, attempted to escort paramedics into the crowd. When members of the crowd attempted to take a bicycle from one constable, police retreated and warned the crowd to disperse. Shortly after the riot squad congregated on Thurlow St. on the West side, police fired tear gas into the crowd, causing people to run in all directions. Many major retailers along Robson had their windows broken, including an Eaton's department store which had more than 50 smashed. The storefronts were eventually guarded by a constable as police regained control of the streets. Tear gas wafted through the open windows of West End residents that night. St. Paul's Hospital responded to the situation by placing guards at the emergency room entrance to prevent tear gas victims from entering, claiming there was nothing that could be done for them. Eventually, as reported in The New York Times, bowls with water were placed outside by the security guards for those suffering from tear gas. Total damage to the downtown core was estimated at $1.1 million Canadian Dollars.A Tale of Two Riots Subduing the crowd required the direct involvement of over 540 officers, of the Vancouver Police Department and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Numerous individuals were arrested and charged, and up to 200 people were injured. Aftermath Ryan Berntt, a rioter who was shot in the head with a plastic bullet by police, causing a four-week coma and permanent brain damage, filed a civil suit against police and the City of Vancouver claiming excessive force. In 1997, he was found 75 percent liable for his own injuries, however, the British Columbia Court of Appeal ordered a new trial in 1999. In 2001, Berntt's civil suit was dismissed by the Supreme Court of British Columbia. In New York City, although the celebrations marking the Rangers' first championship in 54 years were peaceful and there were no reports of violence or arrests, they were marred by the Vancouver riots. Rudy Giuliani, who became the city's mayor just five months before, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, and Rangers President and General Manager Neil Smith said that the Rangers and people in New York City were in shock over the news of the riots and that the shockwaves of it had traveled to the city and put it on the highest alert. Bratton canceled days off for the New York City Police Department on June 17, 1994, the day of the parade for the Rangers, as a precaution against what happened in Vancouver happening in New York City. During their broadcast of the post-game celebrations following Game 7, Hockey Night in Canada's Ron MacLean said when the network broadcast scenes outside Madison Square Garden that the NYPD avoided a large-scale riot by \\"continuing to bolster their situation in anticipation of a wild night in Manhattan.\\" Seventeen years later, the Canucks played the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals.

History  The Baroque palace was built from 1729 to 1740 for Francis Louis of Neuburg, Prince-elector and Archbishop of Mainz from 1729 to 1732. Since he was at the same time Hochmeister of the Teutonic Knights, he built the Deutschhaus as his second residence for representative purposes in his duties as Hochmeister in the immediate neighborhood of the Electoral Palace, his other residence. The building was constructed by Anselm Franz Freiherr von Ritter zu Groenesteyn in a style influenced by French Baroque architecture. It consists of a main building and two pavilions around a central court. One of the pavilions contained a chapel with frescoes by Christoph Thomas Scheffler. Due to the Hochmeister's death in 1732, the building was never used for its intended function as Hochmeister's residence. View from the Rhine side In the times of French occupation leading to the establishment of the Republic of Mainz, it became the seat of the Rhenish-German National Convention. This earliest democratically elected parliament in Germany first met on March 17, 1793 in the Deutschhaus. On the next day, the Convention declared Mainz and all of the territory between Landau and Bingen to be an independent state based on the principles of liberty and egality, and the Convention's president Andreas Joseph Hofmann proclaimed the Rhenish-German Free State (Rheinisch- Deutscher Freistaat) from the balcony of the Deutschhaus. After this period had ended with the French capitulation after the Siege of Mainz on July 23, 1793, the building was used by Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen until the territory was ceded to France again in the Treaty of Campo Formio, and the Deutschhaus became the administrative seat of the French d√©partement Mont- Tonnerre. It was used as a palace by Napoleon during all of his 9 stays in Mainz, who planned to double the size of the building and use it as an imperial residence, as Mayence was intended to become one of the bonnes villes de l'Empire, the 36 most important cities of France. General Adolphe Guillaumat with the French flag in front of the building at the end of the Occupation of the Rhineland in June 1930 In the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, the building was used by the Dukes of Hesse-Darmstadt, who obtained the territory of Mainz after the Congress of Vienna. In 1870, the building served as the headquarters of the Prussian army in the early stages of the Franco- Prussian War. During World War II, the building was heavily damaged, especially in the air raid of February 27, 1945, which destroyed most of the city. Of the Deutschhaus, only the exterior walls remained. The Deutschhaus can be seen at the right of the Neues Zeughaus, the seat of the Minister- President of Rhineland-Palatinate Reconstruction started after the Rhineland- Palatinate Landtag decided to move from Koblenz to Mainz on May 28, 1950. It was completed in 1951, and the new building was used for the first time for the constituting session of the newly elected Landtag on May 18, 1951. It has been used as plenary building of the Landtag ever since. As the Deutschhaus has only very limited office space for the members of parliament, a new office building for them was constructed in 1999.

It is based on his experiences before, during, and after the firebombing of Kobe in 1945. One of his sisters died as the result of sickness, his adoptive father died during the firebombing proper, and his younger adoptive sister Keiko died of malnutrition in Fukui. It was written as a personal apology to Keiko, regarding her death. The story was first published in Japan in „Ç™„Éº„É´Ë™≠Áâ© (≈åru Yomimono) \\"All For Reading\\", a monthly literature magazine published by Bungei Shunju, in October 1967. Nosaka won the Naoki Prize for best popular literature for this story and American Hijiki, which was published a month before. Both short stories along with four others were bundled as a book in 1968 published by Shinch≈çsha (). The short story was later adapted into the 1988 anime film Grave of the Fireflies, directed by Isao Takahata. The film was released on April 16, 1988, over twenty years from the publication of the original work.\\"The Animerica Interview: Takahata and Nosaka: Two Grave Voices in Animation.\\" Animerica.

It was adapted again into a live-action television film Grave of the Fireflies in 2005, and another live-action film in 2008. Nosaka explained that Grave of the Fireflies is a \\"double-suicide story.\\"\\"The Animerica Interview: Takahata and Nosaka: Two Grave Voices in Animation.\\" Animerica. Volume 2, No. 11. Page 7. Translated by Animerica from: Takahata, Isao. Eiga o Tsukurinagara, Kangaeta Koto (\\"Things I Thought While Making Movies\\") Tokuma Shoten, 1991. Originally published in Animage, June 1987. This is a translation of a 1987 conversation between Takahata and Akiyuki Nosaka. Isao Takahata, the anime film director, said that he saw similarities to Chikamatsu Monzaemon's double-suicide plays. Development Akiyuki Nosaka wrote the book in 1967, during a period of high economic growth. Nosaka said that the era felt strange to him and that \\"the real spirit of humanity was different\\" and so he wished to depict an \\"idealized humanity\\" between a brother and sister, or \\"ultimately, of a man and a woman.\\" He added that he wished to place Seita, the main character, \\"in an idealized situation.\\" Nosaka said that he himself had been in such a scenario until fourteen and then had to grow up very quickly, becoming \\"worse off\\" than other children. Characters Seita Akiyuki Nosaka explained that Seita and Setsuko survive the wartime environment by \\"locking themselves up in a world of their own.\\" Nosaka added that after their mother, their sole guardian, dies, Seita \\"decides to become the guardian of his little sister, even if it means making an enemy out of the world.\\" At one point, Seita has a favorable reception to making himself a source of food for his sister. Nosaka argued \\"On the one hand, that's very tragic, but it's also a blessed situation. For Seita, it's like he can try to build a heaven for just the two of them.\\" Nosaka argued that while Seita is \\"when it comes to reality\\" not a romanticist for he also becomes hungry, \\"objectively speaking\\" Setsuko, at age four, is at the period when \\"a girl looks the cutest\\" and Seita is just becoming aware of his masculinity in his adolescent period. Nosaka said that the two have an \\"obvious consanguineous relationship\\" and that Setsuko is the only person Seita can confide in. Nosaka added that \\"while there's a strong blood tie, he's shut out from being able to love her as a girl\\" and that his tension increases to high levels and therefore sublimation takes place. Nosaka explained that Seita \\"is rather spoiled for a wartime child\\" and therefore the children of 1987 would act like he would if they were put in that situation. Isao Takahata said that he was compelled to adapt the story into an animation after seeing how Seita \\"was a unique wartime ninth grader.\\" He previously believed that boys always developed the will to live, but Seita instead chooses not to endure difficult feelings; when his aunt insults him, Seita does not act in a stoic manner and instead withdraws from the situation. Takahata argued that Seita's feelings are better understood by the children in 1987, who often base decisions on whether or not they are pleasant, while during that year his generation had the belief that Seita needed to endure it. Takahata argued that \\"It's not only the children...I think the times are becoming that way, as well\\" and therefore he liked the idea of adapting the story as a film. Nosaka said that in the story, Seita \\"got increasingly transformed into a better human being\\" since he was trying to \\"compensate for everything I couldn't do myself\\" and that he was never \\"kind like the main character.\\" Nosaka explained that \\"I always thought I wanted to perform those generous acts in my head, but I couldn't do so.\\" He believed that he would always give food to his sister, but when he obtained food, he ate. The food tasted very good when it was scarce, but he felt remorse afterwards. Nosaka concluded \\"I'd think there is no one more hopeless in the world than me. I didn't put anything about this in the novel.\\"\\"The Animerica Interview: Takahata and Nosaka: Two Grave Voices in Animation.\\" Animerica. Volume 2, No. 11. Page 10.

This is a translation of a 1987 conversation between Takahata and Akiyuki Nosaka. Setsuko Nosaka said that Setsuko also has to grow up quickly, and she takes the role of Seita's mother, \\"and at other times, the role of his lover.\\" Setsuko acts as Seita's spiritual support while Setsuko relies on Seita for nourishment. Nosaka said that \\"[i]n the end, it turns out that the days leading up to their death are like the development of a love story.\\" Nosaka said that the death of his sister was \\"an exact match with the novel.\\" Sources Category:1967 short stories Category:Anti-war books Category:Autobiographies Category:Japanese short stories Category:Short stories adapted into films Category:World War II short stories Category:Fiction set in 1945 Category:Children and death ja:ÁÅ´ÂûÇ„Çã„ÅÆÂ¢ì ","title":"Grave of the Fireflies (short story)"},{"id":"7167315","text":"Francis Scott (July 21, 1921 - October 5, 1995) was an American musician and arranger that was a member of the Lawrence Welk orchestra.

He first took up the piano at age eight, and by the time he was twelve, he led his first band and started to arrange songs. He originally attended North Dakota Agricultural College after high school, but after a year he left when he decided to pursue a career in music. He was the music director at radio station WDAY in Fargo from 1944 to 1956 where he scored over 2,500 arrangements for the station while composing music for community theater groups and conducting local ice shows. In 1956, bandleader Lawrence Welk asked him to join his orchestra and his nationwide television show. He appeared on The Lawrence Welk Show playing piano and harpsichord during his tenure on the show until 1969, when he was replaced by the late Bob Smale. He also worked behind the scenes of the Welk show as an arranger, assisted the production staff and furnished programming ideas.

Created from Studios Herg√© in 1987 by Fanny Rodwell, Herg√©'s widow, the Herg√© Foundation is a not-for-profit organization based in Brussels, the birthplace of the creator of Tintin. It runs Herg√©'s estate, the official Tintin website, and the Herg√© museum. Moulinsart The name was chosen as the name for the foundation's commercial and copyright wing, set up to actively work to protect and promote the work of Herg√©. It is named after Moulinsart, the ch√¢teau where Captain Haddock lives in the books (in the English translations, is known as \\"Marlinspike Hall\\"). Editions Moulinsart The foundation has released many books on the subject of Tintin in French under the publishing name . Awards On 1 June 2006, the Dalai Lama bestowed the International Campaign for Tibet's Light of Truth Award upon the Herg√© Foundation, along with South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The award was the Dalai Lama's recognition of Tintin in Tibet, Herg√©'s most personal adventure. Accepting on behalf of the Herg√© Foundation, Herg√©'s widow Fanny Rodwell stated, \\"We never thought that this story of friendship would have a resonance more than 40 years later.\\" Rights issue The Herg√© Foundation has frequently litigated against other entities that attempted to use Tintin images. However, after Moulinsart sued Dutch fanzine Herg√© Genootschap (Herg√© Society) in 2012 for one million euros for publishing Tintin images without a license, a contract was unearthed whereby Herg√© had assigned all the rights of his works to his original publisher Casterman in 1942. At no time has Fanny Rodwell, the widow and sole heir to the foundation, nor her husband Nick Rodwell, who manages the Tintin empire, ever challenged the agreement in the past. The court's decision means Moulinsart never owned the rights they have been asserting. \\"It appears, from a 1942 document ... that Herg√© gave publishing rights for the books of The Adventures of Tintin to publisher Casterman, so Moulinsart is not the one to decide who can use material from the books.\\" said the Hague court's ruling. The document came from a Herg√© expert who wishes to remain anonymous.

It can be eaten as a main course, for lunch or dinner, or as a side dish. Cauliflower cheese consists of pieces of cauliflower lightly boiled and covered with a milk-based cheese sauce, for which a mature cheese (such as cheddar) tends to be preferred. A more elaborate white sauce or cheddar cheese sauce flavoured with English mustard and nutmeg may also be used. The dish is topped with grated cheese (sometimes mixed with bread crumbs) and baked in the oven to finish it. History Cauliflower is thought to originate from Kythrea in Cyprus, which historically was a former British Colony. B√©chamel sauce was used extensively in Greek and Cypriot cooking of the 19th century and the early 20th century. Anglocypriots claim to have introduced the dish to the UK. Cauliflower was said to have been introduced to the west during the French Lusignan rule of Cyprus. The Old French word for Cauliflower is chou de Chypre (Cyprus cabbage). There is a recipe for cauliflower with Parmesan cheese in Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, first published in 1861. In the 19th and 20th centuries the dish was often served as an accompaniment to the roast meat and potatoes that were eaten for the traditional Sunday lunch, normally in the winter months. In the UK, cauliflower cheese is now widely produced as a vegetarian ready meal, and is also popular as a pre-prepared baby food.

It is anchored by Kohl's, Total Wine, AMC Theatres, Marshalls, Old Navy, and Best Buy, along with one vacant anchor left by A.C. Moore. Simon Property Group owns one third of the common area of the mall, between Kohl's and Best Buy; the right-hand area of the property from Best Buy to Staples is owned by Target; and the property from Kohl's to Dick's Sporting Goods is owned by New England Development, the mall's original developer.  History  Construction began in 1969, and the mall opened with a dedication ceremony on February 21, 1972. The mall was renovated and expanded first in 1980 and again in 1993. The mall is located less than a mile away from the Northshore Mall in Peabody, although both malls are primarily owned and managed by Simon Property Group. Since the 1980s, the Liberty Tree Mall has focused more on the discount end, whereas the Northshore Mall has focused on the mainstream/upscale end, thus enabling them to coexist semi- peacefully. Ann & Hope, one of the former anchor stores of the mall, opened in 1969 before the mall was completed. Lechmere was the mall's other anchor, which opened with the rest of the mall in 1972. The name Liberty Tree derives from the local version of Boston's Liberty Tree, which originally stood in downtown Boston. During the early years of the mall, a large metal tree stood at the center court to commemorate the Liberty Tree. The sculpture was a featured exhibit in the New England Pavilion at the 1964‚Äì65 New York World's Fair and was designed by Albert Surman, who died in 2010. The sculpture was removed sometime between 1988 and 1992, and is now considered lost. In 1980, a food court was added that included restaurants such as The Roast House and The Fairgrounds. A Marshalls was added during the 1980s, and has been in the mall since then. Marshalls is the only remaining original anchor store. Filene's Basement, which subleased a portion of the Lechmere space in 1983, moved to the Northshore Mall in the 1990s. Sports Authority and Old Navy were added after the 1993 food court-hallway expansion. Sports Authority closed in 2016, after the company filed for bankruptcy, and was replaced with SkyZone. Lechmere and Filene's Basement were anchor stores of the mall until 1997 when they were demolished and rebuilt into Target, Staples, Dollar Tree, and Best Buy in 1998‚Äì99. An f.y.e. replaced part of an area of smaller stores, converting them into a music store/video arcade (formerly Dream Machine), both of which have since closed. Another group of stores was converted to Bed Bath & Beyond. Ann & Hope closed their entire chain of stores in 2001, and this included the Liberty Tree Mall location. This location was later rebuilt into Kohl's. Stop & Shop and Pier 1 Imports were later built to the left of Kohl's. A Loews Theatres 20-screen multiplex was also added to the mall. In January 2008, Stop & Shop closed. The store was originally built in 2003.Danvers Herald. \\"Stop & Shop to close at mall\\". December 6, 2007.

In early 2013, PPE Casino Resorts applied to the state gambling commission for a slots parlor in the rear area of the mall, where Marshalls and the food court are located now. The announcement led to some debate, with some concerned about the character of the mall and others optimistic about jobs and revenue a slots parlor could generate for the community.

Later the Company manufactured the radically restyled Esplanada with improved engines and, with increasing control by the Chrysler Group over the French concern, was taken over by the American car giant as majority share holder. During its ten years of market presence Simca defended its market share against fierce competition from Volkswagen, Ford, Chevrolet and Willys. The brand disappeared from the Brazilian Market in the late 1960s following a strategic decision by its owners Chrysler. Foundation The Simca plant received a visit by Juscelino Kubitschek before his inauguration as president in 1956, organized by a Brazilian General who had a family member employed in Poissy. Kubitschek jokingly invited Simca to build a plant in Minas Gerais, his home state. Simca took this proposal quite seriously and sent a letter of intent to produce cars in Brazil. In the interim, Brazil had formed an Executive Group for the Automotive Industry (GEIA), which had laid forth a set of requirements for any producer wishing to establish a plant in Brazil. Simca claimed that their proposal and arrangement with Kubitschek pre-dated these rules and lobbied for exceptions.Shapiro, p. 908 Simca also lobbied directly in Minas but were in the end forced to present their own proposal, which was passed with a number of contingencies. Simca do Brasil was then founded on 5 May 1958 in the City of Belo Horizonte, capital of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, as a result of Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek efforts to lure foreign car companies to pioneer this market with huge potential through tempting fiscal advantages. Assembly of the Vedette (and derivatives) began in March 1959. Simca do Brasil initially imported kits of the Simca Vedette supplied by the French Simca HQ and had them assembled in their facilities in S√£o Bernardo do Campo (State of S√£o Paulo), where the administration would move to later on, and Rio de Janeiro. In spite of promises made, first to President Kubitschek and later to the GEIA (the Brazilian Executive Group for the Automotive Industry), Simca's activities were never moved to Minas Gerais.Shapiro, p. 909 The first car left the assembly line in 1959 but was plagued with enormous problems not only because of the 480 strong, but totally inexperienced workforce. The delays in passing the GEIA rules meant that Simca were unable to access hard currency and suffered severe parts problems as a result. A reputation for low quality quickly developed, one which Simca was unable to shake. From assembling to manufacturing Simca Esplanada manufactured by Simca do Brasil Meanwhile, Simca do Brasil imported all the tools and machinery to start its own production and was busy recruiting 980 local OEM parts suppliers to transform the Simca Chambord, Pr√©sidence and Rallye models into true Brazilian made cars because of Brazilian government demands in exchange for the benefits granted so far. But the huge problems faced on a daily basis at the assembly line threatened to put the future manufacturing site in severe doubts. A crisis broke out and Simca do Brasil threatened to become paralyzed by the growing problems. Simca France, having invested heavily in their Brazilian offspring, then sent their top engineer Jacques Jean Pasteur to Brazil not only to streamline the production but to actually run the entire operation. By 1961 Pasteur had successfully addressed the issues and cars were being built with 98% of parts from national suppliers. Chrysler takes over In the second half of 1966 Chrysler took over as majority shareholder, after having bought 92% of Simca France. From August 1967 onwards, cars left the production line with a small badge at the rear saying \\"fabricado pela Chrysler‚Äù (built by Chrysler), sending out the message of the takeover by the American car brand. The well established Simca name remained in use for another two years. Finally, in 1969, the Simca name was laid to rest as the Americans re- introduced one of their internationally renowned brand names by launching the Dodge Dart on the Brazilian market.

Taxonomy The fossils of Mammalodon were found to be around 25.7‚Äì23.9 million years old, dating to the Late Oligocene. The holotype for M. colliveri, NMV P199986 though formerly MUGD 1874, is an incomplete skull of an adult individual collected in 1932 by George Baxter Pritchard, Alan Frostick, and Frederick Stanley Colliver‚Äìto which owes the species name‚Äìin Jan Juc, Victoria in Australia; specimen NMV P17535, consisting of a lower left molar, probably also belongs to NMV P199986. NMV P173220 consists of a left periotic bone. NMV P199587 is a partial skeleton, consisting of part of the head, spine, and arm; specimen NMV P198871, an ulna, very likely also belongs to NMV P199587. The second species, M. hakataramea, was discovered in the Kokoamu Greensand of New Zealand.Fordyce, R. E. 1991. A new look at the fossil vertebrate record of New Zealand; pp. 1191-1316 in P. V. Rich, J. M. Monaghan, R. F. Baird, and T. H. Rich (eds), Vertebrate palaeontology of Australasia. Pioneer Design Studio and Monash University, Melbourne. Mammalodon fossils have been found in Australia and New Zealand Mammalodon was, at first, considered to be a member of Archaeoceti, an ancient group of whales, which was evidenced by its apparent ancient features, such as the variety of differently shaped teeth in its jaw (heterodonty) that modern whales lack. Mammalodon was first considered to be a baleen whale in a 1982 study despite having no baleen; instead, they cited other similarities such as loosely sutured bones in the snout, a broad and flat roof of the mouth, and an unjointed mandibular symphysis between the two halves of the jawbone. It belongs to the family Mammalodontidae, along with Janjucetus. These whales and Llanocetus may form a clade of toothed baleen whales of the Southern Hemisphere, a sister clade to Aetiocetidae and more modern baleen-bearing baleen whales. The name Mammalodon is said to be derived from English mammal and Ancient Greek odontos tooth, meaning \\"mammal tooth,\\" as its molar teeth are similar to those found in terrestrial carnivores. The Ancient Greek for \\"tooth\\" is however odous (·ΩÄŒ¥ŒøœçœÇ).Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek- English Lexicon. Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. With the assistance of Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Description Mammalodon, with a length of , was smaller and more primitive than modern baleen whales. Unlike other baleen whales, Mammalodon had a blunt and rounded snout. The left maxilla‚Äìupper jaw‚Äìof specimen NMV P199986 preserved four premolars and three molars, and the space between the teeth (diastema) increased towards back into the mouth. The molars decreased in size back into the mouth, like in archeocetes, and the bottom jaw had two more molars than the upper jaw. The specimen's lower jaw indicates it had 24 lower teeth in all, all tightly spaced together. The upper teeth all looked the same (monodonty), whereas the bottom teeth varied in shape (polydonty) which is an ancient characteristic of whales. There were three lower incisor teeth, and one upper incisor with possibly two or three vestigial incisors. The teeth were likely never replaced, and the whale had the same set of teeth throughout its life. The single upper incisor was markedly smaller than the other teeth, and smaller than the upper incisors of Janjucetus. The cheek teeth‚Äìmolars and premolars‚Äìwere all double-rooted, and the lower molars were serrated and triangular. In the holotype of M. colliveri, only the second vertebra of the neck‚Äìthe axis‚Äìis preserved. Unlike in modern baleen whales, but similar to archeocetes and the ancient toothed baleen whale Aetiocetus, the breastbone is composed of several pieces. The top-most breastbone, the manubrium, is T-shaped and wider than is long like archaeocetes, but plate-like and compressed like modern baleen whales. Unlike in modern whales though similar to archaeocetes, the thyrohyoid bone of the hyoid apparatus used to hold up the tongue is large and tubular as opposed to plate-like. It probably had a fused mandibular symphysis linking the two halves of the jaw together, unlike in later and modern baleen whales. Palaeobiology As with the closely related genus Janjucetus, Mammalodon lacked baleen, instead possessing well- developed teeth. As such, it was not able to filter-feed in the same manner as extant baleen whales, making its diet and ecological niche a mystery. As the teeth are widely spaced, they may have developed a method of filter-feeding unlike that of other whales. It may have been a bottom filter feeder, its blunt snout helping to suck up organisms from the sea floor.

There are currently two genera in this family: Janjucetus and Mammalodon. After a new cladistic analysis by Fitzgerald (2010), Janjucetus was transferred into Mammalodontidae, thereby making Janjucetidae a junior synonym of Mammalodontidae. Analysing the jaw morphology of the toothed mysticetes, found eight mandibular characters unique to the members of Mammalodontidae: * the mandibular symphysis is short, has a rugose joint surface, but lacks a symphyseal groove. In archaeocetes the symphysis is long. In modern mysticetes, in contrast, the symphysis is very small, its joint surfaces are smooth, and there is a groove on the interior side of the mandible that accommodates the symphyseal ligament which enables them to open their mouth wide. * the external foramina on the mandible are relatively large (smaller or absent in later mysticetes) * the postcanines sit in a longitudinal groove flanked by a lateral edge (the \\"alveolar margin\\") * the alveolar (upper) margin forms an angle with the ventral (lower) margin (like in archaeocetes) * the ventral margin is straight in the posterior half of the mandible * teeth have longitudinal ridges * posterior postcanines have two roots joined below the crown base * postcanines are densely packed without long diastemata From these mandibular features, Fitzgerald 2006 concluded that in mysticetes enlarge oral cavities adapted for suction feeding evolved before mandibular adaptations for bulk filter feeding, like for example kinetic jaw joints.

The mall was last anchored by Target, and Berkshire Mall 10 (both are still open) with four vacant anchors last occupied by Best Buy, JCPenney, Macy's, and Sears. History The mall opened in September 1988. The original anchor stores at the mall were Hills (later Ames), JCPenney, Sears, Service Merchandise, and local chain Steiger's. Steiger's sold its locations to Filene's (later Macy's) in 1994. Service Merchandise closed in 1999. Two years after its closure, the mall acquired a permit to open a BJ's Wholesale Club in the space vacated by Service Merchandise. Instead, the building was torn down and replaced with Best Buy and Linens 'n Things in 2002. Ames, which closed in 2001, was replaced with a Target in 2002.

The cT programming language was largely spawned from the TUTOR (1965) and the MicroTutor (1977) programming languages. Although cT had many applications, its primary usage was 2D graphics for the classroom setting. cT was used for a variety of purposes, but its main niche was the creation of programs for education. Many prize-winning educational programs were written in cT (see VISQ), especially in the area of physics. In 1997, students at Carnegie Mellon were taught cT in a new introductory physics course created by Ruth Chabay and Bruce Sherwood. In 1998, David Scherer entered the university as a freshman and enrolled in one of the introductory physics classes that used cT. Although cT offered a relatively easy 2D graphics programming environment, Scherer saw the possibility of creating an even better tool. In the spring and summer of 2000, with the assistance of David Andersen, Ruth Chabay, Ari Heitner, Ian Peters, and Bruce Sherwood, Scherer created Visual, a module for Python that was not only easier to use than the cT programming language, but also rendered objects in three dimensions. The combination of Python plus Visual is called VPython. Further development of the cT programming language was ended and the newly created VPython was used in its place. Since VPython's creation, several versions have been released to the public. In 2016, developers announced that classic VPython would no longer be developed. Instead, development will concentrate on Glowscript and Jupyter implementations of the language. Usage VPython is a simple rendering tool for 3D objects and graphs. Its main use has been in education, but it has also been used in commercial or research settings. VPython was first used in introductory physics courses at Carnegie Mellon and then spread to other universities and eventually high schools, especially in connection with the Matter & Interactions curriculum. A related development due to David Scherer and Bruce Sherwood is GlowScript, which makes it possible to write and run VPython programs in a browser, including on mobile devices, thanks to the RapydScript Python-to-JavaScript compiler, created by Alexander Tsepkov. Programs can be written, run, and stored at glowscript.org, and the compiled-to-JavaScript code can be exported and embedded in one's own web page. John Coady has created the ivisual version for use in the IPython, now Jupyter environment, using the GlowScript WebGL graphics libraries to render 3D output in an IPython/Jupyter notebook. Rhett Allain in his Wired blog shows an example of using Trinkets to embed both editable VPython source code and 3D execution in one's own web page. Objects See the article on Python for Python syntax. This article will address several of the objects that are VPython specific. Click here for the complete documentation. The cylinder object is a good example of a simple VPython object. Here is an example of a simple cylinder as given in VPython's documentation (in older VPython implementations, the module to import is vpython, not visual): from visual import * # Import the visual module rod = cylinder(pos=(0, 2, 1), axis=(5, 0, 0), radius=1) Image:VisualRef-1.gif Some similar objects offered by the VPython 3D rendering engine are the cone, sphere, and box objects. In addition to solid objects, VPython offers graphing tools as well. Here is an example of a simple graph in VPython as given in its documentation: from visual.graph import * # Import graphing features from numpy import arange, cos, exp funct1 = gcurve(color=color.cyan) # A connected curve object for x in arange(0., 8.1, 0.1): # x goes from 0 to 8 funct1.plot(pos=(x, 5. * cos(2. * x) * exp(-0.2 * x))) # Plot References *http://www.vpython.org/ *http://www.vpython.org/contents/cTsource/cToverview.html *http://linuxgazette.net/144/john.html * Category:Articles with example Python (programming language) code Category:Python (programming language) libraries ","title":"VPython"},{"id":"7167576","text":"\\"Girl\\" was the final single released from the Time's debut album.

Founded as a major public hospital, it was shut down in August 2007 because of its poor record of patient care. The urgent care center and outpatient clinic, however, remained operating on the site. In 2014, a smaller hospital under a partnership between Los Angeles County and the University of California opened as a nonprofit organization governed by a seven-member board of directors.Jennifer Steinhauer, Deal Will Turn a Los Angeles Hospital Private, The New York Times, November 23, 2009, Accessed November 23, 2009.Molly Hennessy-Fiske, UC regents approve partnership with L.A. County to reopen King medical facility, Los Angeles Times, November 20, 2009, Accessed November 23, 2009. MLK Outpatient Center was operated by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (DHS). In the 2000s (decade), widely publicized problems related to incompetence and mismanagement caused the hospital to undergo a radical overhaul which reduced the number of beds from 233 to 42 before it finally closed.Susannah Rosenblatt, Former King/Drew scales down to smallest size, Los Angeles Times, March 1, 2007. Since 2004, 260 hospital staffers, including 41 doctors, had been fired or had resigned as a result of disciplinary proceedings. To alleviate the impact on the community of this large loss of capacity, The Los Angeles County Medical Alert Center (Felix: MAC) contracts ambulances take approximately 250 patients per month to other local hospitals. At the beginning of the 21st century and before its crisis, MLK‚ÄìMACC (then MLK/Drew) had 537 beds, was the teaching hospital of the adjacent Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, spread over a site which included a dormitory for medical residents, employed 2,238 full-time personnel, and in 2004 treated 11,000 inpatients and 167,000 outpatients. Located near high crime streets, the hospital had a very active trauma unit. In 2003, it handled 2,150 gunshot wounds and other life-threatening injuries. Because of the large number of gunshot wounds the trauma unit saw, the US military sent their trauma teams to MLK/Drew for training.  History  Founding and early history The facility's founding was spurred by the 1965 Watts Riots. In the aftermath of the unrest, Governor Pat Brown appointed a Commission to identify factors which contributed to the unrest. This result was the December 1965 McCone Report. One major finding of the report was the lack of health care access near the low income neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles. At the time, the closest major public trauma center was Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, located over ten miles (16 km) away‚Äîa problem heightened by the amount of gang violence in the area. In 1966, DHS established a task force to develop a full-service community and teaching hospital operated by the County in conjunction with the USC and UCLA Medical School as well as the newly formed Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School, a private, non- profit medical school formed to train doctors to work in areas of urban poverty. Ground was broken on the hospital in April 1968. It was originally named the Los Angeles County Southeast General Hospital but was soon renamed Martin Luther King Jr. General Hospital, days after the namesake's assassination. After a dedication in February, it opened on March 27, 1972 as a full-service medical center. The facility changed its name again, to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, when it became the teaching hospital of the adjacent Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science. In 1981 the hospital expanded into psychiatric care by opening the Augustus F. Hawkins Mental Health Center. In 1998 it expanded its trauma center. By the 1980s, King/Drew was part of the Drew/UCLA Undergraduate Medical Education Program, training physicians through a partnership of UCLA and Drew medical schools, and was a source of pride and jobs in the community. The fall of King/Drew King/Drew entered the 21st century with an array of problems related to incompetence and mismanagement. A perceived lack of quality at the hospital had earned it the nickname of \\"Killer King.\\"Charles Ornstein and Rich Connell, State moves to revoke King‚ÄìHarbor's license, Los Angeles Times, June 22, 2007. The facility employed travel nurses from across the country in an attempt to improve conditions. Troubles come to light On August 22, 2003, the Los Angeles Times reported that two women connected to cardiac monitors at King/Drew died after their deteriorating vital signs went undetected. In December 2003, DHS closed the cardiac monitoring ward at the hospital after a third patient died under questionable circumstances. A consulting group was hired to help fix issues with the nursing staff; DHS spent nearly $1 million on this effort. In a January 13, 2004 report, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined that King/Drew was out of compliance with minimum requirements for receiving federal funding, citing the work of government inspectors who identified three patients who died at King/Drew after what were determined to have been grave errors by staff members. By March, CMS declared King/Drew patients were in \\"immediate jeopardy\\" of harm or death because of medication errors at the hospital, citing numerous mistakes and threatening to pull federal government funding from the public hospital. In June, 2004 CMS again stated that patients were in jeopardy, citing the use of Taser stun guns to subdue psychiatric patients. Yet again, it threatened to pull federal funding but backed away; federal funding makes up over half of King/Drew's $400 million operating budget. Closure of the trauma center On September 13, 2004, DHS recommended the closure of King/Drew's busy trauma unit, saying the hospital needed to put its full energy into fixing problems in other areas. Soon afterward, the Los Angeles Times revealed that the American College of Surgeons had revoked its approval of the quality of King/Drew's trauma unit in 1999 and 2003 because it failed to properly investigate questionable patient deaths and that doctors routinely skipped meetings held to discuss treatment problems. Also in September, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed with CMS to hire a new consulting firm to take over operations at the hospital. By November 2004 neighborhood resistance to the proposed closures (particularly the trauma center) formed, led by U.S. Representative Maxine Waters and joined by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, actress Angela Bassett and children of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In December, 2004, CMS declared King/Drew patients were in \\"immediate jeopardy\\" for a third time. This time it cited the staff's heavy reliance on Los Angeles County Police personnel to deploy Tasers to subdue combative and violent psychiatric patients. Federal funds were again threatened, but as in previous times, action was not taken. Despite protests, negative media and the near- unanimous opposition of city political leaders, the five-member Board of Supervisors voted four to zero, with one abstention, to move forward with closure of the trauma center. A temporary restraining order was filed by a group of doctors and residents, but was denied. The trauma unit was closed in early 2005. Patients were diverted to three other hospitals, both public and private (with county subsidy). A few days later, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (now simply the Joint Commission), citing the medical center for failing to correct severe lapses in patient care, threatened to pull its seal of approval, jeopardizing over $14 million in physician training funds. King/Drew's seal of approval was revoked in February 2005.Charles Ornstein, How King‚ÄìHarbor has stayed alive, Los Angeles Times, June 12, 2007 This move gained national attention after the Los Angeles Times ran a Pulitzer Prize-winning five-part series reporting on \\"The Troubles at King/Drew.\\" The series found that the problems at the hospital were far deeper than the public already knew and faulted the Board of Supervisors for shying away from making needed changes, often because of racial politics. Among the other findings was that King/Drew spent more per patient than any of the three other general hospitals run by Los Angeles County, the opposite of what many hospital supporters had assumed. Problems for King/Drew became even worse over a period of four days in March, 2005, when three patients died as a result of mistakes and lapses in medical care. The Board of Supervisors considered severing the hospital's relationship with Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science and partnering with another medical school such as UCLA, USC or Loma Linda University. Then, in April the Los Angeles Times reported a seventh death attributed to lapses in care by the hospital. This time, nurses and staff virtually ignored the audio and visual cues of vital-sign monitors over a period of hours. \\"Make-or-break\\" inspection After the three previous warning holding King/Drew out of compliance with federal guidelines since January 2004, CMS and federal authorities held an unannounced, last-chance inspection of the hospital that began on July 31, 2006 and was finished on August 10. On September 22, CMS informed King/Drew that the hospital still did not meet minimum patient-care standards, failing nine of the government's twenty-three conditions for federal funding, and thus failing the final, \\"make-or-break\\" inspection. Federal regulators identified problems in nursing, pharmacy, infection control, surgical services, rehabilitation services, quality control, patients' rights and the hospital's governing body and physical plant. Inspectors found more problems during the final inspection than they had at any time in the previous three years.  King/Drew becomes King‚ÄìHarbor   Radical restructuring  DHS elected to move forward with a radical restructuring plan that eliminated the hospital's specialty services, severed its relationship with the Drew medical school, and proposed to place it under the management of Harbor‚ÄìUCLA Medical Center (Harbor‚ÄìUCLA). The plan downsized and refocused the hospital on community medical care, including emergency department and outpatient services; the two central pillars of the plan were identifying and removing under-performing staff and integrating the two hospitals \\"under one medical management and administrative leadership team at Harbor‚ÄìUCLA.\\"Rich Connell, Robert J. Lopez and Susannah Rosenblatt, King‚ÄìHarbor efforts faltering, Los Angeles Times, June 19, 2007. King/Drew became King‚ÄìHarbor to reflect the change. All employees of the hospital were interviewed, with half permitted to stay and the rest transferred to other hospitals. Approximately 1,400 employees remained. As a result of these measures, Medicare agreed to continue funding the hospital until March 31, 2007. After further negotiations, federal inspectors agreed to delay inspection until August 2007. King/Harbor had to pass this inspection. Otherwise federal funding would end on November 30, 2007. As a part of the March deal with the federal government, Los Angeles County agreed not to bill Medicare for hospital services until August 2007, giving it time to fix problems at the hospital.Charles Ornstein and Robert J. Lopez, King‚ÄìHarbor ordered to fix problems or else, Los Angeles Times, June 8, 2007. If federal funding ended, among other problems, MLK‚ÄìHarbor would permanently lose 250 medical resident slots, 15% of the 1,700 in Los Angeles County.Susannah Rosenblatt, Hospital could lose 250 resident positions, Los Angeles Times, March 1, 2007. On March 6, 2007, officials from Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science announced they were suing Los Angeles County for $125 million for breach of contract, claiming that the restructuring of the hospital terminated support to 248 medical residents and gutted the adjacent university.Susannah Rosenblatt, Medical school to sue L.A. County, Los Angeles Times, March 7, 2007. The two entities had collaborated since 1972. In response, Los Angeles County Board Supervisor Mike Antonovich stated \\"Drew University will fail in court as they failed as a medical school.\\" Problems surface again Despite initially upbeat official reports from hospital officials,Rich Connell and Susannah Rosenblatt, King status reports were upbeat, Los Angeles Times, June 9, 2007. King‚ÄìHarbor found itself under public criticism once again after different stories ran in both the Los Angeles TimesCharles Ornstein, Tale of last 90 minutes of woman's life, Los Angeles Times, May 20, 2007.Charles Ornstein and Francisco Vara- Orta, Tragic Catch-911 for dying woman, Los Angeles Times, June 13, 2007. and LA WeeklyCeleste Fremon, Escaping With His Life , LA Weekly, May 23, 2007. in late May 2007 citing serious lapses in care, one of which was fatal, at the renamed hospital. In particular, the case of patient Edith Isabel Rodriguez, who bled to death on the emergency room floor after being ignored for forty- five minutes, became a cause c√©l√®bre of the failures and bureaucratic indifference of King‚ÄìHarbor as well as political and health leaders in Los Angeles, creating or reinforcing fears that the health care system could not take care of people in a time of dire need. In response to public outcry, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.) asked federal regulators to address how they will protect patients at King‚ÄìHarbor in light of \\"horrific\\" and \\"appalling\\" lapses in patient care. The news reports prompted a multi-day inspection by state and federal officials, and on June 7, 2007, federal health officials declared that King‚ÄìHarbor had put emergency department patients in \\"immediate jeopardy\\" of harm or death, that it remained in violation of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, and gave it twenty-three days to fix the problems or lose federal funding once and for all. During the inspection, CMS found that 17 patients, among 60 whose cases were reviewed, received substandard care at the hospital.Charles Ornstein, Report details risks to patients' lives, Los Angeles Times, June 19, 2007. If the problems were resolved in that timeline, the hospital still could have lost its federal certification because it had failed to meet the terms of a March agreement with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Despite multiple threats from the government, experts in hospital accreditation cite the federal government's relatively tempered response due to the hospital's unique history and special standing in the community, as well as its support from African American politicians. On June 12, 2007, the Los Angeles Times reported that King‚ÄìHarbor had replaced its chief medical officer, Dr. Roger Peeks, who had been brought in to fix problems three years earlier.Susannah Rosenblatt and Rich Connell, King‚ÄìHarbor medical chief is ousted; nursing woes are disclosed, Los Angeles Times, June 12, 2007. During a June 18, 2007 meeting with the County Board of Supervisors, county health officials disclosed that they were still unable to meet the cornerstone pledges they had made to CMS: only about one-third of the 1,200 employees they initially projected would be shifted to other institutions had actually been reassigned, and significant control had not been effectively handed off to Harbor‚ÄìUCLA. In April, 60% of 285 registered and licensed vocational nurses failed one or more parts of basic clinical competency assessments; while more than 10% failed three or more sections of the assessment. The staff of Harbor‚ÄìUCLA was surprised by the amount of training King‚ÄìHarbor employees needed. On June 21, 2007, the state California Department of Health Services (CDHS) moved to revoke the license of King‚ÄìHarbor.Kathleen Billingsley, Letter to Dr. Bruce Chernoff, Re: Martin Luther King/Harbor Hospital License (Archive), California Department of Health Services, June 21, 2007. The process, supported by state politicians including Gov. Schwarzenegger, could take six months to a year and would force the hospital's closure. CDHS could rescind the action if the hospital was able to show that it met state and federal standards.State Department of Health Services Initiates Action to Revoke Martin Luther King‚ÄìHarbor Hospital‚Äôs License , California Department of Health Services, June 21, 2007. There remained serious concerns over how King‚ÄìHarbor's 47,000 annual emergency department visits might be spread across the system with minimum disruption if the hospital were to close. In response to the state's decision, Los Angeles County Supervisors considered having the county close the hospital ahead of the state,Charles Ornstein and Jack Leonard, Vote on closing King‚ÄìHarbor anticipated, Los Angeles Times, June 23, 2007. hoping to thereby formulate and implement an orderly plan for diverting patients and, by suspending King‚ÄìHarbor instead of allowing it to lose its state license, making an easier task reopening it.Jack Leonard, Burke silent as panel debates hospital's fate, Los Angeles Times, June 26, 2007. The County ultimately decided to not move for County closure. The hospital received a brief reprieve when a June 25, 2007 inspection showed critical problems with its emergency department identified earlier in the month had been corrected, preserving federal certification and funding for the hospital until August 2007, when it must pass a broader federal review. The weeklong federal inspection began on July 23, 2007. The next day, inspectors from CMS once again cited King‚ÄìHarbor for placing patients in \\"immediate jeopardy\\" of harm, hours after a psychiatric patient cut herself with a scalpel in an emergency department bathroom.Susannah Rosenblatt and Charles Ornstein, U.S. cites King‚ÄìHarbor for poor care, Los Angeles Times, 26 July 2007. Closure On August 10, 2007, after the hospital failed a comprehensive review by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, federal officials decided to revoke $200 million in funding.Charles Ornstein, Tracy Weber and Jack Leonard, King‚ÄìHarbor fails final check, will close soon, Los Angeles Times, August 11, 2007. Inspectors concluded that there was no functioning quality improvement plan at the hospital.Jack Leonard, King‚ÄìHarbor inspection report released, Los Angeles Times, August 14, 2007. Los Angeles County health director Dr. Bruce Chernof moved quickly to notify the county Board of Supervisors of his decision to begin shutting down the facility. The emergency department was closed by 7 p.m. that day and ambulances were diverted to other area hospitals. The rest of the hospital was closed by August 27, 2007. Some of King‚ÄìHarbor's 1 600 employees would likely be reassigned to jobs at other county facilities. On August 13, at a specially convened board meeting, LA County supervisors voted unanimously to shut inpatient services and promised to pay up to $16.3 million to nearby private hospitals and doctors bracing for a deluge of patients from the closed facility. They also released the 124-page report by federal inspectors that detailed dozens of errors and failures by the hospital during their final make-or-break review. The citations included improperly sterilized medical equipment, nurses who could not rapidly find medication, a nurse who did not know how to mix medication in an emergency, and a patient who complained of severe chest pain but was not given pain medication for four and a half hours. With the hospital closed, the facility continued to operate as the Martin Luther King Jr. Multi-Service Ambulatory Care Center, an urgent care facility and outpatient clinic. Ramifications of closure The closure of King‚ÄìHarbor had an immediate effect on health care services in the region. Nine nearby hospitals were declared \\"impacted\\" by the distribution of former King‚ÄìHarbor patients. The greatest burden fell on St. Francis Medical Center in nearby Lynwood, which expanded its emergency department by 14 beds and saw an increase in patients from 155 per day to 180 per day, with the intensive care unit seeing an average rise from 26 patients to 33. Nearby clinics have also been impacted. The nine clinics that are part of the St. John's Well Child and Family Centers saw a 157 percent increase in visits since King‚ÄìHarbor closed. Meanwhile, the remaining outpatient clinic at King‚ÄìHarbor has seen patient totals fall well below the target of 190,000 visits a year due to the negative reputation of the facility. As King‚ÄìHarbor was long a major hospital for the city's sickest and poorest residents, the increase in uninsured and under-insured patients has put major stress on the financial health of relieving institutions.Jennifer Steinhauser, A City Where Hospitals Are as Ill as the Patients, The New York Times, June 5, 2008, Accessed June 6, 2008. With the closure of the hospital, South Los Angeles has one hospital bed per 1,000 residents, compared with a national average of three beds per 1,000 residents. New replacement hospital As soon as MLK‚ÄìHarbor was closed, efforts were begun to find a way to reopen the facility as soon as possible. Los Angeles County officials originally planned a 2009 reopening, but that proved unfeasible. The County found a partnership with the University of California system to reopen the hospital as a nonprofit organization governed by a seven-member board of directors; the hospital would no longer be run by the county. The board of directors would consist of two appointees chosen by the university system, two chosen by county officials, and three chosen jointly. The county was to contribute $50 million annually to cover expenses and operating costs and $13.3 million a year toward the care of uninsured patients. The county would continue to staff and operate the hospital's outpatient services center, which has remained open. The hospital, now named Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital opened on 7 July 2015. The new nonprofit entity handles all hiring for the Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital. This had been a major point of negotiation because the hospital staff had gained a reputation for being packed with people politically connected to various elected officials, leading to criticism that problems with hospital staff tended to be ignored. At the time of its closure it had about 11.5 workers per bed, compared with the statewide average of four workers per bed. Civil service rules and labor contracts would have required former MLK‚ÄìHarbor employees to be given first chance at a replacement hospital if it were directly owned and operated by Los Angeles County. Chartering the replacement hospital under a Section 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization made it a distinct entity from the County, unencumbered by legacy hiring rules. The hospital reopened as a smaller facility, with 131 beds instead of 233 (compared to 537 at its height). It has an emergency department and four operating rooms. The UC system provides fourteen to twenty physicians and medical oversight for the inpatient hospital, with a goal of eventually providing medical residents to again train there. Other improvements are an upgraded central plant, new emergency generators, and two new buildings, one with six out-patient surgeries and a dental clinic, with an estimated total cost of more than $350 million.

An expert shorthand writer (one of few men of his time who represented that skill), he became a very close friend of future President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, and during the famous Lincoln‚ÄìDouglas debates of 1858, at the request of Lincoln, Hitt served as a shorthand note- taker. Lincoln's legal days in Chicago is when he had first employed Hitt. In 1872, Hitt was a personal secretary for Indiana Senator Oliver P. Morton, In December 1874, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him First Secretary of the American Legation in Paris; he served from 1874 to 1881, and as Charg√© d'Affaires a part of that time. Hitt's former home in Washington, D.C. He was United States Assistant Secretary of State under James G. Blaine during President James A. Garfield and President Chester A. Arthur's Administrations in 1881 and was elected to represent Illinois' 5th district in the United States House of Representatives in 1882. Hitt became Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs at the beginning of the Fifty-first Congress and from the Fifty-fourth to Fifty-ninth Congresses. When the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 came up for renewal in 1892, he argued against the alien documentation provisions of the bill: \\"Never before in a free country was there such a system of tagging a man, like a dog to be caught by the police and examined, and if his tag or collar is not all right, taken to the pound or drowned and shot. Never before was it applied by a free people to a human being, with the exception (which we can never refer to with pride) of the sad days of slavery. ‚Ä¶\\"23 Cong. Rec. 3923 (1892). He was appointed in July 1898, by President William McKinley, as a member of the commission created by the Newlands Resolution to establish government in the Territory of Hawaii. During the last years of his life, he was Regent of the Smithsonian Institution. He died on September 20, 1906. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Mount Morris, Illinois, along with his parents. Hitt is the namesake of the community of Hitt, Missouri.

It is managed by Simon Property Group, who owns 94.4% of it, and is anchored by Bloomingdale's in two locations, with the Women's store located at the west end and the Men's Home & Furnishing store anchoring the east end. These are the only Bloomingdale's locations in Massachusetts. History The Shops at Chestnut Hill, formerly known as The Mall at Chestnut Hill, was built into the side of a hill in 1974 and as such had ground level access on both of its two floors. A Bloomingdale's Home Furnishings store had opened at the site in 1973,The New York Times, November 28, 1970, page 40, \\"Site in Boston Area; New Store is Set by Boomingdale\\" while the two-story mall itself and a Filene's store opened in 1974. The Filene's had relocated from a neighboring 1950s-era location in the Chestnut Hill Shopping Center (which became the headquarters of General Cinema in 1975, later becoming the location of The Container Store and an AMC Theatres, which closed in 2012). Filene's expanded in size to in 1980 with the addition of a third floor, while the mall's Bloomingdale's home store added its own third floor and was reconfigured to include a men's department to complement a women's store it had opened across the street in 1978 at the Chestnut Hill Shopping Center. In 1998 locally based S.R. Weiner & Associates assumed a long-term lease on the mall property from developer C&R; Realty.The Boston Globe, November 5, 1998, page C9, \\"Newton firm to run Mall at Chestnut Hill\\" In December 2001 S.R. Weiner in its turn assigned management as well as sold part of its leasehold in the mall to Rodamco North America, N.V.The Boston Globe, December 22, 2001, page C1, \\"ECO/S.R. Weiner sells to Rodamco\\" A few months later, with the break-up of Rodamco, Simon Property Group acquired management and an interest in the mall's leasehold. The mall's structure and anchors remained essentially intact from 1980 until 2005, when May Department Stores (the then parent of Filene's) was acquired by Federated Department Stores (the owner of Bloomingdale's). In March 2006, Federated closed the Filene's store and spent the better part of the year renovating the space. In November 2006 Bloomingdale's relocated its Women's store from the adjacent Chestnut Hill Shopping Center to the former Filene's, thereby giving The Mall at Chestnut Hill a Bloomingdale's at both the east and west ends. The mall was renovated in the fall of 2006 to coincide with the opening of the expanded Bloomingdale's. In addition to adding more chairs and sitting areas, a large handicapped-accessible elevator was installed in the central atrium close to the main, Route 9, entrance. The Apple Store location moved from its original location into a much larger one, re-openeing on March 26, 2016, sporting the newest Apple store design language. The first Massachusetts location of Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana opened in December 2015 on the second level at the main entrance. A Simon- operated Starbucks opened Summer 2016 nearby, at the same entrance.

The causative organism of Pneumocystis pneumonia, it is an important human pathogen, particularly among immunocompromised hosts. Prior to its discovery as a human-specific pathogen, P. jirovecii was known as P. carinii. Lifecycle The complete lifecycles of any of the species of Pneumocystis are not known, but presumably all resemble the others in the genus. The terminology follows zoological terms, rather than mycological terms, reflecting the initial misdetermination as a protozoan parasite. It is an extracellular fungus. All stages are found in lungs and because they cannot be cultured ex vivo, direct observation of living Pneumocystis is difficult. The trophozoite stage is thought to be equivalent to the so-called vegetative state of other species (such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe) which, like Pneumocystis, belong to the Taphrinomycotina branch of the fungal kingdom. The trophozoite stage is single-celled and appears amoeboid (multilobed) and closely associated with host cells. Globular cysts eventually form that have a thicker wall. Within these ascus-like cysts, eight spores form which are released through rupture of the cyst wall. The cysts often collapse forming crescent-shaped bodies visible in stained tissue. Whether meiosis takes place within the cysts, or what the genetic status is of the various cell types is not known for certain. Homothallism The lifecycle of P. jirovecii is thought to include both asexual and sexual phases. Asexual multiplication of haploid cells likely occurs by binary fission. The mode of sexual reproduction appears to be primary homothallism, a form of self-fertilization. The sexual phase takes place in the host's lungs. This phase is presumed to involve formation of a diploid zygote, followed by meiosis, and then production of an ascus containing the products of meiosis, eight haploid ascospores. The ascospores may be disseminated by airborne transmission to new hosts. Medical relevance Pneumocystis pneumonia is an important disease of immunocompromised humans, particularly patients with HIV, but also patients with an immune system that is severely suppressed for other reasons, for example, following a bone marrow transplant. In humans with a normal immune system, it is an extremely common silent infection. Identified by methenamine silver stain of lung tissue, type I pneumocytes, and type II pneumocytes over- replicate and damage alveolar epithelium, causing death by asphyxiation. Fluid leaks into alveoli, producing an exudate seen as honeycomb/cotton candy appearance on hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Drug of choice is Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, pentamidine, or dapsone. In HIV patients, most cases occur when the CD4 count is below 200 cells per microliter. Nomenclature At first, the name Pneumocystis carinii was applied to the organisms found in both rats and humans, as the parasite was not yet known to be host-specific. In 1976, the name \\"Pneumocystis jiroveci\\" was proposed for the first time, to distinguish the organism found in humans from variants of Pneumocystis in other animals. The organism was named thus in honor of Czech parasitologist Otto Jirovec, who described Pneumocystis pneumonia in humans in 1952. After DNA analysis showed significant differences in the human variant, the proposal was made again in 1999 and has come into common use. The name was spelled according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, since the organism was believed to be a protozoan. After it became clear that it was a fungus, the name was changed to Pneumocystis jirovecii, according to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICNafp), which requires such names be spelled with double i (ii). Both spellings are commonly used, but according to the ICNafp, P. jirovecii is correct. A change in the ICNafp now recognizes the validity of the 1976 publication, making the 1999 proposal redundant, and cites Pneumocystis and P. jiroveci as examples of the change in ICN Article 45, Ex 7. The name P. jiroveci is typified (both lectotypified and epitypified) by samples from human autopsies dating from the 1960s. The term PCP, which was widely used by practitioners and patients, has been retained for convenience, with the rationale that it now stands for the more general Pneumocystis pneumonia rather than Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The name P. carinii is incorrect for the human variant, but still describes the species found in rats, and that name is typified by an isolate from rats. Pneumocystis genome Pneumocystis species cannot be grown in culture. Therefore, the availability of the human disease-causing agent, P. jirovecii, is limited. Hence, investigation of the whole genome of a Pneumocystis is largely based upon true P. carinii available from experimental rats which can be maintained with infections. Genetic material of other species, such as P. jirovecii, can be compared to the genome of P. carinii. The genome of P. jirovecii has been sequenced from a bronchoalveolar lavage sample. The genome is small, low in G+C content, and lacks most amino-acid biosynthesis enzymes. History The earliest report of this genus appears to have been that of Carlos Chagas in 1909, who discovered it in experimental animals, but confused it with part of the lifecycle of Trypanosoma cruzi (causal agent of Chagas disease) and later called both organisms Schizotrypanum cruzi, a form of trypanosome infecting humans. The rediscovery of Pneumocystis cysts was reported by Antonio Carini in 1910, also in Brazil. The genus was again discovered in 1912 by Delano√´ and Delano√´, this time at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, who found it in rats and proposed the genus and species name Pneumocystis carinii after Carini. Pneumocystis was redescribed as a human pathogen in 1942 by two Dutch investigators, van der Meer and Brug, who found it in three new cases: a 3-month-old infant with congenital heart disease and in two of 104 autopsy cases - a 4-month-old infant and a 21-year-old adult. There being only one described species in the genus, they considered the human parasite to be P. carinii. Nine years later (1951), Dr. Josef Vanek at Charles University in Prague, Czechoslovakia, showed in a study of lung sections from 16 children that the organism labelled \\"P. carinii\\" was the causative agent of pneumonia in these children. The following year, J√≠rovec reported \\"P. carinii\\" as the cause of interstitial pneumonia in neonates. Following the realization that Pneumocystis from humans could not infect experimental animals such as rats, and that the rat form of Pneumocystis differed physiologically and had different antigenic properties, Frenkel was the first to recognize the human pathogen as a distinct species. He named it \\"Pneumocystis jiroveci\\" (corrected to P. jirovecii - see nomenclature above). Controversy existed over the relabeling of P. carinii in humans as P. jirovecii, which is why both names still appear in publications. However, only the name P. jirovecii is used exclusively for the human pathogen, whereas the name P. carinii has had a broader application to many species. Frenkel and those before him believed that all Pneumocystis were protozoans, but soon afterwards evidence began accumulating that Pneumocystis was a fungal genus. Recent studies show it to be an unusual, in some ways a primitive genus of Ascomycota, related to a group of yeasts. Every tested primate, including humans, appears to have its own type of Pneumocystis that is incapable of cross-infecting other host species and has co-evolved with each species. Currently, only five species have been formally named: P. jirovecii from humans, P. carinii as originally named from rats, P. murina from mice, P. wakefieldiae also from rats, and P. oryctolagi from rabbits. Historical and even recent reports of P. carinii from humans are based upon older classifications (still used by many, or those still debating the recognition of distinct species in the genus Pneumocystis) which does not mean that the true P. carinii from rats actually infects humans. In an intermediate classification system, the various taxa in different mammals have been called formae speciales or forms. For example, the human \\"form\\" was called Pneumocystis carinii f. [or f. sp.] hominis, while the original rat infecting form was called Pneumocystis carinii f. [or f. sp.] carinii. This terminology is still used by some researchers. The species of Pneumocystis originally seen by Chagas have not yet been named as distinct species. Many other undescribed species presumably exist and those that have been detected in many mammals are only known from molecular sample detection from lung tissue or fluids, rather than by direct physical observation. Currently, they are cryptic taxa.

Thousands of copies in both French and English were also distributed in Thailand. The quality of the Thai forgeries was found to be superior to that of the Belgian version. Plot The plot opens on a rainy and cold night in Marlinspike Hall. The occupants, Tintin and Captain Haddock are unhappy and financially broke, since there are no new Tintin adventures for them because of the death of their creator, Herg√©. (This is the first of many self-references the plot makes.) As they discuss their plight, Jolyon Wagg's wife arrives and ask them to go to Thailand to search for her husband, who went there on a trip he won from his employer, the Rock Bottom Insurance Company, and never returned. She had already sent Thomson and Thompson to look, but without any results. Since it is an all expenses paid trip, Tintin and Haddock immediately accept and are soon on their way to Thailand. Nestor, Snowy and the cat are left behind, but Professor Calculus joins them. As they check into their Bangkok hotel, they are spotted by Derek Dimwit, a representative of the Marlinsprick Company which holds the rights to the Tintin franchise. He calls his head office and is told he must stop them from going on any more adventures that could be used in a book not controlled by Marlinsprick. Tintin and his friends go to the red light district, where they run into General Alcazar, now the owner of a Thailand bar after being deposed by General Tapioca. Alcazar tells them he saw Jolyon Wagg in his bar, but he has gone north to Chiang Mai with a kathoey (transsexual). Calculus and Haddock both pick up prostitutes in the bar, but Tintin prefers the company of a young boy instead (This is a reference to questions by fans regarding Tintin's sexuality in the original books). The next day the adventurers fly north and soon run into Thomson and Thompson. The Thompson twins do not want anyone to find Wagg, since they are enjoying themselves in Thailand at Mrs. Wagg's expense. However, they pick up the trail and Wagg, who is living outside Chiang Mai. They learn he no longer enjoys the company of his kathoey partner. Wagg longs for his wife's cooking, in particular her rabbit marinated in beer. After a series of misadventures, they all find themselves back in Chiang Mai in time to celebrate the new year of 2000. The story ends with Tintin being presented the first copy of Tintin in Thailand. He declares the proceeds will guarantee him many peaceful days in the sun. Arrests In February 2001, the Herg√© Foundation learned about Bud E. Weyser's attempts to market Tintin in Thailand as an unknown Tintin book to distributors in Belgium. The Belgian police organized a sting, with an officer pretending to be a prospective buyer; two arrests were made in Tournai. They also arrested the designer in Antwerp. The men confessed to printing more than 1,000 copies for sale in Belgium, and the 650 copies found were seized. All three men were subsequently released. Copies of Tintin in Thailand can still occasionally be found in Bangkok. However, the Herg√© Foundation takes quick action to remove copies that are posted online.

He was proud of his nationality and of his faith, and this pride was expressed in action whenever and wherever the opportunity arose.\\" Devereux founded St. Bonaventure University. Background Nicholas Devereux was born June 7, 1791, the son of Thomas and Catherine (Corish) Devereux, of County Wexford, Ireland. They had six sons and three daughters. Originally of Norman French extraction, they were wealthy and well connected, and lived at ease on their handsome estate, \\"The Leap\\", at Davidstown, near Enniscorthy. They sympathized warmly with and took an aggressive part in the agitations preceding the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and on the defeat of the patriots or rebels the family was ruined. Thomas Devereux was arrested and imprisoned and pardoned just before his death. A price was set upon the heads of three of his sons and his estates were confiscated. The eldest son, Walter, was a man of powerful frame, distinguished for his strength and courage. The second son was John Corish Devereux, who during the agitation preceding the rebellion was obliged to fly from the country; he went first to France and afterwards to America. Thomas married Mary Redmond and they had one son, John C., Jr., who was afterwards adopted by Thomas's brother, John C. Devereux, of Utica. The fourth son, James, was killed at the Battle of Vinegar Hill. The fifth son, Luke, came to America and died of yellow fever at Natchez, Mississippi in 1818. Nicholas was the sixth son.Wager, Daniel. Our County and Its People, Part II: Biography. Boston: The Boston History Company, 1896 One of his sisters became the Superior of the Presentation convent in Enniscorthy. John Corish Devereux, Nicholas's older brother, came to America in 1796 or 1797 and settled in Utica, New York in 1802. There he opened a dry goods and grocery store; the business prospered and became one of the most extensive in Western New York. A courtly and polished gentleman, John C. Devereux was most noted for his charity and hospitality. He was a devout Catholic, but contributed generously to many charities and denominations. He was the first mayor of Utica elected by the people, in 1840. Twice married, he had no children, adopted his nephew, John C. Devereux, Jr., son of his brother Thomas. Life In 1806, at the age of fifteen, Nicholas Devereux emigrated to join his brother John, who had previously settled in Utica, New York. On the first Sunday following his arrival he attended Mass in St. Peter's, Barclay Street, and put on the plate one of his last three gold coins, Kernan, Thomas. \\"Nicholas Devereux.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 16 (Index). New York: The Encyclopedia Press, 1914. 24 July 2019 The sexton thought it as an offering of thanks for his safe trip to America. He was employed as a clerk for his brother until going to work for William James and Company in Albany, New York. James had emigrated from Bailieborough, County Cavan, Ireland around 1789, and amassed a vast fortune from business dealings in upstate New York State, primarily in Albany real estate, money lending, and his involvement with the building of the Erie Canal. William James also owned a salt company, a tobacco factory and a Hudson River shipping operation.Grondahl, Paul. \\"James Family Plot (1771-1832): Patriarch William James and relatives of novelist Henry James\\", Times-Union, December 5, 2013 In 1814, Devereux returned to Utica and went into partnership with his brother in a firm that after his brother retired in 1816, became \\"Devereux & Co\\".Demetreu, Danielle. \\"Nicholas Devereux\\", St. Bonaventure University Archives, 2006 The firm was one of the largest in Western New York. In 1821 Nicholas and his brother, John purchased the land above the canal between Genesee and Hotel streets, where they erected a large store and warehouse. Mr. Devereux was very successful as a merchant. In the fall of 1827 the firm was called on to pay $90,000 within ninety days. At that time he was living in a handsome place which he purchased from Jeremiah Van Rensselaer. Devereux divided the beautiful grounds into lots, intersecting them by streets, and sold them at a handsome profit. In 1835, he bought from the Holland Land Company over 400,000 acres in Western New York of what remained of the Holland Purchase, including much of the territory of Cattaraugus, Allegany, and Wyoming counties. He was mainly instrumental in procuring the establishment at Utica of the first branch of the United States Bank that was located west of Albany. His brother was appointed president of the Utica branch of the United States Bank and held the position as long as the bank existed. As the Devereux brothers were successful business, many people with relatively small savings would seek their advice regarding possible investments. By 1821 a custom had developed whereby they would leave money with the brothers for safekeeping. Even after both had retired from active business, they retained a bookkeeper at the Devereux office at 12 Bleeker Street, to keep track of accounts. In 1839, Nicholas decided it was time to form a corporation to carry on this work. They founded the Utica Savings Bank, for which they obtained a charter. John was elected president. At first the bank was operated from Nicholas Devereux's office, a vacant shop where the corporation secretary, Stalham Williams would receive deposits. Passbooks were kept on shelves behind the shop counter. On the wall was a gauge for measuring height for the purposes of identification, and a detailed physical description of each depositor was maintained in a memorandum book. In 1868, the bank moved to new quarters on the corner of Genesee and Fayette streets.\\"The Savings Bank of Utica\\", United States Investor, Vol. 34, Part 2, Issues 27-52, September 15, 1923 Largely through his efforts the State Hospital was located in Utica and he was a member of the first board of managers. He was a director in the Utica Steam Woolen Mills and of the New York Life and Trust Company. In the interest of the New York Life and Trust Company he spent some time in Albany and while there took an active part in the organization of the Utica and Schenectady Railroad, of which he became a director. He owned at various times large quantities of real estate in Utica and Western New York and in the vicinity of Scranton, Pennsylvania. He held at one time title to over 50,000 acres of land in that State. As a financier and director, he was involved in the Utica Water Works, and also the Steam Woolen Mills of Utica. The mill, which employed about 100 people, manufactured broadcloth. According to Francis Kernan, \\"Nicholas Devereux was very charitable and hospitable ‚Äî a cultured, pious, progressive Irish-American. He was proud of his nationality and of his faith, and this pride was expressed in action whenever and wherever the opportunity arose.\\" Nicholas Devereux died at Utica, New York, 29 Dec., 1855. Family Devereux became acquainted with the family of Dr.Benjamin Butler (a surgeon) on his business trips to New York. He married their daughter Mary Dolbear Butler on November 28, 1817. They had six children. His daughter Hannah married United States Senator Francis Kernan; his daughter Mary became a Sister of Mercy and laboured for thirty years in the convents in Houston and 81st streets, New York. His son, John C. Devereux, assisted in managing his father's extensive properties. In 1831, his family was subject to a dangerous case of influenza. While it appears that the members of the Devereux household survived, the attending physician, Dr. Alexander Coventry succumbed to the illness, leaving behind seven sons and four daughters.Bagg, Moses Mears. Memorial History of Utica, N.Y.: From Its Settlement to the Present Time, D. Mason, 1892, p. 40 Philanthropy Devereux was an ardent Catholic, and a generous philanthropist. Nicholas Devereux was a lover of the Holy Scripture and read the entire Bible through seventeen times. To circulate the New Testament he had an edition of it printed at Utica at his own expense. The plates of this edition were afterwards purchased by Messrs. Sadlier, of New York, and about 40,000 copies printed. Devereux taught Sunday-school in St. John's Church, Utica, and gave a copy of the New Testament to any boy or girl who memorized the Gospel of St. John. In 1843, the Devereux brothers were among the founding trustees of St. John's Orphan Asylum, staffed by the Daughters of Charity from Emmitsburg, Maryland.Cookinham, Henry. History of Oneida County Vol 1, S.J. Clarke Publishing Company, 1912 In 1854 he founded Assumption Academy and saw it staffed by the Christian Brothers, who later ran St. Vincent's orphanage. It became St. Vincent's Industrial School. A noted instance of his spontaneous generosity refers back to the early days of the Church in Connecticut. Happening to be at Hartford one Sunday he learned that owing to the bigotry and Know Nothing sentiment in the town, it was impossible for the parishioners to obtain a certain piece of property for their church, as they were too few and too poor to provide the ready cash demanded. Devereux, though a stranger, did not need to be appealed to, he immediately advanced the required sum of $10,000, without asking or receiving any assurance that the money would ever be returned to him, though the grateful pioneer Catholics did in fact repay him later. He founded St. Bonaventure University in Allegany, New York on 200 acres of land that he had himself donated. With John Timon, the Bishop of Buffalo, he was instrumental in inviting a group of Franciscan brothers from Italy, to minister to the growing Catholic population of Western New York and to teach at the new university. He visited Rome in 1854 accompanied by his wife, his daughter Mary, and Rev. Michael Clarke and brought returned with six Franciscan Fathers and gave them $5,000 towards building the friary.\\"Our Province\\", The Order of Friars Minor, Province of the Immaculate Conception The largest residence hall on the St. Bonaventure University campus is named Devereux Hall in his honor.

The island is in diameter at the base of its summit and is also referred to as \\"Hat Island\\" due to the summit's shape. The limestone cliffs, some in height, of the guyot and the rest of the island are covered in dense tropical jungle. Geography Vatu Vara is located west of Mago Island and some south-west of Vanua Balavu at Lat: 17¬∞ 26'00 S Long: 179¬∞ 31'00 W. The volcanic and limestone island is nearly in diameter at its base. Its 1973 summit, the highest in Lau, is a massive truncated pyramid bounded on all sides by almost perpendicular cliffs up to in height. The crest of the pyramid is some in extent, and is generally flat, although pitted with holes and depressions from deep, some of them filled with water. At its base there is in most places a wide belt of gently sloping land, standing not more than above sea level, and forming the brim of the hat suggesting the island's profile. On the northern and eastern edges of the island the sea breaks against the limestone cliffs, which are deeply undercut; but elsewhere the island is circled by a broad fringing reef, which, off the western coast swings sharply away from the shore to enclose the lagoon. The precipitous sides of the central mass are scored by three shallow terraces, marking pauses in the uplift of the island; but these are not readily observed, being smothered under the dense vegetation that clothes the whole towering structure. The island is a former atoll, specifically called a ‚ÄúGuyot‚Äù. This is an extinct volcano that has become overgrown by coral reefs to form an atoll. The flat top was once at sea level, hence the flat summit. Its distinctive size and hat-like shape is recognizable from over away, including from nearby islands such as Kaibu, Yacata, and Vanua Balavu. The island is privately owned by James Jannard. Vakatawa kei Vatuvara (Guardian of Vatuvara) The traditional mythical guardian of Vatu Vara is a sea goddess (or nymph) named Sakulawe.

In 2006 they won the FA Women's Premier League Northern Division and were promoted to the FA Women's Premier League National Division, where they played until relegation in the 2010‚Äì11 season. In 2018‚Äì19 they won promotion to second highest level league of English football. History Early days The ladies' club was formed in 1991 as part of Blackburn Rovers' community programme, and reached the Northern Combination Women's Football League in 1998. After a few years in mid-table, the club began to take off in 2002. They moved into their parent club's lavish training facility at Brockhall Village, England youth striker Katie Anderton arrived from Tranmere Rovers and manager Marek Walsh demoted himself in favour of 25-year-old coaching prodigy Andy McNally. In 2003‚Äì04 Rovers won the Northern Combination by winning every match, and also added the Lancashire County Cup. The following season they finished a creditable third in the Premier League Northern Division. Prior to the 2005‚Äì06 campaign, Rovers signed England Under-21 players Kay Hawke from Curzon Ashton and Lynda Shepherd from Stockport County. The club then won the league by finishing undefeated, with a record 20 wins from 22 games. McNally won FA Manager of the Year award, the first person from outside the top-flight to do so, while during the season Lynda Shepherd was called into a training camp with the senior England squad. Women's Premier League National Division Clitheroe F.C. ground at Shawbridge For the club's first season at the top-level, Rovers arranged to play their home games at Clitheroe FC's Shawbridge ground. The squad was strengthened with the signing of Leeds United full-back Mel Cook and England striker Amanda Barr, from Charlton Athletic. In October 2006 the club lost 6‚Äì3 to Chelsea in the Premier League Cup amidst farcical scenes. The controversial performance of the 20-year-old referee saw him leave Shawbridge under police escort, while Andy McNally was sent-off and subsequently banned for a month by the FA for foul and abusive language. Despite several senior players demanding his return, McNally was suspended by his employers Blackburn Rovers and replaced with Adam Lakeland in January 2007. Although Amanda Barr also departed in January, to Leeds United, Blackburn rallied to finish in the top half of the table and reach the semi-final of the FA Women's Cup, where they lost 0‚Äì1 to Charlton Athletic. 34-goal striker Katie Anderton and goalkeeper Kay Hawke were both selected for the England squad at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. However, neither made the final 2007 World Cup squad. Anderton spent the summer playing in the United States, for FC Indiana. Record goalscorer Katie Anderton Kay Hawke and Mel Cook signed for Lincoln City in August 2007, while former captain Anisha Bateman joined Preston North End. Lincoln goalkeeper Nicola Hobbs arrived as a replacement for Hawke. Rovers recruited several other new faces including international players Katie Williams, Michelle Walsh and Karen Burke. Natalie Preston was signed from Leeds United and captained the side in pre-season. A poor second half of the season saw Rovers finish eighth in 2007‚Äì08, while they were ejected from the FA Women's Cup by Lincoln at the quarter-final stage. 2008‚Äì09 proved no better as Rovers finished ninth and suffered a humiliating County Cup final defeat to Combination League Rochdale. Another aberrant refereeing performance in October 2008 saw four Blackburn players sent-off in a Premier League Cup defeat to Portsmouth, a scenario which manager Adam Lakeland described as \\"making a mockery of the women's game.\\" In summer 2009 Rovers quit Shawbridge, citing the condition of the pitch as a contributory factor in their poor form. 2009‚Äì10 saw Blackburn playing at the Stainton Park ground of Radcliffe Borough FC and finishing seventh in the Premier League National Division. Super League In January 2010 Blackburn and Watford were the only top-flight clubs who failed to apply for membership of the new FA Women's Super League. In Blackburn's case the decision was related to their reluctance to separate from the men's club. With the club back at the second level of English women's football, several players departed to Super League teams. Amy Kane and Danielle Hill returned to Everton, while Lynda Shepherd signed for Liverpool. Katie Anderton signed a Super League contract for Doncaster Rovers Belles but continued to play for Blackburn in the meantime. Although Blackburn intended to introduce young players to their squad, they also remained active in the transfer market. Defender Charlotte Farrell and Northern Irish international midfielder Kim Turner arrived from Manchester City and versatile Amanda Goodwin signed from Curzon Ashton. In April 2011 the club parted company with Adam Lakeland, shortly before relegation into the Premier League Northern Division was confirmed.

It was the site of numerous dogfights between UN fighter pilots and their opponents from North Korea (including some unofficially crewed by Soviet airmen) and the People's Republic of China. Soviet-built Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 were the aircraft used during most of the conflict, and the area's nickname was derived from them. It was the site of the first large-scale jet-vs-jet air battles, with the North American F-86 Sabre. History 1950 a defecting North Korean pilot to the US Air Force. The North Koreans began their war against South Korea on June 25, 1950 with small numbers of Soviet aircraft retained from the Second World War. These were flown by under-trained and inexperienced pilots. After the United States and its closest allies committed its air units to the UN, the North Korean People's Army Air Force (KPAAF) was rapidly depleted. For several months, propeller-engined bombers and fighters, like the B-29 and P-51 Mustang ‚Äì and early jet fighters like the F-80 Shooting Star, F-84 Thunderjet and Grumman F9F Panther ‚Äì flew the skies over Korea virtually unopposed. During October, the major Communist powers ‚Äì China and the Soviet Union ‚Äì commenced unofficial military support of North Korea. The Soviets also committed to supply North Korea and China with its latest MiG-15 fighters, and to train Korean and Chinese pilots to fly them. China officially entered the war in support of North Korea on October 25, 1950. While its strength in ground forces initially overwhelmed UN forces, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) was, at the time, small and no better equipped than the KPAAF. While the Soviet Union never officially entered the war, on 1 November 1950, the 64th Fighter Aviation Corps (64 IAK) of the Soviet Air Forces was attached to the PLAAF, under the 1st United Air Army. That same day, Soviet- piloted MiG-15s began operating over North Korea and the first clashes between MiG-15s and US aircraft occurred, when eight aircraft from the Soviet Air Forces intercepted about 15 United States Air Force P-51 Mustangs flying a ground support mission. First Lieutenant Fiodor Chizh shot down and killed Mustang pilot Aaron Abercrombie. Later in the day, the first air combat between jets occurred, when three MiG-15s attacked about 10 USAF F-80s. While First Lieutenant Frank Van Sickle, in a F-80C, was killed, a US record states that he was shot down by AA fire. First Lieutenant Semyon F. Khominich (referred to as Jominich in some sources) ‚Äì was credited with a kill by the Soviet authorities. On November 9, 1950, a MiG-15 was destroyed in combat for the first time, when Lieutenant Commander William T. Amen of the US Navy, in a F9F-2B Panther, shot down and killed Captain Mikhail F. Grachev. In response to the deployment of MiG-15s, the UN's P-51 squadrons began to convert to jet fighters. In the case of the USAF, this was the F-86 Sabre. F-86A-5-NA Sabre 49-1223. This aircraft served with the 335th F-I Squadron, 4th F-IW in Korea. It was shot down by MiGs near Wonsan on February 3, 1952; the pilot ejected. UN Command standing orders forbade pilots from crossing the Chinese border. On December 17, Lieutenant Colonel Bruce H. Hinton led a finger-four formation of Sabres from the 336th Fighter Squadron on a patrol, a round trip, along the Yalu River, in an attempt to draw the MiG pilots into combat. The Sabre pilots stayed below , to create the impression on radar screens that the Sabres were a slower aircraft. The slower speed and two drop tanks on each F-86 also provided maximum air time. Forty minutes after take-off the Sabres were approaching the Yalu at . Four MiGs were spotted below the Sabres and about to pass beneath them. The Americans jettisoned their drop tanks and as the MiGs passed below, the Sabres turned to the left and dived down at the Soviet fighters. When the MiG pilots realized that their adversaries were not older jets that they could easily extend away from, they broke formation and headed for the border. Hinton caught up to the leader's wingman, Major Yakov Efromeenko, and fired 1,500 rounds of .50 caliber bullets. Smoke belched from its jet pipe and flames enveloped the tail section. After Efromeenko ejected, the MiG crashed about south of the Yalu.Rodney Steel, MiG v Sabre War Monthly (1976), p. 41. On the morning of December 22, a Sabre was destroyed by a MiG-15 pilot for the first time. Captain Lawrence V. Bach's F-86 was hit in the wing root by cannon fire from an unknown MiG pilot and Bach was captured after ejecting. That afternoon, eight Sabres from the USAF 4th Fighter- Interceptor Wing (4th F-IW), operating out of a forward base at K-14 Kimpo (Gimpo), attacked an estimated 15 MiGs at and pursued some to the Yalu, claiming six without loss. 1951‚Äì53 On January 1, 1951 a Communist offensive drove UN forces out of the Kimpo area; K-14 was overrun and the 4th F-IW was withdrawn to Japan.War Monthly (1976). MIG V Sabre, by Rodney Steel (p. 41). In March 1951, the first two Sabre squadrons, from the 4th F-IW, returned to Korea, just in time to meet a new build-up of Communist air strength designed to secure air superiority over northwest Korea, in a prelude to a major ground offensive. While the Australian government had attempted to order the F-86, to replace Mustangs operated in Korea by No. 77 Squadron RAAF, McDonnell-Douglas was required to prioritize re-equipping the USAF. The British Gloster Meteor F.8 was the only viable alternative. 77 Squadron on begin converting to Meteors in Japan during April 1951. USAF pilots nicknamed April 12, 1951 \\"Black Thursday\\", after 30 MiG-15s attacked 48 B-29 bombers escorted by approximately 100 F-80s and F-84s. The MiGs were fast enough to engage the B-29s and extend away from their escorts. Three B-29s were shot down and seven more were damaged, with no casualties on the communist side. Following this, USAF bomber sorties over Korea were halted for approximately three months. Bomber commanders were forced to discontinue daylight raids, and changed to night missions by small formations. In the first five months of 1951 the 4th F-IW flew 3,550 sorties and claimed 22 victories. No F-86 Sabres were shot down by MiGs, although a number were lost due to accidents.War Monthly (1976). MIG V Sabre, by Rodney Steel (p. 42). On July 10, 1951 truce talks between North Korean and UN representatives opened at Kaesong. The ground forces were virtually stalemated at the 38th parallel, but in the air the two squadrons of the 4th F-IW were flying the only Sabres in the theatre.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 231‚Äì233 Some intelligence source estimated that 500 MiGs were being operated by the 1st United Air Army.War Monthly (1976). MIG V Sabre, by Rodney Steel (p. 43). Although 77 Squadron RAAF had previously operated in Korea as a ground-attack unit, many of its pilots were veterans of World War II fighter units and it was expected that the Gloster Meteor would allow it to return to its previous role of interception. With 22 Meteors, 77 Squadron was attached to the USAF's 4th F-IW at Kimpo at the end of July.Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 119, 126Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 126, 142 For a few weeks, MiG-15 pilots scrutinized the performance of the Meteors and used their superior speed to avoid engaging the Meteors.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 143‚Äì145Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 126‚Äì127 The first Meteor fatalities occurred on 22 August, when two aircraft collided in mid-air as they returned to Kimpo after a sweep.RAAF Historical Section, Fighter Units, p. 58 Meteor and MiG-15s pilots engaged each other for the first time on 25 August, without either side scoring hits. Four days later, eight Meteors and 16 Sabres fought 12 MiGs; one Australian ejected after his aircraft was shot down, and a second Meteor was damaged. The following week, a Meteor suffered severe damage in a dogfight with MiGs.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 234Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 147‚Äì151 As a result of these losses, senior RAAF commanders decided to focus on escort and air defense sorties. alt=Three men in flying suits walking among twin-jet military aircraft Flight Lieutenant R.

Both sides apparently overestimated the scale of the battle and the damage inflicted to their opponents: while three Meteors were lost, Soviet pilots claimed nine Meteors destroyed; Australian pilots claimed one MiG shot down and another damaged, from a formation of at least forty MiGs, while Russian sources suggest that all of the MiGs returned to base and less than 25 MiGs were available to 176 GvIAP at the time.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 171‚Äì172Krylov; Tepsurkaev, Soviet MiG-15 Aces of the Korean War, pp. 48‚Äì49 The F86-As and F86Es of the 4th F-IW were now getting decidedly battle- worn and it was decided that the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing (51st F-IW) was able to commence operations from Suwon on December 1 under Colonel Francis S. \\"Gabby\\" Gabreski.Gabreski was a World War II aces with 28 victories over the Luftwaffe to his credit.

During that month 63 MiGs were shot down for the loss of only nine Sabres. An important reason for the increasing superiority of UN air power was the new F86-F, which had been issued to two squadrons of the 51st Wing in June and July and began reaching the 4th Wing in September. This Sabre development had a more powerful J47 engine developing thrust, wing shackles for drop tanks (raising the combat radius to ) and a simplified A4 radar gun sight that was more efficient than the MkXVIII gyro sight used on most of the F86-As and easier to maintain than the rather unreliable A1CM radar sight fitted to late F86-As and Es.War Monthly (1976). MIG V Sabre, by Rodney Steel (p. 46). One Meteor was shot down and another damaged by MiGs following a ground-attack mission on 2 October 1952.RAAF Historical Section, Fighter Units, p. 59Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 152 No. 77 Squadron was credited with downing its last MiG southeast of Pyongyang on 27 March 1953.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 215‚Äì216 A special fighter-bomber variant of the F86-F arrived in Korea during January 1953 ‚Äì the F86-F-30 with dual stores mountings under each wing. This Sabre could carry either a drop tank or a bomb on the inner fittings, together with a drop tank on each of the outboard points. The new fighter-bombers were issued to the 18th Fighter Bomber Wing, which included 2 Squadron, South African Air Force (previously a P-51 unit). In February the 8th Fighter Bomber Wing began to replace its F-80s with Sabre fighter-bombers. On July 27, 1953 the ceasefire came into effect. By that time there were 297 Sabres in Korea facing an estimated 950 Sino- Korean MiGs. During the conflict the F-86 pilots claimed to have destroyed 792 MiGs in air-to-air combat for a loss of 78 Sabres ‚Äî a phenomenal 10 to 1 kills-to-losses ratio. In September the defection of a MiG-15 pilot (with his aircraft) enabled US pilots to assess their erstwhile opponent at first hand.

However, this ratio were not count the number of aircraft of other types (B-29, A-26, F-80, F-82, F-84...) were shot down by MiG-15s.  Soviet role  Gun camera strip showing Soviet MiG-15 over Korea, April 1953. According to Budiansky, \\"In late March 1951, the 1st RSM (1st Radio Squadron, Mobile), still operating in Japan, picked up Russian ground controllers in voice communication with Soviet MiG fighter aircraft operating over North Korea. This became an \\"intelligence windfall\\", because \\"Soviet doctrine called for tight control of fighters by stations on the ground tracking the location of friendly and enemy aircraft on radar throughout the battle.\\" These radio intercepts gave additional warning beyond the range of radar. This breakthrough in signals intelligence, centralized at a single USAFSS facility in Seoul, meant real- time listening of Russian controllers and fighters and the subsequent passing of information to U.S. pilots. \\"An analysis of ground control traffic in June 1952 concluded that more than 90 percent of MiGs engaged in air operations over North Korea were being flown by Russians.\\" The Soviet Union kept the participation of their aircrews in the Korean War secret for many years, though it was widely suspected by UN forces. Soviet aircraft were adorned with North Korean or Chinese markings and pilots wore either North Korean uniforms or civilian clothes, to disguise their origins. For radio communication, they were given cards with common Korean words for various flying terms spelled out phonetically in Cyrillic characters. These subterfuges did not long survive the fury of air-to-air combat, however, and pilots were soon heard communicating in Russian. Soviet MiG-15 regiments were based on Chinese fields in Manchuria, where, according to existing UN rules of engagement, they could not be attacked. Many Soviet regiments underwent preliminary training at Soviet bases in the neighboring Soviet Maritime Military District. Soviet air defense troops also began to arrive along the Yalu, setting up radar installations, ground control centers, searchlights and large numbers of anti- aircraft guns to deter any attacks on the Chinese airfields. While UN pilots chafed at the restrictions imposed on attacking the MiG's Chinese airfields, it wasn't known until many years later that the MiG pilots themselves operated under tight restrictions. To preserve the impression that Soviet pilots were not fighting in Korea, they were prohibited from flying over non-Communist- controlled territory or within of the Allied front lines. One Soviet pilot who was shot down in UN-controlled territory shot himself with his pistol rather than be taken captive. Another pilot who bailed out into the Yellow Sea was strafed to prevent him from being captured. Soviet pilots were not allowed to pursue UN aircraft over the UN-controlled Yellow Sea. In spite of the restrictions, many US pilots took advantage of a \\"hot pursuit\\" exception to flying over China to pursue MiGs across the Yalu River. Later, \\"hot pursuit\\" became active MiG hunting over Manchuria, with US pilots maintaining a \\"code of silence\\" about the patrols. Flight leaders chose wingmen who would keep quiet, and many rolls of incriminating gun camera footage \\"mysteriously\\" disappeared. The UN conducted Operation Moolah to entice Communist pilots, especially Soviet pilots, to defect to South Korea with a MiG-15. The operation was intended to gain an analysis of the MiG-15's flight performance, as well as serve a psychological purpose undermining the Soviet pilots.

The MiG Alley battles produced many fighter aces. The top aces were Russian. Nikolay Sutyagin claimed 21 kills, including nine F-86s, one F-84 and one Gloster Meteor in less than seven months. His first kill was the F-86A of Robert H. Laier on 19 June 1951 (listed by the Americans as missing in action), and his last was on 11 January 1952, when he shot down and killed Thiel M. Reeves, who was flying an F-86E (Reeves is also listed as MIA). Other famous Soviet aces include Yevgeni G. Pepelyayev, who was credited with 19 kills, and Lev Kirilovich Shchukin, who was credited with 17 kills, despite being shot down twice himself. The top UN ace of the war, Capt. Joseph C. McConnell, claimed 16 MiGs, including three on one day. His story featured in a film called The McConnell Story, starring Alan Ladd and June Allyson. The second-highest- scoring UN ace, Maj. James Jabara, was the first UN jet-vs.-jet ace. Another ace, Frederick C. \\"Boots\\" Blesse, claimed nine MiG-15s in his F-86 Sabre and later wrote No Guts, No Glory, a manual of air fighter combat that is still studied today. James P.

It stars Philip Seymour Hoffman. The plot follows an ailing theater director (Hoffman) as he works on an increasingly elaborate stage production whose extreme commitment to realism begins to blur the boundaries between fiction and reality. The film's title is a play on Schenectady, New York, where much of the film is set, and the concept of synecdoche, wherein a part of something represents the whole, or vice versa. The film premiered in competition at the 61st Annual Cannes Film Festival on May 23, 2008. Sony Pictures Classics acquired the United States distribution rights, paying no money but agreeing to give the film's backers a portion of the revenues.Michael Barker Sony ‚Äì Sony Classics' Michael Barker and Tom Bernard take the long view of success ‚Äì Los Angeles Times. Articles.latimes.com (February 3, 2003). Retrieved on 2010-12-19.Glut of Films Hits Hollywood ‚Äì WSJ.com. Online.wsj.com (September 3, 2008). Retrieved on 2010-12-19. It had a limited theatrical release in the U.S. on October 24, 2008, and was a commercial failure on its initial release. The story and themes of Synecdoche, New York polarized critics: some called it pretentious or self-indulgent; others declared it a masterpiece and later listed it among the best films of the 2000s, with Roger Ebert ranking it as the decade's best. The film was also nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Theater director Caden Cotard finds his life unraveling. He suffers from numerous physical ailments and has been growing increasingly alienated from his wife, Adele, an artist. He hits rock bottom when Adele leaves him for a new life in Berlin, taking their four-year-old daughter Olive with her. After the success of his production of Death of a Salesman, Caden unexpectedly receives a MacArthur Fellowship, which gives him the financial means to pursue his artistic interests. He is determined to use it to create an artistic piece of brutal realism and honesty, something into which he can pour his whole self. Gathering an ensemble cast into an enormous warehouse in Manhattan's Theater District, he directs them in a celebration of the mundane, instructing them to live out their constructed lives. As the mockup inside the warehouse grows increasingly mimetic of the city outside, Caden continues to look for solutions to his personal crises. He is traumatized as he discovers Adele has become a celebrated painter in Berlin and Olive is growing up under the questionable guidance of Adele's friend Maria. After a failed attempt at a fling with Hazel (the woman who works in the box office), he marries Claire, an actress in his cast, and has a daughter with her. Their relationship ultimately fails, and he continues his awkward relationship with Hazel, who is by now married with children and working as his assistant. Meanwhile, an unknown condition is systematically shutting down his autonomic nervous system. As the years rapidly pass, the continually expanding warehouse is isolated from the deterioration of the city outside. Caden buries himself ever deeper into his magnum opus, blurring the line between reality and the world of the play by populating the cast and crew with doppelg√§ngers. For instance, Sammy Barnathan is cast in the role of Caden in the play after Sammy reveals that he has been obsessively following Caden for 20 years, while Sammy's lookalike is cast as Sammy. Sammy's interest in Hazel sparks a revival of Caden's relationship with her, leading Sammy to commit suicide. As he pushes against the limits of his personal and professional relationships, Caden lets an actress take over his role as director and takes on her previous role as Ellen, Adele's custodian. He lives out his days in the model of Adele's apartment under the replacement director's instruction while some unexplained calamity occurs in the warehouse leaving ruins and bodies in its wake. Finally, he prepares for death as he rests his head on the shoulder of an actress who had previously played Ellen's mother, seemingly the only person in the warehouse still alive. As the scene fades to gray, Caden says that now he has an idea of how to do the play when the director's voice in his ear gives him his final cue: \\"Die.\\" Cast * Philip Seymour Hoffman as Caden Cotard * Samantha Morton as Hazel * Michelle Williams as Claire Keen * Catherine Keener as Adele Lack * Emily Watson as Tammy * Dianne Wiest as Ellen Bascomb / Millicent Weems * Jennifer Jason Leigh as Maria * Hope Davis as Madeleine Gravis * Tom Noonan as Sammy Barnathan * Sadie Goldstein as Olive Cotard * Robin Weigert as adult Olive * Deirdre O'Connell as Mrs. Bascomb * Jerry Adler as Caden's father * Lynn Cohen as Caden's mother * Josh Pais as Ophthalmologist * Daniel London as Tom * Stephen Adly Guirgis as Davis * Amy Wright as Burning House Realtor * Paul Sparks as Derek * John Rothman as Dentist * Frank Wood as Evaluative Services Doctor * Elizabeth Marvel as Warehouse Realtor * Daisy Tahan as Ariel * Cliff Carpenter as Old Man * Amy Spanger as Soap Actress Nurse * Nick Wyman as Soap Actor Doctor * Dan Ziskie as Leg Tremor Doctor * Rosemary Murphy as Frances * Alvin Epstein as Man with Nosebleed * Tim Guinee as Needleman Actor * Joe Lisi as Maurice * Alice Drummond as Actress Playing Frances * Michael Higgins as Actor Playing Man With Nosebleed * Christopher Evan Welch as Pastor * Peter Friedman as Emergency Room Doctor Production The film began when Sony Pictures Classics approached Kaufman and Spike Jonze about making a horror film. The two began working on a film dealing with things they found frightening in real life, rather than typical horror-film tropes. This project eventually evolved into Synecdoche. Jonze was originally slated to direct, but chose to direct Where the Wild Things Are instead.\\"Reading Charlie Kaufman's Next Project,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 13, 2006 Motifs ;The burning house :Early in the film, Hazel purchases a house that is perpetually on fire. At first showing reluctance to buy it, Hazel remarks to the real estate agent, \\"I like it, I do. But I'm really concerned about dying in the fire,\\" which prompts the response \\"It's a big decision, how one prefers to die.\\" In an interview with Michael Guill√©n, Kaufman stated, \\"Well, she made the choice to live there. In fact, she says in the scene just before she dies that the end is built into the beginning. That's exactly what happens there. She chooses to live in this house. She's afraid it's going to kill her but she stays there and it does. That is the truth about any choice that we make. We make choices that resonate throughout our lives.\\"TwitchFilm interview With Charlie Kaufman, October 23, 2008 The burning house has been compared to the Tennessee Williams quote: \\"We all live in a house on fire, no fire department to call; no way out, just the upstairs window to look out of while the fire burns the house down with us trapped, locked in it.\\" It has also been said that the house is a reference to Jungian psychology. In an interview, Kaufman mentioned that a Jungian scholar sees the house as a representation of the self.https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2008/12/film-d01.html ;The end is built into the beginning :The film continuously brings up the quote \\"The end is built into the beginning\\" which is meant to symbolize the emphasis on the connection of death with birth. This is emphasized by how most of time is spent being not yet born or dead, and how life is only implemented in a fraction of a second in comparison. Another attribute connecting to this theme is the grey screen. The film both starts and ends with a fade-in to a grey screen as a further connection to this ongoing sensibility.\\" ;Miniature paintings and the impossible warehouses :Both Caden and Adele are artists, and the scale on which both of them work becomes increasingly relevant to the story as the film progresses. Adele works on an extremely small scale, while Caden works on an impossibly large scale, constructing a full-size replica of New York City in a warehouse, and eventually a warehouse within that warehouse, and so on, continuing in this impossible cycle. Adele's name is almost a mondegreen for \\"a delicate art\\" (Adele Lack Cotard). Commenting on the scale of the paintings (actually the miniaturized paintings of artist Alex Kanevsky),Review: 'Synecdoche, New York' Los Angeles Times, October 24, 2008 Kaufman said, \\"In [Adele's] studio at the beginning of the movie you can see some small but regular-sized paintings that you could see without a magnifying glass ... By the time [Caden] goes to the gallery to look at her work, which is many years later, you can't see them at all.\\" He continued, \\"As a dream image it appeals to me. Her work is in a way much more effective than Caden's work. Caden's goal in his attempt to do his sprawling theater piece is to impress Adele because he feels so lacking next to her in terms of his work,\\" and added, \\"Caden's work is so literal. The only way he can reflect reality in his mind is by imitating it full-size ... It's a dream image but he's not interacting with it successfully.\\" ;Jungian psychology :Many reviewers believe Kaufman's writing is influenced by Jungian psychology.\\"The Life of the Mined: On Synecdoche, New York\\", filmbrain.comBoston Review ‚Äî Alan A. Stone: The Mind‚Äôs Eye. Bostonreview.net. Retrieved on December 19, 2010.Of Font & Film: The fine art of dying font ‚Äì Columnists. The News Herald (March 22, 2009). Retrieved on 2010-12-19. Carl Jung wrote that the waking and dream states are both necessary in the quest for meaning. Caden often appears to exist in a combination of the two. Kaufman has said, \\"I think the difference is that a movie that tries to be a dream has a punchline and the punchline is: it was a dream.\\" Another concept in Jungian psychology is the four steps to self- realization: becoming conscious of the shadow (recognizing the constructive and destructive sides), becoming conscious of the anima and animus (where a man becomes conscious of his female component and a woman becomes conscious of her male component), becoming conscious of the archetypal spirit (where humans take on their mana personalities), and finally self-realization, where a person is fully aware of the ego and the self. Caden seems to go through all four of these stages. When he hires Sammy, he learns of his true personality and becomes more aware of himself. He shows awareness of his anima when replacing himself with Ellen and telling Tammy that his persona would have made him more adept in womanhood than in manhood. In taking on the role of Ellen, he becomes conscious of the archetypal spirit and finally realizes truths about his life and about love. ;References to delusion :In the Cotard delusion, one believes oneself to be dead or that one's organs are missing or decaying. Caden‚Äôs preoccupation with illness and dying seems related. :When Caden enters Adele‚Äôs flat, the buzzer pressed (31Y) bears the name Capgras. Capgras delusion is a psychiatric disorder in which sufferers perceive familiar people (spouses, siblings, friends) to have been replaced by identical imposters. This theme is echoed throughout the film as individuals are replaced by actors in Caden‚Äôs ever-expanding play. :In the closing scenes of the film Caden hears instructions by earpiece. This is similar to the auditory third-person hallucination described by Kurt Schneider as a first- rank symptom of schizophrenia.Schneider, K. Clinical Psychopathology. New York: Grune and Stratton. 1959. ;Play within a play :The film is meta- referential in that it portrays a play within a play, sometimes also referred to as mise en abyme. :This theme has been compared to the William Shakespeare line \\"All the world‚Äôs a stage, and all the men and women merely players.\\"Synecdoche, New York Review by Las Vegas Critics. Lasvegascritics.com. Retrieved on December 19, 2010. :It has also been compared to the music video for Icelandic singer Bj√∂rk's song \\"Bachelorette\\". The video portrays a woman who finds an autobiographical book about her that writes itself. The book is then adapted into a play, which features a play within itself. The video was directed by Michel Gondry, who also directed Kaufman's films Human Nature and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In an interview, Kaufman responded to the comparison, saying \\"Yeah, I heard that comparison before. The reason Michel and I found each other is because we have similar sort of ideas.\\"Interview: Charlie Kaufman (Synecdoche, New York). Ioncinema.Com (October 22, 2008). Retrieved on 2010-12-19. ;Death and decay :Throughout the film Caden refers to the inevitability of death and the idea that everyone is already dead. \\"Practically everything in Caden's grotesque existence betokens mortality and decay,\\" writes Jonathan Romney of The Independent, \\"whether it be skin lesions, garbled fax messages or the contents of people's toilet bowls.\\" ;Simulacrum :Some reviewers have noted that the film seems inspired by postmodernist philosopher Jean Baudrillard's concept of Simulacra and Simulation, reinforced by the fact that one of the names Caden gives to his play is Simulacrum. An article in The Guardian suggests that the film is the \\"ultimate postmodern novel.\\" Baudrillard references the Jorge Luis Borges story On Exactitude in Science in his writings. Some commentators have compared the ending of the film where Caden is walking through his reproduction as it begins to fall apart to the story.https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et- synecdoche24-2008oct24-story.htmlhttps://www.iconeye.com/opinion/review/item/4067-synecdoche- new-york ;Hazel's books :Hazel's books also have significance in the film. She has Swann's Way (the first volume of In Search of Lost Time) by Marcel Proust and The Trial by Franz Kafka; both are related to the film's overall motifs. Critical reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 68% based on 187 reviews, with an average rating of 6.77/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Charlie Kaufman's ambitious directorial debut occasionally strains to connect, but ultimately provides fascinating insight into a writer's mind.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \\"generally positive reviews\\". A number of critics have compared it to Federico Fellini's 1963 film 8¬Ω. In his review in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert said, \\"I watched it the first time and knew it was a great film [...] the subject of 'Synecdoche, New York' is nothing less than human life and how it works.

Despite its slippery way with time and space and narrative and Mr. Kaufman‚Äôs controlled grasp of the medium, Synecdoche, New York is as much a cry from the heart as it is an assertion of creative consciousness.

Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a D+ and wrote, \\"I gave up making heads or tails of Synecdoche, New York, but I did get one message: The compulsion to stand outside of one's life and observe it to this degree isn't the mechanism of art ‚Äî it's the structure of psychosis.\\" American film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, \\"...it seems more like an illustration of his script than a full-fledged movie, proving how much he needs a Spike Jonze or a Michel Gondry to realize his surrealistic conceits.\\" The Moving Arts Film Journal ranked the film at #80 on its list of \\"The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time\\".TMA‚Äôs 100 Greatest Movies of All Time The Moving Arts Film Journal .

It is a rhizomatous, beardless perennial plant, native to the Great Lakes region of eastern North America. It has lavender blue or violet-blue flowers, a very short stem and long fan-like green leaves. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. It is closely related to Iris cristata (another North American crested iris). Description It is similar in form to Iris cristata but is chromosomally different and smaller.British Iris Society (1997) James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) It has slender, wiry,Richard Lynch or cord-like, greenish-brown, or yellow rhizomes. It has a large central section and outer sections, which are long and 0.8‚Äì1.2 cm wide. The outer sections have fibrous roots (underneath), and 2‚Äì3 brown scale-like leaves above. It creeps across the ground, creating thick clumps of plants.William Cullina It has 8‚Äì12 sheathing, (fan-like), green or light green, basal leaves. They are falcate (sickle-shaped) or sword-shaped, and linear,Merel R. Black and Emmet J. Judziewicz and long and 10‚Äì8 mm wide. After flowering, the leaves elongate up to long and 10 mm wide. When the plant is not in flower, the leaves of the iris might be confused with false asphodel, (Triantha glutinosa, a white flowered member of the lily family whose leaves are much narrower) which lives in similar habitats. Although, the flower stem of false asphodel is much longer than that of iris and very sticky. It has very short stems, which are long. The stems and flowers are shorter than the leaves. It has green spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which are slightly keeled, and long. They have scarious (membranous) edges. The short stems have 1 to 2 flowers, in Spring, or summer (in Europe), in April, or May, or early June, or July. In Spring, it can flower 7 to 10 days earlier than Iris cristata. It can have later flush of flowers in the fall (Autumn), or October. The flowers are in diameter, come in shades of blue, violet-blue, sky blue, deep blue, lavender blue, lilac, or deep purple. A white form has occasionally, also been found. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The obovate, falls are long and 0.8 cm wide. They taper towards the claw (section closest to the stem). They have a white signal patch, which has a deep violet margin, and 3 central, orange, gold, or yellow and white toothed (or fimbriated ‚Äì fringed) ridges (or crests). The signal patch guides bumblebees in to the middle of the flower, to pollinate it. The standards are narrowly oblanceolate, long and 0.4‚Äì0.5 cm wide. They are shorter and narrower than the falls. It has a yellow funnel- like, perianth tube, which is 1‚Äì2 cm long. The tube is shorter than Iris cristata. It has a trigonal (or triangular), ovary, which is 0.8‚Äì1 cm long. It has a 1‚Äì2 cm long style, which has linear crests and wavy (crenate) edges. The style arm guides bumblebees to the lower section of the sepal, to reach the nectar. After the iris has flowered, between late June to late July, it produces a roundly triangular, or ovoid, seed capsule, which are covered by the spathes. The capsules are 1.2 mm long and 8 mm wide. Inside the capsule, are 3 mm wide, dark brown seeds, which have a white appendage (or aril, fleshy thickening of seed coat), spiralled around the seed. This spiral or corkscrew- like appendage is called an eliaosome. The eliaosomes are used as energy-rich food sources by ants, who help pollinate the plant. Biochemistry In 1994, a study was carried out on the genetic make-up of Iris lacustris. In 2000, a study was carried out on Iris cristata and Iris lacustris, looking at the genetic variation of both irises. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has been counted several times, 2n=42, Simonet, 1934; n=21, 2n=42, Chimphamba, 1973 and 2n=32, Pringle, 1976. It is normally published as 2n = 32, 42.  Taxonomy Foliage and flowers The Latin name is pronounced Iris (EYE-ris) lacustris (lak-US-triss). It has the common name of dwarf lake iris,Wayne Grady lake iris, and Great Lakes iris. The Latin specific epithet lacustris means \\"of lakes\\". The iris was found on Mackinac Island in 1810 by Thomas Nuttall. The botanist travelled from Detroit by canoe with French Canadian voyagers and the surveyor for the Michigan Territory. It was first then published and described by Thomas Nuttall, in 'The Genera of North American Plants' (published in Philadelphia, USA) Volume1, Issue23 on 14 July 1818. An illustration of the iris was published in Wild flowers of the United States by Rickett, plate 11 in 1966. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 15 April 1994, then updated on 3 December 2004. It is a close relative to Iris cristata, the only other crested iris native to North America. However, unlike it, Iris lacustris is found only in small areas of the Great Lakes region that have been glacier-free for only 11,000 years. It was once thought to be a form of Iris cristata, (by William Rickatson Dykes in 1913 and other authors), later chromosomal studies confirmed the two were separate species. Distribution and habitat Iris lacustris is native to temperate regions of northern America. Range It is found in Canada, within the province of Ontario (on the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island). It is found in U.S.A., within the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and, infrequently in Ohio.Tom S. Cooperrider, Allison Cusick, John T. Kartesz (Editors) It is found on northern shores and smaller islands of Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior, within the Great Lakes region. The majority of iris populations are within 500 m of the shore of Lake Huron, but the largest ones can occur up several kilometres away from the lake. Habitat It grows on the Great Lakes shorelines in cool, moist lake shore air. It is found on sand, or in thin soil over limestone-rich gravel, in calcareous (chalky) soil, or bedrock. It also grows on alvar limestone barrens. Along shorelines, old beach ridges, beside streams, in ditches, on cliffs, behind open dunes, or at the edges of coniferous woods (in Canada and Michigan). Conservation Iris lacustris is designated a \\"vulnerable\\" threatened species by federal, state and provincial laws throughout its distribution range. It was added to the U.S. List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants on September 28, 1988. It is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. It was listed by the federal U.S. government as 'threatened' since February 1, 2001. It has become threatened due to habitat destruction, from shoreline development, from road-widening projects, chemical spraying and salting, and off-road vehicle use have caused disturbance and destruction of habitat, and degradation of habitats. Due to being a protected species, plants can not be dug up or seeds gathered. A permit is required for any project (including research, development, and construction) which may \\"take\\" or \\"harm\\" threatened or endangered species in Michigan. Also 37% of the Canadian population is on land in protected areas. Shoreline development has also improved some habitats by opening up the canopy and creating new open ground. Cultivation It is hardy to between USDA Zone 4 and Zone 7. and European Zone H2 It is hardy in Europe, and in the UK. It is tolerant of a range of soils, but prefers moist, slightly acidic neutral soils. It flowers mostly in semi-open habitats with partial sun. Although it can tolerate sunny sites. It can grow in a peat bank, or can grow in a six-inch pot or container. It is rarely offered for sale in Europe. A specimen has been grown in Cambridge Botanic Garden. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may also cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction. Culture In 1998, Iris lacustris was designated the state wildflower of Michigan, where the vast majority of populations exist.  References  Other sources * Center for Plant Conservation.

A wide range of different materials are pelletized including chemicals, iron ore, animal compound feed, plastics, and more.  Pelletizing of iron ore  Processed Taconite pellets as used in the steelmaking industry, with a US Quarter shown to scale. Iron ore pellets are spheres of typically to be used as raw material for blast furnaces. They typically contain 64‚Äì72% Fe and various additional material adjusting the chemical composition and the metallurgic properties of the pellets.Advanced Explorations Inc.:Iron Ore Products Typically limestone, dolomite and olivine is added and Bentonite is used as binder. The process of pelletizing combines mixing of the raw material, forming the pellet and a thermal treatment baking the soft raw pellet to hard spheres. The raw material is rolled into a ball, then fired in a kiln or in travelling grate to sinter the particles into a hard sphere.National Steel Pellet Company:Iron Ore Processing for the Blast Furnace The configuration of iron ore pellets as packed spheres in the blast furnace allows air to flow between the pellets, decreasing the resistance to the air that flows up through the layers of material during the smelting. The configuration of iron ore powder in a blast furnace is more tightly-packed and restricts the air flow. This is the reason that iron ore is preferred in the form of pellets rather than in the form of finer particles.Pelletizing of Iron Ores:[Meyer, Kurt. Pelletizing of Iron Ores. Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg, Verlag Stahleisen mBH, Dusseldorf, 1980.] Preparation of raw materials Additional materials are added to the iron ore (pellet feed) to meet the requirements of the final pellets. This is done by placing the mixture in the pelletizer, which can hold different types of ores and additives, and mixing to adjust the chemical composition and the metallurgic properties of the pellets. In general, the following stages are included in this period of processing: concentration / separation, homogenization of the substance ratios, milling, classification, increasing thickness, homogenization of the pulp and filtering. Formation of the raw pellets Disc Pelletizer The formation of raw iron ore pellets, also known as pelletizing, has the objective of producing pellets in an appropriate band of sizes and with mechanical properties high usefulness during the stresses of transference, transport, and use. Both mechanical force and thermal processes are used to produce the correct pellet properties. From an equipment point of view there are two alternatives for industrial production of iron ore pellets: the drum and the pelletizing disk. Thermal processing In order to confer to the pellets high resistance metallurgic mechanics and appropriate characteristics, the pellets are subjected to thermal processing, which involves stages of drying, preheating, firing, after-firing and cooling. The duration of each stage and the temperature that the pellets are subjected to have a strong influence on the final product quality.  Pelletizing of animal feeds  animal pellets Pelletizing of animal feeds can result in pellets from (shrimp feeds), through to (poultry feeds) up to (stock feeds). The pelletizing of stock feed is done with the pellet mill machinery, which is done in a feed mill. Preparation of raw ingredients Feed ingredients are normally first hammered to reduce the particle size of the ingredients. Ingredients are then batched, and then combined and mixed thoroughly by a feed mixer. Once the feed has been prepared to this stage the feed is ready to be pelletized. Formation of the feed pellets Pelletizing is done in a pellet mill, where feed is normally conditioned and thermal treated in the fitted conditioners of a pellet mill. The feed is then pushed through the holes and a pellet die and exit the pellet mill as pelleted feed. After pelleting processes After pelleting the pellets are cooled with a cooler to bring the temperature of the feed down. Other post pelleting applications include post-pelleting conditioning, sorting via a screen and maybe coating if required.

It follows in the series of Stronghold and Stronghold 2. Gameplay Unlike the previous Stronghold titles, Legends gives the player a choice of different starting rulers with different troop types (including King Arthur and his knights of the round table, Count Vlad Dracul, and Siegfried of Xanten). Other new features include cooperative multiplayer against computer-controlled opponents and the choice between different gameplay options for online play (Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Economic War, and Capture the Flag). Each faction has new and unique unit groups. Most special units have their own unique ability, which must be recharged after they are used. Dragons are also available to every faction, but have a set lifetime. All other special units remain on the map until they die. In story mode the players not necessarily bound to their factions special units. For example, King Arthur can make use of the Ice Tower instead of the Round Table for more balanced game play. Stronghold Legends has been made using a similar graphics engine as Stronghold 2 - the game appeared to be a minor rehash of the previous game on the first inspection. However, playing it revealed that the graphics were considerably improved and new music tracks had been added. More units were available; features like crime were removed entirely, minor changes like this have altered the gameplay experience slightly. It was included in the Mastertronic range of games in the UK, showing its popularity. Plot There are three story lines that follow three different lords and their conquests. Each storyline also has a corresponding campaign difficulty but the gameplay difficulty can be changed independently. Each campaign has its own set of heroes and special units that corresponds with the campaigns theme. The defensive buildings will also change depending on the level and campaign. The modes are as follows: * King Arthur (Easy): This storyline follows King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. Merlin frequently becomes a necessary part of the campaign. The first three missions of this campaign must be completed before choosing another storyline. The environment found in this storyline is lush and vibrant with plenty of trees. * Ice (Medium): This storyline follows Siegfried of Xanten and his conquest in the snowy north. The environment is almost completely covered in snow and dragons frequently nest in the hills around the map. This campaign is harder due to more hazards from special units as well as the Frost Giants present throughout much of the campaign. The special units of this campaign are frost themed with corresponding abilities. * Evil (Hard): This storyline follows Count Vladislav Dracul (Vlad the Impaler). The environment of this campaign is a dead land that has been corrupted. This campaign includes various new special units for Vlad but few appear on the enemies side. Vlad's campaign is challenging due to enormous numbers of enemy knights and pikemen as well as large requirements that must be met to advance into the next level. The special units of this campaign are werewolves, demons, and various corrupted creatures as well as new siege weaponry. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

It typically presents with itching and can lead to complications for both mother and baby. Pruritus (itching) is a common symptom of pregnancy, affecting around 20% of women. The majority of times, itching is a minor annoyance caused by changes to the skin, especially that of the abdomen. However, there are instances when itching may be a symptom of ICP. Although typically noticed on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, the itching can occur anywhere on the body. ICP occurs most commonly in the third trimester, but can begin at any time during the pregnancy. Signs and symptoms Most women with this condition present in the third trimester (although it can present as early as seven weeks) with itching without a rash. Typically, the itching is localized to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, but can be anywhere on the body. Hallmarks of ICP include the following symptoms: Most common: * Itching, in particular but not limited to that of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, without presence of a rash * Itching that is more noticeable in the evening * Darker urine Less common: * Lighter stools * Increased clotting time (due to possibly associated vitamin K deficiency) * Fatigue * Increased nausea * Decrease in appetite * Jaundice (less than 10% of women) * Upper right quadrant pain Not all ICP sufferers have all of the above symptoms. Mechanism The causes of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are still not fully understood. Hormones, environmental and genetic factors are all thought to contribute to the condition. * ICP commonly occurs in the third trimester at the time when hormone levels are at their highest. * Twin and triplet pregnancies, which are associated with higher hormone levels, show a higher incidence of ICP. * ICP resolves quickly after delivery, when placental hormone production ceases. * Older high-dose estrogen oral contraceptive pills could cause features of ICP. Estrogens Estrogens, and particularly glucuronides such as estradiol-17Œ≤-D-glucuronide, have been shown to cause cholestasis in animal studies, by reducing bile acid uptake by hepatocytes. Progesterone Treatment with progesterone in the third trimester of pregnancy has been shown to be associated with the development of ICP, and levels of metabolites of progesterone, particularly sulfated progesterone, are higher in patients with ICP than unaffected women, suggesting that progesterone also has a role in ICP. Genetic factors Clustering of cases of ICP in families, geographic variation in rates of ICP, and recurrence of ICP in 45-70% of subsequent pregnancies all suggest a genetic component to the disease. Genetic mutations in the hepatocellular transport protein ABCB4 (MDR3), which controls secretion of phosphatidylcholine into bile, have been found in cases of ICP. Genetic mutations affecting hepatic bile salt transport molecules have also been found in patients with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. It has been found that mothers of patients with this disease have a higher incidence of ICP, suggesting that heterozygote carriers of these mutations are also predisposed to ICP. In addition to genetic changes to bile salt transport molecules, high levels of estrogen glucuronides have been shown to inhibit the bile salt export pump (BSEP) ABCB11, and high levels of progesterone to inhibit the ABCB4 (MDR3) phospholipid transporter. Consequently, both genetic mutations in hepatocyte proteins involved in bile secretion together with inhibition of those proteins by high levels of hormone metabolites in pregnancy may have roles in the pathogenesis of ICP. Environmental factors A number of features of ICP suggest that environmental factors also have a role in the disease: * It has been reported that the incidence of ICP is higher in winter than summer. * The incidence of ICP in Chile has dropped from 14% of pregnancies before 1975 to 4% in 2016. * ICP recurs in between 60% and 90% of subsequent pregnancies. * Low serum selenium levels have been linked to ICP, although the role of selenium in bile secretion is not known. Diagnosis ICP is diagnosed by blood tests including a serum bile acid test and liver function test. While most pregnant women experience some itch from time to time, itching on the palms and soles without a visible rash, or persisting severe or extensive itch symptoms should be reported to the midwife or obstetrician. To obtain a diagnosis of ICP, there are two LFT (liver function tests) and Serum bile acid test. The liver function tests (LFTs) is a simple blood test, the results of which should be available by the next day. If the ALT level is elevated, this, plus pruritus of palms and soles, could be considered as potentially diagnostic of ICP but only with elevated bile acid levels (however LFTs are not always elevated in ICP patients). The serum bile acid blood test for ICP is a quantitative measurement of bile acids. Other problems with the liver that occur in pregnancy should be considered by the treating clinician. These include preeclampsia, the HELLP syndrome, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Furthermore, other causes of hepatitis, like hepatitis viruses, cancer and certain medications, should also be considered. Treatment Upon diagnosis, many providers will prescribe ursodeoxycholic acid. While there is no cure for ICP, and no way to guarantee a successful outcome, studies have shown a slightly better fetal and maternal outcome from administration of ursodeoxycholic acid, whereas cholestyramine appears to only relieve itching. If additional blood tests to check clotting function identify a problem, giving Vitamin K may help avoid the risk of hemorrhage at delivery. Delivery by 35‚Äì37 completed weeks may be important to fetal outcome as a recent study demonstrated that in severe ICP (defined as bile acids greater than 40 umol/L) the risk of stillbirth was 1.5% compared to 0.5% of uncomplicated pregnancies. This risk rose further if bile acids doubled. The most recent research, published in The Lancet, suggests that around 90% of women with ICP could wait until 39 weeks of pregnancy to be induced. However, this relies on regular bile acid testing with rapid return of results. Risks if untreated Maternal consequences include the following: * Itching, which can become intense and debilitating * Premature labor * Deranged clotting, which requires Vitamin K Fetal consequences include: * Fetal distress * Meconium ingestion * Meconium aspiration syndrome * Stillbirth In most cases induction is recommended at 36‚Äì38 weeks depending upon the severity of the disease as most stillbirths cluster between 37‚Äì39 weeks gestation.Fisk NM, Storey GN: \\"Fetal outcome in obstetric cholestasis.

Cu√©nod contributed to the revival of baroque music, performing compositions by Francesco Cavalli and others. A distinguished singer of Johann Sebastian Bach's music, he was particularly praised for his interpretation of the Evangelist in Bach's St Matthew Passion. He had the longest career of any recorded vocalist or performer in history: he gave his first performance in Paris in 1928, appearing in musical comedies, later in his career gravitating more towards concert and opera, he gave his last concert in 1992; of the latter performances he became best known in the role as Emperor Altoum, appearing opposite Pl√°cido Domingo in Puccini's Turandot. Career Cu√©nod was born in Corseaux-sur-Vevey, Switzerland. His grandfather, William Cuenod was the mayor of Corseaux and he had half English ancestry through his grandmother, through his ancestry he was related to both the Churchill and Spencer family In 1913, aged 11, Cu√©nod attended the 78th birthday party of Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, who played piano duets with Ignacy Jan Paderewski.Instant Encore . Retrieved 14 April 2014 He received his French-German music training at the Ribaupierre Institute in Lausanne, at the conservatories in Geneva and Basel, and in Vienna. He started his career as a concert recitalist and singer. In 1928, he made his stage debut in Ernst Krenek's Jonny spielt auf in Paris, and in 1929 he sang for the first time in the United States in No√´l Coward's Bitter Sweet. From 1930 to 1933, he was active in Geneva, and then in Paris from 1934 to 1937. During the seasons 1937 to 1939, he made an extensive concert tour of North America. From 1940 to 1946, he taught at the Geneva Conservatory. In 1943 he resumed his operatic career singing in Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus in Geneva. He subsequently sang at Milan's La Scala (1951), the Glyndebourne Festival (from 1954 on) and London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (1954, 1956 and 1958). Cu√©nod was known for his roles as Basilio in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, the Astrologer in Rimsky- Korsakov's The Golden Cockerel, and a role written for him by Stravinsky, Sellem in The Rake's Progress. In pre-war Vienna and Paris, he frequented aristocratic salons and worked with Nadia Boulanger, with whom he made a pioneering set of recordings of madrigals by Monteverdi in 1937; after the war, the new early-music boom relied heavily on his light, unmannered, natural sound. On February 4, 1969, Cu√©nod performed Renaissance music with American lutenist (and later composer) Raymond Lynch at the Smithsonian. He holds the record as the oldest person to make a debut at the Metropolitan Opera. He debuted as the Emperor Altoum in Giacomo Puccini's Turandot on 12 March 1987 at the age of 84. He repeated the role the following season for a total of 14 performances. His very last appearance on stage was in 1992, aged 90, when he sang M. Triquet in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin at the Th√©√¢tre du Jorat in M√©zi√®res. After retiring from the concert circuit, he became an educator of the musical arts in England, with Belgian international soprano Suzanne Danco. Awards and honours Cu√©nod's recording of Erik Satie's Socrate in the 1970s, released on Nimbus Records, won the Grand Prix du Disque Mondiale award at the Montreux Music Festival.

On his centenary in 2002, he was awarded the World of Song award by the Lotte Lehmann Foundation.\\"World of Song Award\\", Lotte Lehmann League Personal life Cu√©nod's native language was French, but he was fluent in English, German and Italian. He resided with his life partner, Alfred Augustin (41 years his junior), in the Vaud region of Switzerland. They lived in the Ch√¢teau de Lully, an 18th-century castle that belonged to his grandfather, who purchased the property in 1899. In June 2007, when Cu√©nod was 105, he and Augustin entered into a civil union after changes in Swiss law gave same-sex couples many of the legal benefits of marriage. Cu√©nod became a centenarian in 2002, and died aged 108, on 6 December 2010 at his home in Vevey, Switzerland. References Sources * Further reading * Bradley S.

He lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. He began making films at the age of 18. He was influenced by the French New Wave and experimental cinema, most notably Jean-Luc Godard and Andy Warhol. In 1969, Auder met and eventually married Viva, an actress who started her career collaborating with Warhol. A year later, they moved to New York City where Auder has since resided. That same year, he purchased a Sony Portapak, one of the first commercially available video cameras. Video allowed Auder to translate Warhol‚Äôs talent for making the banal glamorous and the glamorous banal into a diary practice which Auder himself did not consider fine art. Viva first used these collaborative tapes to create the first video novel The Baby published in 1975. His earliest works are travel logs and endearing portraits of friends including Hannah Wilke, Alice Neel, Annie Sprinkle, Eric Bogosian, Louis Waldon, and Larry Rivers. The label ‚Äúvideo artist‚Äù was applied retroactively when Auder began exhibiting his work in 1980. At that time, he produced a series of works including scripted biographical material and video collages appropriating material from television. As the quality of video cameras improved and access to editing facilities increased, Auder‚Äôs skills as an auteur became more apparent. Auder married painter/actress and author Vivahttp://www.warholstars.org/indfoto/iviva.html in 1969 and together they had one daughter, Alexandra Auder, in February 1971.

Career A native of Southern California, Ralston graduated from Montebello High School in 1955 and attended Wheaton College in Illinois on a full music scholarship. Before finishing his degree, he transferred to the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, from which he earned a Bachelor of Music degree in composition and accompanying in 1964. During his college years, Ralston played six nights a week with the Freddy Martin orchestra (1959-1962) at Los Angeles's Coconut Grove nightclub, where in 1962, Welk invited him on his show as a guest musician. Playing with Freddy Martin lasted until the summer of 1963, when one of Welk's original pianists, Jerry Burke, fell ill and soon died, and Ralston was hired on a permanent basis. The Welk programs feature Ralston's piano and organ solos, but they frequently include his performances as a singer, dancer, and comedian. He arranged music and continued to perform for the Music Makers live and on television until 1982 when Welk retired from active performing. Since 1988, he has been the pianist and organist for the Founders Church of Religious Science in Los Angeles, an affiliate of the Centers for Spiritual Living. Throughout his career, Ralston has recorded several hundred albums; many of them as a solo artist or with bandleaders, including Welk, Ray Conniff, and Billy Vaughn. He has also been active in the preservation of theater pipe organs across America and has been a guest conductor for several symphony orchestras. Ralston appeared as host in a 1999 PBS rerun of Lawrence Welk's \\"Time\\" show. He still holds regular concerts in his home with various guest vocalists. Family Ralston and his Dutch-born wife, Fietje, have been married since March 3, 1963, and they have two adult children. The Ralstons reside in Granada Hills in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. Ralston's parents were Bradford Ralston and the former Marjorie Elizabeth Norton (1911‚Äì1998), an early cartoonist for Walt Disney. In 1928, Disney hired her as an inker, the thirteenth person employed by the new company. She was the first female voice actor for Minnie Mouse in the 1929 cartoon Wild Waves. Ralston's brother, Frederick Carleton \\"Rick\\" Ralston (born August 25, 1941), founded Crazy Shirts in Honolulu, Hawaii. His paternal aunt and uncle, Esther Ralston and Howard Ralston (1904‚Äì1992), were actors.  Legal Issues  Ralston was arrested in 1984 for the molestation of a 13-year-old boy that he met in Times Square and brought to California. When police raided his home, pornographic slides were discovered of at least 13 other boys. Ralston eventually pled guilty to one felony count of committing a lewd act with a child under age 14. In a plea bargain with the District Attorney's Office, three other lewd conduct charges involving two other boys were dismissed. Los Angeles police detective Steve Hales stated outside the courtroom, \\"'In all my years working with sexually exploited children, that was the most inappropriate sentence on a pedophile I've ever seen.\\" Ralson was sentenced to 5 years probation and no contact with children.

Hagemeister was employed at the universities of Marburg, Bochum, Basel, Innsbruck, Frankfurt (Oder) (Viadrina European University), and Berlin. Hagemeister served as researcher at the Department of History of the University of Basel and as temporary professor at the Department of History of Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich and at the Department of East European History at Viadrina European University, Frankfurt (Oder). Hagemeister wrote his doctoral thesis on the Russian philosopher Nikolai Fyodorov (1829‚Äì1903). In his current research he concentrates on the origins and early history of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the life and work of the Russian religious and apocalyptic writer Sergei Nilus (1862‚Äì1929).  Research on the Protocols  The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, first published in the Russian Empire in 1903, is a notorious forgery that pretends to detail a long-term Jewish plan for world domination. The origins of the document are shrouded in mystery and many theories have been proposed. The theory that had received the most support until recently was presented at the Berne Trial of 1933‚Äì1935, in which two Jewish organizations sued the Swiss distributors of the Protocols. The plaintiffs invited witnesses who testified that the Protocols was originally written in France in the late 1890s by agents of the Russian secret police and later translated into Russian. According to their version, the main perpetrators were police commander Pyotr Rachkovsky and his unsavoury collaborator Matvei Golovinski. This account became generally accepted following the publication of Norman Cohn's Warrant for Genocide in 1966, which added many details to it. Hagemeister's research into the origins of the Protocols led him to discount both the French origin of the document and the involvement of the Russian secret police. He discovered that the chief witness for the prosecution at the Berne trial had demanded a large sum of money in advance and that the plaintiffs themselves considered him highly suspect. His historical research supports the textual analysis of Cesare G. De Michelis, who concluded that the forgery was originally written in Russian in 1902‚Äì3 by unknown person(s). Among the experts who have accepted Hagemeister's theory is Richard S. Levy, who called him \\"the leading authority on this subject\\".

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was a sexual discrimination class action lawsuit filed on October 16, 2001, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, seeking back pay and an injunction. The suit challenged Walmart's denial of health insurance coverage for prescription contraceptives. The case was granted class action status with an estimated 400,000 women eligible for participation in the lawsuit. In September 2006, Walmart added prescription contraceptives to its health insurance coverage. In November 2006, the court ordered an investigation into whether illegal kickbacks were paid by Milberg Weiss to the lead plaintiff. The plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the case rather than permit discovery into the payments. Lawsuit The lawsuit was filed by Lisa Smith Mauldin, a 23-year-old customer service manager at a Walmart store in Hiram, Georgia. Mauldin, a divorced mother of two, was working for 32 hours per week at a rate of US$12.14 per hour and spending $30 a month on birth-control pills. She had signed up for the company's health care plan in February 2000 only to learn that it did not cover her prescription contraceptives. Liza Featherstone of The Nation described this financial weight as \\"a significant burden for [Mauldin] (and certainly a prohibitive one for many fellow employees, who earn significantly lower wages).\\" Mauldin sued Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., her employer, claiming that the defendant's health plan was in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because its provisions did not provide coverage for prescription contraceptives. Mauldin sought to amend Walmart's health plan to include coverage for contraceptives and to receive reimbursement for the cost of contraceptives, pre-judgment interest, and attorneys' fees. Maudlin was represented by a legal team consisting of the law firm of Milberg Weiss as lead class counsel, George Stein as local counsel, Judy Applebaum of the National Women's Law Center, and the law firm of Heller, Horowitz & Feit. On August 23, 2002, U.S. District Judge Julie Carnes granted the case class action status, allowing all women who had been covered by Walmart's Associates Health and Welfare Plan since March 2001 and who had been using prescription contraceptives to join the lawsuit. Attorney George Stein estimated the number of eligible women as 400,000. Walmart requested that the court reconsider the granting of class action status but on September 30, 2003, the court denied its request without prejudice. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, but the court did not rule on those motions. Improper payments In 2006, the court found that Lisa Mauldin had received payments from her local counsel, George Stein, that the court called \\"highly irregular, and at the very least create an appearance of impropriety.\\"See Stein admitted to paying Mauldin checks totaling US$2250, but denied that it was to induce her to sue Walmart. According to Stein, the payments were loans for personal matters and a sponsorship for Mauldin's daughter to attend cheerleading camp. Lead counsel Milberg Weiss claimed they had no knowledge of the payments and indicated in their response to the court that Stein and Mauldin intended to withdraw from the lawsuit. The court at first denied Walmart's request to take discovery on Milberg Weiss. However, in a November 22, 2006 order, the court decided to allow discovery, noting that, \\"Given the evidence of suspicious payments to Mauldin, and the recent indictment of Milberg Weiss for recruiting plaintiffs to participate in class action lawsuits, discovery is warranted to ensure that Mauldin's EEOC charge was not fraudulently procured.\\" Dismissal In September 2006, Walmart decided to change its health care policy to include coverage of prescription contraceptives as part of a larger overhaul of its health-care plans. According to Walmart, this decision had nothing to do with the lawsuit.Affidavit of Mark Casciari, December 8, 2006. On December 8, 2006, just a couple of weeks after the court's discovery order, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the case voluntarily, stating that the central purpose of the lawsuit had been achieved. Even though Milberg Weiss claimed that it had been successful, it did not request attorneys' fees for its five years of legal work; the dismissal prevented Walmart from investigating whether Milberg Weiss had broken the law, and also ended the plaintiffs' claim for back pay. On December 20, 2006, the court dismissed the case. Walmart's new health care policy went into effect on January 1, 2007.  See also  *Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

It was approximately one mile from the terminus of U.S. Route 40 and U.S. Route 322. Bader Field permanently closed on September 30, 2006. It was named after the former mayor of Atlantic City, Edward L. Bader, who purchased the land for the airfield. The field as of 2016 was for sale. History Bader Field was opened in 1910 and was authorized to provide passenger service in 1911. It was the first U.S. municipal airport with facilities for both seaplanes and land-based airplanes. The first known usage of the term \\"air-port\\" appeared in a newspaper article in 1919, in reference to Bader Field. The term was coined by Robert Woodhouse and referred to the \\"Flying Limousines\\", a seaplane passenger service between Atlantic City and New York. Bader Field was the founding location of the Civil Air Patrol in 1941. Scheduled commercial airline service at the airport ended in 1990, when Allegheny Airlines moved to the larger Atlantic City International Airport. The control tower was removed in the late 1990s and some of the former airport property was used to build a minor-league baseball stadium. Accident On May 15, 2005, the Cessna CitationJet 525A registered OY-JET overran the runway when attempting a 10 knots tailwind landing, ending up in the adjoining Intracoastal Waterway. An eyewitness video captured the accident from the final approach to the rescue of the plane's occupants by local boaters and the subsequent inadvertent operation of the aircraft as an \\"airboat\\". The NTSB report of the accident noted, \\"...the airport diagram...observed attached to the pilot's control column after the accident...read, 'airport closed to jet aircraft'\\". Emergency Use On June 29, 2019 three small banner-towing planes were forced to land at Bader field to avoid extreme thunderstorms in the area. Redevelopment and later uses Bader Field is considered a prime redevelopment site. In 1998, Bernie Robbins Stadium, a 5,500-seat baseball stadium, opened on the site, housing the Atlantic City Surf minor league baseball team until it discontinued operations in 2009. An indoor ice skating rink, Flyers Skate Zone, also opened up at the Bader Field site. The South Jersey RegionSouth Jersey Region of the Sports Car Club of America hosts autocross events at Bader Field during the non-winter months. The SJR SCCA has been using the site for a few years to date. In March 2011, the Dave Matthews Band announced that Bader Field would be the first of four sites for the Dave Matthews Band Caravan, a three-day music festival featuring an eclectic group of musical acts, with the Dave Matthews Band being the headlining performer for each night. The Atlantic City event was to take place June 24‚Äì26, 2011. In announcing the location of the event, the Dave Matthews Band cited Bader Field's proximity to several major metropolitan areas in the northeastern seaboard and its accessibility via several modes of public transportation. Improvements to the site prior to the event included burning overgrown brush as well as improvements to the long-neglected Bernie Robbins Stadium, which would house VIP seating for special ticket holders as well as host a later music festival featuring rapper Rick Ross. Improvements would also make way for other events, such as motorsports events on the runway strips. In April 2011, Bader Field was included in the new state-run Tourism District controlled by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority. The site's large parcel and potential for redevelopment led to its inclusion, which received much scrutiny from mayor Lorenzo Langford, who cast the lone \\"no\\" vote on the formation of the district, citing the inclusion of Bader Field as his reasoning. In February 2012, Metallica announced that their two-day Orion Music + More Festival would be staged at Bader Field on June 23 and 24, 2012. The popular jam band Phish performed a three-day run at Bader Field, June 15‚Äì17, 2012. Bader Field will host a round of the Global Rallycross Championship in 2016. Facilities and aircraft Bader Field covered an area of at an elevation of 8 feet (2.4 m) above mean sea level. It had two asphalt paved runways: 4/22 measured 2,595 by 100 feet (791 √ó 30 m) and 11/29 measured 2,948 by 100 feet (899 √ó 30 m). For the 12-month period ending January 4, 2001, the airport had 10,683 aircraft operations, an average of 29 per day: 81% general aviation and 19% air taxi.

It was a minor skirmish that the French commander decided was not worth fighting, but his soldiers were displeased at his decision to retreat, and he was subsequently replaced.  Prelude  In Italy the emperor took the initiative, and an Austrian army under Prince Eugene, intended to overrun the Spanish possessions in the Peninsula, assembled in Tyrol in the early summer, while the opposing army (French, Spaniards, and Piedmontese), commanded by Marshal Catinat, was slowly drawing together between the Chiese and the Adige. But supply difficulties hampered Eugene, and the French were able to occupy the strong positions of the Rivoli defile above Verona. There Catinat thought himself secure, as all the country to the east was Venetian and neutral. But Eugene, while making ostentatious preparations to enter Italy by the Adige or Lake Garda or the Brescia road, secretly reconnoitred passages over the mountains between Rovereto and the Vicenza district. On 27 May, taking great precaution as to secrecy, and requesting the Venetian authorities to offer no opposition so long as his troops behaved well, Eugene began his march by paths that no army had used since Charles V's time, and on the 28 May his army was on the plains. His first object was to cross the Adige without fighting, and also by ravaging the duke of Mantua Charles IV's private estates (sparing the possessions of the common people) to induce that prince to change sides. Catinat was completely surprised, for he had counted upon Venetian neutrality, and when in the search for a passage over the lower Adige, Eugene's army spread to Legnago and beyond, he made the mistake of supposing that the Austrians intended to invade the Spanish possessions south of the Po River. His first dispositions had, of course, been for the defence of the Rivoli approaches, but he now thinned out his line until it reached to the Po. The battle Prince Eugene crossing the Alps. After five weeks of cautious manoeuvring on both sides, Eugene found an unguarded spot about 10 km southeast of Legnago near the town of Castagnaro. With the usual precautions of secrecy (deceiving even his own army), he crossed the lower Adige in the night of 8/9 July, and overpowered the small cavalry corps that alone was encountered at Carpi (9 July). Catinat at once concentrated his scattered army backwards on the Mincio, while Eugene turned northward and regained touch with his old line of supply, Roveredo-Rivoli. For some time Eugene was in great difficulties for supplies, as the Venetians would not allow his barges to descend the Adige. At last, however, he made his preparations to cross the Mincio close to Peschiera del Garda and well beyond Catinat's left, with the intention of finding a new supply area about Brescia. This was executed on 28 July. Catinat's cavalry, though coming within sight of Eugene's bridges, offered no opposition. It seems that the marshal was well content to find that his opponent had no intention of attacking the Spanish possessions in the Peninsula; at any rate, Catinat fell back quietly to the Oglio. But his army resented his retreat before the much smaller force of the Austrians and, early in August, his rival Tess√© reported this to Paris, whereupon Marshal Villeroy, a favourite of Louis, was sent to take command.

It was founded in 2003 by Jake Dobkin and Jen Chung. In March 2017, Joe Ricketts, owner of DNAinfo, acquired the company and, in November 2017, the websites were temporarily shut down after the newsroom staff voted to unionize. In February 2018, it was announced that WNYC, KPCC and WAMU had acquired Gothamist, LAist and DCist, respectively. Chicagoist was purchased by Chicago-born rapper Chance the Rapper in July 2018. History  Early history and other blogs  The namesake blog, Gothamist, focused on New York City, was founded in 2003, by publisher Jake Dobkin and editor Jen Chung. other blogs operated by the company include LAist (for Los Angeles), DCist for Washington, D.C., Chicagoist, and SFist (for San Francisco) in the United States, as well as Shanghaiist internationally. Canadian blog Torontoist was launched by the American company, but was transferred to the locally-owned Ink Truck Media in April 2009, while retaining its \\"-ist\\" name and remaining affiliated with the Gothamist network.Torontoist Is Here To Stay, Torontoist, 8 April 2009 In March 2011, Torontoist was acquired from Ink Truck Media by St. Joseph Media, magazine publishing division of Canadian media giants St. Joseph Communications. As a result the site was not affected by the Gothamist shutdown in 2017, and remained in operation until it was acquired by Daily Hive in 2019. In a similar fashion, in 2010 Londonist was transferred to the London-based startup LDN Creative.

After the acquisition, Gothamist expunged from its archives a number of stories that had covered Ricketts critically. Regarding the removal of Ricketts related content from the site, Dobkin told Jezebel, ‚ÄúJust as Bloomberg doesn‚Äôt cover Bloomberg, we don‚Äôt plan to cover Joe Ricketts and so we decided to take down our coverage of him. No one asked us to do it. It was a decision made solely by Jen [Chung] and me.‚Äù On November 2, 2017, Ricketts posted to both DNAinfo and the \\"-ist\\" network sites that both websites would immediately cease operations, a week after Gothamist writers voted to unionize with the Writers Guild of America, East. All content from all DNAinfo sites and all subsidiary sites were taken down. The next day, archives of the sites were returned to functionality. Ricketts's shutdown was criticized as being a mere act of retaliation after the two companies' workers had joined a union. In the aftermath of the shutdown, laid-off reporters for Gothamist stated that former owners Jake Dobkin and Jen Chung actively cooperated with Ricketts to discourage the union efforts, ‚ÄúIt was textbook union-busting stuff.‚Äù  Relaunch  On February 23, 2018, public radio stations WNYC, KPCC, and WAMU announced that they had jointly acquired Gothamist and its related sites LAist and DCist. Under the agreement, Gothamist and its sister sites would begin publishing news content again. Additionally, WNYC acquired the archives of Chicagoist and SFist, and Chicago's WBEZ stated that they were exploring an acquisition of the former. WAMU relaunched DCist on June 11, 2018.

He fought in World War I in the Austrian Army, then in the Polish Army in the Polish-Soviet War, and also participated in the Silesian Uprisings. Sports career He came to Wis≈Ça in 1910 and remained with the club until his death. He made his debut in the first squad in 1914. When Reyman began his career in Wis≈Ça it was one of the oldest Polish football clubs but had no great sports success. By the end of his career in 1933 Wis≈Ça was already the champions team which year to year was said to prevail in the National Football League. It was him who led the team to great successes and conducted the exceptional and well-recognizable in Poland style of play of the ‚ÄòReds‚Äô. Reyman was the centre forwarder in Wis≈Ça. At the beginning he was a magnificent scorer, while as the time passed by he managed to combine these skills with the organization of the whole attack. The fans were mostly under the impression of his strikes and scored goals. He scored from free or penalty kicks, from solo dribble runs or from the passes of his co-players. He could strike with any allowable part of a body: from slightly disdained tips to headers. Experts underlined the power and the technique of his strikes. One anecdote rendering in an appropriate way his dynamite in legs refers to the match against the Romanian club - Fulgerul. Reyman scored 4 goals while one strike was a volley kick on the run. That strike was so powerful that the Romanian goalkeeper went into the goal with the ball and fell unconscious for a couple of minutes. No wonder that goalkeepers quailed at the sight of him shooting. His extraordinary effectiveness he showed during the National League seasons. The league verified value of players. He passed the exam with flying colours as the top scorer. His 37 goals in 23 official league matches in 1927 is still the unbeaten record until today. The talent of leading Wis≈Ça attack formation was his next asset. He had a phenomenal ability to read the play and to distribute the ball to his teammates. Thanks to him Wis≈Ça presented a unique yet well- recognizable style of play and the character which was the aggressive, hard, solid and ambitious play to the end, regardless the result. As a captain of the ‚ÄòReds‚Äô for over 10 years he conducted the play of the team. It is worth mentioning here that Wis≈Ça enjoyed greatest successes throughout interwar with no coach support. It happened so when they won the National Cup and the League Championship twice (1926‚Äì1928). As a team captain Reyman had to take the coach position and it was him who set up tactics and the squad for each game. He astonished the contemporary public with his devotion and commitment for the ‚ÄúWhite Star‚Äù. Wis≈Ça with Reyman were as one and no one would imagine any match of the ‚ÄòReds‚Äô without his performance and obviously he did not disappoint the fans. All the more while serving in the army in Vilnius he had to wander through the night by train in order to be ready to play the match next day for the beloved team. It happened once that he got late coming back from the military manoeuvres. He just dismounted the horse at the Jagiellonian University building and rushed the distance of two kilometres to the stadium. As soon as he reached it he was asked if he would be up to the difficult match. He replied: If only the teammates take up the play in 10 for several minutes, before I cool down and change, then I am ready... and so it was, and within couple of minutes after the first whistle a storm of applause announced entering the football pitch by the audience favourite. He paid it back scoring two goals. To describe the indomitableness of his spirit the most spectacular and dramatic game in the club history should be recalled. It was a local derby match against Cracovia on May, the 3rd 1925. Three days before the game he had his leg in a cast. He yielded however to the persuasions of the coach Schlosser and decided to step onto the pitch even if to assist and keep up the fighting spirit in the team. The sticking plaster was removed on Friday and he managed to hobble into the field on Sunday. The first half was the most dreadful in the history of all derbies. Wis≈Ça was losing 1 to 5. The Striped spectators were mad with joy. The Cracovian fans and players filled with elation kissed each other all drunk with happiness. It looked like a massacre on the so-far unprecedented scale. At half-time a miracle happened in Wis≈Ça locker room. There Reyman became the man of the moment and is supposed to call for his pals: ‚ÄúAnybody who does not feel up to giving all the best in the second half to clear our names of the shame hanging over us now should not re- enter the pitch (‚Ä¶). No one demands only victories from you. Sometimes you can be defeated. But everyone has the right to expect ambitious and tenacious play from you. Don‚Äôt let it happen that people consider you as unworthy of‚Ä¶ giving a hand‚Äù. It is clear what this hard talk resulted in. A completely new Wis≈Ça team walked into the pitch for the second half, the team which showed their character. They were people who had more in common than just playing football together, for whom honour and defence of the club colours of the beloved team were not just empty words. The team fought back with full commitment to the end, not giving up despite unfavourable circumstances and seemingly in the hopeless situation. Like he remembered afterwards: ‚ÄúWe decided to play to the bitter end. We fought like tigers, we got to all the balls, I did not feel pain‚Ä¶ we equalized‚Äù. Reyman worked superbly in this match and a fortune rewarded his efforts with 4 goals on his record (the last one 10 minutes before the end among the wild enthusiasm of Wis≈Ça fans). The game ended at the dusk falling which generously hid the blushes on faces of Cracovian players who were to achieve a great triumph but struggled to hold on to a draw in the last minutes of this dramatic match. Leaving the locker room Reyman is reputed to say to his teammates: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve saved the honour of Wis≈Ça‚Äù. He remained an indisputable leader of his team till his last play for Wis≈Ça. It was after he ended his career to discover how important he was for the team. Before World War 2 broke out, when he was missing on the pitch ‚ÄòThe Reds‚Äô being still the top-team were not able to grab the National League title. Career achievements In the years 1910-1933, Reyman played for Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w, scoring 109 goals between 1927-1933. Among his career highlights were: * Winning the Polish championship twice in consecutive seasons with Wis≈Ça (1927, 1928) * Top-scorer in the Polish Soccer League twice in consecutive seasons with 37 goals in 1927 and 30 goals in 1928 * Twelve caps for the Polish National Team * Captain of the National Team at the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris Years after career's end Reyman never gave up with the sport after he stopped playing. He began to work in the organisation of the Kutno Football sub- district Union even before the war. After the Second World War he played the predominant role in reviving this Kutno Union and the Polish Football Association. He was appointed as a National Coach of Polish team until 1948 when he was dismissed and removed from working for sport as a result of Stalin's purges. During the political thaw in 1956 he took an active part in re-establishing of the ruined in Stalinist times sports unions and associations. As a union captain of Polish National Football Association between 1956 and 1958 he conducted the Polish team in memorable matches with The Soviet Union in 1957 (in World Cup qualifying matches). Reyman worked for TS Wis≈Ça club till his death acting among others as an incumbent Vice-President, an honorary captain of the First Squad and an honorary President of The Company. He died on 11 April 1963 in Cracow. In recognition of his achievements, a street in Krak√≥w is named after him, as is the rebuilt Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w stadium.

Carpenter. Jafet Lindeberg (September 12, 1874 ‚Äì November 5, 1962)California, Death Index, 1940-1997 was a gold prospector and co-founder of the city of Nome, Alaska. Norsk gullgraverlegende. (wideroe.no) Background Jafet Isaksen Lindeberg was born in Kv√¶nangen, Troms county, in Norway. In his youth, he tried prospecting for gold in northern Norway. Lindeberg's father, Isak, was a farmer and fisherman. He had come to the region from the valley of Norrbotten, an ancient iron mining region in Norrbotten County, Sweden. Nome Gold Rush In the autumn of 1897, the U.S. Congress decided to send help to the gold miners in Klondike. The gold rush had escalated. Thousands of people rallied to the area, most of them completely unfamiliar with the harsh climate. The authorities feared a humanitarian disaster, with famine, epidemics and lawless conditions. It was difficult to send supplies. It was therefore decided that reindeer and able keepers were to be shipped from Norway to Klondike. Reindeer were known as versatile animals, that could be used for food, clothing and transport. On February 4, 1898, Lindeberg left Alta with the ship SS Manitoba, heading for New York City. He had been hired as a reindeer keeper. There were 113 people, 535 reindeer, and 250 tons of reindeer lichen on the ship. Upon arriving, he learned that the crisis was not as big as anticipated, and he was freed from his contract. The Three Lucky Swedes On the Seward Peninsula at the Bering Strait he met the Swedish immigrants Erik Lindblom and John Brynteson. The three formed the mining firm, Pioneer Mining Company. Lindeberg was elected president of the new venture. The three partners also founded the city of Nome, where they later made a big find of gold. The rumors about \\"The Three Lucky Swedes\\" spread quickly. The following year, Nome experienced a gold rush similar to the Klondike rush. In 1899, Lindeberg joined in the development of Moonlight Springs which was founded by James M. Davidson (1853-1928) to supply water to the City of Nome.Lindeberg, president of the Pioneer Mining Company (Biographies of Nome, Alaska) Late-comers tried to \\"jump\\" the claims of the Pioneer Mining Company by filing mining claims over the same ground. A federal judge ruled that the Pioneer Mining Company claims were valid, but some of the claim jumpers gave partial interests in their claims to Washington politicians, including Alexander McKenzie, who engineered the naming of their own federal judge in the District of Alaska, Arthur Noyes (1854-1915). Noyes handed the Pioneer claims over to the claim jumpers. William W. Morrow, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, subsequently reversed Noyes' rulings, and ordered the gold mines restored to their rightful owners. After Noyes left Nome in disgrace, Lindeberg joined a group of masked vigilantes to seize their properties back from the claim jumpers. The claim-jumping incident was the basis for Rex Beach's best-selling novel The Spoilers (1906), which was made into a stage play and five times into movies. Japhet Lindeberg lived long enough to see the character based on himself played on the big screen by John Wayne, although Lindeberg modestly said that he didn't see much resemblance between himself and Wayne's character in The Spoilers. Lindeberg sold out his share in the Pioneer Mining Company to Wendell P. Hammon (1854-1938) in the 1920s. During a subsequent visit to Norway, Lindeberg convinced his old friend Leonhard Seppala to come work for him in America. Seppala later became a renowned musher, a hero of the 1925 serum run to Nome, and the foremost breeder of Siberian Husky of his time. Lindeberg was married to Josephine Elizabeth Metson (1874-1965), sister of William Henry Metson, attorney for Pioneer Mining. Lindeberg died in San Francisco, California in 1962.

There is evidence of man's activity at the site since the Mesolithic period including Bathampton Camp, an Iron Age hillfort or stock enclosure. It has also been used for quarrying and is now used for a golf course. Geography The plateau is formed from the Greater Oolitic Limestone with formations including Forest Marble, Bath Oolite, Twinhoe Beds and Combe Down Oolite. The limestone dates from the Middle Jurassic with deposits of flint quartz and sandstone, mainly preserved in fissures or other cavities dating from the Middle Pleistocene. The limestone is porous which, along with the flat nature of the plateau means there are no streams or rivers, particularly as several cold springs on Bathampton Down were diverted into reservoirs in the late 18th and early 19th centuries having originally flowed down to the River Avon. Remains of the tramway The southern area merges with Claverton Down and lies above part of the Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines Site of Special Scientific Interest, designated because of the Greater and Lesser Horseshoe bat population. There are small disused quarries which used to obtain Bath stone between the Roman era and the 18th century. Several of these can be seen on the golf course and other have left workings which run under the fairways. The entrance to the Seven Sisters' Quarry was blown up in the 1960s, although the remains of the tramway used to carry stone down to the Canal can still be seen. At the highest point is a Triangulation station at a height of above sea level, which provides views over the city and surrounding countryside. The northern slopes between Bathampton Down and the River Avon have been built on and are traversed by the A36. To the east is Bathampton Wood separating the plateau from the road, River Avon, Kennet and Avon Canal and the Great Western Main Line. \\"Bathampton Rocks\\", an outcrop of rock, was the site of the Bathampton Patrol (Auxiliary Units) Operational Base during the Second World War. To the south and east are Claverton Down and the site of the University of Bath. History Prehistoric Wansdyke and other earthworks at Bathampton Down The first evidence of human activity is from the Mesolithic period and consists of a dispersed collection of flint finds, including hammerstones, cores, fragments of axes and arrowheads. The remains of a stone circle were described in the 19th century; however no evidence remains. Four Bronze Age round barrows (tumuli) have been reported. There are also tentative findings of a probable bowl barrow and a possible confluent barrow. In one round barrow a small burial urn was recovered. Many of the barrows were opened by John Skinner in the 18th Century. Bathampton Camp may have been a univallate Iron Age hill fort or stock enclosure. The rectangular enclosure approximately (east-west) by (north-south) has been identified, which may be a Medieval earthwork. The eastern side needs no protection, because the ground falls away steeply to the River Avon, below. There is a single rampart and flat-bottomed ditch on the other three sides (univallate). The site was excavated in 1904-5 and in 1952‚Äì4. Human and animal remains were found, also pottery and flint flakes. Small fragments of pottery were found during excavations in the 1960s which have been dated to the Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age. The area is a Scheduled monument. During the Iron Age the area surrounding the camp had a settled agrarian landscape. There is a network of Celtic fields of some around the area now covered by the golf course. These are difficult to date but are thought to originate in the Iron Age and may have still been in use into the Roman Empire era. The area to the south east, which is known as Bushey Norwood and includes part of the ramparts and some surviving upright stones, was given to the National Trust by Miss M.E. Mallett in 1960. Roman There is some evidence of a small Roman villa, although the area is more noted for funerary activity with two Romano-British stone coffins being found in 1794 and 1824, both containing inhumation remains. Medieval Earthworks with the telecommunications tower in the background For many years it was thought that the earthworks were a part of the Wansdyke, but it is now thought improbable that Wansdyke crossed Bathampton Down. There is stronger evidence of agrarian activity with extant strip lynchets to the west of Bathwick Wood. There are also several pillow mounds, used as artificial rabbit warrens in the area known as Bathampton Warren. These date from 1256 when Henry III gave the right to hunt small game to the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Bathampton Down is one of the sites considered as a possible location for the Battle of Mons Badonicus, the traditional site of legendary King Arthur's decisive victory over the Saxons. Modern Sham Castle Sham Castle, a folly on the western edge of Bathampton Warren, was probably designed around 1755 by Sanderson Miller and was built in 1762 by Richard James, master mason for Ralph Allen, \\"to improve the prospect\\" from Ralph Allen's town house in Bath. It is a Grade II* listed building. It consists of a single screen wall with a central pointed arch, flanked by two 3-storey circular turrets, which extend sideways to a 2-storey square tower at each end of the wall. Sham Castle is illuminated at night. There is a telecommunications mast across the far side of the golf course from Sham Castle. Around 1730, at the North-East corner of Bathampton Camp, a new limestone quarry was opened by Ralph Allen, to provide local cut Bath stone for buildings in Bath. Its use declined by the end of the 18th Century; however between around 1800 and 1895 it reopened to supply stone for the Kennet and Avon Canal, with the stone being lowered down an inclined plane gravity tramway to the water. The American Museum in Britain at Claverton Manor On the southern slopes sits the American Museum in BritainAmerican Museum in Britain website in Claverton Manor, a house designed by Jeffry Wyattville and built in the 1820s on the site of a manor bought by Ralph Allen in 1758. It is now a Grade I listed building. A drinking water reservoir was constructed on the down in 1955, although the land had originally been purchased by the City Council of Bath in 1928. The University of Bath campus The area is now part of a golf course behind the University of Bath. Construction of the campus began in 1964, with the first building, now known as \\"4 South\\", completed in 1965, and an artificial lake was constructed. Over the subsequent decade, new buildings were added as the campus took shape. The eastern part of the campus is dominated by the \\"Sports Training Village\\", built in 1992 and enhanced in 2003 with an extension. A proposal to move the boundary of the \\"Green Belt\\" surrounding the town from where it crosses the campus to its edge, to facilitate further development area for the University, was agreed in October 2007, by the local council for Bath and North East Somerset following a public inquiry. Over several years, the Bath University grounds have received recognition for their outstanding beauty with awards from groups like \\"Bath in Bloom\\".

It includes 112 (106 in the later versions) cards as well as a mechanical card launcher. It first launched in 2011. The main difference between Uno Attack and the original Uno is that instead of drawing cards, players press a button on the card launcher, which shoots out a random number of cards at random times. Mechanical Card Launcher UNO Attack comes with a special mechanical card launcher that runs on 3 C batteries. The card shooter contains a receptacle where the deck of cards is placed, and a button on the front, known as the \\"Launcher Button\\". When the rules call for a player to \\"Hit\\" the card shooter, the player presses the button on the card shooter. An electronic chime sounds, and a random number of cards shoot out. As many as 25 cards have been known to shoot out. At times, the shooter may not shoot out any cards, as it is designed not to do so every time. Numerous tests have shown that it will shoot out cards at least once every four button presses, however other tests have shown the shooter going as many as 10 passes without shooting cards. It has been known to rarely shoot out cards more than twice in succession. Differences to Original Uno In Uno Attack, there are a number of differences to the original card game. The gameplay differences are as follows: * When a player does not have a playable card in the original game, they are forced to draw 2 cards. Uno Attack's rules call for the player to press the Launcher button once instead. * When a player plays their second-to-last card, thereby reducing their hand to one card, they must shout, \\"Uno!\\" If they do not, and another player catches it, they are forced to draw two penalty cards in the original game. Uno Attack, however, calls for the player to press the Launcher button twice instead. In addition, a player who calls \\"Uno!\\" when they have more than one card must hit the Launcher button twice as a penalty. * A player may choose not to play a playable card in their hand. If so, the player must hit the Launcher button once, rather than drawing a card as in the original. This is known as \\"Reneging.\\" * Any player making a card suggestion to another player must hit the Launcher button four times, instead of drawing two penalty cards as in the original. * Pressing the Launcher button any number of times ends a player's turn. * If any cards are left sticking out of the Launcher after cards are shot out, the player who pressed the Launcher button must take these cards into their hand with the ones that managed to clear the launcher. * \\"Wild Draw-Four\\" is replaced by \\"Wild Hit Fire\\" and \\"Wild All Hit\\", in which the player who played that card gets to choose the color and the next player must hit the launcher button until it fires. Cards The cards included in the game are as follows: * Two 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's, 7's, 8's, and 9's of each color (red, blue, green, and yellow). * Two \\"Reverses\\" of each color. * Two \\"Skips\\" of each color. * Two \\"Hit twos\\" of each color. * One \\"Discard all\\" of each color. * One \\"Trade Hands\\" of each color * Four \\"Wilds\\". * Two \\"Wild Hit-Fires\\". * Two \\"Wild All Hits\\". Here is what each card means in detail: * Reverse - Simply reverse direction of play. Play left becomes play right, and vice versa. * Skip - The next player to play loses his/her turn and is ‚Äúskipped.‚Äù * Wild Card - This card can be played on any card. The person playing the card calls any color to continue play, including the one presently being played if desired. A Wild card can be played even if the player has another playable card in his/her hand. * Hit 2 - When this card is played, the next player must hit the Launcher button twice. His or her turn is then over; play continues with the next player. * Discard All - Play this card when a player wants to discard all of the cards in your hand of the same color. For example, if a yellow ‚Äú7‚Äù is in the Discard pile, one may discard all the yellow cards in your hand, with a yellow Discard All card placed on top. (you may also discard a Discard All card on the top of another Discard All card.) * Trade Hands - The player who plays this card will exchange all cards with the other player that he or she chooses. * Wild Hit-Fire - When this card is played the player calls a color, then the next player in the direction of play must press the Launcher button until the Launcher shoots out cards. The activating player adds the Launched cards to his or her hand and forfeits his/her turn, then play continues as normal with the next player. * Wild All Hit - The player who plays this card chooses the color and all other players must press the Launcher button Common variants * Modified Uno Attack: When a player has a specialty played, he or she has the opportunity to play the same specialty card.

The mall's anchor store is Bass Pro Shops. History Fingerlakes Mall was developed by The Pyramid Companies of Syracuse, New York in 1980. Originally the mall featured Chappell's, JCPenney, Kmart, and Sears as its anchor stores; at the time, the mall also featured a movie theater and roller skating arena. Chappell's moved to Camillus in 1994, and Kmart closed a year later. As these anchor stores closed, the mall began to lose many inline tenants, and by the late 1990s it was forty-five percent occupied. Peebles soon replaced Chappell's but then closed not long afterward. Also operated in the former Chappell's space was later Manhattan 101 and then Steve & Barry's. In June 1992, the mall was sold to Jager Management, who in turn sold it to Gregory Greenfield & Associates (GG&A;) five months later. Under GG&A;'s management, and with Jones Lang LaSalle as a leasing agent, the mall was renovated inside and outside. By 2003, it was at eighty percent occupancy. Sears was later re-located from its existing space to the space vacated by Kmart. The former Sears spaces and adjoining mall space were converted to Bass Pro Shops, which opened in 2004. In the end of September 2012, The Finger Lakes Theatre closed it doors after 7 years being opened by the management company who also controls Auburn's Movieplex 10 in Auburn, New York. Sears announced the closure of its Fingerlakes store in late 2014. On June 4, 2020, it was announced that JCPenney would be closing on October 18, 2020 as part of a plan to close 154 stores nationwide which left Bass Pro Shops as the only anchor left.

Its body color is gray to brownish without markings, and its limbs are relatively short. It is the official state amphibian of Alabama.  Habitat  The range of the Red Hills salamander is restricted to a narrow belt of two geological formations, approximately long (east to west) and between 10 and wide (north to south), in southern Alabama. These formations are included within the Red Hills physiographic province of the Coastal Plain. The range is limited on the east by the Conecuh River and on the west by the Alabama River (Jordan and Mount 1975). Currently, there are eight published locality records from Butler, Conecuh, Covington, Crenshaw, and Monroe Counties (Brandon 1965; Schwaner and Mount 1970). This species inhabits burrows located on the slopes of moist, cool mesic ravines shaded by an overstory of predominately hardwood trees. These areas are underlain by a subsurface siltstone stratum containing many crevices, root tracings, and solution channels which are utilized by the Salamander. The topsoil in typical habitat is sandy loam. Data for comparison of habitat changes are available from two studies; one by French (1976) and one by Dodd (1989). Ninety-one of the same sites were surveyed in both studies. (Each study also surveyed additional sites not visited by the other study.) Of these 91 sites, 54 appeared similar to earlier descriptions, 19 had improved habitat conditions, and 18 were adversely affected by timber cutting since 1976. Of the 19 sites judged to have improved, 18 had been cleared of trees or had been selectively cut prior to French's survey but have since regrown a full tree canopy. (None of these improved sites had been mechanically prepared for replanting.) In addition to these 91 sites, 14 others examined in the latest survey were damaged by timber cutting; their status in 1976, however, was unknown. Conservation status P. hubrichti is considered a threatened species. Primary threats to this species include its restricted range, loss of habitat, a low reproductive rate, and a limited capability of dispersal. Of the approximately 63,000 acres (250 km¬≤) of remaining habitat, about 60 percent is currently owned or leased by paper companies which primarily use a clear-cut system of forest management. This technique, coupled with mechanical site preparation for replanting, appears to completely destroy the habitat for the Red Hills Salamander. However, as noted above, the Red Hills Salamander prefers hardwood sites which are not managed using a clear-cut system. The clear-cut system is used primarily in pine management. Pine sites are not conducive as Red Hills Salamander habitat. In 2010, The Nature Conservancy acquired of land in southwest Alabama in an effort to provide sufficient habitat to support the survival of the species. The land will eventually be transferred for recreational use to the state of Alabama.

Life and playing career Born in Gillingham, Kent, Edmed played for Chatham Centrals, Rochester and Gillingham before being signed by Liverpool manager Matt McQueen in January 1926 for ¬£1800. He couldn't have made his debut in a more important game if he had tried, it was the visit to Anfield by bitter rivals Manchester United in a Division One match on 28 August 1926, Liverpool made it a happy day for Edmed as they beat United 4‚Äì2 with Dick Forshaw bagging a hat-trick, his goalscoring account was opened 6 days later on 4 September at the Baseball Ground, but Derby County won the game 2‚Äì1. Edmed, a winger, went straight into the starting line-up and stayed there for the rest of his first season missing only four matches. He, again, couldn't be shifted from his spot the following year when he was an ever-present, along with Tom Bromilow, scoring 14 times, he was the club's spot-kick taker which helped him score as many as he did from the wide position. He was to score two more (16) the following season, missing just three games, this total was even more remarkable as his penalty duties were given to Robert Done. He started the next campaign and was again a permanent fixture in the side until he picked an injury towards the end of the season. He was to play just a dozen times during the 1930‚Äì31 campaign and eventually lost his place to Harold Barton. After spending six years at the club, appearing 170 times and scoring 46 goals, Edmed was allowed to leave and joined his final club, Bolton Wanderers, in May 1932. He scored on his Bolton debut, ironically against Liverpool, in an 8‚Äì1 win for his new team at Burnden Park. He died on his birthday 14 February 1984.

In addition to the twenty-four official comic albums written by Herg√©, several unofficial parodies and pastiches of The Adventures of Tintin have been published over the years by various authors. While some consist in entirely new drawings made to resemble the original art, others were created by splicing together strips from the original albums, and rewriting the dialogue. The copyright owner of the original comics, Moulinsart, has taken legal steps to stop publication of some of the unofficial material. Eric Jenot's Tintin Parodies site was closed down by Moulinsart in 2004 for displaying Tintin parodies and pastiches. Other material has remained available, for instance the anarchist/communist comic Breaking Free.  Parodies and satire Some parodies of Tintin feature the actual Tintin characters with their original identities and personalities, some feature the original characters but with wildly modified personalities, and some simply reuse the appearance of the characters but give them completely different names and identities.

It is commonly used in failure analysis and non-destructive evaluation. It also has applications in biological and medical research. The semiconductor industry has found the SAM useful in detecting voids, cracks, and delaminations within microelectronic packages. History The first scanning acoustic microscope (SAM), with a 50 MHz ultrasonic lens, was developed in 1974 by R. A. Lemons and C. F. Quate at the Microwave Laboratory of Stanford University. A few years later, in 1980, the first high-resolution (with a frequency up to 500 MHz) through-transmission SAM was built by R.Gr. Maev and his students at his Laboratory of Biophysical Introscopy of the Russian Academy of Sciences.7\\\\. R. Gr.

Ultrason., Ferroelectr. Freq. Control, 32 (2), 289 ‚Äì301 (1985) Since then, many improvements to such systems have been made to enhance resolution and accuracy. Most of them were described in detail in the monograph Advanced in Acoustic Microscopy, Ed. by Andrew Briggs, 1992, Oxford University Press and in monograph by Roman Maev, Acoustic Microscopy Fundamentals and Applications, Monograph, Wiley & Son - VCH, 291 pages, August 2008, as well as recently in R.Gr. Maev, Editor and Co-author, Advances in Acoustic Microscopy and High Resolution Ultrasonic Imaging: From Principles to New Applications, Monograph, 14 Chapters, 400 pages, Wiley & Son - VCH, April 2013. Principles of operation Scanning acoustic microscopy works by directing focused sound from a transducer at a small point on a target object. Sound hitting the object is either scattered, absorbed, reflected (scattered at 180¬∞) or transmitted (scattered at 0¬∞). It is possible to detect the scattered pulses travelling in a particular direction. A detected pulse informs of the presence of a boundary or object. The \`time of flight' of the pulse is defined as the time taken for it to be emitted by an acoustic source, scattered by an object and received by the detector, which is usually coincident with the source. The time of flight can be used to determine the distance of the inhomogeneity from the source given knowledge of the speed through the medium. Based on the measurement, a value is assigned to the location investigated. The transducer (or object) is moved slightly and then insonified again. This process is repeated in a systematic pattern until the entire region of interest has been investigated. Often the values for each point are assembled into an image of the object. The contrast seen in the image is based either on the object's geometry or material composition. The resolution of the image is limited either by the physical scanning resolution or the width of the sound beam (which in turn is determined by the frequency of the sound). Applications \\\\- Fast production control \\\\- Standards : IPC A610, Mil-Std883, J-Std-035, Esa, etc \\\\- Parts sorting \\\\- Inspection of solder pads, flip-chip, underfill, die-attach \\\\- Sealing joints \\\\- Brazed and welded joints \\\\- Qualification and fast selection of glues, adhesive, comparative analyses of aging, etc \\\\- Inclusions, heterogeneities, porosities, cracks in material Device testing SAM is used for counterfeit detection, product reliability testing, process validation, vendor qualification, quality control, failure analysis, research, and development. Detecting discontinuities in silicon is just one of the ways scanning acoustic microscopy is being used for testing in the semiconductor market. Medicine and biology SAM can provide data on the elasticity of cells and tissues, which can give useful information on the physical forces holding structures in a particular shape and the mechanics of structures such as the cytoskeleton. These studies are particularly valuable in investigating processes such as cell motility. Some work has also been performed to assess penetration depth of particles injected into skin using needle-free injection Another promising direction was initiated by different groups to design and build portable hand- held SAM for subsurface diagnostics of soft and hard tissues Vogt, M., and Ermert, H., ‚ÄúLimited-angle spatial compounding imaging of skin with high- frequency ultrasound,‚Äù IEEE Trans.

He scored 326 league goals in 485 games. Club career Bedford, a striker, began his career at Nottingham Forest in 1919, and it was after his performance against Blackpool at the City Ground that the promotion-seeking Seasiders, under the guidance of new manager Bill Norman, signed him in March 1921 for a fee of ¬£900. He made his debut for the Seasiders in a 1‚Äì0 league defeat at South Shields on 12 March 1921, and scored his first goal for the club in the return match at Bloomfield Road seven days later. Bedford scored seven goals in his first ten league games for Blackpool. In 1921‚Äì22 he scored 11 goals in 32 games, and the following season, 1922‚Äì23, he played in all 42 league games and scored 32 goals and was the country's leading goalscorer. In 1923‚Äì24 he was again the country's top scorer with 34 goals, a feat which only Jimmy Hampson equalled. In 1924‚Äì25, Bedford's goals helped Blackpool reach the fourth round of the FA Cup for the first time and he scored 24 goals in 40 league games. He scored six goals in seven games at the start of the 1925‚Äì26 season, but was transferred to Derby County on 24 September 1925, for a fee of ¬£3,500. He scored 142 goals in 203 league games for Derby. In December 1930 he was transferred to Newcastle United, playing 30 league games and scoring 17 goals up to January 1932, when he moved to Sunderland, a move which only lasted for a short time. On 12 May 1932, he moved to Bradford Park Avenue where he scored 15 goals in the 1932‚Äì33 season. And in June 1933 he joined Chesterfield, where he scored 12 goals in the 1933‚Äì34 season. However, he then refused new contract terms with Chesterfield and the club released him. In August 1934 he joined non-League club Heanor Town, where he ended his playing career. International career Bedford was capped twice for England. He made his debut against Sweden on 21 May 1923 in a match which England won 4‚Äì2. His only other England cap came against Ireland on 22 October 1924, at Anfield, scoring England's second goal in a 3‚Äì1 victory. Managerial career In the late 1930s Bedford joined Newcastle United's coaching staff, before joining Derby County where he became the club's masseur in 1938. After World War II he became manager of Heanor Town, a position he held until he resigned in 1955. He died in Derby on 24 June 1976. Blackpool F.C.

Life and career Early Born October 20, 1948, in the Hakata ward of Fukuoka, Naomi Tani moved to Tokyo at the age of 18. After arrival in Tokyo, she was featured in a photo layout in Weekly Taishu / Popular Weekly (ÈÄ±ÂàäÂ§ßË°Ü - Shukan Taishu).Tani, Naomi. Interviewed by Hamamoto, Maki. (1998). \\"Naomi Tani - An Interview with Nikkatsu's Queen of SM\\" (Conducted in January 1998 in Kyushu, Japan) in Asian Cult Cinema Number 19, April 1998. p.39. This appearance led to offers for roles in \\"Pink films\\", the low-budget, independent soft-core pornographic films which dominated Japan's domestic cinema at this time. Her debut was in the 1967 film Special. She took her screen name \\"Tani\\" from the novelist Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki and \\"Naomi\\" from the central character in his important early work A Fool's Love. \\"Tani,\\" or \\"valley,\\" is also a Japanese slang word for the cleavage between the breasts. Consequently, Ms. Tani may have had a variety of puns in mind when she later opened a restaurant calling it the \\"Ohtani\\" (Big Breasts or Big Tani). Tani's early films were principally with the small companies that were making pink films independent of the large studio system in the 1960s. In her pre-Nikkatsu career, she appeared in comedies, dramas, and action films, but it was the S&M; genre which would make Tani a star. Her debut film was Special („Çπ„Éö„Ç∑„É£„É´ - Supesharu) for Shin Nihon Eigasha and directed by the prolific pink film auteur K≈çji Seki. The film had Tani in the role of the mistress of a black marketeer who tries to cheat people at an onsen. The couple is stopped by the local villagers. Experiments on the Human Body (Zanki: Seitaijikken 1967) was a war drama in which Tani played a nurse in China where Japanese doctors are performing experiments on Chinese POWs. Tani had a minor role in director Mamoru Watanabe's Slave Widow, which starred major \\"pink\\" actresses Noriko Tatsumi and Mari lwai. Impressed with Tani, Watanabe, considered one of the \\"Pillars of Pink,\\" cast Tani in her first leading role for his next film, Bed of Violent Desires (1967). Typical of the sex-thriller pink films made by Koei studio in the years before Nikkatsu took over the genre in the 1970s, in this film, Tani plays the role of a daughter who seeks bloody revenge against her mother and her lover after they kill Tani's father for his money.Weisser, p.62, 394-395. Tani's first experience with an S&M; film was in one episode of the omnibus film Memoirs Of A Modern Female Doctor (1967),Weisser, 269. and her first full-fledged S&M; leading role was in director Masanao Sakao's Cruel Map of Women's Bodies (1967), in which she plays a prostitute who repeatedly escapes from, and then captured and tortured by the yakuza. Tani would play similar roles for Sakao in other films such as Virgins With Bad Reputations, also made in 1967.Weisser, p.139. During this early stage of her career, Tani sometimes worked at prominent pink film producer/director K≈çji Wakamatsu's independent studio. She worked several times with the prolific director Shin'ya Yamamoto (director) in such films as Degenerate (1967), Memoirs of Modern Love: Curious Age (1967) and Season For Rapists (1969).Weisser, p.113. Also during this period she became friends with the SM author, Oniroku Dan, with whom she would work throughout her film career. Dan was secretly writing S&M; film scripts under the pseudonym Matsugoro Kuroiwa while working as a high school English teacher.Tani (Interview), p.39. Tani's \\"pretty face, beautiful fair skin... and 96cm (38\\") large breasts\\" as well as her acting abilities helped make her a popular actress in the late 1960s. She reportedly appeared in more than 200 films before her work with Nikkatsu, for which she is best known today.Weisser, p.333. Even at this early stage of her career, working for independent studios, Tani had already established herself as the \\"Queen of Pink.\\"Konuma, Masaru. (1998). Interviewed by Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser on November 6, 1998, in Asian Cult Cinema, #22, 1st Quarter, 1999. p.22. As an indication of her growing prominence as a representative of the erotic cinema in Japan, she appeared in the U.S. Playboy's December 1968 issue in their \\"Girls of the Orient\\" pictorial article. In 1972, she directed two films from Oniroku Dan stories, Sex Killer and Starved Sex Beast. Commenting on her own directorial style, Tani noted, \\"I accentuated scenes with a lot of torture and bondage.\\"Tani (Interview), p.44. Nikkatsu Throughout the 1960s, softcore pornographic \\"Pink Films\\" had been produced in Japan by small, independent studios. In 1971, however, Nikkatsu, the country's oldest film studio, had entered the \\"Pink Film\\" market with its high-budget and quality \\"Roman Porno\\" series. Besides appearing in Nikkatsu's first experiment in the pink film in 1968, Tokyo Bathhouse (Onna Ukiyo Buro), which featured over 30 sex-film stars in cameo appearances,Weisser, p.434.World Filmography 1968, p.411. Tani's first official Roman porno for Nikkatsu was in a minor role as a nurse in Sensuous Beasts (1972). Unlike her starring roles for smaller studios, she played a supporting role in this film. Preferring to continue starring in lower-budget films rather than playing supporting roles for Nikkatsu's leading Roman Porno actresses, she did not stay with Nikkatsu at this time.Tani (Interview), p.41.Weisser, p.374-375. Even when Nikkatsu began asking Tani to work for their studio in major roles, she refused for years because Nikkatsu was reluctant to enter the S&M; genre with its Roman Porno series. Feeling that S&M; was her destiny, Tani consented to work at Nikkatsu only on the condition that her first film be based on Oniroku Dan's novel, Flower and Snake. Nikkatsu agreed. Directed by Masaru Konuma, this 1974 film became a major hit for Nikkatsu, and established the S&M; genre of Roman Porno film which would continue to be profitable for the studio throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Tani's next film for Nikkatsu, Wife to be Sacrificed (1974) was also directed by Konuma, though, unlike most of her films for the studio, this one was not based on an Oniroku Dan novel. It became an even bigger hit than Flower and Snake, and one of Nikkatsu's all-time top five money-makers. Tani's female co-star from Wife to be Sacrificed, Terumi Azuma, would return in the 1975 film, Cruelty: Black Rose Torture, and the two would be paired in several other films until Azuma began starring in her own films in 1976.Weisser, p.302. The title introduced Nikkatsu's nickname for Tani (\\"Black Rose\\"), which would be re-used in later film titles.Weisser, p.66. In Konuma's 1977 parody of the Roman porn genre, In the Realm of Sex, Tani appears as herself, stalked by a perverted middle-aged fan who wants to perform an S&M; session with her. Tani manages to reverse the roles by binding and torturing the fan instead.Weisser, p.209. Besides Konuma, Tani worked for many of the other most prominent Roman porno directors while at Nikkatsu. \\"Violent pink\\" director Yasuharu Hasebe commented, \\"I regret that I only worked with her once... a very short scene at a greenhouse in Rape! The segment was only long enough for her to get assaulted by the rapist.\\"Hasebe, Yasuharu. (1999). Interviewed by Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser in Tokyo. Asian Cult Cinema #25, 4th Quarter 1999, p.42. Tani starred in director K≈çy≈´ Ohara's Nikkatsu Roman pornos, Fascination: Portrait of a Lady (1977), Rope Hell (1978) and Fairy in a Cage (1977) which had Tani playing the role of a wealthy business woman who is tortured by the sadistic head of the inquisition branch of the Japanese military during World War II.Weisser, p.136-138. Director Sh≈çgor≈ç Nishimura's 1978 film, Lady Black Rose, contained two notorious scenes which are often selected as examples of the Roman porno S&M; genre. In one, gallons of water are forced into Tani's mouth through a funnel while her stomach can be seen enlarging. Tani points out that scenes like these were often tricks, though no special effects were involved. \\"I was simply good at sucking my belly into a small ball and then expanding it.\\"Tani (Interview), p.43. In the other, gallons of brandy are similarly poured into Tani's vagina while her body can be seen flushing from pale white to a drunken red. The film is alternately praised and condemned as \\"the ultimate woman-as-an-object\\" film.Weisser, p.222-223. Tani's last film, Rope and Skin (1979) was also directed by Nishimura, once again based on an Oniroku Dan novel, and had a part for fellow \\"Pink queen,\\" Junko Miyashita. As Tani's farewell performance, Nikkatsu gave this critically acclaimed yakuza period-piece a big budget.Weisser, p.353. Tani's style Known for her remarkable dedication to her work, Tani would perform even the most extreme of S&M; scenes without complaint. During the twelve years she worked as an actress, she never went to the beach or allowed herself to get a suntan, feeling that it was important to keep her skin very white, so that it could be seen turning red during some of the scenes involving such things as whippings or melting candle wax tortures.Tani (Interview), p.43-44 Tani wrote in 1998 \\"The woman's naked body must not only be seen as a sensual object, but must also be able to express emotion; so, I did my best to keep Naomi Tani's body as close as possible to perfect condition.\\"Tani, Naomi. (1998) \\"Introduction\\" in Weisser, Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, p.9 When Tani was asked if she ever found herself sexually aroused while making a film, she stressed the artistry behind her performances, commenting that the face of a woman in actual sexual ecstasy would likely cause laughter. Instead, she says, \\"An actress has the responsibility to excite the audience, not herself.\\"Tani (Interview), p.45 She further states, \\"... to gain sympathy from the audience, I engaged in elaborate discussions with the filmmakers concerning Naomi Tani's torture scenes, to insure that they were both cruel and beautiful.\\"Tani (\\"Introduction\\"), p.12 Her willingness to submit herself to scenes of extreme physical difficulty led director Shinya Yamamoto to famously utter, \\"Naomi Tani is a monster!\\"Tani (Interview), p.40 The quality of her performances was recognized by the mainstream Japanese film establishment. She was nominated for best actress by the Japanese Academy for two of her Nikkatsu Roman Porno films, Lady Black Rose, and Flesh of the Rose, (both 1978). Director Masaru Konuma says as an actress Tani was, \\"Stylish. No matter what she did-- her behavior, her attitude, her body-- everything became a perfect picture.\\"Konuma, p.24 In his Behind the Mask: On Sexual Demons, Sacred Mothers, Transvestites, Gangsters, Drifters, and Other Japanese Cultural Heroes, Ian Buruma describes Tani as the most celebrated porn star of her time, \\"combin[ing] the savage and the maternal.\\" To explain her popularity he says she \\"looked like a Japanese mother, her ample breasts tucked into a matronly kimono. She was the ideal object for men to take their anxieties out in, like the patient mother being pummelled by her sons. She was the Mother Goddess in bondage, the passive cross-bearer of masculine inadequacy.\\" Retirement In 1979, after reigning for five years as Nikkatsu's \\"Queen Of S&M;,\\" Tani retired suddenly and unexpectedly at the height of her popularity. She later gave her reason as, \\"I never wanted to disappoint my fans by showing an unflattering face. That's why I've always refused to do a comeback. Nobody is free from aging. I want to exist in the audience's memory as a forever blooming flower.\\"Weisser, p.333 She celebrated her retirement by issuing a vocal album entitled Modae no Heya. On this disc's recent re-release in CD format, a reviewer commented of Tani's vocals, \\"There‚Äôs a worldliness in her voice and a maturity which suggests she‚Äôs seen it all... There is however a fragility to her voice, a cracking sense of the truly erotic, the unseen, the taboo which drapes each syllable... hearing music which would usually be readily associated with a mid-70s Samurai movie bedding down with such muted eroticism is more than a winning formula.\\" Tani notes that she immediately felt much more relaxed upon retirement. \\"I didn't have to worry about going out in the sun. I could suddenly enjoy the outdoors, golf and the beach.\\"Tani (Interview), p.46 Her early retirement from film was clouded by difficulty however. In 1981 she was hit by a car while walking her dog, and had to undergo extensive rehabilitation for three years. This difficult period in her life continued with her 1984 divorce from her husband. After the divorce, she opened the Ohtani restaurant in Kumamoto, which became highly successful, and which she currently owns.Tani (Interview), p.47 In 1996 she also opened \\"Yours Naomi\\", a video store near Hakata which specializes in erotic cinema, especially Nikkatsu's Roman Porno films. She comments that \\"Many young people (in their 20s and 30s) who used to buy the mindless AV [Adult Video] junk have shifted to 'Roman Porn' after being introduced to it.\\" During the late 1990s Tani's work enjoyed a renewed surge of interest. Wife to be Sacrificed was released theatrically in the U.S. in 1998, playing in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City.Ranaletta, Ray. (1998). \\"Wife to be Sacrificed - Coming to a Theater Near You?\\" in Asian Cult Cinema, # 19 (April 1998), p.49-50 In preparation for this event, Tani was interviewed by the U.S. publication, Asian Cult Cinema for its April, 1998 issue. Surprised by this attention from the U.S., Tani commented \\"I didn't think U.S. movie fans were interested in me or my movies. I thought Americans ignored my films because of the SM theme, since these movies give the impression of being abusive toward women. Regardless of the filmmaker's intent - the intellectual or artistic merit - I thought Americans viewed these productions as politically incorrect.\\" This attention from the U.S. again brought Tani to the attention of the domestic Japanese media. At the time, Tani wrote, \\"the fact that people are still interested in me - after almost 20 years away from the screen - fills me with buoyancy and surprise. It embarrasses me, too.\\" In this retrospective atmosphere, Tani was finally persuaded to return to film in 2000 to appear in Hideo Nakata's documentary on director Masaru Konuma entitled Sadistic and Masochistic.

It was fought on 16 April 1941, between four British and three Italian destroyers, near the Kerkennah Islands off Sfax, in the Tunisian coast. The battle was named after the Italian flagship, the destroyer Luca Tarigo. Control of the sea between Italy and Libya was heavily disputed as both sides sought to safeguard their own convoys while interdicting those of their opponent. Axis convoys to North Africa supplied the German and Italian armies there, and British attacks were based on Malta, itself dependent upon convoys. The battle In mid-April, 1941, a five ship Axis convoy sailed from Naples, en route to Tripoli. It consisted of four German troopships (Adana, Arta, Aegina and Iserlohn) and an Italian ammunition ship (Sabaudia). The convoy was escorted by a Luca Tarigo (flagship) and two s, Baleno and Lampo, all under orders from Commander Pietro de Cristofaro. The convoy was delayed by bad weather, sailing in the evening of 13 April. The British had been alerted to the convoy's sailing by intercepted radio messages. On 15 April, a British Maryland reconnaissance plane sighted and shadowed the convoy. Two Italian SM.79s that were ordered to provide air cover did not arrive, due to the continuing bad weather. During the night of 15‚Äì16 April, the convoy was intercepted by the British 14th Destroyer Flotilla ( (flagship), , HMS Nubian, and , commanded by Captain Philip Mack). At least three of these destroyers were equipped with radar.D'Adamo, citing Derek Howse's Radar at Sea The encounter took place as the Italian convoy maneuvered around the shallow waters surrounding the Kerkennah Islands. By the use of the radar, the British force ambushed the Axis convoy in the dark. As the convoy passed a buoy marking sandbanks, the British opened fire at and closed to as near as . Three of the Axis transports were sunk, and the other two beached on the sandbar and became a total loss. Lampo was run aground and later salvaged, while Baleno sank in shallow waters. The flotilla commander, Commander de Cristofaro, on board Tarigo, had his leg shot off and later died of his wounds; he was posthumously awarded the Medaglia d'Oro (the highest Italian military decoration). While listing to port and sinking, Tarigo (now under the command of the only surviving officer, Ensign Ettore Bisagno) launched two torpedoes that hit HMS Mohawk; HMS Jervis subsequently scuttled Mohawk, which sank to the sandy bottom at a depth of . The outcome of the battle marked the end of the relatively unopposed Axis transport to Libya, which they had enjoyed since June 1940.Greene & Massignani, pp. 163-164 Aftermath The wreckage of HMS Mohawk as seen from an Italian reconnaissance aircraft (1941) The Italian maritime command in Libya immediately organised a rescue operation which involved the destroyers Malocello, Da Noli, Vivaldi, and , torpedo boats Centauro, Clio, Partenope, Perseus, and Sirtori, seaplane carrier Orlando, hospital ship Arno, and merchant ships Antonietta Lauro and Capacitas. A total of 1,271 survivors were recovered of about 3,000 men on board. Italian naval forces also found the wreckage of HMS Mohawk, settled on her port side in shallow water. During April, May, and June 1941, Italian divers, disguised as local fishermen, retrieved documents and other material from the wreck of Mohawk. In 1998, researchers asserted that documents recovered were essential to the later, successful Italian attack on Alexandria.Greene & Massignani, p. 164 The destroyer Lampo was salvaged from the shallow water after a four-month effort, and repaired by May 1942. She was sunk again on 30 April 1943. Adana sank several hours after the engagement, while the wreck of Arta was destroyed with explosive charges by the crew of the submarine HMS Upholder on the night of 26 April 1941. Axis casualties are variously reported as 350, 700, or 1,800 men; British losses were 43. Notes References * Green, J; Massignani, A.

Costello (born May 5, 1965 in Lynn, Massachusetts) is a former State Representative for the Massachusetts House of Representatives, who represented the first district of Essex County, Massachusetts. Costello graduated from Salem State University in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science, and from Suffolk University Law School with his Juris Doctor in 1996. Costello served in the House from 2003 to 2014. Education Costello has dedicated his career to public service. While he was a student at Salem State College (now Salem State University), Costello spent three years organizing and leading a program that resulted in student's building desperately needed housing for some of the poorest Americans living in Appalachia. He also spent a summer working as an intern in the United States Congress. Costello graduated cum laude from Salem State and went to work as a lay volunteer for the Catholic Diocese of St. Thomas. Later, he served as the Program Director for the Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Association of Boston. While attending Suffolk University Law School, Costello earned academic honors and worked for New Hampshire's Office of the Public Defender. Early career After earning his Juris Doctor degree in 1996, Costello worked for Essex County District Attorney Kevin M. Burke. As an Assistant District Attorney, Costello prosecuted hundreds of cases involving the possession and distribution of drugs, domestic violence, assault and battery and robbery. Costello was elected to the Newburyport City Council as a councilor-at-large in 1997 and, a year later, became field director for Congressman John F. Tierney's (D-Salem) campaign. Following Congressman Tierney's successful election, Costello worked as the chief of staff for State Senator Joan Menard (D-Somerset), former chair of the Massachusetts Democratic Party. State legislator Costello was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2002. He serves the First Essex District, which includes the cities of Newburyport and Amesbury and the town of Salisbury. During his first term, Costello served on the Joint Committees on Banks and Banking and Insurance. He appeared on the Pat Whitley Radio Show and on New England Cable News with Chet Curtis to discuss insurance issues and the Bank of America merger with Fleet Bank. He now serves as the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security and is a member of the Democratic leadership team in the House. In his role as Chairman, Costello has taken a leading role on many critical public safety issues. He was one of the lead sponsors of sweeping identity theft legislation designed to safeguard consumer's information and signed into law by Governor Deval Patrick last year. He is a member of the Governor's Anti-Crime Council, which discusses critical issues like gang violence and the spread of assault weapons. He served on the Governor's CORI Reform Commission, which helped author legislation that will provide meaningful opportunities for people seeking to transition back into society. In a similar capacity, he was just named the National Chair of American Bar Association's Re-entry and Collateral Consequences Committee. In 2007, the Massachusetts Bar Association named Costello its Legislator of the Year. Within his district, Costello has helped sustain many of the valuable organizations that provide critical social services in the region, including the Newburyport YWCA, the Pettengill House, the Boys and Girls Club of the Lower Merrimack Valley, the Newburyport Learning Enrichment Center and the Jeanne Geiger Crisis Center. He has also worked hard to preserve the natural environment and historic resources that make the 1st Essex District such a beautiful place to live. Costello is a member of the Board of directors for the Essex County Bar Association and is of Counsel to Andrews and Updergraph Law Firm of Salem. Costello announced his retirement effective September 15, 2014, to join a law firm. Family Costello is the son of former State Senator Nicholas Costello and Cynthia Costello. He is married to Kerrin D'Archangelo of Massachusetts, and they live in Newburyport with their daughter and son. External links *Official website of State Representative Michael A.

Geology Part of an eastward extension of the Hellam Hills, Chickies Ridge has been separated from them by a water gap cut by the Susquehanna. The ridge is composed of uplifted Cambrian Chickies Formation, which extends several miles east before merging into the surrounding uplands. Chickies Rock, at the west end overlooking the river, is the largest exposed anticline on the East Coast. According to the USGS, the summit of the ridge is 587 feet (179 m) above sea level. Chickies Creek runs along the north side of the ridge towards the western end, while Jones Run runs along the south side towards the western end. History Pennsylvania Canal and Columbia Branch PRR at the base of Chickies Rocks The name of the creek comes from the Lenape \\"Chiquesalunga\\", meaning \\"place of crayfish\\". Chickies Hill Road appears to have been the earliest road over the ridge, switchbacking across the middle and making a steep descent down the northern side on the way from Columbia to Marietta. During the Gettysburg Campaign of the American Civil War, Chickies Rock served as a Union army observation post during the Confederate occupation of Wrightsville across the river. The Columbia and Donegal Electric Railway built tracks up the side of the ridge from Columbia in 1893. The railway climbed for on a 6% grade, running on the west side of Chickies Hill Road and then curving sharply west to reach Chickies Park. This was an amusement park built by the trolley company on the west end of the ridge, atop Chickies Rock, overlooking the Susquehanna. The line to the park was opened on July 1, 1893. It was then extended down the north side of the ridge, running westward about , rounding a tight horsehoe curve and turning eastward, to cross Chickies Creek at the base of the ridge and run to Marietta. This extension was opened on December 31, 1893. The trolley line was abandoned on April 25, 1932. View of the cliffs at Chickies Rock, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Route 441 once followed Chickies Hill Road, but a later realignment brought it directly through the western part of Chickies Ridge in a deep cut, substantially reducing the climb. The Pennsylvania Canal, the Columbia Branch and then the Atglen and Susquehanna Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad all at different times squeezed between Chickies Rock and the river. All but the last are now abandoned. A variation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is told, with an Indian Maiden replacing Juliet and a white settler as Romeo. Eventually, the settler is killed in a war over the maiden, who throws herself off Chickies Rock. Trails and recreation Chickies Rock is a popular venue for rock climbing. The ridge to the west of Chickies Hill Road is part of Chickies Rock Park, owned by Lancaster County. The Chickies Rock Overlook Trail leads from parking along Route 441 to the top of Chickies Rock, roughly following the old trolley grade. The Clayton Shenk trail crosses Jones Run and climbs up the south side of the ridge east of Route 441, dropping down the north side to Chickies Hill Road.

The population in 2011 was 196 in 76 households (29 household spaces had no usual residents), over 79% of the population were able to speak Welsh. It has one of the smallest populations of any Welsh community, the smallest being Ganllwyd. It is in the electoral ward of Uwch Conwy. History Ysbyty Ifan, until about 1190, was known as D√¥l Gynwal (Welsh for Cynwal's Meadow). Then, it came to the attention of the Knights of St John, the Order of Hospitallers, who set up a hospital to care for pilgrims and also to be a hostel for them on their journeys (Ysbyty Ifan means hospital of St John). Ysbyty Ifan was on the ancient pilgrimage routes, for example, from Bangor Is Coed (Bangor-on-Dee) to Holyhead and Bardsey Island and the Cistercian Way between Aberconwy and Cymer. It is centrally located among a significant number of important pilgrimage destinations of the Middle Ages, see the map which shows only some of them. In the 15th century, the Red Bandits of Mawddwy used Ysbyty Ifan as a hideout, taking advantage of the Knights' privilege of sanctuary. The hospital was abolished in 1540 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries; the Church of St John is built on the site of the old hospital, and it contains a number of remnants that tell of the area‚Äôs history. Effigies in the church are said to depict Rhys Fawr ap Maredudd (fl. 1485-1510), a local nobleman who served Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth, his wife Lowri, and his son Robert, chaplain to Cardinal Wolsey. There is a bridge over the Afon Conwy in the centre of the village Notable associations *The poet William Cynwal was buried in Ysbyty Ifan in about 1588. He was a disciple of Gruffudd Hiraethog and took part in the second Caerwys eisteddfod in 1568. *Tomos Prys, sailor, buccaneer and poet, was buried in Ysbyty Ifan on 23 August 1634. *Abraham Lincoln's great, great grandfather, John Morris, lived in Bryn Gwyn, a farmhouse in Ysbyty Ifan which is now derelict. His daughter emigrated to Pennsylvania in the United States with a group of Quakers in the 17th century. *Si√¥n Dafydd Berson (c.1675-1769), poet, clog maker and lay reader, was buried in Ysbyty Ifan cemetery in 1769. Dafydd is mainly remembered as the person who taught Twm o'r Nant to read and write. The inscription on his grave, by Twm o'r Nant, says \\"Galar, i'r ddaear ddu - aeth athraw...\\" (Oh grief, into the black earth - goes the teacher...) *Gwallter Mechain, the Welsh bard, was made curate of Ysbyty Ifan in 1799. Today Ysbyty Ifan has a primary school with two classrooms and a cafeteria. The village also has a bakery shop, a post office, a milk shop and a rugby union pitch with a children's playground. The Ysbyty Ifan Estate is the largest single estate looked after by the National Trust. The area of the estate is over 8,000 hectares and includes moorland, river valleys and hill farms. The Migneint is an area of moorland and bog designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The Trust is responsible for a number of holiday cottages within the estate including Foel-Gopyn, which is off the grid. There are also a number of other places of interest near Ysbyty Ifan, so the area attracts a large number of visitors including walkers, especially during the summer months. Ysbyty Ifan is part of the Uwch Conwy ward for elections to Conwy County Borough Council.

DRFMs are typically used in radar jamming, although applications in cellular communications are becoming more common. Overview A DRFM system is designed to digitize an incoming RF input signal at a frequency and bandwidth necessary to adequately represent the signal, then reconstruct that RF signal when required. The most significant aspect of DRFM is that as a digital \\"duplicate\\" of the received signal, it is coherent with the source of the received signal. As opposed to analog 'memory loops', there is no signal degradation caused by continuously cycling the energy through a front-end amplifier which allows for greater range errors for reactive jamming and allows for predictive jamming. A DRFM may modify the signal prior to retransmitting which can alter the signature of the false target; adjusting its apparent radar cross section, range, velocity, and angle. DRFMs present a significant obstacle for radar sensors. The earliest reference to a digital means of storage of RF pulse signals is an article in the Jan/Feb 1975 issue of Electronic Warfare, a publication of the Association of Old Crows, written by Sheldon C. Spector, entitled \\"A Coherent Microwave Memory Using Digital Storage: The Loopless Memory Loop\\" An example of the application of DRFM in jammers: The DRFM digitizes the received signal and stores a coherent copy in digital memory. As needed, the signal is replicated and retransmitted. Being a coherent representation of the original signal, the transmitting radar will not be able to distinguish it from other legitimate signals it receives and processes as targets. As the signal is stored in memory, it can be used to create false range targets both behind (reactive jamming) and ahead of (predictive jamming) the target intended for protection. Slight variations in frequency can be made to create Doppler (velocity) errors in the victim receiver as well. DRFM can also be used to create distorted phase-fronts at the victim receive antenna which is essential for countering monopulse radar angular measurement techniques. Use in hardware in the loop simulation Since a DRFM system is designed to create a false target to a radar system, this technology can be employed to perform hardware in the loop simulation.JJ. Strydom and JE. Cillers, \\"Advances in the testing and evaluation of airborne radar through realtime simulation of synthetic clutter,\\" 48th Annual AOC International Symposium and Convention, Washington, DC, USA, 13‚Äì16 November 2011 JJ.

Olivier, \\"Advances in the realtime simulation of synthetic clutter for radar testing and evaluation,\\" 47th Annual AOC International Symposium and Convention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, 3‚Äì7 October 2010 Hardware-in-the-loop simulation is an aid to the development of new radar systems, which allows for testing and evaluation of the radar system earlier in the design cycle. This type of testing reduces the cost of development, for example, expensive initial flight trials for airborne radars can now be moved to the laboratory. The radar can be tested either through direct coupling, or through air coupling with antennas.

Biography After winning a nationwide talent contest at the age of four and starring in the motion picture Valley of the Sun Marches On, Barnum continued his acting career on TV in the Amos 'n Andy Shows, the Jack Benny Show, and others, making his first solo recording as Pee Wee Barnum in 1950. He then joined doo- wop groups the Dootones and, in late 1955, when Carl Gardner and bass Bobby Nunn left the Robins to form the Coasters for Atlantic, Barnum replaced Bobby Nunn as baritone and bass for the Robins, as well as playing piano for them. This version of the Robins recorded for the Whippet label, where Barnum soon became the A&R; man. In 1960, under the pseudonym \\"Dudley\\" he recorded the radio hit \\"El Pizza\\", a parody of Marty Robbins' \\"El Paso\\". In 1961 he had the only hit under his own name, the instrumental \\"Lost Love\\", and in the same year recorded the first version of \\"Nut Rocker\\", credited to Jack B. Nimble and the Quicks. He also recorded three albums as a singer-pianist during the 1960s. Since that time he became most widely known as an arranger, for a very wide range of performers including Lou Rawls, Count Basie, O.C. Smith, Frank Sinatra, the Supremes, Donna Loren, Aretha Franklin, Little Richard, Gladys Knight, Melinda Marx, Al Wilson, the Pump Girls, and the Little Tots. Barnum also produced, along with Johnnie Walls of JWP Productions which distributed the record, the 1985 hip-hop comedy song \\"Rappin' Duke\\". He also produced \\"The Fish Song\\", a rare song by the New Creation, released on Salaam Records. In addition, he co-wrote \\"Your Love\\", a 1977 Top 20 hit song by Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr. H.B. Barnum had an album recorded by the Novells, a Los Angeles area band, titled, That Did It! in 1968. The album re-emerged as an import some 40 years later when it was released in the United Kingdom in July 2005 and again in December 2007 by Radioactive Records. H. B.

A founding member of the Regulators during the Lincoln County War in New Mexico, Scurlock rode alongside such men as Billy the Kid. Early life He was born in Tallapoosa County, Alabama, January 11, 1849, the sixth of 11 children born to Priestly Norman Scurlock (July 3, 1806 - June 22, 1876) and Esther Ann Brown (May 19, 1819 - June 1, 1903). Josiah was said to have studied medicine in New Orleans, thus receiving his nickname \\"Doc\\". Described as tall, weighing , with brown eyes and dark blond hair, Doc went to Mexico in about 1870. While there, he and another man had an argument over a card game and drew their pistols. The other man shot first and the bullet went through Doc's mouth, knocking out his front teeth and coming out the back of his neck without any more serious damage. He quickly returned fire and killed the man who shot him. Cowboy Scurlock returned to the United States in 1871 and went to work as a line rider for John Chisum. He and other riders were also used to defend Chisum and his cattle holdings in the event cattle rustlers attempted to prey on them. Sometime during 1873, he and Jack Holt were surprised by a group of Indians and Holt was killed. Scurlock found refuge among some rocks and, after a protracted fight, he killed the Indian leader. During the night he slipped away and walked for help. At some time after the fight, Holt's body was presumably partially dismembered, as his right arm was removed at the elbow. In September 1875, Scurlock's riding partner, Newt Higgins, was killed by Indians. Scurlock was so upset over this incident he told Chisum he wanted to quit. Chisum, however, would not hear of it and refused to pay him. Scurlock then made the newspapers when he stole three horses, two saddles, and a rifle and left for Arizona. Chisum sent some of his men after Scurlock and they caught up with him, but when he explained that he took the things because Chisum would not pay him, they agreed with him and let him go. In Arizona, he met Charlie Bowdre and the two men opened a cheese factory on the Gila River. Some of Scurlock and Bowdre's descendants have said that one of their first employees was Billy the Kid. After they closed the cheese factory in the spring of 1876, Scurlock and his best friend, Bowdre, returned to Lincoln County, New Mexico, where they bought a ranch on public domain land on the Rio Ruidoso from L. G. Murphy on credit, which made them victims of the L. G. Murphy & Co. monopoly. Scurlock, Bowdre, Frank Coe, George Coe, and Ab Saunders stormed the very weak Lincoln jail on July 18, 1876, freeing cattle rustler Jesus Largo from the custody of Sheriff Saturnino Baca. They took Largo outside of town and hanged him. Scurlock accidentally shot and killed his friend, Mike G. Harkins, manager of John H. Riley's store at Blazer's Mill, while he was examining a pistol on September 2, 1876. On October 19, 1876, Scurlock and Mar√≠a Antonia Miguela Herrera (June 13, 1860 ‚Äì November 27, 1912) were married in Lincoln, New Mexico. (Around the same time, Antonia's sister, Manuela Herrera, married Charlie Bowdre, which made Bowdre a brother- in-law of Scurlock.) Ten children were eventually born of Scurlock and Antonia's union. Lincoln County War For over a year, Scurlock was in several posses to pursue and arrest horse thieves. He, Bowdre, and others lynched some of the thieves they caught. In January 1877, Scurlock and a neighbor, George Coe, were arrested by Sheriff William J. Brady for suspicion of harboring a murdering fugitive and member of the Jesse Evans Gang named Frank Freeman. For the next few days, Scurlock and Coe received very harsh treatment from Brady. They were allegedly tortured, but were eventually released. In October 1877, the Evans Gang stole horses belonging to John Tunstall, Alexander McSween, and Richard \\"Dick\\" Brewer from Brewer's Rio Ruidoso ranch. Scurlock and Bowdre, as well as Brewer, went off in pursuit of the Evans Gang and located them, but were unable to regain possession of the stolen horses.Joel Jacobsen, Such Men as Billy the Kid: The Lincoln County War Reconsidered, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, 1994, p.32 After Tunstall was murdered in February 1878, Scurlock became a founding member of the Regulators and was involved in most of the battles of the Lincoln County War. In the Gunfight of Blazer's Mills on April 4, Scurlock was shot in the leg by Buckshot Roberts. Scurlock later became the third and final leader of the Regulators, after prior leaders Dick Brewer and Frank McNab had been killed. Scurlock served as a deputy sheriff under Sheriff John Copeland, who was a McSween partisan and replaced Sheriff Brady. On May 14, 1878, he led a posse of 18 to 20 men, which included Billy the Kid, Bowdre, George Coe, Brown, and Scroggins, to the Dolan-Riley cattle ranch, ostensibly in search of those implicated in the killing of MacNab and the wounding of Saunders. According to Riley, they drove off 26 horses and two mules, killed a herder named Wair; a Navajo Indian employed at the ranch as a cook; and a 15-year-old boy called Johnny. However, W.T. Thornton, Thomas B. Catron's law partner, reported that the latter two were only wounded. Writer Robert M. Utley says that they captured a man named \\"Indian\\" Manuel Segovia, the likely shooter of McNab, but he was shot while allegedly trying to escape.Robert M. Utley, Billy the Kid: A Short and Violent Life, University of Nebraska Press, 1989, p.82. Since Catron had foreclosed on the property of J. J. Dolan & Co., the horses appear to have been his property. As a result of his strong protest to the governor, Copeland was removed as sheriff due to his refusing to side with the Murphy-Dolan faction. The raid by the Regulators resulted in the removal of one of their partisans from a position of authority and his replacement with George Peppin, who was just as strongly attached to the other side. When Billy attempted to make a deal with Governor Lew Wallace, Scurlock was captured and held in custody with him. He was held on suspicion of the murder of \\"Buckshot\\" Roberts. When Wallace's deal fell through, Billy and Scurlock were told they were going to be charged. Faced with extradition for a murder, on June 17, 1879, Billy and Scurlock rode out of Lincoln. Sheriff Kimball did nothing to stop them.Robert M. Utley, Billy the Kid: A Short and Violent Life, University of Nebraska Press, 1989, p.119-23. In August Billy and associates stole a large number of cattle from Chisum. After Chisum sent a posse after them, Scurlock decided to leave the gang.Jon Tuska, Billy the Kid: His Life and Legend, Greenwood Press, Westport, 1994, p.259 Later life In about October or November 1879, Scurlock moved to Texas, where he settled down and became a highly respected citizen. On the 1880 census in Potter County, Texas, he was keeping the mail station. Doc Scurlock died at age 80 from a heart attack in Eastland, Texas. He is interred in Eastland City Cemetery, along with his wife and other family members. Movie portrayals In the western film, Young Guns, Scurlock was portrayed by actor Kiefer Sutherland, as a polite, moral, poetry writing cowboy. At the end of the film, Scurlock left Billy the Kid's posse, fleeing from New Mexico with an Asian woman he fell for earlier in the movie in the hopes of starting a new life in the East. In the sequel, Young Guns II, Scurlock (again played by Sutherland) is serving as a school teacher in New York City when he is arrested and taken back to New Mexico, where he is saved from hanging by The Kid. He rejoins Billy's posse and is mortally wounded in an ambush led by John W. Poe, played by Viggo Mortensen, when he steps out of their hideout. Back inside, he staggers out again to be killed in a hail of bullets. This is based on the death of Charlie Bowdre in an ambush organized by Pat Garrett. In fact Scurlock was married to a Mexican woman in 1876 and died peacefully in Texas many years after the period of time covered by the movie. The original \\"Young Guns II\\" screenplay accurately portrays Scurlock as heading off to Texas with his bride. It has been reported that Kiefer Sutherland, faced with scheduling conflicts, refused to return to the Young Guns franchise unless his character died in the movie's \\"Stinking Springs Shoot Out\\". Writer John Fusco fought against this demand, but ultimately rewrote the scene to accommodate Sutherland's schedule.

It lies on the B4340 road northwest of the town of Tregaron, on the edge of the Cambrian Mountains.  History and amenities  Edward Richard's Schoolhouse Ystrad Meurig was the site of a Grammar School founded by Edward Richard (1714-1777) in about 1734 . It subsequently offered pupils a course which included significant elements of Classics and Divinity. The school was thereby enabled to provide a basic training for many Welsh language speakers who wished to enter the ordained ministry - being one of the few establishments licensed for the purpose by the Bishop of St. David's. Several former pupils were later to achieve considerable distinction within the Welsh church. This arrangement continued until the 1820s, when the existing school was finally superseded by a newly established college, which has since been transformed into the current University of Wales, Lampeter. The Grammar School at Ystrad Meurig later reverted to a more modest status as a school for the village and for the surrounding area, although it eventually adopted the name St. John's College, before finally closing in 1973. After lying almost derelict for some years, the building was more recently restored as a centre for the local community. It is a grade II* listed building. The village also contains the slight remains of what was thought to be a simple motte and bailey castle founded by Gilbert de Clare in the 12th century. Recent excavations by Lampeter University have shown that it was far more complex than this and it is now suggested that between the middle of the 6th century and the end of the 9th century this was once the site of the royal llys or hall complex of the Ceredigion kings and princes and that some of the earthworks at least are the remains of this. The llys was the centre of estates held by Welsh aristocrats of Trawsgoed both secular and ecclesiastical as they are identified in the Welsh laws and elsewhere. The grade II listed chapel of St. John the Baptist in its present form dates from 1897. From 1866 up to 1965, Ystrad Meurig was served by the Strata Florida Railway Station, on the Carmarthen to Aberystwyth line - which had originally been proposed as a part of the Manchester and Milford Railway. Samuel Lewis reported that the population of the village was 109 in 1833.

Futures under glass: a recipe for people who hate to predict Futures, vol. 22, issue 8, pp. 820‚Äì842. The fundamental question of backcasting asks: \\"if we want to attain a certain goal, what actions must be taken to get there?\\"Tinker, J. 1996. From 'Introduction' ix-xv. Life in 2030: Exploring a Sustainable Future for Canada, edited by J.B. Robinson et al. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press.Page 5. Environmental Change and Challenge : A Canadian Perspective by Philip Dearden, Bruce Mitchell. / 9780195410143 / 0-19-541014-9. Oxford University Press. While forecasting involves predicting the future based on current trend analysis, backcasting approaches the challenge of discussing the future from the opposite direction; it is \\"a method in which the future desired conditions are envisioned and steps are then defined to attain those conditions, rather than taking steps that are merely a continuation of present methods extrapolated into the future\\".Holmberg & Rob√®rt (2000), p.294. In statistics and data analysis, backcasting can be considered to be the opposite of forecasting; thus: * forecasting involves the prediction of the future (unknown) values of the dependent variables based on known values of the independent variable. * backcasting involves the prediction of the unknown values of the independent variables that might have existed, in order to explain the known values of the dependent variable.  Backcasting vs. Forecasting  Temporal representation of backcasting.Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.147. Backcasting, a term first coined by John B. Robinson in 1982,See Robinson (1982, 1988, 2003). involves establishing the description of a very definite and very specific future situation. It then involves an imaginary moving backwards in time, step-by- step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the future to the present to reveal the mechanism through which that particular specified future could be attained from the present.Robinson's backcasting approach is very similar to the anticipatory scenarios of Ducot and Lubben (1980), and Bunn and Salo (1993). Backcasting is not concerned with predicting the future: ::The major distinguishing characteristic of backcasting analyses is the concern, not with likely energy futures, but with how desirable futures can be attained. It is thus explicitly normative, involving \\"working backwards\\" from a particular future end-point to the present to determine what policy measures would be required to reach that future.Derborg (1996), p.814. According to Jansen (1994, p. 503): ::Within the framework of technological development, ‚Äúforecasting‚Äù concerns the extrapolation of developments towards the future and the exploration of achievements that can be realized through technology in the long term. Conversely, the reasoning behind ‚Äúbackcasting‚Äù is: on the basis of an interconnecting picture of demands technology must meet in the future ‚Äî ‚Äúsustainability criteria‚Äù ‚Äî to direct and determine the process that technology development must take and possibly also the pace at which this development process must take effect. ::Backcasting [is] both an important aid in determining the direction technology development must take and in specifying the targets to be set for this purpose. As such, backcasting is an ideal search toward determining the nature and scope of the technological challenge posed by sustainable development, and it can thus serve to direct the search process toward new ‚Äî sustainable ‚Äî technology. Practical applications Backcasting is increasingly used in urban planning and resource management of water and energy. It was used by Peter Gleick and colleagues at the Pacific Institute in a 1995 study on California water policy, as an alternative to traditional California water planning approaches.Gleick, P.H., P. Loh, S.V. Gomez, J. Morrison. 1995. California Water 2020: A Sustainable Vision. Pacific Institute, Oakland, California (May 1995) In 2006, the Capital Regional District Water Services, which services the greater Victoria area in British Columbia, Canada, committed to backcasting to the year 2050 as a formal element of all future strategic water planning initiatives.http://www.crd.bc.ca/minutes/wateradvisorycommitt_/2006_/dec12/dec12.pdf Backcasting is a key component of the soft energy path, a concept developed by Amory Lovins after the shock of the 1973 energy crisis in the United States.\\"Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken?\\" published in Foreign Affairs, in October 1976 Backcasting from Sustainability Principles, or System conditions of sustainability is a key concept of the 'Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development' pioneered by Karl-Henrik Rob√®rt, founder of The Natural Step, an international nonprofit organization dedicated to applied research for sustainability, in cooperation with a global academic Alliance for Strategic Sustainable Development which links universities which cooperate with businesses, and other NGOs. It has been refined and tested by peer-review and application within businesses (widely known examples are: Interface, Nike, Whistler). Backcasting is used in climate reconstruction or cosmology to determine the conditions (i.e., values of unknown independent variables) that existed in the distant past based on known (more accurately estimated) values of past dependent variables.

A use of force continuum is a standard that provides law enforcement officers and civilians with guidelines as to how much force may be used against a resisting subject in a given situation. In some ways, it is similar to the U.S. military's escalation of force (EOF). The purpose of these models is to clarify, both for law enforcement officers and civilians, the complex subject of use of force. They are often central parts of law enforcement agencies' use of force policies. Various criminal justice agencies have developed different models of the continuum, and there is no universal or standard model.Stetser, 2001, p. 36. Generally, each different agency will have their own use of force policy. Some agencies may separate some of the hand-to-hand based use of force. For example, take-downs and pressure point techniques may be one step before actual strikes and kicks. Also, for some agencies the use of aerosol pepper spray and electronic control devices (TASER) may fall into the same category as take-downs, or the actual strikes. The first examples of use of force continuum were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s.Stetser, 2001, pp. 36-37. Early models were depicted in various formats, including graphs, semicircular \\"gauges\\", and linear progressions. Most often the models are presented in \\"stair step\\" fashion, with each level of force matched by a corresponding level of subject resistance, although it is generally noted that an officer need not progress through each level before reaching the final level of force. These progressions rest on the premise that officers should escalate and de-escalate their level of force in response to the subject's actions.Stetser, 2001, p.38. Although the use of force continuum is used primarily as a training tool for law enforcement officers, it is also valuable with civilians, such as in criminal trials or hearings by police review boards. In particular, a graphical representation of a use of force continuum is useful to a jury when deciding whether an officer's use of force was reasonable.Grossi, 2um006. Example model While the specific progression of force varies considerably (especially the wide gap between empty hand control and deadly force) among different agencies and jurisdictions, one example of a general use of force continuum model cited in a U.S. government publication on use of force is shown below. # Officer presence ‚Äì the professionalism, uniform, and utility belt of the law enforcement officer and the marked vessel or vehicle the officer arrives in. The visual presence of authority is normally enough for a subject to comply with an officer's lawful demands. Depending on the totality of the circumstances, a call/situation may require additional officers or on scene officers may request assistance in order to gain better control of the situation and ensure a more safe environment for all involved. It also will depend on the circumstances of the situation. For example, depending on how many people are at the scene with the officer, a larger presence may be required. However, if 10 officers arrive at a scene with only a single suspect, the public may perceive the situation as an excessive use of officer presence within the use of force continuum. # Verbal commands/cooperative controls ‚Äì clear and understandable verbal direction by an officer aimed at the subject. In some cases, it is necessary for the officer to include a consequence to the verbal direction so that the subject understands what will happen if the subject refuses to comply with the officer‚Äôs direction. The verbal command and the consequence must be legal and not considered excessive according to the continuum. For example, an officer could not order a disabled person in a wheel chair to stand up or be sprayed by Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Pepper Spray. # Empty-hand submission techniques, PPCT ‚Äì Pressure Point Control Tactics, Control Tactics, techniques ‚Äì a level of force that has a low probability of causing soft connective tissue damage or bone fractures. This would include joint manipulation techniques, applying pressure to pressure points and normal application of hand-cuffs. # Hard control Techniques/Aggressive response techniques ‚Äì the amount of force that has a probability of causing soft connective tissue damage or bone fractures or irritation of the skin, eyes, and mucus membranes. This would include kicks, punches, stuns and use of aerosol sprays such as oleoresin capsicum (OC) pepper spray. Some models split these techniques between empty hand, soft control and intermediate weapon techniques but only include 5 levels of the continuum. # Intermediate weapons ‚Äì an amount of force that would have a high probability of causing soft connective tissue damage or bone fractures. (e.g. expandable baton, baton, pepper spray, Taser, beanbag rounds, rubber fin stabilized ammunition, Mace (spray), police dogs, etc.) Intermediate weapon techniques are designed to impact muscles, arms and legs, and intentionally using an intermediate weapon on the head, neck, groin, knee caps, or spine would be classified as deadly or lethal force. # Lethal force/Deadly force ‚Äì a force with a high probability of causing death or serious bodily injury. Serious bodily injury includes unconsciousness, protracted or obvious physical disfigurement, or protracted loss of or impairment to the function of a bodily member, organ, or the mental faculty. A firearm is the most widely recognized lethal or deadly force weapon, however, an automobile or weapon of opportunity could also be defined as a deadly force utility. The U.S. Navy teaches a six- step model: Officer presence, Verbal commands, Soft controls, Hard controls, Intermediate Weapons, and Lethal force. Hard controls includes the use of tools such as hand-cuffs, while soft controls equates to empty hand above, describing techniques where the officer may engage a resisting detainee. When escalating, voluntary submission to cuffs is a viable way to prevent the need for empty hand submission techniques which place the officer and the detainee at physical risk. When de-escalating, hard controls (i.e.: cuffs and isolation in the rear seat of a cruiser) gives officers a reasonable and achievable goal after altercation with a detainee during which higher levels of force may have been required.  Subject classifications  In all use of force continuum models, the actions of the subject is classified in order for the officer to quickly determine what level of force is authorized and may be necessary to apprehend or compel compliance from the individual. Listed below are examples of how subjects are classified. * Passive compliant ‚Äì a person who recognizes the authority of the officers presence and follows the verbal commands of the officer. * Passive resistor ‚Äì a person who refuses to follow the verbal commands of the officer but does not resist attempts by officers to take positive physical control over them. * Active resistor ‚Äì a person who does not follow verbal commands, resists attempts by the officer to take positive physical control over them, and does not try to inflict harm on the officer. * Active aggressor ‚Äì a person who does not follow verbal commands, resists attempts by the officer to take positive physical control over them and attempts to cause harm to the officer or others. Generally, the passive subjects and active resistors fall under levels 1‚Äì3 of the use of force continuum, while active aggressors fall under levels 4‚Äì6. The officers are trained to apply the proper measure of force within the continuum based on the actions and classification of the subject. Reasonableness standard The United States Supreme Court, in the case of Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, (1989), held that when engaged in situations where the use of force is necessary to effect an arrest, or to protect an officer's life or that of another, a law enforcement officer must act as other reasonable officers would have acted in a similar, tense, rapidly evolving situation. Such situations, once known as use of force incidents, are now commonly referred to as response to resistance incidents, because a law enforcement officer must respond to resistance offered by another. In order to determine what actions officers find reasonable in similar situations, some experts utilize surveys with law enforcement officers, who are provided with certain scenarios to determine what actions they would take if placed in certain situations. Knowing what other officers and citizens deem reasonable helps to craft a solid response to resistance continuum.

It is also known colloquially as iBosso. Founded in 1926 as Lions Football Club, composed mainly of boys born in Makokoba (Bulawayo's oldest township) by two of the Ndebele King Lobengula‚Äôs grandsons, Albert and Rhodes, who were sons of Njube. In 1936, the players changed the name to Matebeleland Highlanders Football Club. Nicknames Highlanders are known by their nicknames, Bosso, Tshilamoya, Amahlolanyama, Ezikamagebhula, High High, Mantengwane among many others. Bosso is derived from Setswana slang and means \\"The Boss. \\"Tshilamoya is IsiNdebele and, loosely interpreted, could mean \\"big-upsetters\\" or \\"demoralisers\\", a term coined in apparent reference to the Team's nemesis. Amahlolanya is taken from the Grey-Crested Helmet-shrike, a bird found mostly in Southern parts of Zimbabwe whose black and white colours resemble those of the team's. EzikaMagebhula, a nickname for Orlando Pirates, can also be used in reference to Highlanders FC, possibly because of the similarity of both clubs' colours. Club motto \\"Siyinqaba!\\" ‚Äì \\"We are a Fortress!\\" History 19th century- Colonialists decided to placate the Ndebele King Lobengula with a proposal to send his grandsons to study in the Cape Province in South Africa. The names of the two grandsons were Albert and Rhodes, sons of Njube. 1926 ‚Äì The two brothers returned from South Africa, where Albert had completed studies in agriculture at Tsolo Agricultural School and Rhodes completed studies in bookkeeping at Lovedale Institute. Both had taken to football as extramural activities. Rhodes continued playing soccer and formed a team called the Lions Football Club, composed mainly of boys born in Makokoba (Bulawayo's oldest township). 1936 ‚Äì the players changed the name to Matebeleland Highlanders Football Club. 1966 ‚Äì the Rhodesia National Football League (RNFL) asked Highlanders to join them. They agreed and two years later were drafted into the 2nd Division. Highlanders finished top on their first year and were promoted to Division One. 1970 ‚Äì the team was in the Super League, but after collecting just 7 points, they were relegated back to the first division but were back in the top flight again a year later in 1971. 1972 ‚Äì Tony McIlveen, a British export from Northern Ireland, joined the side. McIlveen had previous experience playing semi-professionally for Irish League side Crusaders, and whilst not known for his height, his tenacity as a midfield dynamo was an added bonus to the vastly improving side. 1973 ‚Äì Highlanders FC won the Chibuku Trophy, beating high-profile Mangula at Rufaro Stadium. Players who clinched the honours included Ananias Dube, Billy Sibanda, Kenny Ngulube, Edward Dzowa, Andrew Jele, Tommy Masuku, Lawrence Phiri, Josiah Nxumalo, Geoffrey Mpofu, Boet Van As, Tymon Mabaleka, Gavin Dubely, Bruce Grobbelaar, Barry Daka, Tony McIlveen, and others. 1976 ‚Äì Highlanders became dissatisfied with the national administration led by Mr. John Madzima, and pulled out of the RNFL to help form the South Zone Soccer League (SZSL). Some disgruntled senior members of the team broke away from Highlanders to form their own club, Olympics, even taking the black & white strip. But Highlanders survived. The teams that formed the nucleus of the SZSL were Black Chiefs, Callies, Portuguese, Old Miltonians, and Highlanders (all from Bulawayo), Black Horrors (Plumtree), Ramblers (Gwanda), and Go Beer Rovers (Gwelo). 1979 ‚Äì most Harare-based clubs saw the wisdom of Highlanders' decision and lent their support to the club against the national association's injustices, i.e. unfair gate takings distribution, improper methods of accounting of finances, and preferential treatment of certain teams. The National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) was then formed as a result. 1980 ‚Äì NPSL and the RNFL were merged to form the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA). 1986 ‚Äì a group of senior players left after falling out with the executives over money. Apprentices were upgraded to the senior team. Players who included the likes of Rahman Gumbo, Mercedes Sibanda, Willard \\"Nduuuna\\" Mashinkila-Khumalo, Madinda Ndlovu, Dumisani Ngulube and many others. Between 1999 and 2002 Highlanders won the Premier League four seasons back to back. In 1999 and 2000 they were coached by Rahman Gumbo. Gumbo was sacked for failure to reach the African champions league‚Äôs money spinning mini league. In 2001 a Briton Eddie May was handed over the job to Coach Bosso as they are affectionately known by their fans and he went on to win two Premier league titles back to back.

In Zimbabwe, players from Highlanders who have played at the highest level of professional football in the world include players like Peter Ndlovu, Bruce Grobelaar, and Benjamin Nkonjera. Highlanders is the second-most supported club in Zimbabwe with over 5 million supporters, after Dynamos who have over 7 million supporters. The support for these two clubs has tribal origins, as Highlanders are supported by both Ndebele-speaking people and those residing in the Matebeleland region. Rivalry Highlanders most bitter rival is Dynamos from Harare and the matches between these two giants have been dubbed \\"Battle of Zimbabwe\\". The battles between Bosso and Dembare are similar to those ones between the two Soweto Giants Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs in South Africa in the Soweto derby. CAPS United is also another Bosso's rival and the matches pitting these two teams have been dubbed \\"Battle of the Cities\\". These matches were in the past associated with a lot of violent clashes amongst the fans.

Adapted from the 1927 novel of the same name by Owen Johnson, and written by Louis D. Lighton, Hope Loring, Alfred Hustwick, and Adela Rogers St. Johns, the film is about a young flapper who tricks her wealthy friend into marrying her during a night of drunken revelry. Even though she knows that he is in love with another woman, she refuses to grant him a divorce and repeat the mistake of her divorced parents. Produced by Jesse L. Lasky, E. Lloyd Sheldon, and Adolph Zukor for the Famous Players-Lasky, the film was released on April 25, 1927 by Paramount Pictures. Plot Jean Waddington (Esther Ralston) and Ted Larrabee (Gary Cooper) grew up together in an affluent society, the children of divorced parents. Most of their friends have cynical attitudes towards love and marriage, but Jean and Ted are more serious. In fact, Jean has fallen in love with Ted, who one day proposes marriage. Knowing, however, that Ted's father was unfaithful to his wife and irresponsible, Jean demands that he prove himself before she accepts his proposal. Soon Ted starts a business and opens up an office in the building where their mutual friend Kitty Flanders (Clara Bow) works. Kitty is also a child of divorce. One evening, Kitty throws a wild party at work, and Ted takes part in the revelry. At the party, Kitty meets Prince Ludovico de Saxe (Einar Hanson) and is immediately attracted to him. The prince returns her affection, but the prince's guardian Duke Henri de Goncourt (Norman Trevor) prevents them from seeing each other because she is not of their social class. Raised by a mother who insisted that she marry a wealthy man, Kitty soon sets her sights on Ted‚Äîeven though she knows that Ted and her close friend Jean love each other. One evening, after going on a drunken spree, Kitty tricks Ted into marrying her, even though she does not love him. Desperately unhappy, Ted assures Jean that he will seek a divorce as soon as possible. Not wanting him to repeat the mistakes of their parents, Jean refuses to marry him if he divorces, and sails off for Europe. The arrival of their baby does little for their marriage, and Ted avoids spending any time with his unwanted wife.

History London Underground's associations with visual art began in 1908 when its then Publicity Officer Frank Pick began commissioning leading artists to work on poster campaigns for the rapidly expanding network. The company's distinctive corporate image, including official Underground roundel and iconic tube map designed by Harry Beck are also considered major contributions to visual art, and several of the network's stations have been decorated with artistic tiling or murals depicting local historical or traditional themes. Launched in 2000, previously known as Platform for Art, London Underground's art programme aimed to continue the company's association with the arts and \\"create an environment for positive impact and to enhance and enrich the journeys of the passengers that are its audience\\". Platform for Art was rebranded as Art on the Underground in 2007. The programme Posters, billboards and exhibition spaces are provided by London Underground for young and aspiring artists in various media. Most notably, at Gloucester Road station an entire disused platform is the backdrop for a rolling programme of four exhibitions a year featuring murals or sculptures with eye- catching lighting. The ticket hall and exit area at Piccadilly Circus station is also a venue for Platform for Art displays. In addition, some stations' walls are decorated in tile motifs unique to that station, such as profiles of Sherlock Holmes's head at Baker Street, and a cross containing a crown at King's Cross St Pancras. Oval has cricket-themed decorations, with murals, statues and banners all celebrating the illustrious game. Unique Edwardian tile patterns, designed by Leslie Green and installed in the 1900s, were also used on the platforms of many of the Yerkes-funded stations on the Bakerloo, Northern and Piccadilly lines. Many of these tile patterns survive to this day, though a significant number of these are now replicas. As part of the commemoration of Arsenal's stadium move, a temporary mural was placed along the walls of Arsenal station passageways as part of London Underground's Platform For Art scheme. It was unveiled in February and removed in September 2006. Go to the Gallery, an additional collaborative initiative with over 20 of London's art galleries, saw a series of posters featuring various artworks produced for display in unusual sites all over the network including in South Kensington's museum subway, and at Charing Cross and Earl's Court tube stations among others. Many other stations on London Underground host temporary exhibitions, with past locations having included Canary Wharf, Piccadilly Circus, Charing Cross, Southwark and Westminster stations.

It offers intermediate level high school courses (grades 11 and 12) through the GCE Advanced Level and 10+2 programs, as well as Bachelor's and master's degrees in natural science, business, social science, and humanities. Widely considered to be one of the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in Nepal, St. Xavier's College accepted 504 students from 13,000 students for its +2 program in 2016, resulting in an acceptance rate of 3.8%. History Jesuits began their educational work in Nepal in 1951. St. Xavier's College functioned as an evening Intermediate Science class from the premises of St. Xavier's School, Jawalakhel in the initial years, and later moved to its own building at Maitighar, Kathmandu, in 1993. For the first eight years, the only course offered was Intermediate in Science, in affiliation with Tribhuvan University. In 1996 the three-year Bachelor of Science in Social Work, the first of its kind in Nepal, was established in conjunction with Kathmandu University. In 1997 a B.Sc. in Environmental Science was offered but after three years discontinued admitting students. Since then bachelor's degrees have been added in Business Studies and Physics in 2002, in Information Management in 2003, and in 2007 in Computer Science and Information Technology, Microbiology, and B.A. in English, Journalism and Social Work. In 2007 also five master's degree programs were established, in Physics, Microbiology, Business, Social Work, and English. 10+2 was initiated in 2009 and GCE Advanced Level was initiated in 2011. The College moved to Maitighar Heights in 1988 and the first new building, the Academic Block, was built in 1993. The construction of the Administration Block was completed in 1998, followed by that of Watrin Hall and the Library Block in 2000. To cater to the needs of the two IT-based degree programs, and to provide all students with computer facilities, four computer laboratories were constructed, with a total of 203 internet-connected computers. The E.L. Watrin Memorial Building was built in 2005, linking the Academic Block with the Administration Block. A rooftop cafeteria was built in 2006. In 2009 a six-storey building housing modern laboratories for physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and microbiology and social studies. There is also a sports hall that doubles as an auditorium. The College celebrated its silver jubilee in 2013. Today, the College has approximately 3,000 students coming from 275 schools representing all 75 districts and almost all the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity of Nepal. One of the innovative outreach programs is the Partnership in Education (PIE) established in 2004. PIE works in partnership with government schools for the development of the academically weak students in the lowest income brackets, accommodating approximately 300 students annually. Admission Admission to St. Xavier's College is extremely competitive, especially in the 10+2 program. Each year more than 13,000 students from all across Nepal apply and 504 students are enrolled for the +2 program (entailing an average acceptance rate of 3.8%). The admissions process includes a preliminary cutoff score at the SEE, an analytic multiple choice examination, and an interview with college personnel. Other departments of the College have a similar admission procedure. Academic programs right  Intermediate Level Courses  Plus Two (+2) In 2009, Higher Secondary Level (+2) science stream was initiated in affiliation with the Higher Secondary Education Board, NEB (National Examination Board), Nepal. This level of education is the main reason for this college to acclaim its reputation in the country. The college has completed its sixth year of the +2 program. The Higher Secondary Level (+2) science program has offered only two sub-streams: Biology and Physics. Subjects offered for the Biology sub-stream are Biology, Chemistry, English, Extra Math, Mathematics, Nepali and Physics. Meanwhile, Biology, Chemistry, English, Mathematics, Nepali and Physics are offered for the Physics sub- stream. This is the only college in Nepal who let even the students of +2 to attend college in casual wear.  GCE Advanced Level  The GCE Advanced Level program started at St. Xavier's College from 2011 A.D. which is affiliated with Cambridge International Examinations. In 2017, it became an Independent Center (i.e. a Cambridge International School). The offered courses are Accounting, Biology, Business, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, English General Paper, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology and Sociology. The college has a Society established by the students named St. Xavier's A-Level Society (SAS) which mobilizes the students for independent course work and a collaborative teamwork in addition to leadership.

The Dovers were an example of mid-1960s folk rock, psychedelic rock and pop, heavily influenced by the British Invasion and American groups such as The Byrds. Career The Dovers were from Santa Barbara, California, and started their band under the name The Vandells. They began their recording career as The Dovers in 1965 with the Miramar Records release \\"She's Gone\\"/\\"What Am I Going To Do?,\\" which reportedly was a minor hit in the Santa Barbara‚ÄìVentura County area. Three singles followed in late 1965 and early 1966, showing The Dovers' interest in folk and pop; none of their four singles met with national success, and The Dovers broke up shortly afterward.

It began broadcasting at 18:55 on 10 October 2006, from its studio at 18 Doughty Street in the Bloomsbury area of London, and ceased broadcasting at 23:00 on Thursday 8 November 2007. It claimed to be Britain's first Internet-based TV station.  Birth and Early Beginnings  Doughty Media Limited was funded by Stephan Shakespeare and its core presenters at launch included Iain Dale, Tim Montgomerie, Rena Valeh, Zoe Phillips and Donal Blaney. Alex Story, a director of the company at the time of the launch, was the creator of 18 Doughty Street. He wrote the concept on which the station was based, built the studio, and initially organised the production of the channel. Story developed the idea of creating a news platform that would challenge the dominance of terrestrial TV stations over the course of 2005 when he stood for parliament in Denton & Reddish. Over the course of the campaign, he noticed the wide cultural chasm between mainstream news channels and the people. He took his idea of an on-line TV station to Stephan Shakespeare during the first half of 2006. The station used live video streaming technology in a Windows format to webcast from 19:00 until midnight from Monday to Friday, with all programmes being made available to stream again shortly after the programme had aired. Due to the technology of the time, viewers could not download archived videos to their computer or portable device directly from the site, although a video podcast service of all archive videos was offered shortly before the station ceased broadcasting. Although it called itself a \\"TV station\\", legally it was not, so did not operate under the Ofcom Broadcasting Code, which requires \\"due impartiality\\" and prevents politicians being newsreaders, interviewers or reporters in any news programme. At the point of launch, there were four directors of the company, Alex Story, Iain Dale, Tim Montgomerie and Stephan Shakespeare, all Conservative Party members and self-described conservatives, but did not represent the Conservative Party in an official capacity on the station. In late 2006 Story left as a director of the company, followed by the resignations of Tim Montgomerie around March 2007 and of Donal Blaney in October 2007, followed by Iain Dale later in around December 2007.http://iaindale.blogspot.com/2007/12/moving-on.html The latter three were said to be leaving to focus on other projects. For Story, the aim of the channel was to provide an intellectual and cultural platform to take-on the political orthodoxy of the time; for other directors, the channel was to be narrowly focused on the politics of Westminster. Tim Montgomerie suddenly left 18 Doughty Street around March 2007 to work on other products and was replaced by Shane Greer, who became a full-time presenter at the station whilst also acting as Executive Director for Young Britons' Foundation. The station also hosted programmes produced and presented by Alan Mendoza, Peter Tatchell, Christian Wolmar, Christine Constable and Claire Fox. On 22 January 2007 a redesign of the website was launched to promote additional services that 18 Doughty Street wanted to produce: written news and opinion, news links, and what was billed as a series of controversial \\"attack\\" adverts that were to be released on a weekly basis. However, only four were ever produced and their cost rumoured to be disproportionate to success. The total makeover was also supposed to realise the citizen journalism element of 18 Doughty Street and allowed contributors to submit videos for inclusion in the website publications and live productions. However, this project had no success. Against the professional advice of Story, Tim Montgomorie bought 100 Sanyo C5 digital camcorders, but only a handful of videos were received among reports of technical difficulties with the externally developed platform and a lack of editing skills.  Collapse & Shutdown  18 Doughty Street stopped broadcasting on 19 November 2007 claiming that it was being taken off-air to make a range of improvements. Around the same time Donal Blaney and Iain Dale also decided to move on from the station leaving Stephan Shakespeare as the sole remaining director of the company. With the core team collapsed, including the resignations or sackings of production and back office staff, and rumours of a lack of interest from potential investors the project finally collapsed completely when the main investor, Stephan Shakespeare, decided to instead start PoliticsHome in the same building in partnership with Freddie Sayers and also led by the return of some staff, including former Director Tim Montgomerie, who had previously resigned from 18 Doughty Street when it was a TV station following what is now revealed as a senior-level split over the direction of the TV station earlier in 2007. Other websites 18 Doughty Street displayed its brand on a website called The Fisk that featured a variety of contributors critiquing left-leaning commentary and opinion pieces. Following the resignation of Tim Montgomerie from 18 Doughty Street, the website has been re-branded under Conservative Home as part of Stephan Shakespeare's efforts to move the TV station away from the right-wing area of politics. 18 Doughty Street also launched conservative websites CentreRight.com and BritainAndAmerica.com in early 2007, prior to Montgomerie's departure. CentreRight.com still carries 18 Doughty Street branding, whereas BritainAndAmerica has been rebranded under Conservative Home. Although it was already operational, CentreRight.com launched again in January 2008.

Design and development  M-4 Tarpan The M-4 was designed for a demand of the Polish Aero Club, for a trainer plane with a retractable tricycle landing gear. It was based on an earlier project PZL M-2. The basic variant was to be M-4P, for navigation training. The works started in 1958, and the first prototype was built in 1960. Due to a long engine development, it first flew on September 7, 1961 (registration SP-PAW). Trials showed, that the weight was much higher, than estimated (890 kg instead of 748 kg), which demanded changes in design. In July 1964 the second prototype was flown (registration SP-PAK). Flight characteristics and stability of the M-4 were estimated as good, it also fit to aerobatics and rally flying. The cab offered an excellent view for the crew and the plane was overall quite successful. However, because of too high price, the Polish Aero Club decided not to order the plane and the production has not started. A development of the flat engine PZL WN-6 was troublesome and was finally canceled at that time as well.  Description  Metal construction low-wing monoplane, conventional in layout, metal covered. Semi- monocoque fuselage. Trapezoid two-spar wings. Crew of two, sitting in tandem, under a common canopy, with double controls (student in front, instructor in the rear). Retractable tricycle landing gear. Two-blade wooden propeller of variable pitch (diameter 2 m). Fuel tanks in wings (140 l).  Operational history  In 1965 both prototypes were converted to single seater aerobatics variant (in some sources known as the M-4A) by removing front cab equipment. It was planned to use them in World Aerobatics Championship in 1966 in Moscow, but they have not finished full homologation trials and the idea was abandoned. They were not used in this role much.

An English edition was published, under the original German title, between 1957 and 1968 by the Theodore Presser Company (Bryn Mawr) in association with Universal Edition (London) (). A related book series titled B√ºcher der Reihe was begun, but only one title ever appeared in it, Herbert Eimert's Grundlagen der musikalischen Reihentechnik . Origin The journal, whose title means \\"The Row\\" or \\"The Series\\", owes its genesis to the founding of the electronic music studio of the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR) in Cologne (later WDR) under the influence of Werner Meyer-Eppler, and the realisation that technology was becoming an important element in the work of younger composers . The contributions from composers working in the studio were frequently based on their projects there, and in the early stages of competing with the radio-play department for resources, Eimert found having such a journal useful. It helped to raise the studio's educational and academic profile above the entertainment aims of other departments of the radio station, as well as providing opportunities to young authors for publication . Character and history The subtitle of the original edition, \\"Information √ºber serielle Musik\\" (\\"information on serial music\\") reflected the intent of the editors, but was changed for the English edition to \\"A Periodical Devoted to Developments in Contemporary Music\\", a phrase that did not effectively represent the journal's specific context and may have been one reason for an unfavourable reaction from American composers and critics . There were just eight volumes published, each under a thematic title. Further issues had been planned, but publication was broken off when deteriorating relations between the two editors reached the point of open rupture. In 1958, a competing journal, the Darmst√§dter Beitr√§ge zur Neuen Musik, was launched by Wolfgang Steinecke, director of the Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse. When Stockhausen agreed to let Steinecke co-publish an article that Eimert had expected exclusively for Die Reihe , Eimert felt he was being disloyal. When other young composers began following Stockhausen's lead, and Stockhausen himself authorised a short version of another article originally published in Die Reihe , it put increasing pressure on Eimert, who was threatened with a cut in funding by Alfred Schlee of Universal Edition . On the other side, on 24 May 1961 Eimert published in the K√∂lnischer Rundschau a glowing review of Hans Werner Henze's opera Elegy for Young Lovers. Since Henze's style was comparatively old-fashioned, Stockhausen regarded this as a betrayal of the principles of serial music underlying Die Reihe, and vehemently broke with Eimert over it . English edition Differences between the German and English editions can be seen from a comparison of their respective tables of contents. Occasionally items were omitted or substituted, but more commonly these involve the order of the articles. In some cases, however, these resulted in a different tone or emphasis, contributing to the problematic reception of Die Reihe in America . For example, the foreword to the first volume (1955) of the German edition declared it to be the mouthpiece for the younger generation, but this foreword was omitted in the 1957 English edition . In addition, the quality of the translations vary considerably. The first volume of the English edition, in particular, \\"is often content to avoid, rather than understand, the more complex formulations and metaphors in the text\\" . Subject matter Each of the eight issues of Die Reihe was dedicated to a different theme, announced in a subtitle: # (1955) \\"Elektronische Musik\\" / (1957) \\"Electronic Music\\" # (1955) \\"Anton Webern\\" / (1958) \\"Anton Webern\\" # (1957) \\"Musikalisches Handwerk\\" / (1959) \\"Musical Craftsmanship\\" # (1958) \\"Junge Komponisten\\" / (1960) \\"Young Composers\\" # (1957) \\"Berichte‚ÄîAnalyse\\" / (1961) \\"Reports‚ÄîAnalyses\\" # (1958) \\"Sprache und Musik\\" / (1964) \\"Speech and Music\\" # (1960) \\"Form‚ÄîRaum\\" / (1964) \\"Form‚ÄîSpace\\" # (1962) \\"R√ºckblicke\\" / (1968) \\"Retrospective\\" Reception Die Reihe became the most important source of information about European serial and electronic music, thanks in part to the appearance of the English edition . Die Reihe excited considerable controversy, especially after the English editions began appearing in 1957. George and John wrote particularly scornful reviews (, points out an example of wilful misquotation in Backus's review), but even in his relatively factual report on the first volume, Arthur Jacobs could not resist making a joke with reference to the contentiousness surrounding the journal, in connection with a suggestion that the title should also have been translated: \\"if 'The Row' is open to mispronunciation, 'the Series' would have done\\" . Dika Newlin, reporting on volume five, concludes (apparently with reference to the item in it by John Cage) by saying \\"Many readers will be disquieted by the periodical's continuing mixture of worthwhile investigation with pretentious phoniness\\" . John Backus especially singled out articles by , , Henri , and Paul Gredinger 1955 in his review of the first four volumes, where he described the extensive use of scientific methodology as inaccurate and pseudo-scientific; the use of jargon disregarded the meanings of scientific terms and made the articles unintelligible; and all the contents lacked any reference to the results of other workers as support for their statements. Werner Meyer-Eppler's article in volume 1 is singled out as the sole exception: \\"an interesting account of some experimental results in psycho- acoustics, [which] is adequately supplied with references, and is a model of lucidity\\" . Backus makes it clear that his concern is exclusively with the use or misuse of scientific terminology: \\"We shall not concern ourselves with their musical content\\" . One of the most severe critiques was published in the last issue of Die Reihe itself. This was by the Dutch physicist Adriaan Fokker, and was directed primarily at Stockhausen's article \\"‚Ä¶ wie die Zeit vergeht ‚Ä¶\\" (; ). A response defending Stockhausen was published by his colleague, the composer Gottfried Michael Koenig, in the same issue .

Young and Barnes had been performing together since 1971 in the band John Stabber, and formed Do You Want This Table (later shortened to The Table) in 1972. However, they did not own any musical instruments, refused to tour, and stated that they were not a \\"real\\" band and had no future in the music industry. Despite this, they were signed to Virgin Records and released \\"Do The Standing Still (Classics Illustrated)\\", first recorded as a demo in 1975. The single was an NME 'Single Of The Week', rapidly becoming a cult favourite, and subsequently appearing on several punk compilation albums. Record label pressure saw them reluctantly become a well-received live act. Their uncompromising stance led to disagreements with Virgin, however, and they left, signing to Chiswick Records in 1978 and releasing a second single, \\"Sex Cells\\". The band ceased to exist after several line-up changes and a policy of playing increasingly uncommercial and distasteful material. Young's later band, Flying Colours, released a single, \\"Abstract Art\\", on the No Records label in 1981. Cardiff band Boy Azooga recorded a cover version of Do The Standing Still in 2018.

Jacob Bailey, Annapolis, Nova Scotia Jacob Bailey (16 April 1731 - 26 July 1808) was an author and clergyman of the Church of England, active in New England and Nova Scotia. Biography Bailey was born in Rowley, Massachusetts, and was educated at Harvard College, ranked at the bottom (by social order) of the class of 1755, which notably also included John Adams. He started his career in the ministry as a Congregational preacher in New Hampshire but converted and became an Anglican clergyman in 1760, through his connection with Dr. Silvester Gardiner, a prominent Massachusetts physician, businessman, and landowner. Gardiner, also Anglican, sought a minister to serve the rural parish of Frankfort or Pownalborough (now Dresden, Maine, but then part of Massachusetts), which was part of the lands his business partnership, the Kennebec Proprietors, oversaw. Bailey's congregation was a mix of mainly German Lutheran and French Huguenot immigrants, who were often at odds on matters of religion with the area's Yankee Congregationalists. Despite continuing friction with the local Congregationalists, Bailey was able to build a church and parsonage in 1770-71. Hostilities towards Bailey continued, especially when he continued to profess Loyalty to the British Crown, and he moved with his family to Nova Scotia in 1779, after American Patriots twice made attempts on his life. He served in the parish of Cornwallis for a period and then moved to Annapolis Royal where he remained for the rest of his life. In 1780, Rev. Bailey was appointed the Deputy Chaplain to the 84th Regiment.p. 177  Poet  It is through his writings that Bailey's place in Canadian history was assured. His poetry was widely known and his verse satire was considered to be styled like that of the English poet, Samuel Butler. He wrote a considerable amount of prose as well and much of this can contribute to historians' studies of those times. \\"Behold the vaunting hero,\\" Royal Gazette and the Nova-Scotia Advertiser (Halifax), 11 Dec. 1798, and \\"Observations and conjectures on the antiquities of America,\\" Mass.

It stars Bruce Li as \\"Bob\\" Lee, whose life is essentially the same as Lee's and is on two occasions actually referred to as 'Bruce'. The film has been released under the alternate two film titles they were: The Story of the Dragon and Bruce Lee: Master of Jeet Kune Do. This film is not to be confused with another Bruce Lee biopic, Bruce Lee: A Dragon Story. Synopsis In San Francisco, Bruce \\"Bob\\" Lee (Bruce Li) works in a Chinese food restaurant with his wacky friend Chang Ming. When a gang of hoodlums is making trouble, Bob puts a lot of pepper on their chicken, making them sneeze a lot (and inspiring the immortal line, \\"This is pepper chicken. Good for gut's ache!\\"). Unfortunately, Bob and Chang are blacklisted from the bustling San Francisco Chinese restaurant community by the gang. They accidentally land a job at a shipyard after narrowly averting being run over by the owner's daughter's car. She tells them to get back to work, assuming they already work there unloading speaker cabinet boxes. The shipyard is attacked by members of the boxing gang that Bob beat up in the beginning of the film. At first, Bob and Chang refuse to fight to prevent losing their jobs again. However, they are called chickens by the shipyard owners, and after finally beating up some bad guys, people realize what an amazing martial artist Bob is, and encourage him to start his own kung fu school. Bob's school opens to boffo business, but there is controversy among the powerful rival kung fu schools because Bob is teaching to non- Asians. He also creates Jeet Kune Do, and uses his newly improves martial arts ability to whup the baddies once and for all. Production Filming started in late 1975 and finished early 1976. The film was made in Taipei and nearby areas. The restaurant scene at the start is in Bo-Ai street, Taipei. The bungalows are in a former US military housing complex near Taipei. The docks scenes are at Keelung. Some scenes were shot in the suburb of Beitou. Reaction The film was poorly received by critics. Despite the negative reaction to this film, actor Hwang Jang Lee would later achieve stardom after appearing as the bad guy in Jackie Chan's breakout films, Snake in the Eagle's Shadow and Drunken Master.

He was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1794 and came to Lower Canada with his family in 1801, after having been captured by a French frigate in 1797 when they first left for North America. He began work as a clerk with a group of Montreal merchants but joined the Canadian Light Dragoons during the War of 1812, becoming lieutenant in 1813. He was taken prisoner later that year and released the following year. In 1817, he began work with the Bank of Montreal, becoming cashier (manager) by 1827. He served as lieutenant-colonel in the local militia during the Lower Canada Rebellion. In 1841, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada as one of two members for the city of Montreal. He was also elected to the city council in 1842. He retired from the assembly in 1844 and returned to work at the bank until 1846. In 1848, he was elected again in the city of Montreal. Holmes was a supporter of the annexation movement, signing the Montreal Annexation Manifesto. He was elected to city council again in 1850. He was a vice- president of the St Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad and became vice-president of the Grand Trunk Railway when the two were amalgamated in 1853. In the same year, he became a director of the Bank of Montreal. Holmes was named receiver of customs at Montreal in 1863 and died there in 1865.

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 221 (US 221) in Hillsville north to SR 61 in Narrows. SR 100 is one of the major highways of the New River Valley, connecting Narrows and Pearisburg in Giles County with Dublin, Pulaski (via US 11), and Interstate 81 (I-81) in Pulaski County. Route description View north along SR 100 just south of Dublin SR 100 begins at an intersection with US 221 (Floyd Pike) at the eastern edge of the town of Hillsville. The state highway heads north as two-lane Sylvatus Smith Highway through northeastern Carroll County. SR 100 passes through the hamlet of Sylvatus before entering Wythe County and crossing Little Reed Island Creek. The state highway, whose name is now Wysor Highway, crosses the New River at Barren Springs then enters Pulaski County. SR 100 continues north to its cloverleaf interchange with I-81 south of Draper Mountain. The roadway continues north as US 11 (Lee Highway) across the mountain to Pulaski; US 11 also heads south along I-81 toward Wytheville. SR 100 joins I-81 as the Interstate heads northeast toward Roanoke. The two highways are paralleled by frontage roads as they pass through a diamond interchange with SR 658 (Greenbriar Road) at Draper and a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 99 (Count Pulaski Drive) at McAdam. The old alignment of SR 100, now designated SR F-047 (Kirby Road), continues to parallel the Interstate as the highways cross Peak Creek. Near the community of Newbern, I-81 and SR 100 diverge at a diamond interchange that serves as the eastern terminus of SR F-047. SR 100 heads north as Cleburn Boulevard, a four-lane divided highway that passes by the industrial area of Burlington Mills before passing under a rail spur that serves the Radford Army Ammunition Plant to the east. Just north of the rail spur, the state highway enters the town of Dublin, where it crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway's Pulaski District rail line immediately before a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 11 (Lee Highway) adjacent to the main campus of New River Community College. SR 100 passes New River Valley Airport before crossing Little Walker Mountain. The northbound direction of the highway has a runaway truck ramp on the descent to Little Walker Creek, which the highway crosses while reducing to a two-lane road just before entering Giles County at the south end of Little Walker Creek's gorge through Walker Mountain. SR 100 continues north as Pulaski-Giles Turnpike, which crosses Walker Creek at its confluence with Little Walker Creek and intersects SR 42 (Blue Grass Trail) at Poplar Hill. The state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway again at Staffordsville, north of which the highway leaves the vicinity of Walker Creek. The two directions of SR 100 follow different alignments--northbound straight and southbound curvy--south of Pearisburg. The state highway enters the town of Pearisburg on Main Street, which reduces to an undivided highway and then two lanes. In the center of town, SR 100 intersects US 460 Business (Wenonah Avenue) and runs concurrently with the U.S. Highway on Main Street through downtown. At the north end of downtown, SR 100 veers northwest on Main Street, which is again four lanes, while US 460 Business heads north to its terminus at US 460. At the west end of town, SR 100 veers west onto two-lane Narrows Road, which parallels the south side of the New River and Norfolk Southern's East River District rail line to the town of Narrows. The state highway enters town as Main Street and reaches its northern terminus at SR 61 (Monroe Street).

The organization that creates value primarily by enabling direct interactions between two (or more) distinct types of affiliated customers is called a multi-sided platform.. This concept of two-sided markets has been mainly theorised by the French economists Jean Tirole and Jean- Charles Rochet. Two-sided networks can be found in many industries, sharing the space with traditional product and service offerings. Example markets include credit cards (composed of cardholders and merchants); health maintenance organizations (patients and doctors); operating systems (end-users and developers); yellow pages (advertisers and consumers); video-game consoles (gamers and game developers); recruitment sites (job seekers and recruiters); search engines (advertisers and users); and communication networks, such as the Internet. Examples of well known companies employing two-sided markets include such organizations as American Express (credit cards), eBay (marketplace), Taobao (marketplace in China), Facebook (social medium), LinkedIn (professional medium), Mall of America (shopping mall), Match.com (dating platform), AIESEC (leadership development for youth by placing talent in companies), Monster.com (recruitment platform), and Sony (game consoles). Benefits to each group demand economies of scale. Consumers, for example, prefer credit cards honored by more merchants, while merchants prefer cards carried by more consumers. Two-sided markets are particularly useful for analyzing the chicken-and-egg problem of standards battles, such as the competition between VHS and Beta. They are also useful in explaining many free pricing or \\"freemium\\" strategies where one user group gets free use of the platform in order to attract the other user group.http://ssrn.com/abstract=249585 Geoffrey Parker and Marshall Van Alstyne (2000) \\"Information Complements, Substitutes, and Strategic Product Design\\"http://rje.org Bernard Caillaud and Bruno Jullien (2003). \\"Chicken & Egg: Competing Matchmakers\\".

[Two-Sided Markets: A Progress Report]http://hbr.harvardbusiness.org/2006/10/strategies-for-two-sided- markets/ar/1 Thomas Eisenmann, Geoffrey Parker, and Marshall Van Alstyne (2006). [ \\"Strategies for Two-Sided Markets.\\" Harvard Business Review]. Overview Two-sided markets represent a refinement of the concept of network effects. There are both same-side and cross-side network effects. Each network effect can be either positive or negative. An example of a positive same-side network effect is end-user PDF sharing or player-to-player contact in PlayStation 3; a negative same-side network effect appears when there is competition between suppliers in an online auction market or competition for dates on Match.com. The concept of network effects was conceived independently by Geoffrey Parker and Marshall Van Alstyne (2000,2000, 2005) to explain behavior in software markets and by Rochet & Tirole to explain behavior in credit card markets. The first known peer-reviewed paper on interdependent demands was published in 2000. Multi-sided platforms exist because there is a need of intermediary in order to match both parts of the platform in a more efficient way. Indeed, this intermediary will minimize the overall cost, for instance, by avoiding duplication, or by minimizing transaction costs. This intermediary will make possible exchanges that would not occur without them and create value for both sides. Two-sided platforms, by playing an intermediary role, produce certain value for both users (parties) that are interconnected through it, and therefore those sides (parties) may both be evaluated as customers (unlike in the traditional seller-buyer dichotomy). Structural characteristics A two-sided network typically has two distinct user groups. Members of at least one group exhibit a preference regarding the number of users in the other group; these are called cross-side network effects. Each group's members may also have preferences regarding the number of users in their own group; these are called same-side network effects. Cross-side network effects are usually positive, but can be negative (as with consumer reactions to advertising). Same-side network effects may be either positive (e.g., the benefit from swapping video games with more peers) or negative (e.g., the desire to exclude direct rivals from an online business- to-business marketplace). For example, in marketplaces such as eBay or Taobao, buyers and sellers are the two groups. Buyers prefer a large number of sellers, and, meanwhile, sellers prefer a large number of buyers, such that the members in one group can easily find their trading partners from the other group. Therefore, the cross-side network effect is positive. On the other hand, a large number of sellers mean severe competition among sellers. Therefore, the same-side network effect is negative. Figure 1 depicts these relationships. Figure 1: Cross-side and same-side network effects in a two- sided network.http://www.hbsp.com Eisenmann (2006), \`\`Managing Networked Businesses: Course Overview.\\" Neither cross-side network effects nor same-side network effects are sufficient for an organization to be a multi-sided platform. Examining traditional supermarkets, it is clear that shoppers prefer higher number of suppliers and bigger variety of goods, while suppliers value higher number of buyers. Nevertheless, a supermarket does not qualify as a multi-sided platform because it does not enable direct contact between shoppers and suppliers. On the other hand, such network effects are not required for a firm to be seen as a multi-sided platform. One example is the situation in which niche event organizers implement a ticketing service managed by a small on-line ticket provider in their websites. Consumers affiliate with the on-line ticket provider only when they go to the website to buy the ticket. However, cross-side network effects and same-side network effects are common in multi-sided platforms. In two-sided networks, users on each side typically require very different functionality from their common platform. In credit card networks, for example, consumers require a unique account, a plastic card, access to phone-based customer service, a monthly bill, etc. Merchants require terminals for authorizing transactions, procedures for submitting charges and receiving payment, \\"signage\\" (decals that show the card is accepted), etc. Given these different requirements, platform providers may specialize in serving users on just one side of a two- sided network. A key feature of two-sided markets is the novel pricing strategies and business models they employ. In order to attract one group of users, the network sponsor may subsidize the other group of users. Historically, for example, Adobe's portable document format (PDF) did not succeed until Adobe priced the PDF reader at zero, substantially increasing sales of PDF writers. In the operating systems market for home computers, created in the early 1980s with the introduction of the Macintosh and IBM PC, Microsoft decided to steeply discount the software development toolkit (SDKs) for its operating system, relative to Apple pricing at that time, lowering the barrier to entry to the home computer market for software businesses. This resulted in a big increase in the number of applications being developed for home computers, with the Microsoft Windows/IBM PC being the operating system/computer type combination of choice for both software businesses and software users. Competition Because of network effects, successful platforms enjoy increasing returns to scale. Users will pay more for access to a bigger network, so margins improve as user bases grow. This sets network platforms apart from most traditional manufacturing and service businesses. In traditional businesses, growth beyond some point usually leads to diminishing returns: Acquiring new customers becomes harder as fewer people, not more, find the firm's value proposition appealing. Fueled by the promise of increasing returns, competition in two-sided network industries can be fierce. Platform leaders can leverage their higher margins to invest more in R&D; or lower their prices, driving out weaker rivals. As a result, mature two-sided network industries are usually dominated by a handful of large platforms, as is the case in the credit card industry. In extreme situations, such as PC operating systems, a single company emerges as the winner, taking almost all of the market.http://hbr.org/2006/10/strategies-for-two-sided-markets/ar/1 Eisenmann T., Parker G., and Van Alstyne M.W. \\"Strategies for Two-Sided Markets\\" Article Preview, Harvard Business Review, October 2006 Pricing Platform managers must choose the right price to charge each group in a two- sided network and ignoring network effects can lead to mistakes. In figure 2, pricing without taking network effects into account means finding prices that maximize the areas of the two blue rectangles. Adobe initially used this approach when it launched PDF and charged for both reader and writer software. Two sided marketplace can also be built using Marketplace Softwares such as IdyaFlow.http://www.hbsp.com Tripsas (2000), \\"Adobe Systems, Inc.\\", Case 9-801-199. Figure 2:Traditional pricing logic seeks the biggest revenue rectangle (price √ó quantity) under each demand curve.http://ssrn.com/abstract=1177443 Parker and Marshall Van Alstyne (2005), page 1498. In two-sided networks, such pricing logic can be misguided. If firms account for the fact that adoption on one side of the network drives adoption on the other side, they can do better. Demand curves are not fixed: with positive cross-side network effects, demand curves shift outward in response to growth in the user base on the network's other side. When Adobe changed its pricing strategy and made its reader software freely available, its managers uncovered a key rule of two-sided network pricing. They subsidized the more price sensitive side, and charged the side whose demand increased more strongly in response to growth on the other side. As illustrated in figure 3, giving consumers a free reader created demand for the document writer, the network's \\"money side\\". Figure 3: So long as the revenue gained (red box) exceeds the revenue lost (light blue box), a discounting strategy is profitable. The subsidy largely changes network size. Similarly, gaming manufacturers very often subsidize the gamers and sell their consoles at substantial losses (e.g. Sony's PS3 lost $250 per unit soldKenji Hall, \\"The PlayStation 2 Still Rocks.)in order to penetrate the market and receive royalties of software sold for their gaming console. On the other hand, even though two-sided pricing strategies generally increase total platform profits compared to traditional one-sided strategies, the actual end value of the two- sided pricing strategy is contingent on market characteristics and may not offset the costs of implementation. For example, profits of an application provider increase with the implementation of a two-sided pricing strategy of the platform provider only if the application is subsidized by the provider. Platform providers should also be more cautious when the giveaway product has appreciable unit costs, as with tangible goods. Free-PC incurred $80M in losses in 1999 when it decided to give away computers and Internet access at no cost to consumers who agreed to view Internet-delivered ads that could not be minimized or hidden. Unfortunately, willingness to pay does not materialize on the money side, as few marketers were eager to target consumers who were so cost conscious.Thomas R. Eisenmann, Geoffrey Parker, Marshall W. Van Alstyne (2006). Strategies for Two-Sided Markets, Harvard Business Review. Strategic issues If building a bigger network is one reason to subsidize adoption, then stimulating value adding innovations is the other.J. Gregory Sidak, The Impact of Multisided Markets on the Debate over Optional Transactions for Enhanced Delivery over the Internet, 7 POL√çTICA ECON√ìMICA Y REGULATORIA EN TELECOMUNICACIONES 94, 96 (2011). Consider, for example, the value of an operating system with no applications. While Apple initially tried to charge both sides of the market, like Adobe did in figure 2, Microsoft uncovered a second pricing rule: subsidize those who add platform value. In this context, consumers, not developers are the money side. Figure 4: In this market, consumers care more about access to critical features. The main effect of a subsidy is to change network value. Which market represents the money side and which market represents the subsidy side depends on this critical tradeoff: increasing network size versus growing network value. The size rule lets people increase adoption more while the value rule lets people increase price more. Although recently developed in terms of economic theory, two-sided networks help to explain many classic battles, for example, Betamax vs. VHS, Mac vs. Windows, CBS vs. RCA in color TV, American Express vs. Visa, and more recently Blu-ray vs. HD DVD. In the case of color TV, CBS and RCA offered rival formats but initially neither gained market traction. Viewers had little reason to buy expensive color TVs in the absence of color programming. Likewise, broadcasters had little reason to develop color programming when households lacked color TVs. RCA won the battle in two ways. It flooded the market with low cost black-and-white TVs incompatible with the CBS format but compatible with its own. Broadcasters then needed to use the RCA format to reach established viewers. RCA also subsidized Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, which gave consumers reason to buy the new technology. Multihoming When two-sided markets contain more than one competing platform, the condition of users affiliating with more than one such platform is called multihoming. Instances arise, for example, when consumers carry credit cards from more than one banking network or they continue using computers based on two different operating systems. This condition implies an increase of \\"homing\\" costs, which comprise all the expenses network users incur in order to establish and maintain platform affiliation. These ongoing costs of platform affiliation should be distinguished from switching costs, which refer to the one time costs of terminating one network and adopting another. Their significance in industry and antitrust law arises from the fact that the greater the multihoming costs, the greater is the tendency toward market concentration. Higher multihoming costs reduce user willingness to maintain affiliation with competing networks providing similar services. Winner takes all Attracted by the prospects of large margins, platforms can try to compete to be the winner-take-all in two-sided markets with strong network effects. That means that one platform serves the mature networked market. Examples of the standards battles include VHS vs Betamax, Microsoft vs Netscape and the DVD market. Not all two-sided markets with strong positive network effects are optimally supplied by a single platform. Markets must have high multi-homing costs and similar consumers' needs. Even if the market has characteristics that could lead it to be dominated by one platform, companies can choose to cooperate rather than competing to be the winner-take-it-all. For instance, DVD companies pooled their technologies creating the DVD format in 1995.Carl Shapiro, Hal R. Varian (1999). Art of Standards Wars (http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/shapiro/wars.pdf) If the market naturally supports a monopoly platform, intense short-run fighting among competing platforms can be motivated by the desire to capture future monopoly profits. Threat of envelopment Since platforms frequently have overlapping user bases, it is not uncommon for a platform to be \\"enveloped\\" by an adjacent provider.http://ssrn.com/abstract=1496336 Thomas Eisenmann, Geoffrey Parker, and Marshall Van Alstyne (2011). \\"Platform Envelopment.\\" Strategic Management Journal. Usually, this occurs when a rival platform provides the same functionality of a platform as a part of a multiplatform bundle. If the money- side perceives that such multiplatform bundles delivers more value at a lower price, a stand-alone platform is in danger. If one cannot reduce price on the money-side or enhance one's value proposition, one can try to change one's business model or find a \\"bigger brother\\" to help. The last option when facing envelopment is to resort to legal remedies, since antitrust law for two-sided networks is still in dispute. However, in many cases a stand-alone business facing envelopment has little choice but to sell out to the attacker or exit the field.

History The community of Fort Rock was named after the natural feature Fort Rock by the town's founder, Ray Nash. Fort Rock post office was established in 1908 under postmaster Josiah Thomas Rhoton. The Fort Rock Valley flourished briefly during the homestead period before World War I, but little remains in the area today. Fort Rock is one of two homestead-era communities remaining in the area, along with Silver Lake. Community The general store Fort Rock had a general store that was in operation since the early 1900s. The store, which also included a gas station, closed in May 2013. As of September 2014, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality had entered into a prospective purchaser agreement to reopen the store after performing needed underground storage tank (UST) cleanup. The store has reopened as of 2017. Fort Rock also has a community church, a Grange hall, a restaurant and a tavern. The Rock View Apartments burned down in 2012; the land on which the apartments was located was owned by the Fort Rock Care Center, which planned to donate it to the Fort Rock Historical Society in 2013. The senior apartments were only six years old when they burned. Museum Today, many of the buildings in Fort Rock are part of the Fort Rock Valley Historical Society's Fort Rock Valley Historical Homestead Museum, which is a collection of homestead-era buildings moved there from the surrounding area, starting in 1988. The museum was created by the Fort Rock Valley Historical Society to preserve historic buildings that were in danger of being razed by the Bureau of Land Management or were being vandalized in their remote locations. Buildings include a church, a log cabin, a doctor's office, a school, a land office, and several other cabins and houses. Climate Fort Rock has a dry-summer Mediterranean climate with cold winters and warm summers featuring colder nights due to large diurnal temperature variations. Freezing temperatures can occur at any time of the year. There are on average 260 days annually where the temperature reaches at or below freezing (8 of them in July).

Early life Noveskey grew up in a very musical household in Northern Michigan. His uncle played bass guitar and sang in a touring rock band, his brother plays drums, and his grandparents played guitar, piano and accordion. Inspired by his uncle Jim Noveskey, Matt started playing bass at age eleven and has been playing in bands since he was a teenager. Matt has said that he was interested in playing both drums and guitar, and that playing bass sort of allowed him to do both at the same time. His first band was called Love Muscle and he also played in a band called Toast, which included his brother on drums. His early musical influences were bassists James Jamerson, Larry Graham, and Flea. Noveskey graduated from Saint Francis High School in Traverse City in 1994. He attended various Michigan colleges and bartended while playing weekend shows with a variety of local acts, including the bands Switch and Botfly. Acting on a tip from his booking agent, in late 1998 he successfully auditioned for Blue October. His first full show with Blue October was at Satellite Lounge in Houston, Texas on February 12, 1999. Blue October Noveskey joined Blue October in 1998 after the departure of the group's original bassist, Liz Mullally. Noveskey played guitar, bass and sang backing vocals on Blue October's 2000 major label debut Consent to Treatment. He also created the artwork for the album and along with Justin Furstenfeld, co-wrote the single \\"James\\" and the live fan-favorite \\"You Make Me Smile.\\" Noveskey toured extensively with Blue October in support of Consent to Treatment. He stayed with the band even after they were dropped from Universal Records, but left due to health reasons at the end of the tour in late 2002. Blue October re-signed with Universal for the release of 2003's History for Sale on which Noveskey contributed. Matt eventually fully rejoined Blue October in late 2004. During his absence, Blue October never played the Noveskey-penned \\"You Make Me Smile\\" during a concert. The song was included as the opening track on the band's 2006 platinum album Foiled and is now a live staple. After the departure of Blue October's lead guitarist, C.B. Hudson, in 2010, Noveskey temporarily took over guitar duty during performances until the band hired Julian Mandrake as a full-time lead guitarist. (a+)machines During his absence from Blue October, Noveskey formed a second band with Blue October's drum technician Alan Adams, who had previously been the drummer for the bands Falling Jupiter and Flywater Washington. The new band, (a+)machines, also includes Ryan Holley and Chris Lynch. Noveskey is the primary singer and lyricist in the band, which have recorded a 5-track EP and a live album. The band actively toured during 2004 and 2005 with such acts as Canvas, SouthFM, 7 Mary 3, Vallejo and the Burden Brothers, and played an official showcase at SXSW in 2005. The group have been on hiatus while Noveskey and Adams tour with Blue October. (a+)machines has periodically reunited to play live concerts. Their most recent show was October 27, 2018 in Austin. Other Music Projects While not touring and recording with his bands, Noveskey lends his services as a bassist, songwriter, vocalist and record producer to other recording artists, such as Wesley Lunsford & The Selfless Season. In January 2008 he formed a production company called 116 Producers with producer/engineer Chuck Alkazian. The duo works with some of the brightest upcoming talent in the music business today, mainly recording out of Detroit and Austin. Several of the artists Noveskey produces have signed to major labels, won awards, achieved chart success and had their songs placed in movies and television shows. In addition to producing young talent, Noveskey is the proprietor of Wanderlust Artist Management and Promotion, a company that manages and promotes the artists he produces. His current roster includes the bands I Am Dynamite, Dossey and Courrier. Matt also manages Dalton Rapattoni who finished third on American Idol, and he also produced Rapattoni's debut solo album Nobody's Home. Recently Matt has launched the Austin branch of Premiere Career Guidance, a Nashville-based artist development firm. In 2012 Noveskey along with Blue October's guitarist C.B. Hudson, broke ground on Orb Recording Studios, a world class residential recording studio in Austin, which opened in 2013. In 2014 Orb Studios was selected as Austin's best recording studio in the Austin Music Industry Awards.

Fujino worked as chief engineer within Honda R&D;, then as vice president, before he was named the project leader for HondaJet development. He is also a managing officer of Honda Motor. At Honda Aircraft, he has played a crucial role in the recent growth of the company, and is responsible for the overall strategy of its design, development, certification, marketing, sales, and production of the HondaJet. For his work at Honda Aircraft, Fujino has received the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Aircraft Design Award (2012), the SAE International Award, the Clarence L. Kelly Johnson Aerospace and Vehicle Design Award (2014), and the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences Award for Innovation in Aeronautics. Fujino is the first aircraft designer to receive all four of these awards, as well as the first individual of Asian descent to win the AIAA award, making him a notable figure in the contemporary aviation industry. Background Education Fujino holds a Bachelor of Science degree and Doctorate degree in aeronautical engineering from University of Tokyo.http://www.hondajet.com/Content/pdf/tech_papers/NC_vol%202_CS4_HondaJet_Kym15May.pdf Fellow * American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA): Fellow * Royal Aeronautical Society: Fellow * SAE International: Fellow * National Academy of Engineering (NAE): Foreign Member Career 1984‚Äì1997 Fujino joined Honda Motor in 1984. He spent the first two years of his career in the automobile research division working on the development of a new electrical control steering system. Fujino was then assigned to Honda‚Äôs aviation research division. In 1986, Fujino and the Honda aviation team were dispatched to the United States to conduct advanced aeronautics research with the Mississippi State University‚Äôs Raspet Flight Research Center. The first experimental jet was an airplane modified from an existing single-engine turboprop plane, but the second jet was built from scratch. It was a pure experimental aircraft that consisted of various new technologies. Fujino and the team generated many drawings and performed numerous stress analyses, conducted structural test, system test, and ground vibration tests, and even had to sand tooling molds by hand. Spending enormous amount of time and effort on this project, Fujino has come to understand the theory needed to design an airplane. At the same time, he has gained advanced technology skills with sufficient experience to fabricate and develop an airplane. 1997‚ÄìCurrent During the research project, Fujino envisioned a great potential for high performance light jet. He thought if an airplane could be designed having both high fuel efficiency and high speed, without sacrificing cabin volume and luggage space, there would be a potential demand in the business jet markets. Fujino continues to develop various new technologies in order to achieve his goal. After Fujino's return to Japan, he pitched an idea of Over-the-wing engine mount, and was assigned large project leader for the HondaJet program in 1997. Along with his passion, determination, and responsibility as a leader to develop HondaJet, Fujino took on the role of president & CEO of Honda Aircraft Company in August 2006. He now resides with his wife and three children in Greensboro, North Carolina. Innovations and designs Fujino‚Äôs clean sheet design for an advanced light jet that could achieve both high speed and high fuel efficiency led to the development of key technologies and concepts. He discovered the optimum Over- The-Wing Engine Mount configuration to reduce wave drag at transonic speed. This aeronautical breakthrough was proven to dramatically enhance aircraft performance, fuel efficiency, and passenger comfort (spacious and quiet cabin). He also developed a new natural laminar flow (NLF) wing and fuselage nose for the light jet and a new hybrid composite structure, which contributed to a lighter airframe. These three innovations allow the HondaJet to achieve highest speed, superior fuel efficiency and the most cabin and luggage space over other jets in its class. Fujino stated that their objectives was to design and develop an advanced light jet that would create new value for personal and business aviation. Through Fujino's practical experience building and designing airplane, and his thorough understanding of advanced technology in aviation, he was able to pursuit of future airplane design concept- HondaJet. Over-The-Wing Engine Mount (OTWEM) Configuration Where most aircraft the engines are below the wings or attached to the rear fuselage, Fujino's idea was to locating the engine nacelle over the wing. The OTWEM design improves performance and fuel efficiency by reducing aerodynamic drag. It also reduces cabin sound, minimizes ground detected noise, and allows room for passengers, luggage, as well as a private lavatory. Natural-Laminar- Flow Airfoil In order to reduce aerodynamic drag and maximize HondaJet's performance, Fujino has applied the Natural laminar flow (NLF) technology on the main wing airfoil (NLF wing) and fuselage nose (NLF nose). Composite Fuselage By applying composite material to the fuselage, which is created from the co-cured integral structure and honeycomb sandwich structures, Fujino allowed the best cost-performance of the jet and contour for aerodynamic. Advanced Cockpit Fujino's cockpit design has achieved a high degree of flight safety with more space and greater visibility provided to the pilot. The Garmin G3000 avionic system with the dual touch-screen controller and three 14-inch landscape high-resolution displays offer enhanced navigation, flight planning, and control.

He left the Communist Party after Nikita Khrushchev's 1956 secret speech and the Soviet invasion of Hungary. Higgins instead joined the Trotskyist Socialist Labour League, soon leaving to join the Socialist Review Group which became the International Socialists (IS), and becoming the group's Secretary. By the 1960s, Higgins was a POEU branch secretary and was elected to the union's national executive, but he gave up his union work to become IS's full-time national secretary in the early 1970s. In a burst of internal quarrels in the period 1973-76 he left the organisation. He was a founder member of the Workers League, but this organisation soon broke apart. Instead, he built a new life as a journalist, later moving into magazine design. He remained active as a writer and speaker at left wing meetings up until his death and in 1997 published a memoir, More Years for the Locust.

Poems on the Underground displays poems by contemporary and classic poets three times a year. POTU also produces booklets free of charge to the public and publishes anthologies.Poems on the Underground, A New Edition, Penguin, 2012. Cover art for the tenth edition of the Poems on the Underground anthology History Launched in 1986, the Poems on the Underground programme was the idea of three writers, Judith Chernaik, Gerard Benson, and Cicely Herbert whose aim was to bring poetry to a wider audience. Judith Chernaik, Cicely Herbert, Imtiaz Dharker, and George Szirtes now select poems for inclusion in the programme. London Underground provides space on its fleet of trains, and they and POTU's partners also display the poems on their websites during the duration of the print display. The posters are designed by Tom Davidson. The first book containing all the featured poems was not published until much later, having been initially rejected by Faber as unlikely to prove commercially viable. In the end, towards the end of the decade, a young Publisher's Representative (salesman) persuaded his employers ‚Äì Cassell Publishing ‚Äì to publish the tome when, having failed in his attempt to buy the as-yet non-existent publication as a birthday present for his mother, he felt sufficiently confident of making it a bestseller. He was set a target by the publishing house of selling 5,000 copies by the Christmas following publication, or risk losing his job. But the book ‚Äì which is still very much in print 27 years later and must rank as one of the best-selling poetry books of all time ‚Äì immediately sold out and went straight to reprint prior to publication. Partners for Poems on the Underground include London Underground, which generously supports the programme, and the Arts Council of England, the British Council, London Arts and the Poetry Society. The programme A series of different poems are displayed at any given time, ranging from classical and historical works by such well-loved poets as Blake, Shakespeare and Shelley, to contemporary and emerging poets from around the world. The works are displayed three times a year and have proved extremely popular with the travelling public.

A senior leader of the Awami League, Mansur also served as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh in 1975. Early life Muhammad Mansur Ali was born on 16 January 1919 in Kuripara, Kazipur, Sirajganj District in the province of Bengal (now in Bangladesh). Mansur pursued his education in Kolkata Islamia College (now Maulana Azad College). He would pursue a MA degree in economics and law from the Aligarh Muslim University. During this period Mansur became an active member of the Muslim League, which under Muhammad Ali Jinnah demanded a separate Muslim state of Pakistan. He served as the vice-president of the Pabna District Muslim League from 1946 to 1950. He joined the Pakistan Army, received training at Jessore Cantonment and attained the rank of army captain. Deciding to practise law, he enrolled in the Pabna District Court in 1951. Political career He would soon be elected member of Awami League's central executive committee and president of its Pabna District unit. Mansur was arrested by police in 1952 for helping to organise protests against the declaration of Urdu as the sole official language, in what became known as the Language Movement. Mansur and his party demanded that Bengali also receive recognition and the provinces be granted autonomy. After his release, Mansur was elected a member of the East Pakistan Legislative Assembly in 1954 as a candidate of the United Front alliance of various political parties. In the cabinet headed by Ataur Rahman Khan, Mansur served in different periods as the province's minister of law, parliamentary affairs, food, agriculture, commerce and industry. Mansur was re-arrested in the aftermath of the coup d√©tat led by Ayub Khan, who became President of Pakistan and imposed martial law. He would remain incarcerated from 1958 to 1959. Mansur Ali played an important role in the Six point movement led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who demanded substantial regional autonomy and opposed the military regime. In the 1970 elections, he was elected member of the legislative assembly. At the outbreak of the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, Mansur went underground to organise a government in exile. Mansur became the minister of finance in the Mujibnagar government. After the independence of Bangladesh, Mansur was the minister of communications and later home affairs. After the introduction of a one-party, presidential system in 1975, Mujib became the President of Bangladesh. Mansur was appointed the prime minister. He helped Mujib organise the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League.  Personal life  He married Begum Amina the daughter of a District Judge from the area of Rangpur. They had five sons and one daughter. His eldest son Dr Mohammad Selim became an advocate from Bangladesh and studied for the BAR at Lincoln's Inn, he is a prominent political figure and became Presidium member for Awami League and held the position of Chairman of Bangladesh Foreign affairs committee as well as being an MP representing his fathers constituency Kazipur in Sirajganj District. His second son Mohammad Nasim also became a leader of prominence and was MP and held ministerial posts of Telecoms and Home for Awami League government between 1996 and 2001. Death On 15 August 1975, Mujib was assassinated along with his family by a group of military officers. It is believed that the 15 August coup d'√©tat was masterminded by Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, a disgruntled member of Mujib's regime who would become president. Mansur went into hiding immediately after the killing. When Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad invited Awami League leaders such as Mansur Ali, Syed Nazrul Islam, A. H. M. Qamaruzzaman and Tajuddin Ahmad to join his government, they refused. They were arrested by the army on 23 August 1975. Refusing to support Ahmad's regime, they were murdered while incarcerated in the Dhaka Central Jail on 3 November, which was one of the key points for the 3 November coup, which already ousted Ahmad from power again.

Not much of the town remains today, however a few buildings still exist. The townsite is located in Tennessee Township. History Throughout the 1880s groups as large as 2,000 people gathered in a western Illinois river valley to drink natural spring water that was said to have medicinal properties capable of solving a variety of physical and psychological ailments. Some time in the 1880s, the land was named Vishnu Springs after the Hindu god Vishnu because of the supposed healing power of the water. Near the start of the 20th century, a man named Darius Hicks took steps to start a town and health resort on the land around Vishnu Springs. He divided the land owned by his family into plots and sold them for $30 each. The centerpiece of the town was a three-story hotel named the Capitol Hotel which was built to attract people seeking the health and spiritual effects of the spring. The town featured two stores: a blacksmith shop and a restaurant. Transportation was provided by horse and buggy from the nearby town of Colchester, Illinois. Later, Hicks added parks, a fishing pond, a racetrack, and a schoolhouse. In the summer of 1903 a supervisor was making sure that the horse who turned the gears of the resort's carousel was walking at a steady pace while children were riding the carousel. Somehow, that supervisor's shirtsleeve was caught in the gears of the carousel, pulling him into them. Screams of terror interrupted the sound of the joyful children riding the carousel, as the supervisor was crushed to his death. The carousel was stopped, and was never again ran. Despite Hicks‚Äô efforts, the town never prospered. Transportation was difficult due to the lack of rail lines or an easily navigable river. Hicks left the resort town in 1903, and indifferent management let the town decay. By the 1920s most of the businesses had closed, large numbers of guests stopped visiting, and the town could be considered abandoned. A man named Ira Post attempted to revive the resort in 1935. Post marketed the area as a vacation and picnic area that had limited success until the 1950 when Post died. In 1968 a woman named Alfred White and a man named Albert Simmons tried to reopen the restaurant and country music attraction. In the 1970s a group of students from Western Illinois University started a commune on the land. The commune sustained itself with farming, livestock, and occasional music festivals. The hotel was once again abandoned by 1982. Most of the town is gone today, however the hotel still stands. Much of the hotel has been ruined by vandals and decay. The land was donated to Western Illinois University in 2003 as a wildlife refuge and a place for conservation and research. There are longstanding rumors that the land is haunted by the ghosts of those who once lived in the thriving town. Ira & Reatha T.

Its name in Xhosa means ‚Äòmoon‚Äô and it is one of the oldest black townships in Cape Town. It was established as a result of the migrant labour system. In 1948 black migrants were forced to settle in Nyanga as Langa became too small. Nyanga was one of the poorest places in Cape Town and is still is one of the dangerous parts of Cape Town. In 2001 its unemployment was estimated at around 56% and HIV/AIDS is a huge community issue. The township is known as the \\"murder capital\\" of South Africa. Nyanga is situated from Cape Town along N2 highway, close to the Cape Town International Airport and next to the townships of Gugulethu and Crossroads. History The neighborhood was established in 1946 and proclaimed a township in the same year for migrant labour predominantly from the Eastern Cape. It was initially established as a spillover once the neighborhood of Langa was fully occupied. Residents of Nyanga were active in joining a national call to protest against the apartheid laws passed in 1960. Later they were active in the 1976 student uprisings against the use of Afrikaans as first language in schools. Nyanga became notorious for its black on black faction fighting that was allegedly perpetrated by police in the early eighties. The local authorities (izibonda) grouped themselves according to their background and used that as their criteria when allocating land. These cultural differences were allegedly used by the police to stir up violence, and elements of the community were infiltrated by the apartheid regime. This led to emergence of the notoriously violent group called \\"the witdoeke\\" (the white scarfs). As a result of these fights Tambo square was formed. Nyanga is made up by nine townships (Lusaka, KTC, Old Location, Maumau, Zwelitsha, Maholweni \\"Hostels\\", Black City, White City, Barcelona, Kanana and Europe). Nyanga is one of the world's most dangerous areas, and had the highest number of murders (262) in South Africa during 2012.

History Both retailed at ¬£1999.00 ex vat at March 1983 from 'Movement Audio Visual', 61 Taunton Road, Bridgwater, Somerset, TA6 3LP, UK. Both models combined two technologies; analogue synthesized drum sounds similar to Simmons SDS-V and basic digital 8-bit drum samples. In total 14 independent voice modules could be played (5 of which can be digital). Also notable for its computer-like design and its ability to display drum notes and sequencing graphically on a green black cathode ray tube display unit perhaps similar to page R on the Fairlight CMI. The Movement Drum Systems are known to have been expensive upon release, and it is estimated that approximately thirty were made. The original designers were John Dickenson (owned the company Movement) and Dave Goodway. Dickenson supplied sounds and the idea (the design, look, how it should work, layout etc.) and Dave Goodway did the electronic side of the drum machine. Its most famous user was David A. Stewart of the Eurythmics, who excelled in the use of this drum computer on their 1983 worldwide hit, \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This).\\" The machine (MKI) makes an appearance in the video, in a scene in which singer Annie Lennox is seated on top of a table in a meadow, as Dave Stewart types on the Drum Computer's keyboard. In this video the version used is a two-piece type base unit and separate monitor (perhaps a prototype or the MKI model). This is the model that also appears briefly near the beginning of the video for \\"Love On Your Side\\" by Thompson Twins. Phil Collins used an orange smaller 'one piece' MKII. David Stewart also used this machine on the album Touch and soundtrack album 1984 (For the Love of Big Brother). The last commercial track release on which the Eurythmics used this machine was on Sexcrime (Nineteen Eighty-Four). At this time the Eurythmics chose to use a lot of heavy ambient audio outboard processing to \\"beef-up\\" the rather mild and dated sound of this classic machine. In 1984, Dave Goodway and Jonathan (JJ) Jowitt added MIDI to create an additional 8 track sequencer. Other hardware modifications, like battery-backed memory and disk drives, were added, but the operation was small (only a two-man team). Eventually, the big companies reigned supreme. Vince Clarke currently owns a black version of the MK2 which was originally owned by Stewart of the Eurythmics, purchased for only ¬£500 GBP. Usage In addition to the above, the drum machine was also used on the tracks and albums: *Kim Wilde (Cambodia) and most of her 1982 album Select *Hot Chocolate (Girl Crazy) and most of their 1982 studio album Mystery *Thompson Twins on their Quick Step and Side Kick and Into The Gap albums *John Foxx on his 1981 album The Garden *Mick Karn on his 1982 album Titles *Phil Collins on his 1982 album Hello, I Must Be Going! and with Genesis on the 1983 album Genesis and has been used/owned by: *Kissing the Pink *Kajagoogoo References Category:Computer-related introductions in 1981 Category:Drum machines Category:Musical instruments invented in the 1980s ","title":"Movement Systems Drum Computer"},{"id":"7169583","text":"Worthing Museum and Art Gallery is in the centre of Worthing near the grade II* listed St Paul's. The building, which celebrated its centenary in 2008, was originally designed to house the town's library as well as the museum, the library section being funded by Andrew Carnegie. It is the largest museum in West Sussex. Collections and displays Worthing Museum and Art Gallery has one of the largest costume and textile collections in the UK. The 19th century and 20th century galleries display just a tiny fraction of the museum's contents. The current display in the 19th century gallery looks at the changing shape of women during the century. The 20th century gallery concentrates on women's fashions including pictures of local residents through the ages. There is also a small menswear display. The museum also holds records for all archaeological finds between the rivers Adur and Arun. This includes the John Pull Collection of neolithic flint mines, shown on the television series Time Team, the Patching hoard of gold coins, an Anglo-Saxon long boat, and the Highdown Goblet ‚Äì an Ancient Egyptian glass vase with an Ancient Greek inscription, found at the Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Highdown. The museum has over 900 dolls and a collection of toys from the Georgian period to the present day, in its Juvenilia collection, along with the Colin Mears Collection ‚Äì 2000 objects documenting the history of 20th Century Childhood. It also has social history, numismatics, and fine and decorative art collections. Art collection Bianca, William Holman Hunt, oil on canvas, 1868‚Äì1869 Most of the works collected in the Museum's early years were by artists that had strong Sussex links. However there were exceptions include Nicholas Roerich, Hobbema, Wynants and a piece from the School of Bassano. The collection diversified to include the main movements in British painting and includes Bianca (1869), a painting by William Holman Hunt. There are also works by Lucien Pissarro and Ivon Hitchens. Sculpture is represented through works by John Skelton, Philip Jackson, Dora Gordine and Anthony Stevens who are all nationally recognised but have links to the region. The Museum acquired Skelton's The Diver (1970), a carving in walnut wood, in 2008. This was made possible through the V&A; Purchase Fund and the Friends of the Worthing Museum. The Art Gallery regularly hosts visiting exhibitions such as Jon Edgar in 2010 and Dora Gordine in 2011, in association with Kingston University's Dorich House Museum.

D. Schindler. It was a 2006 Newbery Honor Book (Newbery Medal finalist) and an ALA Notable Book for Children.  Plot introduction  The story is about a cat named Whittington that goes to live in a barn that is owned by a man named Bernie. Ben and Abby, Bernie's grandchildren, come to the barn. Ben struggles with reading in school. Ben has dyslexia and is struggling to learn how to read. He has been told by the school principal that if his reading skills do not improve, he will not advance to the next grade. Whittington tells the story of his namesake, a man named Dick Whittington, which encourages Ben.  The three stories in Whittington  Three stories merge in the novel. The first is about Whittington, a scruffy tomcat, descended from Dick Whittington's legendary cat, who wants to become part of the community in a barn full of animal outcasts kept by the kindly Bernie and his grandchildren, Ben and Abby. The second is the cat's retelling of the story of his famous ancestor, Dick Whittington's cat. The story of Dick and his cat, based in reality but told in legends dating back to the early 17th century and recounted in several modern books listed in the Endnote, is a rags-to-riches tale of a poor boy led to fame and fortune by an unusual pet with a knack for killing rats. The third is about dyslexic Ben's efforts to learn to read before he is held back and placed in Special Ed. The last two parallel each other to a certain extent, as Dick struggles to make his way in the world and Ben struggles with his frustration and fear. Dick is helped by his cat, who steers him to both fortune and love. Ben is helped by all the barn animals, who convince his sister to set up lessons in the barn, and get him to try out the Reading Recovery program at school, despite the teasing of his classmates.

World War II On January 1, 1942, after the United States entered World War II, Johnson was recalled to active duty. He served as US Naval Delegate to the Inter-American Defense Board from March 30, 1942, to August 1945, working to develop defenses in the western hemisphere. During this period, he had additional duty as Naval Member on the Joint Mexican-United States Defense Commission and as Senior Naval Member of the Permanent Joint Board on Defense, Canada-United States. He was awarded the Legion of Merit. His citation states: > ... Vice Admiral Johnson rendered invaluable assistance to all members of > the Board during the early stages of hostilities and, by his superb ability > and tact, was in large measure responsible for securing rights and > privileges vitally needed by our forces in the conduct of the war and for > the maintenance of cordial relations between the United States and Latin > American countries... Johnson retired on August 13, 1945, after forty-nine-and-a-half years of service. Personal life On June 18, 1903, at Albany, New York, he married Hannah Cox Harris, daughter of Frederick Harris and his wife. She was a granddaughter of New York State Senator Hamilton Harris and a great-niece of U.S. Senator Ira Harris. They had two daughters, Caroline Gilbert and Elvira Lindsay Johnson. Hannah Johnson died in 1962. Johnson died on December 5, 1963, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. They were survived by their daughters and their families: Caroline had married James Elwyn Brown, who became a US diplomat, and Elvira married Charles Burke Elbrick, who became an ambassador.

History Krogh's principle is named after the Danish physiologist August Krogh, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology for his contributions to understanding the anatomy and physiology of the capillary system, who described it in The American Journal of Physiology in 1929. However, the principle was first elucidated nearly 60 years prior to this, and in almost the same words as Krogh, in 1865 by Claude Bernard, the French instigator of experimental medicine, on page 27 of his \\"Introduction √† l'√©tude de la m√©decine exp√©rimentale\\": Krogh wrote the following in his 1929 treatise on the then current 'status' of physiology (emphasis added): \\"Krogh's principle\\" was not utilized as a formal term until 1975 when the biochemist Hans Adolf Krebs (who initially described the Citric Acid Cycle), first referred to it. More recently, at the International Society for Neuroethology meeting in Nyborg, Denmark in 2004, Krogh's principle was cited as a central principle by the group at their 7th Congress. Krogh's principle has also been receiving attention in the area of functional genomics, where there has been increasing pressure and desire to expand genomics research to a more wide variety of organisms beyond the traditional scope of the field. Philosophy and applications A central concept to Krogh's principle is evolutionary adaptation. Evolutionary theory maintains that organisms are suited to particular niches, some of which are highly specialized for solving particular biological problems. These adaptations are typically exploited by biologists in several ways: Thermus aquaticus *Methodology: (e.g. Taq polymerase and PCR): The need to manipulate biological systems in the laboratory has driven the use of an organismal specialization. One example of Krogh's principle presents itself in the heavily used Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), a method which relies on the rapid exposure of DNA to high heat for amplification of particular sequences of interest. DNA polymerase enzyme from many organisms would denature at high temperatures, however, to solve this problem, Chien and colleagues turned to Thermus aquaticus, a strain of bacteria native to hydrothermal vents. Thermus aquaticus has a polymerase that is heat stable at temperatures necessary for PCR. Biochemically modified Taq polymerase, as it is usually called, is now routinely used in PCR applications. *Overcoming technical limitations: (e.g. large neurons in Mollusca): Two Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning bodies of study were facilitated by using ideas central to Krogh's principle to overcome technical limitations in nervous system physiology. The ionic basis of the action potential was elucidated in the squid giant axon in 1958 by Hodgkin and Huxley, developers of the original voltage clamp device and co-recipients of the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The voltage clamp is now a central piece of technology in modern neurophysiology, but was only possible to develop using the wide diameter of the squid giant axon. Another marine mollusc, the opisthobranch Aplysia possesses relatively small number of large nerve cells that are easily identified and mapped from individual to individual. Aplysia was selected for these reasons for the study of the cellular and molecular basis of learning and memory which led to Eric Kandel's receipt of the Nobel Prize in 2000. Tyto alba, the Barn Owl *Understanding more complex/subtle systems (e.g. Barn owls and sound localization): Beyond overcoming technical limitations, Krogh's principle has particularly important implications in the light of convergent evolution and homology. Either because of evolutionary history, or particular constraints on a given niche, there are not infinite solutions to all biological problems. Instead, organisms utilize similar neural algorithms, behaviors, or even structures to accomplish similar tasks. If one's goal is to understand how the nervous system might localize objects using sound, one may take the approach of using an auditory 'specialist' such as the barn owl studied by Mark Konishi, Eric Knudsen and their colleagues. A nocturnal predator by nature, the barn owl relies heavily on using precise information on the time of arrival of sound in its ears. The information gleaned from this approach has contributed heavily to our understanding of how the brain maps sensory space, and how nervous systems encode timing information.

He served as the 13th Lieutenant Governor of Washington from 1957 to 1989, a longer tenure than any other lieutenant governor in the state's history. Previously he was head coach of the University of Washington football team from 1953 to 1955, compiling a record of 10‚Äì18‚Äì2. Two decades earlier he had been a college football player at Washington. Early life and career Born in Pensacola, Florida in 1910, Cherberg was the youngest of twelve children from a butcher father who emigrated from Europe. In 1919, his family moved to Seattle, Washington. He played football at Queen Anne High School before graduating in 1929. He attended the University of Washington (UW) and played halfback on the football team. Cherberg graduated in 1933 with a degree in economics. After graduation, he taught classes and coached football at Cleveland and Queen Anne high schools in Seattle, where he led both schools to state football championships. He joined the UW football staff in 1946. The three seasons he served as head coach of the UW football team were controversial. His record of 10 wins, 18 losses, and 2 ties was identified as the second-worst in Seattle's history in a 2006 article by Seattle Post-Intelligencer columnist Jim Moore. The team was involved in a payoff scandal that led to NCAA sanctions for the school and the firing of Cherberg in February 1956. Political career In June 1956 Cherberg announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor. Capitalizing on name recognition from his football career and the statewide contacts he'd developed as the head of the state's association of high school football coaches, he won the Democratic primary by defeating Howard S. Bargreen, and the general election by defeating Republican Don McDermott. Cherberg was inaugurated as Washington's lieutenant governor on January 16, 1957, under fellow Democrat Albert Rosellini. For his first 15 years in office, he also worked as an account executive at Seattle-area TV station KIRO to supplement his then-low lieutenant governor salary. Cherberg ran for Mayor of Seattle in 1964, but was defeated by Republican councilman Dorm Braman by 95,699 votes to his 83,205. Cherberg's platform included support for fair housing. Years later, both he and Braman testified for the prosecution regarding the mayoral race and money from Seattle police officials and King County Prosecuting Attorney Chuck Carroll, who were alleged to have been tolerating police corruption. (The case was later dismissed.) Following his defeat in the mayoral campaign, he once again ran for lieutenant governor. He served continuously under Republican Governor Daniel J. Evans (1965‚Äì1977), Democrat Dixy Lee Ray (1977‚Äì1981), Republican John Spellman (1981‚Äì1985), and for the first term of Democrat Booth Gardner (1985‚Äì1989). In his last race, he won comfortably with 63% of the vote. Cherberg stepped down in the 1988 race having served as lieutenant governor for nearly one third of Washington state's history at the time; at his death, he was the longest serving lieutenant governor in United States history. Death The John A. Cherberg Building at the Washington State Capitol houses senate offices. Cherberg lived in Seattle until his death from pneumonia at age 81 in 1992. He was interred at Calvary Cemetery, about a mile (1.6 km) northeast of the University of Washington campus. The John A. Cherberg Building, which houses Washington State Senate offices at the State Capitol campus, was renamed in his honor.

The film gathers together several of the many Lee imitators who sprang up after the icon's death (including Bruce Le and Dragon Lee), alongside performers from the real Lee's films and other veterans of the Hong Kong movie industry. It has been called \\"The Mount Rushmore of Bruceploitation films\\". Synopsis Immediately after the death of Bruce Lee in Hong Kong, Mr. Colin of the Special Branch of Investigations asks Professor Lucas (Jon T. Benn), a brilliant scientist, to take samples of the late master's brain tissue. Using these samples, Lucas creates three perfect clones of Lee: Bruce Lee 1 (Dragon Lee), Bruce Lee 2 (Bruce Le), and Bruce Lee 3 (Bruce Lai). They are trained in martial arts by Bolo Yeung and Chiang Tao. The mission of the clones is to fight crime in Southeast Asia. Bruce Lee 1 goes undercover as an actor for a corrupt, gold- smuggling producer who plans to have him die on camera. Meanwhile, the other clones go to Thailand where they meet up with Chuck (Bruce Thai), a local SBI agent who is not a clone but who also resembles Bruce Lee. They have been assigned to kill Dr. Ngai, a mad scientist who is plotting to take over the world with his army of bronze automatons: men whose skin turns to metal when they are injected with Ngai's special formula. The clones successfully complete their missions and return to Hong Kong. But Professor Lucas, disgruntled because he feels he was not properly rewarded by the SBI for creating the clones, pits them against one another. The professor's female assistants stop the three clones from fighting amongst themselves, and Lucas sends out a small army of men to dispatch the clones. By the end of the film, Bruce Lee 3 has been killed--but so have all of Professor Lucas's henchmen (including the two kung-fu instructors, both defeated by Bruce Lee 1). Bruce Lee 2 finishes off Lucas's personal bodyguard and the professor is arrested. Reaction On the website Kung Fu Cinema, Mark Pollard sums up much of the appeal of the film, writing: > \\"Clones of Bruce Lee is the Plan 9 from Outer Space of Hong Kong cinema. > It's the very definition of bad filmmaking and sleazy exploitation. Expect > to witness mad scientists bent on world domination, death rays, bronzemen, > and naked women frolicking on the beach. Despite some decent kung fu action, > particularly with Bolo, it's so bad you'll laugh or turn it off.\\" A review on the website The Bad Movie Report finds it less enjoyable: > \\"Although the Lee-alikes are in superb shape, and certainly know their Lee > chops, there is a deadening sameness about the fight scenes that eventually > robs the movie of all joy; this flick is, after all, 95% fight scenes. I've > always preferred the swordplay-oriented kung fu movies- the more weapons, > and the more bizarre, the better. Let's face it, the numerous styles > notwithstanding (and there are several on display), there are only so many > ways to aim a blow at your opponent and only so many ways to block that > blow. Without a good fight coordinator, like Lee himself, Jimmy Wang Yu, > Samo Hung or a host of others, after forty-five minutes of the same fight > over and over, each subsequent fight becomes the kinetic equivalent of white > noise: your mind more or less goes on vacation.\\" Production notes The Clones of Bruce Lee contains the only fight scene between Bruce Le and Dragon Lee. Jon T. Benn, who plays Professor Lucas and is familiar to Bruce Lee fans as the mob boss from Way of the Dragon, later appeared as an American businessman in Jet Li's film Fearless. This film is one of several appearances in the Bruceploitation subgenre for Bolo Yeung, who won fame for his portrayal of the muscular villain Bolo in Bruce Lee's Enter The Dragon.

General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably. His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time. The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate. The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.

Mohamed Nazim, Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015.

Background of character He usually had two things on his mind, girls and jokes. His jokes usually got little or no reaction from any other character, yet he continued his catchphrase, \\"I still got it!\\". Ralph was a practical joker and often used novelty items such as whoopie cushions, Groucho glasses, spring-loaded eyeball glasses, and joy buzzers. In the first season, Malph's girl-chasing was the primary focus of his character. He occasionally got dates but generally he was not very successful at it, although he was more successful than Richie Cunningham and Potsie. As the seasons progressed, he was shown to be easily frightened and often panicked greatly at the least and greatest occurrences. Originally the series tended to focus on Richie and Potsie, often in schemes to attract women, with Ralph as a third wheel. In the early seasons, Ralph was considerably \\"cooler\\" than Richie and Potsie, being a member of the gang, The Gems, and having a hot rod car. As the series shifted its focus to concentrate more on breakout character Fonzie and his friendship with Richie, Ralph was more often paired with Potsie. This was evident even more when the characters graduated from high school, when Ralph and Potsie rented and shared an apartment together, and they often argued. In the first episode of this arrangement, \\"The Apartment\\", Richie also moved in with them but, due to the pair's continual squabbling, Richie decided to move back home. In one episode where they were feuding, \\"Ralph vs. Potsie\\", they divided the apartment with white tape and assigned each other one side of the room, but they eventually patched up their differences. Ralph returns home after being honorably discharged from the U.S. Army in the episode entitled \\"Welcome Home\\" and he decides to become an optometrist just like his father. Ralph goes off to college and this serves as his last appearance in Happy Days. One small continuity error remains with the character of Ralph's father. Originally, his father owned a woman's dress store in town and his name was Harry Malph (played by Mike Monahan in the first-season episode \\"Because She's There\\"), but when the show shifted to a studio audience format in the third season, Ralph's father was shown to be an optometrist, Mickey Malph, played first by Alan Oppenheimer and then subsequently and more famously by Jack Dodson. Additionally, in the same first-season episode, Ralph's mother was named Hazel and was played by Gracia Lee; from the third season onward, however, she was referred to as Minnie Malph, and her character was never shown on camera again. Trivia *In the episode Hollywood: Part 2 Ralph's Middle name was revealed to be Hector. *He is one of the two characters (the other being Potsie) to be absent from the series finale. *He once kissed Joanie Cunningham in the episode, \\"Welcome Home\\" when he saw how beautiful she looked.

Potsie was a close friend of Richie Cunningham and Ralph Malph, who often spent time at Arnold's Drive In. He was characterized as being not very bright, somewhat gullible, socially clumsy, and in modern hindsight, very \\"square,\\" and because of it, he was frequently called a nerd by friends and acquaintances. However, Potsie is a very talented singer, and his musical endeavors became more central to the character as the series progressed. Potsie's extremely sour relationship with his father (never seen on camera) was a minor running joke on the series, with lines such as \\"I'm gonna talk to my dad too; will be the first time in six months!\\" Despite his shortcomings, he is a very kind and compassionate young man. If he messes up, he is usually the first to apologize. He is the first to jump in and support someone, especially his best friend Richie. In \\"The Deadly Dares\\" (Season 1, Episode 6), Potsie revealed how he got his nickname. He was asked, \\"Potsie Weber? What kind of name is this?\\" He replied, \\"They call me Potsie because when I was a young boy I used to like to make things with clay, and one day my mother called me Potsie.\\" In the pilot and early seasons, Potsie appeared with best friend Richie in the plots and appeared to be more savvy than him, a character trait that would be dropped by the writers. As the series progressed, and with the breakout character Arthur \\"Fonzie\\" Fonzarelli becoming close friends with Richie, Potsie became more commonly paired with Ralph in episodes, particularly when the pair rented an apartment together upon leaving high school. Like his friends, Potsie had his share of crushes on members of the opposite sex. His one steady girlfriend was Jennifer Jerome, played by Lorrie Mahaffey, who became Williams' wife from 1978 to 1986. The two met in college and shared a passion for singing, as evidenced by a duet they sang during their fraternity/sorority \\"pinning ceremony.\\" Her departure from the show was left unexplained. Potsie‚Äîwho eventually became assistant manager of Cunningham Hardware, the hardware store owned and operated by Richie's father, Howard Cunningham, throughout the series‚Äîwas apparently smart enough to get into medical school, and continued to work toward his goal of becoming a psychiatrist during the later years of the show's run. Potsie was one of the few characters to remain through the entire run of the show, even though his appearances became sporadic in the later years (Potsie appeared in only six episodes apiece in the final two seasons). As episodes began to shift toward Fonzie and the other characters, Potsie became more of a \\"dumb foil\\" for punchlines, usually from Fonzie or Mr. Cunningham. Although he is credited as a star during the opening credits of the series finale, \\"Passages,\\" he does not appear in the episode, other than in archive footage from previous episodes in the end montage.

The character of Chachi is the younger cousin of Fonzie, first appearing on Happy Days in season 5, beginning in 1977. His main love interest is Joanie Cunningham, with their relationship becoming a common theme for episodes in later seasons. Chachi shares a close relationship with his older cousin Fonzie. Many times, Fonzie stepped in and was able to be the older brother figure that Chachi needed. Chachi is also very close to his mother and his step-father Al. Together, Chachi and Joanie became aspiring musicians, and the spinoff series Joanie Loves Chachi was developed when Chachi's mother Louisa and new stepfather Al Delvecchio (the second owner of Arnold's) opened a new restaurant where Joanie and Chachi performed most of their music. Joanie and Chachi, along with some of his cousins and a character named Bingo, form a band, which was never named in the series. Joanie and Chachi returned to Happy Days when Joanie Loves Chachi was cancelled, and after them being broken up for a while in the final Happy Days episode, Joanie and Chachi marry. Development and reception After his initial appearance, the character of Chachi was expanded to a recurring character due to positive reception by fans, with Baio receiving up to 5,000 fan letters a week. The name was given by Ron Howard's long term friend, Andrew Smith. When the writers began developing the character of Chachi as a musician, Baio was against the idea because he \\"didn't sing,\\" but changed his mind based on the possibility of the fame associated with becoming a pop singer. His early catchphrase \\"Wah, wah, wah!\\" became popular with teenage girls. However, an attempt to spark a fashion trend by having Chachi frequently costumed with a bandana tied around his pant leg did not catch on. The character was named after a street where the show's creator Garry Marshall had lived. There have been false rumors that circulated claiming that the broadcast of Joanie loves Chachi had high viewership numbers in Japan and Korea because the name \\"Chachi\\" sounds like slang term for \\"penis\\" in those countries.

Picked up by his hometown team, the Calgary Flames on March 3, 2009, he was traded the next day to the Colorado Avalanche. Nycholat played in 5 games with the Avalanche before his season ended after suffering a concussion in a 3-1 loss to the San Jose Sharks on March 22, 2009. On July 2, 2009, Nycholat returned to the Vancouver Canucks, signing a one-year contract. He again linked up with the Canucks AHL affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, to provide a veteran presence. He scored 22 points in 37 games in an injury affected season before he was recalled to the Canucks to cover as an extra defenseman during the 2010 playoffs.

Cunningham is a fictional character played by Ron Howard on the 1970s TV sitcom Happy Days. He is the second son of Howard and Marion Cunningham, brother of Joanie Cunningham and Chuck Cunningham, and a friend of Fonzie, Ralph Malph, and Potsie Weber. Cunningham was the original lead character, but was supplanted by Fonzie when that character's popularity came to dwarf that of Cunningham and the other characters (however, Ron Howard and Henry Winkler (Fonzie) continued to share top billing in the opening credits of the show). Howard also played the character in several other shows: he appeared in guest appearances on Love, American Style and Laverne & Shirley, and was a regular on the animated series The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang. Character traits Richie Cunningham was the quintessential example of the All-American, 1950s teenager. He was exceedingly wholesome and, with his red hair and freckles, he bore more than a passing resemblance to Howdy Doody (as noted in the episode \\"The Howdy Doody Show\\"). Occasionally he got into trouble, usually in some scheme designed to attract women, but he did not seem to have a malicious bone in his body. Many of the episodes revolved around Richie's attempts to pick up women, and there was little that the clean-cut teen would not do to land a date. If buying a new car or joining a local gang was what it took, Richie was ready and willing to give it a shot. Whenever he was feeling particularly lucky‚Äîespecially when he spotted a prospective girlfriend‚Äîhe would sing Fats Domino's \\"I found my thrill ... on Blueberry Hill\\". When he became angry or annoyed, he would call any nemesis \\"bucko\\", even going as far as calling Fonzie this on several occasions. Richie also harbored an enormous ambition as a writer. He first wrote for the Jefferson High Bugle, and then later became a cub reporter for the Milwaukee Journal, although in the first-season episode \\"Because She's There\\" he told his blind date, Phyllis, that he wanted to eventually go to law school and become a lawyer. Throughout the series' run, Richie remained best friends with Fonzie, Ralph Malph, and Potsie Weber. He was always ready to help any of these friends if they got into trouble and also looked after his younger sister Joanie as she grew up. In the first season it was revealed that he and Potsie were best friends and grew up together since childhood; this was alluded to again in the seventh-season episode, \\"A Potsie Is Born.\\" After high school, Richie went to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee and soon met his girlfriend and future wife Lori Beth Allen in a library. Richie studied journalism at the university and always remained alert for any opportunity to further his writing career. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee; he, along with Ralph, served a short stint in the U.S. Army and was stationed in Greenland. While overseas, he married Lori Beth by telephone, with Fonzie standing in as proxy for the absent Richie. Lori Beth visited Richie in Greenland long enough to get pregnant. Their son was named Richie Jr. In the final season of the series, Richie (with Lori Beth and Richie Jr.) and Ralph returned home from the Army. Howard had gotten Richie a job as a reporter for the Milwaukee Journal, something Richie had always wanted, but Richie had a new dream of becoming a screenwriter. Richie moved to Hollywood with Lori Beth and his child to find work as a screenwriter. They later returned in the series finale for Joanie and Chachi's wedding.

It may also refer to literature written by people who write in the Swahili language. It is an offshoot of the Bantu culture. The first literary works date back to the beginning of the 18th century, when all Swahili literature was written in the Arabic script. Jan Knappert considered the translation of the Arabic poem Hamziya from the year 1652 to be the earliest Swahili written text. Starting in the 19th century, missionaries and orientalists introduced the Latin script for writing the Swahili language. Characteristics Swahili literature has been an object of research by many western scholars since the 19th century. There is a debate regarding objectivity as a few scholars tried to establish a canon of Swahili writing.Knappert, Jan (1980) - The canon of Swahili literature (B.C. Bloomfield (ed.), Middle East Studies and Libraries. London, 1980, 85-102.) One of the main characteristics of Swahili literature is the relative heterogeneity of the Swahili language. One can find works written in Kiamu, Kimvita, Kipemba, Kiunguja, Kimrima, Kimtang'ata, Ki-Dar es Salaam and Ki- Nairobi which are considered varieties of Swahili. Swahili literature has been sometimes characterized as Islamic by some western scholars such as Jan Knappert. This approach was criticized by some experts such as Alamin Mazrui and Ibrahim Noor Shariff. In fact, Swahili poetry has produced many secular works by such poets as Muyaka bin Ghassany and Muhammad Kijuma. Because of this orientalist exploration and interest in the Swahili culture and language, most of the theses made on the Swahili literature have been done outside of the native place.A. Ricard, (1995) Introduction √† ¬´ Comment √©crire pour le th√©√¢tre en suivant Aristote ? de Ebahim Hussein ¬ª, in : Alternatives th√©√¢trales n¬∞48, p.64. Classification Swahili literature is classified into three genres: Riwaya (the novel), tamthilia (drama/play) and ushairi (poetry). Scholars, however, cite the problem in the literary classification because the sense of orientation associated to genre does not work properly for Swahili literature. The lack of clear and decisive parameters for genres can be illustrated by the convergence of oral and written literary forms. Rajmund Ohly noted that the names of genres are not well defined while denominations are too vague to distinguish class divisions. Fiction Fiction in Swahili literature mainly consisted of oral narrative traditions. It was not until the 1940s that Swahili started to have a written fiction. Modern Swahili literature is a direct result of the standardization of Swahili. Previously, writers would write in a particular dialect to show their attachment to a certain dialect, such as Lamu, Tanga or Mombasa. The normalization of Swahili motivated writers, such as George Mhina and Lyndon Harries to promote the development of Swahili by creating a literary corpus.\\"The Swahili Novel - Challenging the Idea of 'Minor Literature' by Xavier Garnier Poetry Generally, Swahili poetry is derived from Arabic poetry. Swahili poetry or \\"ushairi\\" (from , poetry) is still written in the traditional manner. According to an account, the traditional poetry is created to be sung rather than read. It began in the northern Kenya coastal towns of Lamu and Pate before spreading to Tanga Region, Zanzibar and other nearby areas.ossrea.net - The Waswahili/Swahili Culture The poetic tradition is still alive today as pieces are often published in local newspapers and used in taraab songs and musical theater popular in Zanzibar and the Swahili coast. However, there are a few fundamental differences between the Swahili and Arabic poetry. With much of African influence, the two poems can hardly be compared for it is sui generis.\\\\- Poetry provides a remarkable outlet for personal expression in Swahili culture By Lyndon Harries Traditional poetry can be classified into different groups according to its form and content. It can be epic, lyrical or didactic, as well as religious or secular.vessella.it - Swahili Examples of narrative poetry, known as utenzi, include the Utendi wa Tambuka by Bwana Mwengo (dated to about 1728) and the Utenzi wa Shufaka. Use of Swahili prose was until recently practically restricted to utilitarian purposes. However, the traditional art of oral expression in poetry has produced a number of valuable works. It is characterized by its homiletic aspects, heroic songs, folklore ballads and humorous dialogues which accurately depict Swahili life, cultural beliefs and traditions. Because of the immediate historical aspect of the Swahili literature, especially in the 19th century, it is still a hard job to interpret many of the poems due to the lack of knowledge of the context in which the poem was written.

Created by Muneo Sait≈ç, Entei first appeared in the video games Pok√©mon Gold and Silver and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles, animated adaptations, and printed adaptations of the franchise. Known as the Volcano Pok√©mon, Entei is created during a volcanic eruption. It is one of the three \\"Legendary Beasts\\" featured in Pok√©mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. Entei was a main character in Pok√©mon 3: The Movie, where it is an illusion created by Unown. It also appears in Pok√©mon: Zoroark: Master of Illusions. Since its appearance in the Pok√©mon series, Entei has received generally mixed reception. It has been featured in several forms of merchandise, including figures, plush toys, the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game, and others. Entei is part of the Legendary beasts Trio. Design and characteristics Entei is one of the three \\"Legendary Beasts\\" designed by manga artist Muneo Sait≈ç that are featured in Pok√©mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. In an interview, Tsunekazu Ishihara, President of The Pok√©mon Company, described Entei as well as the other two Legendary Beasts Raikou and Suicune as appealing and exciting to both new and old players; he states that they would evoke memories for old players, while new players would be surprised by the random appearance of them. According to Pok√©mon legend, the Legendary Beasts were reincarnated by Ho-Oh from the spirits of three Pok√©mon which died in the fire that gave the Burned Tower its name. Entei is a Chinese guardian lion-like creature covered in brown fur with a long, thick mane covering its neck. It has gray plates surrounding the cape that makes it look as if smoke is coming out of a crater on its back. Entei has white paws, black cuff-like bands on its legs, and a red face with a white plate that resembles a Fu Manchu moustache on its face, and a three-pointed yellow crest on its forehead. Entei's head appears to resemble a kabuto, a samurai helmet. Myths say that it is born during a volcanic eruption, and that a new one is born along with each volcano. Entei is an embodiment of magma, and can launch searing fire from its mouth. Its roars can make volcanos erupt on another part of the globe. As a member of the legendary beast trio, Entei are constantly on the move with no set place to hang around in. Appearances In the video games Entei first appears in the Game Boy Color video games Pok√©mon Gold and Silver. Upon being approached by the player's character, Entei, along with its counterparts Raikou and Suicune, flee, traveling at incredible speeds across Johto. The three of them will randomly appear on a certain route, fleeing from battle at the first opportunity. It also reprises its role in Pok√©mon Crystal, a special edition of Gold & Silver, by roaming the Johto region. In the Crystal Version, a special theme music will play if the player encounters one of these three legendary beasts. The three of them later appear in Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen; however, only one of them appears in a single play through. If the player chooses Bulbasaur, Entei will appear in a similar fashion to how it appeared in Gold and Silver. In Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, Entei is encountered similarly to how it is in Gold and Silver. To promote the release of Pok√©mon Black and White, players could download the shiny Entei, Raikou, and Suicune from GameStop stores on various weeks in January and February 2011, which will activate the Zoroark event in the games. Entei is among the few Pok√©mon to learn Eruption or Extreme Speed, and is the only one besides Ho-Oh to learn Sacred Fire. Entei, along with its counterparts, appears as the final boss of Pok√©mon Ranger. It appears in the Super Smash Bros. series since Melee, using Fire Spin when summoned from a Pok√© Ball, and as a stage. It also appears as trophies in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. Melee, and in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and Wii U. Entei also appears as a Spirit in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate alongside Raikou and Suicune. It also appears in other spin-off titles, including Pok√©mon Trozei and all Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon titles. In other media An illusionary Entei was a main character in Pok√©mon 3: The Movie. After Molly Hale made a wish to the Unown, he served as a replacement father for her while her real father was trapped in the Unown dimension. He did everything Molly asked for, even kidnapping Ash's mother Delia Ketchum to be her mother. When Brock and Misty entered the tower Entei had created and placed Delia in, seeking to rescue her, Entei gave Molly Crystal Pok√©mon for her to battle them with. When Ash confronted him to rescue his mother, Entei quickly defeated his Totodile and Cyndaquil, and his Pikachu was only able to last longer without success. Even Ash's Charizard, who returned to him from the wild after learning of his distress, was only able to temporarily hold Entei off. However, when Entei was about to kill Charizard, Molly finally decided that she wanted to restore her life to how it was before. Accepting Molly's decision, Entei helped Pikachu and Charizard defeat the now out-of-control Unown before bidding Molly farewell, assuring her that he would always be in her dreams. Entei makes few appearances in the television series, with its only major appearance in the episode \\"Entei at Your Own Risk\\". Entei appears in the film Pok√©mon: Zoroark: Master of Illusions along with its two counterparts, Raikou and Suicune, as well as Celebi.https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/pokemon-movies/pokemon- zoroark-master-of-illusions-2011 The Official Pok√©mon Website. Retrieved 2020-09-04. Entei also appears in the film Pok√©mon the Movie: I Choose You! along with Raikou, Suicune, and Ho-Oh. Entei also appears in episode six of Pok√©mon Generations.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rga9wUdKRk8 The Official Pok√©mon YouTube Channel. In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, Entei and its counterparts are awakened by the character Yellow. They then race across Kanto and Johto in order to find trainers to defeat the Masked Man, the leader of Team Rocket in this manga, and rescue Ho-Oh. Entei first teams up with Blaine, and later Silver, eventually rescuing the characters Gold and Silver from the Masked Man. After he is defeated, the three legendary dogs depart. Promotion and reception Since its appearance in the Pok√©mon series, Entei has a received mixed to positive-leaning reception. It has been featured in several forms of merchandise, including figures, plush toys, the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game, and others. Entei's role in the film has been well-received; in his review of Pok√©mon 3: The Movie, Variety editor Robert Koehler stated that Entei was a \\"fine addition to the collection\\". In his review of Pok√©mon 3, USA Today editor Mike Clark described Entei as a \\"creature with a kind heart\\". Reviewer Eric D. Snider commented that while he does morally questionable acts during Pok√©mon 3: The Movie, he is not evil; merely attempting to fulfill the wishes of Pok√©mon 3 character Molly as a minister of the Unown. The Hollywood Reporter editor Michael Rechtshaffen compared Entei to the Beast from the Disney film Beauty and the Beast. IGN's \\"Pok√©mon of the Day Chick\\" stated that while it was somewhat cool in the film, Entei was the worst legendary Pok√©mon when it was released Pok√©mon Crystal. GamesRadar commented that they hated its appearance, describing it as a \\"mask-wearing mutt with garbage glued onto its back\\". Entei was included by MTV's Multiplayer Blog as one of the nominees in the \\"Greatest Canine In Video Game History\\" article, along with Raikou and Suicune. In the end however, none of them were chosen by readers or by the panel of judges. IGN also ranked Entei as the 18th best Pok√©mon.https://www.ign.com/top/pokemon/18 References External links * Entei on Bulbapedia * Entei on Pokemon.com Category:Pok√©mon species Category:Video game characters introduced in 1999 Category:Video game characters with fire or heat abilities ","title":"Entei"},{"id":"7169964","text":"Ch√¢bles (Dictionnaire-Dikchen√©ro: Fran√ßais-Patois/Pat√™-Franch√©.

Swedish football rules were a mix of the association football rules and the rugby football rules, most closely resembling the former.  History  The inspiration for Swedish football came from the English football, however, when ball games first were introduced in Sweden in the 1870s, the distinct rules of the different codes of football that had been adopted around ten years earlier in England were lost on the way over to Sweden, and no distinction was made between the codes. This caused confusion as some played the game with the round ball, while others played with the oval ball.J√∂nsson, p. 203. One of the first mentions of football being played was in an article in G√∂teborgs-Posten on 24 May 1874, where the readers were told that a gymnastics society had been founded in Gothenburg, and that the society also had played \\"a few football player games, which seemed to be of a very animated nature\\".Persson, p. 34. A year later, G√∂teborgs Bollklubb were founded, and the club had amongst other sports football on the programme. In 1880, the first set of rules for Swedish football were published in the book Fria Lekar. Anvisning till skolans tjenst by Lars Mauritz T√∂rngren. He had visited England to study sports and returned to write down his experiences in the book. He had misunderstood--or completely failed to notice--the codification of football made almost 20 years earlier, and his set of rules were thus a mix of association and rugby football, \\"a middle course\\", as he expressed it. The rules were hard to understand and did not come into widespread use.Persson, pp. 35-36. Instead, five years later in 1885, G√∂teborgs BK along with the leading clubs in Stockholm (Stockholms Bollklubb founded 1879) and Visby (Visby Bollklubb) met and established a set of rules that were to dominate the Swedish football scene in the following years.Persson, p. 37. The first association football match played on Swedish soil took place in Malm√∂ on 12 October 1890 when Kj√∏benhavns Boldklub visited the city and two of the teams of the Danish club played an exhibition match. But it was in Gothenburg that the modern football had its breakthrough, and the first national match was played 22 May 1892 between the two Gothenburg clubs √ñrgryte Idrottss√§llskap and Idrottss√§llskapet Lyckans Soldater. By 1895, association football had outrivaled the Swedish variant, with much help by the English, Scottish and Australian immigrant workers that introduced the modern code at their workplaces.J√∂nsson, p. 211.  Rules  The rules of Swedish football were much like the association rules, with two main exceptions, the players were allowed to catch the ball with their hands and run with it a short time before drop kicking it away again, and the goal did not have any crossbar. The number of rules written down by Lars Mauritz T√∂rngren were ten: #A goal is made by an honest full kick or drop kick of the ball from the hand; [To not be surprised, a keeper is positioned at the goal. He can, after order by the captain, be changed during the game.] or an honest bulley which brings the ball through all obstacles between the goal posts. Sometimes a certain height is prescribed which the ball must pass over. #The area or the field for the play shall be marked by sidelines. When the ball is kicked outside these boundaries, any competitor may kick him back perpendicular into the field at the point where he passed out from the field. #A player who is behind the ball, i.e. closer to the home of the opposite team than his teammate at the moment he kicked the ball, is out of play and may not participate except in agreement with the following rule #A player who, according to the preceding rule, is out of play is not allowed to kick the ball or hinder anyone from doing this until the ball has been touched by someone of the opposite team, after which he is allowed participate like before. #A player who has honestly got hold of the ball, either through a catch or after the first bounce, may run with the same a short part with the intention to gain an opportunity for a drop kick or a punt. #Every player of the opposite team may use lawful ways to hinder him who has the ball, to drop kick or make a full punt. #To take or hold someone is under no conditions allowed during any part of the game. #Hitting, kicking and tripping is not allowed. #At the start of the game the captains of both sides shall between themselves agree how long the game shall be played. #At the agreed time, independent of what phase the game is in, one of the captains shall yell \\"finished game\\", and the play shall immediately be stopped.Persson, p. 36.

Location Eldora is one of a few Colorado ski resorts on the east side of the continental divide. It is about west of Boulder and about from downtown Denver. The Ski-n-Ridehttp://www.rtd-denver.com/skiNRide.shtml bus (Route N), operated by RTD, runs between Boulder and the ski area seven times daily during ski season and serves as easy transportation from town to mountain. The ski area was founded in 1962 and has proven popular partly due to skiers not having to use the extremely busy I-70 to reach the resort. The summit of the area is at above sea level on Bryan Mountain, with a 1600-foot lift served vertical drop. The slopes face primarily north and east, and the main base area is at . The resort caters mostly to day skiers and snowboarders, although some overnight accommodations are available in Nederland, and many hotel rooms are available in Boulder. In addition to alpine skiing, the Eldora Nordic Center also includes 40 km of cross-country skiing and snowshoeing trails, as well as rentals, lessons and packages. Although Eldora is small compared to some of the bigger resorts in Colorado, the terrain variety is well known and challenging. There are beginner-friendly trails located on Little Hawk Mountain, intermediate and advanced trails on Challenge Mountain through Indian Peaks, and expert terrain is found in Corona Bowl and the West Ridge trail, which varies from 45 to 70% slope.Eldora Master Plan Eldora Mountain Resort 2011 Master Plan Given its location along the Divide, Eldora can get some powerful winds; for example, the area had to shut down for most of a day in late 2019 due to hurricane-force winds. After a brief campaign to solicit patron feedback in 2010, an updated master plan was published for 2011. Among the main objectives listed are lift replacements and additions, as well as terrain improvements. History Eldora was first conceived in 1961 when four men purchased a 400-acre parcel of land from the Forest Service near Nederland. This land consists of the base-area lodge and the parking lot. A road from Nederland was constructed the following year along with two T-bars. To stay competitive with many of the other front-range ski areas (all of which are now defunct, with the exception of Squaw Pass, since renamed Echo Mountain Park), a lodge was erected and the road was regraded. The resort installed their first chairlift, Little Hawk, in 1967. The lift, which was constructed by Miner-Denver, still runs today and is the oldest operating chairlift in Colorado. In 1973, two more double chairlifts were installed: Cannonball, which paralleled the T-bar on the main mountain, and Corona, which opened a new area to the north. An additional two double chairlifts, Caribou and Sundance, were constructed by Lift Engineering in the late 1970s, on the beginner hill. Beginning in 1979, the resort started losing money, in part because the construction of the Eisenhower Tunnel on Interstate 70 made it more convenient to reach the larger ski areas west of the Continental Divide. The resort stayed open until 1986, when it closed from the 1986‚Äì1987 season because of ownership issues. When the resort reopened the following season, the new management included the former president of Copper Mountain. In 1989, the Corona Bowl, which had been left abandoned for years, reopened. The bowl was named after an alternative name for Rollins Pass, the mountain pass used by the Denver and Salt Lake Railway to traverse the Continental Divide from 1904 to 1928 prior to the opening of the Moffat Tunnel. The right-of-way for the Rollins Pass route can be seen from the top of Corona. In 1992, Challenge, a triple chairlift purchased from Sun Valley in Idaho, was installed parallel to Cannonball. Two fixed-grip quad chairs were installed in 1998: one which replaced the original Corona lift, and another one just east of it, Indian Peaks, which opened 150 new acres of terrain.History of Eldora Ski Area. In 2013, it was announced that Eldora Mountain Resort would be added to Vail Resorts' Epic Pass for the 2013‚Äì2014 year. In 2014, it was announced that Eldora Mountain Resort would leave the Vail Resorts' Epic Pass and join Winter Park & Copper Mountain's Rocky Mountain Super Pass Plus] for the 2014‚Äì2015 year.Eldora joins Winter Park ‚Äì Copper Mountain Rocky Mountain Super Pass Plus. In 2016, it was announced that Powdr Corporation had acquired Eldora Mountain Resort and rebranded their terrain park as a Woodward facility. In the 2017/2018 Season, Eldora Mountain Resort installed the Alpenglow chairlift, a new high-speed detachable six person chairlift. The resort started the 2018/2019 ski season on Wednesday, November 7th, its earliest opening day in more than two decades (and roughly 12 days earlier than the average opening day since 2010). In late 2019, Eldora submitted plans to add to its 1,600 parking spaces an additional 800 spaces, expanding an existing lot and creating a new one. In mid-March 2020, with the 2020 COVID-19 coronavirus deemed a pandemic, Eldora discontinued free RTD tickets as well as the free shuttle bus for the rest of the season and cancelled events and live music through the end of the month.

He is mainly known for his altarpieces, but his outstanding achievements are large decorative frescoes for the Sacro Monte di Varese and the Sacro Monte di Varallo.Alberto Bertoni. \\"Morazzone.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 7 Feb. 2017 Life He was born in Morazzone, near Varese, Lombardy, the son of a mason, who soon after his birth moved to Rome. There he was influenced by Ventura Salimbeni and Cavalier D'Arpino and began to work in a Mannerist style. In Rome he painted some canvases and also his first frescoes (Adoration by the Magi and a Visitation) in San Silvestro in Capite (1596). His style also shows exposure to another pupil of D'Arpino, Caravaggio. His depictions of martyrdom and ecstasy are imbued with the morbid religiosity characteristic of Lombardy in his age. Adoration of the Magi He returned to Milan in 1597. In Lombardy, he painted frescoes for the Cappella del Rosario in San Vittore in Varese (1599), and worked in some of the Sacri Monti of the Alps. This activity began with the Ascent to Calvary (1602‚Äì1606) chapel in the Sacro Monte of Varallo where he was influenced by Gaudenzio Ferrari and developed a more dramatic style. In 1608-1609 he completed the Flagellation chapel in the Sacro Monte of Varese then returned to Varallo for the Ecce Homo chapel (1610‚Äì13). Last of this serie is the Porziuncola chapel (1616‚Äì20) in the Sacro Monte di Orta. His other frescoes include the Cappella della Buona Morte in San Gaudenzio in Novara and the depiction of some of the Prophets frescoed for the nave of the Piacenza Cathedral, completed after his death by the Bolognese painter Guercino. The Martyrdom of Saints Secunda and Rufina. Collaboration between Il Morazzone, Procaccini and GB Crespi (1620-1625) He also painted altarpieces for many churches in Northern Italy and canvases for private collectors. He collaborated with Giovanni Battista Crespi (Il Cerano) and Giulio Cesare Procaccini in the painting of the Quadroni of San Carlo Borromeo for the Duomo of Milan. Among the pupils and followers of il Morazzone were Francesco Cairo, Stefano & Gioseffo Danedi, Isidoro Bianchi, Giovanni Paolo & Giovanni Battista Recchi, Paolo Caccianiga, Tommaso Formenti, Giambatista Pozzi, and Cristoforo Martinolli della Rocca.Le glorie dell'arte lombarda, by Luigi Malvezzi, 1882, page 248.

The club is based in the small town of Berrigan located in the Riverina district of New South Wales. History The Berrigan Football Club's first recorded match was against Cobram, at Cobram in 1891 and initially competed in the Murray Border Football Association in 1895 and 1896, then competed in the Southern Riverina Football Association (SRFA) from 1905 to 1930. Berrigan won ten SRFA premierships against teams such as Finley, Leniston, Tocumwal and Jerilderie. In 1931 and 1932, Berrigan, Finley and Nathalia applied to join the Murray Football League, but were knocked back on the grounds of excessive travel for the other competing club. Berrigan and Finley remained in the SRFA in 1931, but in 1932, Jerilderie went into recess and Oaklands and Urana pulled out of the SRFA, which saw this competition ultimately fold up. This left Berrigan and Finley without an official competition to play in, in 1932. Berrigan, Finley and Jerilderie did played in the SRFA junior competition from 1930 to 1932. In 1933 Berrigan joined the Murray Football League and played in ten grand finals and won five premierships against old time Murray Football League teams such as - Numurkah, Nathalia, Cobram and Tocumwal. It was between 1980 and 2002 that Berrigan struggled to win games in the Murray Football League and started to fall behind the other teams and looked like folding at one stage, but through the use of the strong community of the town, the club decided to join the Picola & District Football League. Berrigan struggled to win games until the 2009 season when the Picola League split into two divisions, which left Berrigan competing against teams such as Jerilderie, Blighty, Deniliquin, Strathmerton, Picola United, Mathoura, Yarroweyah and Wunghnu in the North West conference. Berrigan made the top three in the 2009 season and made it to its first grand final in 29 years, however the saints fell short against their rivals Jerilderie by three points. In the 2011 season, Berrigan were premiers in the PDFL. Not only did the saints host this grand final but had sweet revenge over Jerilderie by 34 points. It is through these previous grand finals and Murray League football that Berrigan and Jerilderie have developed a fierce rivalry. Today the Berrigan Saints play their games at one of the finest Recreational Reserves in the district, Having their club rooms completely re-built and the change room renovated, the saint are able to host large crowds and grand finals.

The game was released in arcades in 2000 and was ported to the Nintendo Gamecube and Xbox in 2002 by Point of View and for Game Boy Advance in 2004 by DSI Games and Namco. Gameplay The player races against time and another psychotic cab driver through New York City to earn money. The game is divided into four difficulties, each of which contains three different levels (with the exception of \\"Dusk and Wired\\", which only contains one). If the player manages to beat the rival cab in all three levels of a difficulty, they are taken to a bonus stage with the only available route being all of the Risky Routes. At the end of a stage, the player's score is based on the amount of time it took to reach the destination, the cab's condition, the rival being beaten, the number of Turbo powerups obtained, and the number of Risky Routes traversed. Unlike many racing games, the horn actually has a functional use of making (most) mobile vehicles move aside. If the player runs out of time before completing the stage, they encounter a continue screen. A 10-second countdown will be then given to the player if they wish to try again. After it expires, the game is over. However, on the console version's Head-to-Head mode, there is no continue feature. After time runs out, the game automatically ends. Reception Reviews for Smashing Drive were generally negative for the Xbox and Gamecube versions and mixed for the Game Boy Advance version. Jon Thompson of AllGame rated the arcade version three stars out of five and wrote, \\"The visuals of Smashing Drive are certainly decent, although they can't qualify as top-notch in this day and age.\\" Thompson also wrote, \\"It isn't the most amazing racer ever made, but it has enough interesting ideas and strong enough execution to make it something different in the arcade world. It's tough, it's attractive, and overall, it's fun.\\" Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame rated the GameCube version two stars out of five and wrote, \\"Namco's history of delivering feature packed arcade ports to home consoles comes crashing to a halt with Smashing Drive [...]. Smashing Drive was probably not an easy game to port due to so much happening on the screen, and to its credit, the game never bogs down. Unfortunately, the darn thing never speeds up either, so each race feels like it takes place underwater. The graphics are colorful but simple, lacking the detailed textures expected from a GameCube title. [...] Succeeding in Smashing Drive is a simple matter of memorizing the courses, knowing where each turbo is located, and learning the best shortcuts. Once that's done, there's very little replay value.\\" Fran Mirabella III of IGN gave the GameCube version a 3.4 rating and wrote, \\"The only added benefit [from the arcade version] is multiplayer, and that also dries up speedily. Smashing Drive is a neat concept, but fails pretty miserably in execution. It's just far too linear to offer up any compelling gameplay. There are no permanent upgrades for your cab, no cars to unlock, and only one final bonus destination to surprise you.\\" Mairabella called the soundtrack, \\"Definitely one of the most god-awful soundtracks ever created. The collection of about four or five songs is downright nauseating. [...] We've asked ourselves if anyone could actually like this music. Even the composer -- dare we call them that -- would have to be somewhat crazed to think he/she created something anyone would want to listen to.\\" Mirabella also criticized the game's outdated graphics, and concluded that \\"after about a half-hour or so I had nearly beaten the game and found most of the shortcuts. It's an arcade game port. It's not a title I feel is made for the home console market.\\" Aaron Boulding of IGN gave the Xbox version a 3.3 rating out of 10 and criticized it for not taking advantage of the console's graphical capability. Boulding also criticized the game's animation, writing, \\"When you do see pedestrians scurrying out of the way, they look like tiny flat action figures waddling to safety.\\" Boulding also said the game included the, \\"Worst soundtrack ever\\", calling it \\"pure synthesized, acid-washed crap.\\" Boulding also wrote, \\"The crashes and other sound effects aren't very effective and the attempt at surround sound is laughable.\\" Gerald Villoria of GameSpot rated the GameCube and Xbox versions a 3.5 rating out of 10. Villoria criticized the GameCube version's graphics and generic sound effects, and wrote that \\"the worst culprit is the game's music, which is just as disappointing as the game's short life span. There are three grungy garage rock songs in total, and all three are of absolutely abysmal production value. A single song loops every 30 seconds or so for each level--listening to the same horrible song over and over again for 20 minutes will practically be enough to drive you mad.\\" Villoria also said \\"few players will get more than a couple of hours' worth of enjoyment out of the home version.\\" Villoria said the Xbox version \\"essentially shares all the failings displayed in the GameCube port\\". Frank Provo of GameSpot rated the Game Boy Advance version a 6.1 and said that \\"for a variety of reasons, it doesn't seem like such a bad game\\" in comparison to the GameCube and Xbox versions, despite duplicating the same \\"look and feel\\". Provo said, \\"Nothing about the music or sound effects is particularly noteworthy [...]. And while the vocal lyrics within the game's music clips are unique, they're not exactly spicy or memorable.\\" Provo concluded that it \\"isn't a great racing game, and it certainly won't eat up weeks of your time, but it is fine for what it is: a simple, graphically impressive racer that can be played in short bursts.\\" Provo also noted in his review, \\"As an arcade game, Smashing Drive was something of a laughing stock. Apart from the fact that it was a restrictive knockoff of Sega's Crazy Taxi, albeit with weapons, the ancient polygon graphics looked like they were rendered on whatever home video game console was popular in 1996--which wasn't so flattering for an arcade game that was produced in 2000.\\" References External links * Category:2000 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Gaelco games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:GameCube games Category:Namco games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in Spain Category:Video games scored by Joan Sanmarti Category:Video games set in New York City Category:Xbox games Category:Destination Software games ","title":"Smashing Drive"},{"id":"7170073","text":"This article shows U.S. Census totals for New Haven County, Connecticut, broken down by municipality, from 1900 to 2000. Like most areas of New England, New Haven County is (and has been at all times since well before the 20th century) entirely divided into incorporated municipalities. There is no unincorporated territory. There are three types of municipalities in Connecticut: towns, boroughs and cities. As in the other New England states, towns are the basic unit of municipal government. Boroughs overlay towns and assume responsibility for some municipal services within their boundaries. Boroughs are not found in any of the other New England states, and are not very common in Connecticut today, although they were somewhat more numerous in the past. A number of boroughs have disincorporated over the years, choosing to revert to full town control. Cities also overlay towns. This is different from the other New England states, where cities are a different type of municipality equivalent to a town (this difference is related to cities having originally developed in Connecticut from the borough model). Most current cities are coextensive with their parent town, however, such that the entire municipality functions as a city. In practice, these cities are really no different from cities in the other New England states. It is also possible for a city in Connecticut to overlay part, but not all, of a town. There are currently only one or two examples, but it was a more common arrangement in the past. Many of today‚Äôs coextensive cities were non-coextensive at one time. As with boroughs, a number of non-coextensive cities have also disincorporated over the years, choosing to revert to full town control. The main tables below show municipalities at the town level. For any census, adding up the totals for each town should yield the county total. In cases where a community encompassed a coextensive city, the tables in the New England Historical U.S. Census Totals series mark the community as a city. In cases where a town included a non-coextensive city, the total shown below represents the entire town, including but not limited to the city. A separate section follows with population totals for boroughs and non-coextensive cities. For more information on the New England municipal system, see New England town.

within the town of the same name *The borough of Guilford, within the town of the same name *The borough of Naugatuck, coextensive with the town of the same name *The borough of Wallingford, within the town of the same name *The borough of West Haven, within the town of Orange *The city of Meriden, within the town of the same name *The city of Waterbury, within the town of the same name In addition to the above, there were three more cities in the county which had already been made coextensive with their parent town (New Haven, Ansonia and Derby). In 1902, Waterbury, which at the time was by far the largest non-coextensive city in the state, finally became coextensive with its parent town. The borough and town of Naugatuck have been coextensive since at or shortly after the borough's incorporation. Naugutuck is the only borough in Connecticut which has ever been coextensive with its parent town. A sixth borough, Woodmont (within the town of Milford), was incorporated in 1903. The following changes have occurred since then: *1911 ‚Äì The borough of West Haven disincorporated *1922 ‚Äì The city of Meriden became coextensive with its parent town *1941 ‚Äì The borough of Guilford disincorporated *1958 ‚Äì The borough of Wallingford disincorporated *The borough of Branford disincorporated sometime between 1970 and 1980 The 1910 and 1920 Census reports make reference to a borough called Fair Haven East, which is stated to be within the city of New Haven in 1910, and within the city of New Haven and town of East Haven in 1920. Its population was not tabulated in either census, apparently because boroughs and cities both fall within the same census category (incorporated places), and Census methodology of the time would not allow one to be within another. Fair Haven East is not mentioned in the 1900 or 1930 reports, and no details are provided on how or when it was created or ceased to exist. 1900 *Waterbury (city) 45,859 *Meriden (city) 24,296 *Naugatuck (borough) 10,541 *Wallingford (borough) 6,737 *West Haven (borough) 5,247 *Branford (borough) 2,473 *Guilford (borough) 1,512 1910 *Meriden (city) 27,265 *Naugatuck (borough) 12,722 *Wallingford (borough) 8,690 *West Haven (borough) 8,543 *Branford (borough) 2,560 *Guilford (borough) 1,608 *Woodmont (borough) 194 1920 *Meriden (city) 29,867 *Naugatuck (borough) 15,051 *Wallingford (borough) 9,648 *Branford (borough) 2,619 *Guilford (borough) 1,612 *Woodmont (borough) 220 1930 *Naugatuck (borough) 14,315 *Wallingford (borough) 11,170 *Branford (borough) 2,365 *Guilford (borough) 1,880 *Woodmont (borough) 531 1940 *Naugatuck (borough) 15,388 *Wallingford (borough) 11,425 *Branford (borough) 2,235 *Guilford (borough) 1,986 *Woodmont (borough) 748 1950 *Naugatuck (borough) 17,455 *Wallingford (borough) 11,994 *Branford (borough) 2,552 *Woodmont (borough) not reported 1960 *Naugatuck (borough) 19,511 *Branford (borough) 2,371 *Woodmont (borough) not reported 1970 *Naugatuck (borough) 23,034 *Woodmont (borough) 2,114 *Branford (borough) 2,080 1980 *Naugatuck (borough) 26,456 *Woodmont (borough) 1,797 1990 *Naugatuck (borough) 30,625 *Woodmont (borough) 1,770 2000 *Naugatuck (borough) 30,989 *Woodmont (borough) 1,711 Note: The population of the borough of Woodmont was not reported separately from the town of Milford in the 1950 and 1960 Censuses. It is not clear why. Notes 1970 Census The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 1970 census totals subsequent to their initial release. The 1970 total for New Haven County was originally reported as 761,337; and for the town of East Haven, 25,028. The totals were later revised to those shown in the list above. In addition, as had been the case with the 1950 and 1960 Censuses, the 1970 Census did not initially report the population for the borough of Woodmont separately from the city of Milford. The revision included a separate total for Woodmont. (The villages of Jericho, Vermont and Newbury, Vermont display a similar pattern.) 2000 Census The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 2000 census totals subsequent to their initial release. The 2000 total for the city of New Haven was originally reported as 123,626; and for the town of Hamden, 56,913. The totals were later revised to those shown in the list above. This was apparently done to correct assignment errors between these municipalities; the collective population of the two is the same using either set of figures, so the county total was not affected.

It has a capacity of 6,500 and had lights and FieldTurf installed in the summer of 2007. It is part of the Ryland Milner Complex which includes Bearcat Arena in the Uel W. Lamkin Activity Center (formerly \\"Lamkin Gym\\") which is where the college basketball team plays, Martindale Gymnasium (the original school gymnasium), and the Robert P. Foster Aquatic Center. The field is surrounded by the Herschel Neil Track (named for a university student and rival of Jesse Owens who held several NCAA track records in the 1930s). The playing field itself is called Tjeerdsma Field in honor of the school's winning football coach Mel Tjeerdsma. History The stadium originally opened in 1917 as Memorial Stadium, which replaced a field on the north side of the Administration Building of the college which had started operations in 1906. In 1961 it was named Rickenbrode Stadium for long-time university business manager and athletic booster William Rickenbrode. Through the 1970s the stadium which had lights was the home field for the Maryville High School Spoofhounds and was used as a venue for various civic functions including the annual 4 July display. In the 1970s Northwest began construction of a new stadium on the west side of the campus. However funds ran out as Northwest began competing for funding with the newly founded Missouri Western State University 40 miles south in St. Joseph, Missouri. In 1988 the State of Missouri under Governor John Ashcroft announced plans to close Northwest altogether. Following spirited opposition, the plans were reversed and Northwest found it in a position of having to aggressively find ways to differentiate it from its rival if it wanted to survive. In 1994 Mel Tjeerdsma, who had a stellar playoff coaching reputation from his jobs at Northwestern College (Iowa) and Austin College, started coaching at Northwest. The first season on the job, his team went 0-11. In 1996 they made it to the NCAA Division II playoffs. However because of poor conditions they were unable to play home games for which they were entitled. In 1998 and 1999 Northwest won back-to-back Division II championships in games broadcast nationally on ESPN. Interest in the university immediately soared with the St. Louis Rams flying the team to a championship game and the Bearcats playing one game a year at Arrowhead Stadium. Partially as a result, Missouri finally managed to finish the long-stalled plan to create a four-lane highway between St. Joseph and Maryville. In 2000 the east visitor grandstand was completely rebuilt, funded by students of the university. Following the 2001 season, the west home grandstand was demolished (with temporary bleachers put in place for the 2002 season). In 2003 the stadium‚Äîwith its new west grandstand with chairback and railback seating‚Äîwas unveiled. During the renovation the stadium lights were taken down (and would be ultimately put up in 2007). The new stadium has ten luxury boxes and the scoreboard has video replay features. The video board is one of the few that offer instant replay at the NCAA Division II level. The entire $5 million overhaul was privately paid for by alumni and boosters. The stadium was renamed Bearcat Stadium in 2004 to honor the contributions of the many individuals and organizations who worked in the fundraising efforts. On December 9, 2006, the stadium hosted the first nationally televised home game in the school's and Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association's history when Northwest defeated Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania in the semifinals of NCAA Division II football. The game was broadcast on ESPNU which brought in lights (previously used by Musco Lighting at Ohio Stadium during the Michigan - Ohio State game) to illuminate the field.

It was published by Kannada University, Hampi in 1993. However, in reality it was on Ragamala Paintings as depicted in \\"Svarachudamani\\" authored by the Mummadi Krishna Raja Wodeyar. Similar set of Ragamala Paintings are also found in Sri Tattva-Nidhi. \\"Kamapithasana\\" (Setubandhasana) from Sritattvanidhi Another important work in this genre is by a Sanskrit scholar and hatha yoga student named Norman Sjoman. His 1996 book The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace presents the first English translation of a part of kautuka nidhi, the Sritattvanidhi, which includes instructions for and illustrations of 122 postures, illustrated by stylized drawings of a yogini in a topknot and loincloth. Some of these poses‚Äîwhich include handstands, backbends, foot-behind-the-head poses, Lotus variations, and rope exercises‚Äîare familiar to modern practitioners (although most of the Sanskrit names are different from the ones they are known by today). But they are far more elaborate than anything depicted in other pre- twentieth-century texts. It also describes the origins of some asanas from a gymnastics exercise manual of the late 19th century, the Vyayama Dipika. Influence on modern yoga Gajasana, Elephant Pose, a forerunner of Downward Dog Pose In his 1996 book, Sjoman asserts that the influential yoga teacher Krishnamacharya, who did much to create modern yoga as exercise, was influenced by the Sritattvanidhi, which includes 122 asanas, some possibly based on gymnastics.

He served as head football coach at Kansas State University (1967‚Äì1974), the University of Louisville (1975‚Äì1979), and Tulane University (1980‚Äì1982), compiling a career college football record of 75‚Äì98‚Äì2. In 1992, he coached the New Orleans Night of the Arena Football League, tallying a mark of 0‚Äì10. Early life and playing career Gibson was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama. He graduated from Florida State University in 1955, where he received two letters playing as an offensive guard for the Seminoles. He entered the coaching profession immediately after graduation. Coaching career Gibson's first football coaching position was at South Georgia College in 1956, a position he held for three years. At South Georgia, Gibson served as the sole assistant under head coach Bobby Bowden, who had grown up in the same Birmingham neighborhood as Gibson. Following his stint at South Georgia, Gibson returned to his alma mater Florida State to work as an assistant coach from 1959 to 1963. Before leaving Florida State, Gibson also helped to get Bowden hired as an assistant at that school, where Bowden eventually became head coach. Gibson next served as defensive coordinator at the University of Tennessee from 1964 to 1966. Kansas State Prior to the 1967 football season, Gibson was hired as head coach at Kansas State University. When he was hired, the school was mired in a 21-game winless streak and had not enjoyed a winning season since 1954, but he promised the Wildcat fans, \\"We gonna win!\\" Gibson's first season at Kansas State ended with a 1‚Äì9 record, but the next year the team showed significant improvement. Behind sophomore quarterback Lynn Dickey, the 1968 squad earned the school's first national ranking in the AP Poll and shut out Nebraska in Lincoln for the school's first victory over NU in a decade. That same season, Kansas State also moved into a new football stadium. Gibson truly began to deliver on his promise to win during the 1969 season. The team started 2‚Äì0 before second- ranked Penn State arrived to play in Manhattan, Kansas. Penn State ultimately finished the 1969 season undefeated, but Kansas State provided them with one of their toughest tests in a 17‚Äì14 game. Following the loss to Penn State, Kansas State reeled off three straight victories, including a win over defending conference champion Kansas in the first Governor's Cup game, and a 59‚Äì21 blowout of #11 Oklahoma, which was Kansas State's first win over the Sooners since 1934 and the largest loss in Oklahoma's history. K-State would not beat another ranked team until 1993, when Bill Snyder lead the team to victory over Oklahoma again. After the 1969 Oklahoma game, Kansas State sported a 5‚Äì1 record and a #12 national ranking in the AP Poll. This was the high-point of the season, as the team lost its last four games to finish 5‚Äì5. Nevertheless, in only his third season, Gibson had dramatically improved the program. Prior to the 1970 season, Gibson was named the pre-season national coach of the year by Playboy Magazine. The season that followed was up-and- down but ultimately disappointing despite a winning record and a second-place finish in the Big Eight Conference. Kansas State won at Oklahoma and defeated eighth-ranked Colorado, but the season was soured by non-conference defeats and a blow-out loss to Nebraska in the final conference game of the year with the conference title on the line. The worst news of the season came on October 7, 1970, when the conference slapped the Wildcats with three years' probation for recruiting violations. Most seriously, the Wildcats were banned from bowl games and live television for one year. Gibson later said that the sanctions‚Äîthe result of what he called an immature quarrel with Kansas coach Pepper Rodgers‚Äîdestroyed his program. Kansas State stagnated following the 1970 season, with Gibson's teams hovering below the .500 mark for the next four years. Quarterback Steve Grogan provided some excitement during the 1973 and 1974 seasons, but it was never enough to provide a winning record. Gibson decided to leave Kansas State following the 1974 season with a final record of 33‚Äì52. Louisville and Tulane Following his term at Kansas State, Gibson served as head football coach at the University of Louisville from 1975 to 1979. His record at Louisville was 25‚Äì29‚Äì2, and in 1977 he took the school to the third bowl game in its history, the second Independence Bowl. While at Louisville, Gibson coined the nickname \\"Red Rage\\" for the football team, a related carry over from the \\"Purple Pride\\" at K-State. While no longer used as a moniker for the football team, the term Red Rage has been used over the years for various organizations. Currently, the U of L Marching Band is introduced as the \\"RED RAGE!\\" Marching Band. NFL notables from Louisville during Gibson's tenure include Otis Wilson of the Chicago Bears and Dwayne Woodruff of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Joe Jacoby of the Washington Redskins and Mark Clayton of the Miami Dolphins. From 1980 to 1982 Gibson coached at Tulane University, posting an overall record of 17‚Äì17. Gibson defeated LSU in two out of his three seasons at Tulane and also coached the Green Wave to an appearance in the 1980 Hall of Fame Classic. While at Tulane, Gibson was known as \\"Vegas Vince\\" for his risk taking play calling. Awards Gibson was named the Big Eight Conference Coach of the Year in 1970. He was also selected to coach the North squad in the 1971 North‚ÄìSouth Shrine Game. Gibson is enshrined in the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame and the Kansas State University Athletics Hall of Fame. Death Gibson died in 2012 in Kenner, Louisiana after a battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. He was 78. Head coaching record College References Additional sources * Fitzgerald, Tim.

L. Lea in the English-dubbed and altered U.S. edit). The film was directed by Lee Doo-yong, though persistent misinformation claims that the movie was directed by Italian horror director Umberto Lenzi. The poster's artwork was very common among exploitation films at the time. Plot overview The opening sequence (which was filmed separately and added to the original South Korean film when the film was dubbed into English) shows Bruce Lee (played by an unknown imitator), leaping from his grave after it is struck by lightning. While this and the title imply a story involving Bruce Lee returning from the afterlife in order to do battle, the rest of the movie revolves around a plot that has nothing to do with Bruce Lee. Instead, it talks about a certain Wong Han, a Korean man trying to discover the truth behind the death of his brother, Han Ji-Hyeok. He travels to Los Angeles and allies himself with a woman named Suzanne. Han is harassed by a number of petty criminals and thugs in his attempt to find out the truth about his brother.

The following year, the Thundering Herd went undefeated at home and earned a #3 NCAA Division I-AA national ranking early in the season before fading to a 7‚Äì3‚Äì1 record.

Womble Bond Dickinson is a member of Lex Mundi, a global organization of independent law firms.Womble Bond Dickinson UK Locations  History  UK-based law firm Bond Dickinson LLP commenced trading on May 1, 2013. This alliance was a result of a merger between Dickinson Dees and Bond Pearce. Prior to the merger, Dickinson Dees (whose history dates back to 1786) registered as an LLP in 2006. Bond Pearce (founded in 1887) registered as an LLP in 2005. Womble Carlyle's history dates back to 1876 and was named after its early partners including B.S. Womble and Irving E. Carlyle. In January 2016, Womble Carlyle named Betty Temple chairwoman and CEO, and she became one of only a handful of women to sit at the helm of a large national law firm. Temple's appointment represented several milestones for Womble Carlyle. She became the youngest chairperson in the firm's 140-year history, the first chairperson to be located outside of the firm's original Winston-Salem office, and the first woman to lead the firm. As part of Womble Bond Dickinson, Temple is now US CEO and co-chair with UK Managing Partner, Jonathan Blair. Blair was named as one of the Hot 100 Leaders by The Lawyer in 2018. In March 2020, the firm laid off members of its workforce and reduced compensation for some attorneys and staff due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

These seizures often involve complex motor movements, such as hand clenching, arm raising/lowering, and knee bending. Vocalizations such as shouting, moaning, or crying are also common. ADNFLE is often misdiagnosed as nightmares. Attacks often occur in clusters and typically first manifest in childhood. There are four known loci for ADNFLE, three with known causative genes. These genes, CHRNA4, CHRNB2, and CHRNA2, encode various nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Œ± and Œ≤ subunits. Signs and symptoms ADNFLE is a partial epilepsy disorder characterized by brief violent seizures during sleep. Seizures are complex, consisting of arm and leg movements, fist clenching, and vocalizations such as yelling and moaning. These seizures often occur in clusters and can first manifest in childhood. Diagnosis is often initially incorrectly made as nightmares, night terrors, parasomnias and various psychiatric disorders. Causes While not well understood, it is believed that malfunction in thalamocortical loops plays a vital role in ADNFLE. The reasons for this belief are threefold. Firstly, thalamocortical loops are important in sleep and the frontal cortex is the origin of ADNFLE seizures. Secondly, both the thalamus and cortex receive cholinergic inputs and acetylcholine receptor subunits comprise the three known causative genes for ADNFLE. Thirdly, K-complex are almost invariably present at the start of seizures. It is thought that epilepsy is caused because these receptor subunits are expressed presynaptically by neurons that release the inhibitory transmitter GABA. Therefore, the mutation in the Œ±4 subunit could lead to reduced GABA release, causing hyperexcitability. Pathophysiology CHRNA4 The first mutation associated with ADNFLE is a serine to phenylalanine transition at position 248 (S248F), located in the second transmembrane spanning region of the gene encoding a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Œ±4 subunit. Using the numbering based on the human CHRNA4 protein, this mutation is called S280F. Receptors containing this mutant subunit are functional, but desensitize at a much faster pace compared to wild-type only receptors. These mutant containing receptors also recover from desensitization at a much slower rate than wild- type only receptors. These mutant receptors also have a decreased single channel conductance than wild-type and have a lower affinity for acetylcholine. Also importantly, this mutation along with the others in CHRNA4 produce receptors less sensitive to calcium. The second discovered ADNFLE mutation was also in CHRNA4. This mutation, L259_I260insL, is caused by the insertion of three nucleotides (GCT) between a stretch of leucine amino acids and an isoleucine. As with the S248F mutation, the L259_I260insL mutation is located in the second transmembrane spanning region. Electrophysiological experiments have shown that this mutant is tenfold more sensitive to acetylcholine than wild-type. Calcium permeability, however is notably decreased in mutant compared to wild-type containing receptors. Furthermore, this mutant shows slowed desensitization compared to both wild-type and S248F mutant receptors. Also located in the second transmembrane spanning region, the S252L mutation has also been associated with ADNFLE. This mutant displays increased affinity for acetylcholine faster desensitization compared to wild- type receptors. The most recently discovered mutation in CHRNA4 associated with ADNFLE is T265M, again located in the second transmembrane spanning segment. This mutation has been little studied and all that is known is that it produces receptors with increased sensitivity to acetylcholine and has a low penetrance. 15q24 Some families have been shown to not have mutations in CHRNA4 and, furthermore, to show no linkage around it. Instead some of these families show strong linkage on chromosome 15 (15q24) near CHRNA3, CHRNA5, and CHRNB4. Causative genes in this area are still unknown. CHRNB2 Three mutations have been found in the gene CHRNB2, which encodes an acetylcholine receptor Œ≤2 subunit. Two of these mutations, V287L and V287M, occur at the same amino acid, again in the second transmembrane spanning region. The V287L mutation results in receptors that desensitize at a much slower rate compared to wild-type. The V287M mutant displays a higher affinity for acetylcholine when compared to wild-type receptors. As with the mutations in CHRNA4, these mutants lead to receptors less sensitive to calcium. The other known mutation in CHRNB2 is I312M, located in the third membrane- spanning region. Receptors containing these mutant subunits display much larger currents and a higher sensitivity to acetylcholine than wild-type receptors. CHRNA2 Recently, the I279N mutation has been discovered in the first transmembrane spanning segment of CHRNA2, which encodes a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Œ±2 subunit similar to the nAChR Œ±4 encoded by CHRNA4. This mutant shows a higher sensitivity to acetylcholine and unchanged desensitization compared to wild-type. Diagnosis Diagnosis is typically made upon patient history, although EEG recordings can be confirmatory if they occur during attacks. Management Anti-epileptic drugs are normally used to combat ADNFLE. These drugs are discussed in the main epilepsy article.

It was built by Sally Corporation, a popular dark ride manufacturer. The ride experience theme was sports, and the building exterior was themed on the Hersheypark Arena which is directly behind, outside Hersheypark. This ride is not to be confused with the free Hershey's Chocolate World tour ride. The ride replaced a building which housed the park's first aid and ride department offices, as well as a practice skating rink. On August 2, 2018, Hersheypark announced the addition of Reese's Cupfusion for the Summer of 2019, which will replace Reese's Xtreme Cup Challenge. Reese's Xtreme Cup Challenge closed on September 3, 2018.  Story  The ride's \\"backstory\\" featured two sports stars, Sonny Palaski, a pro surfer, and Kip Callahan, an all-star quarterback. Sonny started in California as a surfing star, appearing on the cover of Surf Dude Magazine 36 times. When interviewed about what made him so good, he claims that before going to the beach, he would have a few spoonfuls of peanut butter. Kip started in Western Pennsylvania as quarterback for the Allegheny High School Hawks. His stardom was due to him having a Hershey's chocolate bar before every game. They were brought together in 1998 to host the Xtreme Games. Kip's son, Zack, was competing as a snowboarder, and Sonny's daughter, Skyler, was an in-line skater. The two became friends and eventually started dating. Their parents were elated, and attributed their child's success to the things they liked to eat the most: chocolate and peanut butter. However, they couldn't agree on which was better. This rivalry caused the Xtreme Games to be in danger of going off the air. But Zack and Skyler showed their parents that chocolate and peanut butter could get along just fine by introducing them to Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. They agreed to start a new X-game; the Reese's Xtreme Cup Challenge, which would allow for a fun way of deciding between chocolate and peanut butter.  Techniques  Riders were split into two groups of four (teams \\"Chocolate\\" and \\"Peanut Butter,\\" after the main flavors in Reese's Peanut Butter Cups), seated, and given a ride through. The guests enter a dark tunnel that lights up and makes the vehicles spin. Then the adventure begins. Targets were placed in large scenes, often with spinning obstructions placed in front. Targets lit up with yellow lights that disappear when hit, but these lights turned orange for a short period, yielding double points if hit. One popular tactic was to aim for targets already hit by other players. The shooting scenes were broken down into three sections. In the final section, all targets were orange but the vehicle moves faster. Another dark tunnel then lights up and takes them back to show the players their points. Often, stacking would occur, leaving the riders on the course to continue to shoot while the cars remain stationary, which prevented cars from bumping into each other. Unlike a typical dark ride, RXCC's cars traveled on a track similar to a roller coaster. This cannot be defined as a coaster (not even as a powered coaster), because there is no gravity involved with the movement. When the ride first opened, individual Reese's cups (with caramel) were given out at the end of the ride. If a rider was allergic to peanuts, a standard Hershey's chocolate bar was substituted. Later in the year, all players received Hershey's chocolate bars.

The film was directed by first-time director Miles Brandman. Plot Young couples experiment with anonymous group sex as a way to revitalize their troubled relationships. Through the experience they are forced to rethink the rudiments of a successful relationship: sex, love, and communication. One couple, James and Heather, have lost the spark in their relationship; a cold distance has grown between them and their intimate moments feel forced. Heather is a take- charge problem solver who sometimes gets too carried away for her own good. James, meanwhile, has recently discovered that he's easily manipulated. Another couple, Ellis and Renee, fear that they are at the beginning of the end of their relationship. Renee is thoughtful and honest, but recently she's found herself feeling slightly isolated and bored with Ellis, who puts on a brash, macho front to disguise his insecurity. Both couples seek therapy with Dr. Wellbridge, who offers them experimental treatment to rekindle the cooling relationship. On the doctor's orders, the couples embark on a partner swap that leaves some thrilled and others thwarted, but the truth about their relationships is revealed to all four.

He was the son of a Belgian immigrant, Josias EntWill of Josias Ent, merchant of Sandwich; Kent History & Archives Centre, Maidstone, Kent; PRC32/49/166b, mentioning wife Judith, sons: George, Josias, Giles, and another (Isaac?), and daughters Judith, Elizabeth, Jane & Anne (sometimes called John Ent) and his wife Judith; The Ent (or Ente) family of Sandwich came from Newchurch, in the county of Flanders, to avoid religious persecution.Will of Peter Ente, notary publicke, Kent History & Archives Centre, Maidstone, Kent; PRC17/55/106, lines 7 & 8; proved 1611; George Ent's father died in July 1629, his mother in 1650,Will of Judith Ent, Prob 11, National Archives; 1650, naming George as sole executor, and his son as a beneficiary As a boy, Ent went to school in Wallachia and Rotterdam, but attended college in England. He left for college in April 1624, and received his BA from Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge in 1627 and his MA four years later. Following his graduation from Sidney, he spent five years at the University of Padua, earning his MD in 1636. On 25 June 1639, Sir George Ent became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and remained a fellow for the duration of his life. In addition, he served as a censor from 1645 to 1669 (with gaps in service in 1650, 1652, and 1658), a Registrar from 1655 to 1670, and Consiliarius from 1667 to 1669 and 1676 to 1686. He was elected President of the Royal College of Physicians in 1670 and held the position for five years. He also served on 17 August 1682 and 28 May 1684. Ent was also elected to the Royal Society as an Original Fellow on 22 April 1663. On 10 October 1646, Ent married Sarah, the daughter of a former president of the Royal College, Dr. . Ent was also known as an author, a scholar, and an anatomist. He was widely reputed to be exceptionally eloquent, particularly in Latin. He wrote a number of books, the most prominent of which is probably his Apologia, the first book Ent ever published. In addition, he both studied and gave lectures on anatomy. In 1665, his anatomy lectures at the Royal College of Physicians were observed by King Charles II, who knighted him in April of the same year. This remains the only instance in which a man was actually knighted inside the Royal College. Although born twenty-six years after him, Ent was a close friend of William Harvey, a man known best for his discovery of the circulation of blood. Ent met Harvey in Venice, shortly after his graduation from Padua. His Apologia was a defense of Harvey's theory of circulation, and Ent is credited with convincing Harvey to release his de Generatione Animalium, which was actually edited and published by Ent. Ent is also known for his correspondence with Cassiano dal Pozzo, who sent Ent fossilized wood specimens, including a tabletop made of petrified wood. Ent showed them to the Royal Society, where they led to increased interest in the origin of fossils. Ent died in his house in St Giles-in-the-Fields on 13 October 1689 at the age of 84.  Works and Theories  George Ent's significance lies mainly in his contributions to the works of others, particularly his critiques. He is known as one of the closest friends and first defenders of William Harvey, and he is considered to be one of Harvey's successors in the study of anatomy. Ent's best known theories build on Harvey's work, while the rest of Ent's work spans a wide spectrum of knowledge.  Apologia pro circulatione sanguinis  Translation: Defense on Behalf of the Circulation of the Blood. Written in 1641, the Apologia pro circulatione sanguinis, Ent's most significant work on anatomy, defends the theories of William Harvey‚Äôs book de Motu Cordis (On the Circulation of the Blood), directly responding to the criticism of Emilius Parisianus. This book is significant both on the merits of Ent's own anatomical theories and because it offered one of the first in-depth defenses of Harvey‚Äôs work. In the Apologia, Ent elaborates on Harvey‚Äôs theories on circulation, suggesting that a ‚Äúnutritive fluid‚Äù nourishes the body by passing through the nerves. Ent draws on John Mayow‚Äôs theories on innate heat and respiration in his discussion of the nervous system. In addition to Harvey's work, Ent references both ancient and contemporary sources, particularly mentioning writers discussing topics now considered occult, whom Harvey dismissed.  Sive animadversiones in Malachias Thrustoni  Translation: Or Observations against Malachi Thruston. The Sive animadversiones in Malachias Thrustoni contains Ent's analysis of Malachi Thruston‚Äôs theories on respiration. While containing a reasonable critique, the original theories Ent puts forth in this work do not go beyond those expressed in his Apologia, making this work less significant than the Apologia as an original expression.  Lectures on Anatomy  Ent gave several lectures on anatomy at the Royal College of Physicians in 1665. He is known for being one of only two lecturers to have left his lecture notes in English. After a lecture in April, which the King attended, Ent received a knighthood.  Other Works  Mantissa anatomica combines of three of Ent's studies on anatomy ‚Äì Lophius, Galeus, and Rana. He assembled these as part of an intended broad study of anatomy in the 1650s that never further materialized. From 1637‚Äì1655, Ent corresponded with Cassiano dal Pozzo concerning fossil wood. Published in 1687, near the end of Ent‚Äôs lifetime, the Opera Omnia Medico-Physica (All Medical-Physical Works) contains a collection of Ent‚Äôs works. Ent‚Äôs nonscientific works include a range of topics. The Grounds of Unity in Religion comments on the relationship of the English government and the Church of England, discussing the position of people of different faiths with the political and religious framework. The Manner of Hatching Chicken at Cairo, on which he collaborated with John Graves, describes a method of using heat from ovens to force eggs to hatch.  References  *Bylebyl, Jerome J.

The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in the village of Skaneateles. Its northern terminus is at an intersection with NY 5 in Bennetts Corners, a hamlet within the town of Camillus. NY 321 is predominantly a north‚Äìsouth highway; however, a portion of the route through the towns of Elbridge and Camillus follows an east‚Äìwest alignment. The portion of NY 321 in Camillus between Forward Road and NY 5 is maintained by Onondaga County as part of County Route 66 (CR 66), a route that continues north of NY 5 to Memphis. The majority of NY 321's routing was originally designated as part of NY 26 in 1924. NY 26 continued east to the village of Camillus by way of Forward Road and modern NY 174\\\\. All of NY 26 north of Skaneateles was renumbered to NY 321 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It initially overlapped NY 174 from Forward Road to Camillus; however, this concurrency was eliminated in the 1960s. NY 321 was rerouted to follow Bennetts Corners Road in the 1980s. Route description Skaneateles NY 321 begins at an intersection with US 20 (West Genesee Street) in the Onondaga County village of Skaneateles. The highway, at first, heads northward, intersecting with local streets in the village. After leaving the village and entering the town of the same name, the highway intersects with the Old Seneca Turnpike (CR 133). NY 321 continues northward, then veers east as it crosses into the town of Elbridge. In Elbridge, NY 321 intersects with several county routes, including Halfway Road (CR 107; former NY 368), a connector highway leading to the hamlet of Halfway. Soon afterwards, NY 321 turns to the northeast, heading towards NY 5\\\\. The highway intersects Forward Road (unsigned NY 931F) just inside the Camillus town line soon after the turn. Forward Road, a local road that passes through a mixture of open fields and forests, serves as a connector between NY 321 and NY 174. Past Forward Road, NY 321 becomes concurrent with CR 66 as maintenance of the roadway shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation to Onondaga County. The state designation comes to an end at NY 5 in the hamlet of Bennetts Corners west of the village of Camillus shortly after; however, CR 66 continues onward. History Origins The town of Skaneateles was incorporated in the 1800s to help build highways in the area. The highways that were proposed were to be built with stone and other materials. Construction began in 1911 on a highway between the Skaneateles‚ÄìElbridge town line and the hamlet of Martisco within the town of Camillus. It was accepted into the New York state highway system on September 17, 1912. An extension of the road south into the town of Skaneateles to the village of the same name was constructed in late 1912 and early 1913 and added to the state highway system in September 1913. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the Skaneateles‚ÄìMartisco highway was included as part of NY 26, a route extending from Ithaca to Syracuse by way of Skaneateles. North of Martisco, NY 26 followed Ninemile Creek to the village of Camillus, where it intersected NY 5A (later NY 5). 1957 USGS topographic map of Camillus. NY 321 is shown here on its original alignment while NY 20SY is routed on Bennetts Corners Road NY 321 designation NY 26 was split into several different routes as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The segment of former NY 26 between US 20 in Skaneateles and NY 5 in Camillus was renumbered to NY 321\\\\. It initially overlapped with NY 174 from Martisco to Camillus.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering The overlap remained in place until the 1960s when NY 321 was truncated to the southern end of the concurrency in Martisco. Looking eastward along Forward Road (NY 931F) from junction with NY 321 In the early 1950s, the portion of NY 321 south of Forward Road was co-designated as part of NY 20SY, a largely alternate routing of US 20 between Skaneateles and Manlius via Syracuse. Past Sweets Corners, NY 20SY continued north on a previously unnumbered roadway to NY 5 at Bennetts Corners, where it joined NY 5 east into Camillus. The NY 20SY designation was removed in 1961, leaving Bennetts Corners Road from Forward Road to NY 5 as an unnumbered roadway once again. NY 321 was rerouted in the late 1980s to follow Bennetts Corners Road to NY 5\\\\. This part of NY 321 overlapped CR 66, a highway that began at the junction of Forward and Bennetts Corners Roads and ended in the hamlet of Memphis, and thus became maintained by Onondaga County. The former routing of NY 321 along Forward Road is now designated as NY 931F, an unsigned reference route in length.

Climate As the rest of Switzerland, Nuvilly has a tempered climate. Due to the bowl form and the humidity of all the Broye area, from the middle of September to the end of April, Nuvilly is regularly hidden by a dense cloak of fog. Tourism With its country roads and small path, Nuvilly is a good place for hiking trails and nature sightseeing. Recently renewed and well preserved, the church is a good example of the local architecture.

The term thermophoresis most often applies to aerosol mixtures, but may also commonly refer to the phenomenon in all phases of matter. The term Soret effect normally applies to liquid mixtures, which behave according to different, less well-understood mechanisms than gaseous mixtures. Thermophoresis may not apply to thermomigration in solids, especially multi-phase alloys. Thermophoretic force The phenomenon is observed at the scale of one millimeter or less. An example that may be observed by the naked eye with good lighting is when the hot rod of an electric heater is surrounded by tobacco smoke: the smoke goes away from the immediate vicinity of the hot rod. As the small particles of air nearest the hot rod are heated, they create a fast flow away from the rod, down the temperature gradient. They have acquired higher kinetic energy with their higher temperature. When they collide with the large, slower-moving particles of the tobacco smoke they push the latter away from the rod. The force that has pushed the smoke particles away from the rod is an example of a thermophoretic force. Thermodiffusion is labeled \\"positive\\" when particles move from a hot to cold region and \\"negative\\" when the reverse is true. Typically the heavier/larger species in a mixture exhibit positive thermophoretic behavior while the lighter/smaller species exhibit negative behavior. In addition to the sizes of the various types of particles and the steepness of the temperature gradient, the heat conductivity and heat absorption of the particles play a role. Recently, Braun and coworkers have suggested that the charge and entropy of the hydration shell of molecules play a major role for the thermophoresis of biomolecules in aqueous solutions. The quantitative description is given by: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\chi}{\\\\partial t}= abla\\\\cdot( D\\\\, abla \\\\chi+ D_{T}\\\\, \\\\chi(1-\\\\chi)\\\\, abla T) \\\\chi particle concentration; D diffusion coefficient; and D_T the thermodiffusion coefficient. The quotient of both coefficients :S_T=\\\\frac{D_T}{D} is called Soret coefficient. The thermophoresis factor has been calculated from molecular interaction potentials derived from known molecular models J. Chem. Phys., 50, 4886, (1960) Applications The thermophoretic force has a number of practical applications. The basis for applications is that, because different particle types move differently under the force of the temperature gradient, the particle types can be separated by that force after they've been mixed together, or prevented from mixing if they're already separated. Impurity ions may move from the cold side of a semiconductor wafer towards the hot side, since the higher temperature makes the transition structure required for atomic jumps more achievable. The diffusive flux may occur in either direction (either up or down the temperature gradient), dependent on the materials involved. Thermophoretic force has been used in commercial precipitators for applications similar to electrostatic precipitators. It is exploited in the manufacturing of optical fiber in vacuum deposition processes. It can be important as a transport mechanism in fouling. Thermophoresis has also been shown to have potential in facilitating drug discovery by allowing the detection of aptamer binding by comparison of the bound versus unbound motion of the target molecule. This approach has been termed microscale thermophoresis.An illustration of a device based on microscale thermophoresis at NanoTemper.de Furthermore, thermophoresis has been demonstrated as a versatile technique for manipulating single biological macromolecules, such as genomic-length DNA, and HIV virus in micro- and nanochannels by means of light-induced local heating. Thermophoresis is one of the methods used to separate different polymer particles in field flow fractionation.An illustration of a Thermal Field Flow Fractionation Machine based on thermophoresis used to separate mixed polymers at Postnova.com History Thermophoresis in gas mixtures was first observed and reported by John Tyndall in 1870 and further understood by John Strutt (Baron Rayleigh) in 1882.A brief history of thermophoresis studies is in Encyclopedia of Surface And Colloid Science, Volume 2, published by Taylor & Francis, year 2006. John Tyndall's original article in year 1870 is online at Archive.org. Thermophoresis in liquid mixtures was first observed and reported by Carl Ludwig in 1856 and further understood by Charles Soret in 1879. James Clerk Maxwell wrote in 1873 concerning mixtures of different types of molecules (and this could include small particulates larger than molecules): :\\"This process of diffusion... goes on in gases and liquids and even in some solids.... The dynamical theory also tells us what will happen if molecules of different masses are allowed to knock about together. The greater masses will go slower than the smaller ones, so that, on an average, every molecule, great or small, will have the same energy of motion. The proof of this dynamical theorem, in which I claim the priority, has recently been greatly developed and improved by Dr. Ludwig Boltzmann.\\"\\"Molecules\\" by James Clerk Maxwell, published in September 1873 in Nature (magazine). Reproduced online at Victorianweb.org. It has been analyzed theoretically by Sydney Chapman. Thermophoresis at solids interfaces was numerically discovered by Schoen et al. in 2006 and was experimentally confirmed by Barreiro et al. Negative thermophoresis in fluids was first noticed in 1967 by Dwyer in a theoretical solution, and the name was coined by Sone. Negative thermophoresis at solids interfaces was first observed by Leng et al. in 2016.

SR 156 turns west with SR 5 while SR 106 continues north to the village of Roxbury, where the highway has an at-grade intersection with CSX's Peninsula Subdivision. SR 106 crosses the Chickahominy River into New Kent County and intersects US 60 (Pocahontas Trail). The state highway continues northeast as Emmaus Church Road and has a diamond interchange with I-64 and SR 33. North of the Interstate, SR 106 passes through a roundabout with a pair of stub roads and expands to a four-lane divided highway that passes through a developing residential subdivision. The state highway passes through another roundabout with the incomplete roads of the subdivision before reaching its northern terminus at a roundabout with SR 249 (New Kent Highway) in Talleysville. The north leg of the intersection is SR 609 (Old Church Road), which leads to St. Peter's Church.

Lisa Mark, Jane Hyun and Elizabeth Hamilton (Los Angeles, MOCA, 2002) 9 Education Durant received a BFA in sculpture in 1986 from the Massachusetts College of Art and an MFA from California Institute of the Arts. Career 1990s His work of the 90s was inspired largely by the work of Robert Smithson, an artist interested in history and entropy. Durant's work has been exhibited internationally and in the United States. He has had solo museum exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Kunstverein f√ºr die Rheinlande und Westfalen, D√ºsseldorf, S.M.A.K., Ghent, Belgium, and the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery in New Zealand. His work has been included in the Panam√°, Sydney, Venice, and Whitney Biennials. Durant shows with several galleries including Blum & Poe in Los Angeles, Paula Cooper Gallery in New York, Praz-Delavallade in Paris/Los Angeles and Sadie Coles HQ in London. 2000s In 2005, his exhibition \\"Proposal for White and Indian Dead Monument Transpositions, Washington D.C.\\" was shown at the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York.Sam Durant, Proposal for White and Indian Dead Monument Transpositions. Washington. D.C. (New York: Paula Cooper Gallery, 2005). This work derived out of a residency he was conducting at the Walker Art Center in 2002. He reproduced 30 Indian massacre monuments that are based on similarities to the massive obelisk Washington monument. In 2006, he compiled and edited a comprehensive monograph of Black Panther artist Emory Douglas‚Äô work.Sam Durant, Black Panther: The Revolutionary Art of Emory Douglas (New York: Rizzoli, 2009).

In addition, he was a finalist for the 2008 Hugo Boss Prize and has received a United States Artists Broad Fellowship and a City of Los Angeles Individual Artist Grant. Scaffold Signs of protest at Walker Art Center over Durant's Scaffold In June 2017, Durant erected a two-story wooden beam sculpture entitled Scaffold for display in the garden of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The sculpture was intended to represent \\"the gallows used in seven hangings from 1859 to 2006 sanctioned by the U.S. government\\", as well as \\"America's history of state violence and its use of the death penalty\\". Scaffold had previously been displayed at documenta in Germany in 2012, and at Jupiter Artland in Scotland in 2014. The sculpture elicited protests from Native American groups prior to being put on public display, and delayed the opening of the gallery's public art garden. Protesters were offended by a reference in the sculpture to the 1862 hanging of 38 Dakota Indians at Mankato, Minnesota. Durant agreed to dismantle Gallows, and after initial plans to burn the piece, it was buried by Dakota tribal elders.https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/09/01/scaffold-sculpture- wood-to-be-buried-dakota-official \\"I made Scaffold as a learning space for people like me, white people who have not suffered the effects of a white supremacist society and who may not consciously know that it exists\\" said Durant, \\"white artists need to address issues of white supremacy\\".

The route heads north into Port Crane, where it intersects half of Interstate 88/NY 7 exit 3 (the ramps leading to and from the eastbound carriageway) at Albany Street. Farther north, access to and from I-88 and NY 7 westbound is made at an intersection just past the overpass carrying I-88 and NY 7 over NY 369\\\\. North of Port Crane, NY 369 follows the eastern bank of the Chenango River for a short distance through rural Fenton before splitting from the waterway south of Chenango Valley State Park, which NY 369 passes to the east.

He had his primary and secondary school education in Hong Kong. Graduated from La Salle College. He received his B.S. from the California Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under Francis Low. He is the Horace White Professor of Physics, Emeritus, at Cornell University and a fellow of the American Physical Society. He joined the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2011 and was the Director of HKUST Jockey Club Institute for Advanced Study during 2011-2016. Together with Gia Dvali, he suggested the idea of brane inflation in 1998 in which inflation arises because of the weak forces supersymmetry allows between identical branes. A variant of this proposal based on branes and antibranes was later put on concrete string theoretic grounds by Shamit Kachru and collaborators. He went on to work out many details of brane inflation with his research group at Cornell. He was responsible for the revival of the interest in cosmic strings. Cosmic superstrings are produced at the end of brane inflation due to brane-antibrane annihilation. Apart from the details of brane inflation, he has been working on issues related to the string landscape and quantum cosmology with his collaborators. Alan Guth, in his book The Inflationary Universe, tells the story of how he was led to think about issues that resulted in the original idea of cosmic inflation due to the influence of Henry Tye. At that time they were both postdocs at Cornell University. Tye went to China for six weeks in 1979 during the time that Guth came up with his historic inflation breakthrough. \\"Had he not gone to China, Henry surely would have been a coauthor on the first inflation paper,\\" Guth said.Steve Nadis. \\"The most important cosmologist you've never heard of.\\" Astronomy.

She is portrayed by Hayden Panettiere and first appeared on television in the pilot episode of the series, \\"Genesis\\", on September 25, 2006. She is a high school cheerleader with the power of rapid cellular regeneration. Claire appears in more episodes than any other character (72, plus a 73rd through stock footage). In Heroes Reborn, she dies while giving birth to Malina and Nathan. Background Claire Bennet was born to Nathan Petrelli and Meredith Gordon, two people possessing abilities. Noah Bennet and his partner, Claude, who are agents of the Company, arrive at Meredith's house to abduct her. Claude goes inside to \\"do the heavy liftin'\\" while Noah waits outside until Meredith combusts and blows the door open. Noah runs inside to find Claude on the floor. Claude then tells Noah to find Claire. Noah finds her and carries her out safely. Noah and his wife, Sandra, later adopt her. In the graphic novel Elle's First Assignment, which takes place before the series begins, Bob Bishop gives his daughter Elle her first assignment, which is to track and follow Claire, posing as a student at Union Wells High School. Elle is reluctant, but Bob informs her that Claire is important to the Company. Claire never realizes that Elle is following her. Six months prior to the start of the series, Claire had just become a cheerleader at her high school, with the help of her friend Jackie Wilcox. During an argument on whether or not she wants to be a cheerleader with Jackie, Claire crashes into a glass case, cutting her hand. When they show Claire's parents, Mrs. Bennet says that Claire might need stitches. After Claire, Jackie, and Mrs. Bennet leave for the hospital, the phone rings and Mr. Bennet answers. It is Chandra Suresh, a scientist who studies paranormal phenomena, informing him of Claire's power. Several days later, Mr. Bennet asks if he can see her hand with the stitches. When they unravel the cloth around her hand they are both surprised to see not even a small scratch. After discovering this abnormal ability Claire decides to try stunts which she gets her friend Zach from school to videotape. Genesis In the pilot episode \\"Genesis\\", set six months later, 15-year-old Claire has discovered her power. Frightened as to what it means, she confides in Zach, a high-school classmate who videotapes Claire testing her regenerative power by attempting to injure ‚Äì and even kill ‚Äì herself. Her younger brother, Lyle, also discovers Claire's powers after finding the tape Zach filmed. Claire swears him to secrecy. Claire has been through her share of harrowing experiences, including an attempted rape, being murdered during the attempt, and reviving during an autopsy. Claire is also consumed with curiosity about her birth parents, having been adopted when she was a year old. After the first four episodes of the series, a story arc called \\"Save the cheerleader, save the world\\" begins. Claire's ultimate fate is implied to be tied to the fate of the entire world. A future version of Hiro Nakamura cryptically tells Peter Petrelli: \\"Save the cheerleader, save the world.\\" Isaac Mendez, a drug-addicted painter in New York paints a vision of Claire being chased at her school. He also paints a picture of a blonde cheerleader with the top of her skull removed (which the painting actually depicting Jackie, not Claire). In the episode \\"Homecoming\\", Claire is elected homecoming queen with the help of her friend Zach. Claire's father grounds her, intending to keep her out of harm's way by preventing her from fulfilling Isaac's \\"prophecies\\", but she sneaks out of her bedroom. At the game, Claire meets Peter. However, since he saw the newspaper article where Jackie took credit for the fire rescue that Claire did, Peter believes Jackie is the cheerleader he is there to save. Sylar catches the two girls in the locker room and cuts Jackie's scalp telekinetically, but Claire manages to escape. In the hallway, she finds Peter and the two of them flee the building. Claire takes Peter's advice to run toward the stadium full of people as he tries to fight Sylar. In the end they fall off the roof and Peter dies, as Sylar tries to escape. As Claire approaches Peter she is then astonished to see him heal himself just like her. As Claire goes to get help, she runs into the arms of her relieved father. When the story continues in \\"Fallout\\", Claire's father informs her that he has always known about her powers and has done things he is not proud of to protect her. He tells her Sylar has been taken care of, but warns Claire not to tell anyone about her powers, claiming there are others who would want to harm her. Claire recovers the remaining video tapes depicting her powers from Zach and destroys them. She warns Zach not to tell anyone about her healing abilities. Claire and her father are interviewed by law enforcement officials, including Matt Parkman, but Claire tells them both she and Peter must have been \\"just lucky\\" to have survived Sylar's attack. Claire later meets with Peter alone and is fascinated when he tells her he risked his life to save her (as he was not sure in advance if he had adopted Claire's healing factor). Claire later discovers that both her brother and Zach no longer remember what they have seen regarding her unusual healing abilities. Claire panics and calls her father. Mr. Bennet reassures her that he remembers and everything will be all right. The Haitian then appears out of the shadows and tells Claire that Mr. Bennet sent him to wipe her memory of the preceding events, just as he has wiped the memories of Brody, Lyle, and Zach. The Haitian even states that he had to mind wipe Claire's mother \\"so many times\\" in the past. However, the Haitian then said that there is a reason Claire must remember and asks her if she can keep a secret. Two weeks later, Claire is struggling with being alone again since the Haitian did not wipe her memory. She tries to reconnect with Zach, but between his lack of memory and resentment over the way their friendship ended in grade school, he is not interested. Desperate, Claire meets with the Haitian to discuss her options. He rebuffs her request to see Peter, stating he is being watched by her father. She asks the Haitian to give Zach his memories back, as she does not want to be alone, but he tells her he cannot. Before leaving, the Haitian also recommends she respect her abilities more, rather than see them as an affliction. In \\"The Fix\\", Claire and Zach search for information on her biological mother. Their search leads them to Meredith Gordon, a woman reported to have died in a fire along with her 18-month-old daughter. They believe Claire to be Meredith Gordon's reportedly-dead daughter. When Claire contacts several people with the surname \\"Gordon,\\" she finds a woman who identifies herself as Meredith. The woman is shocked to hear that Claire survived and is revealed to possess the ability of pyrokinesis. In \\"Distractions\\", Claire and Meredith meet, sharing their powers with each other. Later, Meredith telephones Claire's biological father, who is revealed to be Nathan Petrelli, informing him that their daughter is still alive. In the episode \\"Unexpected\\", Claire finds that her mother, Mrs. Bennet, is showing signs of temporary memory loss, at one point even forgetting the family dog, Mr. Muggles, only to revert to her normal self a few minutes later. Later on, Mrs. Bennet collapses while in the kitchen and is rushed to the hospital. When Mr. Bennet arrives, Claire is unable to suppress her anger against him any longer and admits to knowing about the repeated memory wipes that Mr. Bennet has had done on her mother. After this, the family returns home, where they are confronted by Ted Sprague and Matt Parkman. In \\"Company Man\\", Claire and her family are held captive by Sprague and Parkman. After Mr. Bennet tries and fails to save the family, Claire and her father convince Matt to shoot her to get Sprague's trust. She attempts to free her family after she regenerates, but is captured by Sprague in the attempt. After Sprague is shot and his radiation powers go violently out of control, Claire uses her regenerative powers to get close enough to tranquilize him. However, Claire is seen healing from severe radiation burns by one of Mr. Bennet's superiors, who insists that Claire be turned over to their employers. In the end, Claire is given to the Haitian, who is to keep her safe from Bennet's company. In \\"Parasite\\", she is supposed to go with the Haitian to flee the country but manages to slip away from him by stealing his passport at the airport. She then goes to Peter Petrelli's apartment, regarding him as the only person she can trust in the current chaos her life has become. However, she finds his mother, Angela Petrelli, there instead, and Angela reveals that not only is she Claire's grandmother, but that she and the Haitian have been corresponding for some time in order to protect Claire. In \\".07%\\", Claire learns that her grandmother, Angela Petrelli, knew of her existence all along, even though Nathan thought she had died in a fire as a baby. Mrs. Petrelli tells her that she still needs protecting and the two of them will be going to Paris until after the election. When the seemingly dead body of Peter Petrelli is brought to his mother's house, Claire comes downstairs to see Peter for herself. Claire finds a huge jagged shard of glass penetrating his skull. When she pulls it out, Peter comes back to life. Later, Nathan, realizing he cannot afford to have her in the city in the days leading up to the election‚Äîto avoid any scandalous issues and possibly to get her out of the way of Peter's nuclear explosion‚Äîasks Claire to go to Paris. Claire reluctantly agrees to go with Angela, and the two of them embrace warmly. In \\"The Hard Part\\", two days before the bomb, Claire is still staying in the Petrelli mansion. She watches as Nathan greets his wife, Heidi and their two boys Monty and Simon, upon their return to the mansion, although Claire is not introduced to them. Later, Claire and her grandmother, Angela Petrelli, begin packing her bags for Paris. Peter walks into the room and talks to Claire about destiny, although she is convinced the best way for Nathan to protect her is to fly to Paris. Claire tells Peter about Sprague, who can manipulate radiation, after Peter reveals he will likely \\"go nuclear\\" and destroy half of New York. Peter and Claire confront Nathan about Ted; with someone else capable of manipulating radiation, Peter is hopeful the explosion can be prevented. Nathan remains doubtful, pointing out that Peter's vision was of his own explosion. Peter reminds Nathan that he had a vision of flying as well, despite the fact that it was Nathan who could fly ‚Äî a fact that impresses Claire. Later, Peter and Claire go to the Petrelli campaign headquarters to meet with Nathan. Upon arriving, they see Nathan talking with Thompson, whom Claire recognizes as her adoptive father's boss and the man she is running from. Peter gives Claire a handgun, telling her she is the only person who can get close to him if he begins to explode. He instructs her to shoot him in the back of the head, a spot she knows will prevent him from healing. She reluctantly agrees to carry the weapon. The pair recognize a location from one of Peter's drawings of Ted, and decide to look for him. While waiting for Ted to appear, Claire and Peter discuss how their powers have changed their lives. Claire then sees Mr. Bennet walking with Ted and Matt Parkman. She runs to her adoptive father as Peter and Matt acknowledge each other. Meanwhile, Peter notices his hands begin to glow as he absorbs Ted's power. In \\"Landslide\\", Mr. Bennet orders Claire to leave the city with Peter and Ted. They are making plans to make their way out of New York to Nebraska when Peter hears Sylar's thoughts and they hide in a building upon realizing he is nearby. When they re-emerge, Ted is arrested by the FBI. As Ted makes his way to a holding facility, Sylar makes the FBI truck transporting him crash, and Ted is subsequently murdered; his abilities having been absorbed by the villain. Upon receiving this news in \\"How to Stop an Exploding Man\\", Mr. Bennet requests that Peter stay with his daughter at all times and he agrees. Claire, however, feels betrayed when, instead of finding Sylar on their own, Peter drives them to a parking garage where Nathan is awaiting their arrival. Firm in her belief that they cannot trust him, Claire sneaks out when Peter leaves her in the car to speak with his brother, only for her to run into Angela. Angela and Nathan have plans to leave the city with Claire to Nantucket but when she finds out that they have known about the impending explosion all along and are willing to let it transpire, she jumps out of Nathan's office window after bluffing them that she has accepted the situation. Rapidly healing after her fall, she runs off to Kirby Plaza where she catches up to the scene just when Peter is about to explode. Mr. Bennet hands her a gun to shoot her uncle just as she had promised before, but Claire hesitates, pleading with Peter that there must be another way. Nathan flies down in between them at that moment and agrees with his daughter. Claire, Mr. Bennet, Molly, Micah, Mohinder, Matt, Niki and D.L. watch as Nathan flies away with his brother high into the air where Peter then explodes, saving New York City, but possibly sacrificing her birth father and uncle's lives in the process. As the first season ends, Claire reconciles with her adoptive father and they make plans to reunite with the rest of their family. Generations Four months later, 16-year-old Claire and her family have moved to Costa Verde, California, where Claire starts her first day of 11th grade in Costa Verde High School under the last name of \\"Butler\\". She quickly meets West, who nearly runs her over when she accidentally runs in front of his car. Following her father's advice ‚Äî \\"Be entirely unextraordinary\\" ‚Äî she does nothing that makes her stand out. In \\"Lizards\\", Claire, curious about the extent of her abilities and whether they could be used to help others, cuts off her own toe to see if it grows back. It does, but West, watching through the window, catches her in the act. Claire tries to keep him quiet about it, so he reveals his power, the ability to fly, to her. When Claire notices a two-line scar on his neck, he explains that he was \\"abducted by aliens\\" just after meeting a man with \\"horn-rimmed glasses\\", revealing that he was one of many caught and released by Claire's father. In \\"The Kindness of Strangers\\", Claire pretends to make the cheerleading squad in order to have time to date West. Though the cheerleading squad leader, Debbie, will not let her join, she and West manage to get Debbie kicked off the team by abusing their respective powers. In \\"Out of Time\\", West comes to Claire's house unannounced to bring breakfast. Despite her efforts, West discovers the identity of Claire's father and refuses to talk to Claire about it. At the same time, her father discovers the news report about the drunk cheerleader ‚Äî vague details of Claire and West's prank are given ‚Äî and insists on moving again. Claire strongly refuses, saying that she will not go with them. In \\"Cautionary Tales\\", Claire takes a stand against her father's paranoia regarding the Company, claiming that this was all about him. At school, Bob Bishop broaches the subject of underage drinking to her, but slips up and calls her \\"Miss Bennet,\\" tipping her off to who he really is. Claire dashes home and discovers the painting that sent Noah into a paranoid frenzy (Noah's death) before she is abducted. After they take her blood, Bob, Mohinder, and Claire meet Noah, West, and Elle for a hostage exchange: Claire for Elle. As Claire and West fly away, Elle zaps them down. Noah shoots Elle, but is shot by Mohinder, devastating Claire, who breaks the news to Sandra and Lyle. In \\"Truth & Consequences\\" a heartbroken and devastated Claire, who does not know that her father has been revived by the Company, scatters what Bob led the family to be his ashes at the beach. After doing so though, she quickly discovers Elle Bishop observing her. Claire runs up to Elle and tells her that due to what the Company did to her father, she will reveal her power. Claire then punches through Elle's car window and says, \\"You'll be the ones running\\" and walks away. In \\"Powerless\\", Claire is confronted by both her mother and West about her decision to reveal her power to the world. She and West fight, she breaks up with him and after he flies off, her father appears, effectively halting her plans. Villains In \\"The Second Coming\\", Claire, now 17, witnesses the shooting of Nathan on television, and calls Peter to ask about his condition, offering to give Nathan a blood transfusion to save him, though Peter tells her to stay put. She instead packs a duffel bag, apparently planning to go back to Texas to save him, only to find a newly empowered Sylar outside her bedroom, much to her horror and surprise. After a chase through the house, Sylar slices into her skull and examines Claire's brain. When Claire asks if Sylar will eat it, he states that the very idea is disgusting. After poking around, Sylar finds the source and gains the use of Claire's power. He then simply replaces her disembodied skull cap, which immediately reattaches to her body. Before Sylar leaves, he says to Claire that she's \\"different... special... and [he] couldn't kill [her] if [he] wanted to\\". In \\"The Butterfly Effect\\", Claire discovers that she no longer feels pain, which saddens her deeply as she states that pain was the only thing that kept her believing she was human at all. Clearly distressed by this discovery, she resolves to experiment on herself to test her new-found ability. During one scene, Claire begins to videotape herself as she is about to step in front of an oncoming train. By labeling it her \\"seventh attempt\\", Claire is picking up where she had left off in \\"Genesis\\", where she had initially halted her experimentation at attempt number six. However, she is saved from getting hit by the future Peter, who she confides in about Sylar's attack and asks him to train her in her powers. Peter merely states that he can't and teleports away, leaving her by herself on the hill. At home, Noah Bennet, greatly relieved to see her still alive, shows Claire some files on several of the Company's escaped villains, stating his knowledge of their abilities and capabilities. When Claire inquires about the possibility of being attacked by any of these villains at home, Noah tells her he had thought about that idea and then reveals that he and Sandra Bennet had called in Meredith Gordon (last seen in Season 1's \\"Run!\\") to protect the family in Noah's absence. In \\"One of Us, One of Them,\\" Claire enlists Meredith to teach her how to fight back, to no longer be \\"the victim.\\" However, when they leave to do so, Meredith \\"tortures\\" Claire by superheating the air in the building they are in, reducing the level of oxygen (this shows that while Claire is virtually immortal, she still may be vulnerable to asphyxiation). Eventually, she forces Claire to reveal the real reason she wants to learn how to fight: to get revenge on Sylar for what he did to her. Afterwards, a guilt- ridden Meredith apologizes to her at the Bennet household, and Claire leaves for an apparent cheerleader meeting; in reality, she has stolen some Company files that Noah had left on the counter and gone to track down some of the Company's escapees. In the episode \\"Angels and Monsters\\", Claire has begun her mission to recapture the Level 5 escapees. Using the information from her father's files she tracks down Stephen Canfield, who has the ability to mentally create powerful energy vortices that act as miniature black holes. She finds Canfield, stuns him using a Taser, and explains to him that he is evil and how he must be brought to justice. However, much to Claire's surprise, Canfield is remorseful about the death of his neighbor (whom he accidentally killed after a heated argument over a lawnmower). He states how he just wants to be reunited with his wife and kids. Upon hearing this, and convincing Canfield that she was not with the Company, Claire agrees to help him locate his family using the information from her father's files. Shortly thereafter, Noah and his newly assigned partner Sylar (much to Claire's horror) interrupt her mission. Believing that Claire had set him up, Canfield opens up a vortex and escapes; Claire is very nearly sucked in, but is saved at the last minute by Sylar, who attempts to convince her that he is genuinely sorry for what he did; unsurprisingly, she is unwilling to forgive him, and Noah emphatically tells him to shut up and never talk to Claire again. Claire tells Noah that Canfield is truly sorry for what he had done and that the murder was an accident. Noah assures her that he would not place someone in Level 5 who didn't belong there in the first place, and agrees to talk to Canfield. That night, Claire meets Canfield at an amusement park, where it is revealed that his family never came. At that moment, Noah shows up and attempts to force him to kill Sylar in exchange for his own freedom against Claire's protests. However, the depressed Canfield uses a vortex to kill himself instead, feeling he has nothing left to live for. Later, Noah and Sylar drop Claire off at home. Sylar tries to sway Claire over to his side by claiming that Noah is a user who doesn't see people with abilities (including the two of them) as human and never will, but Claire refuses to listen. Inside the house, a relieved Sandra asks about Claire's well-being, and is relieved that Meredith found her, at which point Claire realizes Meredith went out looking for her and hasn't come back. In \\"Dying of the Light\\", Claire has decided to search for Meredith. Despite the tension between Claire's mothers, Sandra does not object, and insists that she comes along, reinforcing the Company's \\"One of Us, One of Them\\" policy. Using Noah's files, they track down Eric Doyle's location. Sandra creates a diversion to buy Claire some time to rescue Meredith by telling Doyle that she is planning a birthday party for Lyle. However, the plan falls apart, and Sandra and Claire end up captured by Doyle. Claire is then forced to play a demented version of Russian Roulette; Doyle has placed the mothers-daughter team under his power and set a gun loaded with only one bullet on a table. After first using his power to control Claire's aim of the gun between both of her mothers, he forces her to shoot Meredith, but the chamber is empty. Meredith pleads to Doyle to release Claire, but he ignores her and continues his game. Next, Sandra is forced to aim the gun at Claire. Doyle releases his power over Claire's mouth and asks her if she has any last words. She reassures Sandra that everything will be okay and asks her mother to shoot. Her mother pulls the trigger until the live round fires, wounding Claire. Believing Claire to be dead, he releases his control of Sandra, which allows Claire to knock him unconscious, releasing the others. Noah later comes and sedates Doyle and takes him away. Claire is still angry with him over his partnership with Sylar and the Stephen Canfield incident and leaves the puppet emporium, followed by Sandra who attempts to calm her down. In \\"Eris Quod Sum\\", Claire and Sandra return home from the emporium. Claire inquires about their situation (\\"We just starred in a human puppet show, my dad's working with a serial killer, and I can't feel pain\\"), but Sandra remains proud of her teenage daughter because of the latter's unwillingness to buckle under pressure. They exit the vehicle, and their house lights start flickering. Once inside, they discover Lyle on the floor groaning in pain; he alerts the women that \\"the bitch is back.\\" Claire then traces the source of the electrical shortages; it is none other than Elle Bishop, who is sitting at Noah's computer desk. After a brief showdown between the two in which Elle's power proved useless against Claire's ability, she is stopped by Lyle who short circuits her body by throwing a pail of water on her. Elle then reveals that since her firing from the Company by new CEO Angela Petrelli, she has nowhere to go and come seeking the assistance of Noah Bennet. She then admits that she is losing control of her ability ever since the Level Five incident and that Pinehearst Industries may have the answers to helping her. Claire, who can identify with power mishaps as her own powers now negate pain, agrees to go with her. While taking a flight to Pinehearst, Claire taunts Elle over her hatred of heights. Elle fumes about her life under Primatech and believes Claire is an \\"idiot\\" if she wants any part in that life. Elle loses her temper, causing her body to overload uncontrollably, releasing electricity into the plane which nearly causes it to crash. Claire tells her to project all of her excess electricity into her body, knowing that she would not be harmed and thus saving the plane. Once they arrive outside Pinehearst, Elle apologizes to Claire for being \\"nothing but a bitch\\" when Claire was \\"nothing but sweet;\\" Claire, however, says she should thank Elle for convincing her not to give up, and Elle expresses her relief that Claire is \\"just as messed up as [she is]\\". As they make their way toward the building, they witness Peter Petrelli getting thrown from a seven-story window. Claire goes to her uncle's aid, and to the shock of the ladies, he had survived the fall, yet his body is not healing. Claire asks Elle to help her carry him to the car, but Elle abandons her and heads inside Pinehearst in hopes of being cured. Claire then calls her biological father Nathan Petrelli at Mohinder Suresh's laboratory loft (formerly Isaac Mendez's loft) and alerts him to the day's events. Later, she and Peter meet with Nathan and Tracy Strauss, and Claire reveals to him the information (\\"Pinehearst\\") he needs to track down his father, Arthur Petrelli, whom Peter reveals is still alive. In \\"It's Coming\\", Peter and Claire get into an argument about the future that Peter witnessed in \\"I Am Become Death\\" in which Claire becomes a ruthless killer herself, with Claire trying to prove otherwise. They are accosted by Knox and Flint (who is still unaware that Claire is his niece through Meredith). Believing them to be after Peter, Claire tries to hold them off, until they reveal that they actually came for her. Claire is surprised that Knox knows her name and ends up captured by the two villains, but she is saved by Peter, who overheard her shouts: Looking at the gas pipe, which was leaking, Peter warned Knox and Flint that he didn't need his powers to stop them, and provoked Flint into unleashing his pyrokinesis, which ignited the airborne gas, buying Peter and Claire time to escape. The biological uncle-niece team later arrive at Primatech, where Matt Parkman attacks Peter for teleporting him to Africa. After Peter convinces Matt (via thoughtspeak) that it wasn't him, but rather Future Peter, Matt and Daphne Millbrook take them to Angela Petrelli's room, where she is awake. Nathan arrives a few moments later, and Angela reveals that even though Pinehearst has both halves of the super-ability formula, a third element is needed; \\"a catalyst hidden in the blood of a human host,\\" as Angela puts it. Claire recalls Sylar's attack on her and points out that Sylar had called her \\"different...special\\" after noticing something unusual about her brain; using this information, Claire theorizes that she is, in fact, the catalyst. In \\"The Eclipse, Part 1,\\" Claire is told by Angela that she must go into hiding to avoid Arthur gaining the catalyst, she is taken to Level 5 where she finds Noah Bennet waiting for her, he takes her to the house of Stephen Canfield. When they arrive there, he starts to teach her how to fight properly, as she struggles to fight him at first. Sylar and Elle are ordered to retrieve Claire for Pinehearst, but when they arrive they find that their powers are not working. Noah easily defeats the now-depowered Sylar and Elle, but Claire is shot by Elle when she throws herself in front of the gun to save Noah. Claire finds that after she is shot, she is not healing. Angered and worried, Noah takes Claire back to her home where Sandra and Noah try to treat her wound; Noah decides against taking her to a hospital, believing that the wound is not that serious and also because he doesn't want to risk Claire's power being exposed to the public should it return. Claire remarks that not being able to heal has finally allowed her to feel pain once again, and that even though it \\"sucks,\\" it feels great. Sandra later returns to Claire's room with dinner on a tray, only to find Claire unconscious on the floor with blood pooling under her, showing that she was more severely injured by Elle's gun than Noah originally thought. In \\"The Eclipse, Part 2,\\" Claire is rushed to the hospital, where it's discovered that her entire bodily system is battling an infection; due to her ability, Claire has never been sick and possesses a very weak natural immune system. The nurse suspects Sandra of lying, as the infection is potentially lethal. When she is stabilized, Claire works up an apology to Sandra for everything that has happened since the events of Volume One, also expressing regret for ever wanting to be normal (\\"I'm so stupid. All I ever wanted was this ability gone. And now it is.\\"). When police arrive to talk to Sandra (calling her \\"Mrs. Butler,\\" as they are still living under the assumed surname), Claire falls into septic shock and ultimately dies of the infection. The hospital staff cover her body. Sandra uncovers Claire's face just as the sun pours in, and she is startled when Claire's wound heals and she abruptly wakes up. At home, Claire is still very angry with Noah for abandoning her again in her time of need, and explains that Noah still sees her as an \\"assignment.\\" Following a suspicious though, Noah and Claire head downstairs to find Sylar and Elle holding Sandra hostage. When they explain their mission, Claire hastily agrees to go with them so that they will leave the family alone. Sylar and Elle refuse to relent until Hiro Nakamura teleports into the Bennet home and sends Sylar and Elle away. He then returns and teleports himself and Claire to Manhattan, 16 years ago. Claire reads the words in the comic's speech bubbles out loud (\\"I don't think I'd be a very good father;\\" \\"Once again, not a request;\\" \\"Don't get too close\\") and hears them repeated back in Japanese by Noah and Kaito. She realizes that they teleported back to the day that Kaito Nakamura gave 18-month-old Claire to Noah on the Deveaux building rooftop‚Äîa scene first shown as a flashback in season 1's \\"Company Man\\". In \\"Our Father\\", while in the past, Hiro and Claire make their plans; Hiro is going to try to get his mother to heal him and gain the catalyst from her in the process, while Claire is going to try to convince Noah not to take the phone call from Kaito Nakamura. They lay out their plans to each other together in a rather humorous exchange, as neither of them understands what the other is saying. When Claire sees a slightly-younger Sandra struggling to support everything outside the Bennets' apartment, she introduces herself as \\"Bonnie, the neighbor's niece\\" and offers to help her. Claire proves to be very adept at handling her 18-month-old self, and tells Sandra to never let the baby out of sight. Claire's ruse is exposed by Noah, who is immediately suspicious of her. When the phone rings Claire, knowing who is calling, stops Noah from answering. She tells Noah that the Company will need to \\"borrow her for a bit,\\" knowing that they plan to instill the catalyst into her past self. While fighting back tears, she tells him that the baby‚Äîhis \\"Claire-Bear\\"---is \\"fine just the way she is.\\" With a smile, Noah finally believes what \\"Bonnie\\" is telling him, and hangs up the phone. That night, on the Deveaux building rooftop, Claire meets again with Hiro, who, in English, tells her that he has been instilled with the catalyst. At that very moment, Arthur Petrelli appears behind Hiro and absorbs Hiro's powers as well as the catalyst, then telekinetically throws him off the roof. Arthur approaches Claire next and, before sending her back to the present day, tells her to relay the following message to Angela: \\"It's over; I've won.\\" In \\"Dual\\", Claire, Noah, Meredith, and Angela, are trapped in the Level 5 facility by Sylar, who initiates the lockdown mode. Sylar attempts to strike a deal with Claire, agreeing to let her, Noah, and Meredith go if she kills Angela, but Claire refuses and, after helping Noah escape from a trap, \\"kills\\" Sylar by stabbing him in the back of the head with a piece of broken glass. Claire goes back for Meredith, who has lost control of her pyrokinesis after being injected with adrenaline by Sylar, but is persuaded to leave her behind, telling Meredith she loves her and escaping with Noah and Angela as the building goes up in flames. She is then comforted by Noah as she mourns her biological mother's apparent death. Fugitives In \\"A Clear and Present Danger\\", Claire is once again staying at the Petrelli mansion in New York City, going over college brochures since she had earned her GED. Angela enters the room and presses that getting an elite college education is Claire's best shot at a normal life; an agitated Claire disagrees, as she has a gut feeling that Sylar is still alive. Angela counters this argument by telling her granddaughter that they were witnesses to the destruction of Primatech, and Sylar most likely didn't survive. Claire tells Angela of Noah's recent so- called \\"business trips\\" and of a news article she found of a man in Memphis who went missing and vows to go after Sylar herself. Later on, as she is leaving the mansion with her stuff, Claire overhears Angela on the phone. Picking up a nearby cordless, she eavesdrops and discovers Angela is talking to Nathan; she is telling him about Claire's suspicions of Nathan's plan to round up and capture people with abilities when Nathan names Peter and Matt as two of his next targets. After being spotted by Angela, Claire hangs up and dashes out. She calls Peter to warn him of these plans, then dashes over to Matt's apartment to warn him as well. Matt shows Claire some drawings he made using his newly discovered power. They are examining a drawing of themselves when Matt is tranquilized from behind. A team comes in to apprehend them. At an airplane hangar, Claire, who is hooded, drugged (becoming semi-conscious as she is seen moving her head which the other prisoners seem incapable of doing when she is brought to Nathan), and in an orange jumpsuit (which has one button unput), is brought to Nathan, who puts her in a car out of the hangar, but on the way out she regains her composure and knocks out the driver before exiting the car and making a mad dash for the plane. She sneaks on board and unmasks Hiro, and then Peter, Mohinder, Tracy, an unknown female fugitive and Matt. Peter then distracts the guards to buy her time to get to the cockpit. She threatens the pilot with an \\"unexpected landing\\", only to discover Noah is also in the cockpit. However, the \\"unexpected landing\\" comes to pass after Peter accidentally unlocks Tracy's power and freezes a hole in the plane. In \\"Trust and Blood\\", after the crash, Claire and Peter attempt an escape while she reveals Noah Bennet's involvement in Nathan's plans. They are accosted by Noah right then, but he lets Peter go and takes Claire to Nathan with plans to get her home. While Noah and Nathan converse in secret, Daphne Millbrook speeds into the tent and takes Claire to the crash site, where Hiro Nakamura, Ando Masahashi, Mohinder Suresh, and Matt Parkman are waiting. Daphne is then shot by The Hunter, and Claire is riddled with bullets until Matt manipulates one of the men to turn on his comrades. The Hunter then threatens Claire with a shot to the back of the head, but Nathan angrily stops him and takes her to Noah, who puts her in a car to take her home to Costa Verde and \\"live that normal life\\" that she used to long for. As Claire is sulking on her bed, Sandra enters and asks Claire what her college plans are. Claire tells her that she wants to stay close to home and get a part-time job. About a moment after Sandra leaves the room, Claire receives a mysterious text message from someone named \\"Rebel\\" telling her to hold out hope and fight back. In \\"Building 26\\", Claire is texting \\"Rebel\\" at the dinner table at home. When Noah and Sandra discuss Claire's college trip, they decide that a community college would be better for her to take some of the pressure off. When Lyle asks Noah about a consultant's job, Claire leaves the dinner table, disgusted. Noah then asserts his authority over Claire, starting with having enrolled her at Costa Verde Community College. After Noah leaves, Claire receives a text from \\"Rebel\\" to warn an Alex Woolsley at a nearby Sam's Comics. When Claire goes to warn him, he thinks he's being pranked, until Claire demonstrates her ability. They then hide from Noah, who finds Alex and makes up a story to get Alex to go with him, but while Claire distracts Noah with a phone call, Alex knocks over several comics toward Noah to buy himself and Claire time to escape. When they find themselves far enough away, Alex reveals to Claire that he can breathe underwater, which he discovered while on his high school's swim team. Claire then notices a car in the rear view mirror that has already passed them twice, and she and Alex ditch his car and escape as Nathan's agents arrive at the scene. The Hunter tells Noah that they found Claire's car parked nearby. Noah goes to confront Claire about the lie; she retorts that she learned from \\"The Master\\" Noah. He maintains that bad things will happen if he can't control Claire anymore, but she asserts her independence from him and drives off. At home, while Noah is out, Claire tells Sandra the truth about Noah and his mission of capturing everybody with ability and she also tells her that the prisoners were drugged and wearing hoods over their faces and she was there (Ironically, she also suffered the same fate as the prisoners she mentioned earlier, but she wasn't meant to be a prisoner), and eavesdrops as Noah and Sandra have it out, with Noah turning the subject to make it about Claire. Noah later tells Claire that Sandra had kicked him out of the house for a while, and then says he wants to change and not keep so many secrets. A tearful Claire realizes how far she took the truth and hugs her father. Claire takes a sleeping bag to Alex, who is hiding in her closet, after Noah leaves. In \\"Exposed\\", Sandra discovers Alex hiding in Claire's closet. After berating their actions, Sandra decides to help them. When two of Nathan's agents search the house to find Alex, Claire and Sandra manage to get rid of them after convincing them that Alex wasn't there, when in fact he was hiding in Noah's secret crawlspace. That night, Sandra and Lyle \\"go out to a movie\\" to distract the agents to buy escape time for Claire and Alex. With the agents on their trail, Claire and Alex hide underwater in a neighbor's pool, where he kisses her to give her some oxygen. After Alex escapes, Claire and Sandra congratulate themselves with popcorn and a \\"sappy love story,\\" as Sandra describes her movie choice. Claire goes to get the popcorn, only to find the microwave empty and Eric Doyle standing in front of her. Doyle explains that he needs Claire's help, as \\"Rebel\\" had texted him, too: \\"CLAIRE WILL SAVE YOU.\\" In \\"Shades of Gray\\", Claire debates the idea of helping Eric Doyle escape the government agents. She applies for Alex Woolsley's former position at Sam's Comics as a cover to help more people with abilities to start over. As she leaves the store, Rebel sends her a text message telling her that Doyle was presently being captured by the agents. Despite reservations, she helps him and gives him a chance to escape. This, however, endangers her status with the government agents. Later that night, Rebel warns her that her free pass has been revoked (presumably since Danko now knows of her biological father's flight ability) and that the agents were going to capture her. She is saved by her biological father, Nathan Petrelli, and they are seen floating together outside of her house as agents search it. In \\"Into Asylum\\", Nathan flies Claire to Patzcuaro, Mexico, where Nathan reveals Claire's free pass was revoked because he was exposed to Danko. They check into a nearby motel with the last of their money, and she later meets her father at the cantina with a wad of cash she got from selling Noah Bennet's necklace, and asks why Nathan gave her a free pass. Nathan gambles away their money by doing a last-man-standing competition from downing shots of tequila, forcing Claire to win it back by betting Nathan's watch and downing the shots of tequila herself, without any consequence due to her abilities. That night at the motel, Nathan, still coming down from his buzz, tells Claire that he gave her a free pass hoping to win her over in one move, and that he is willing to fix what he has wrought. Claire tells him that she has wondered about her real dad over the years, and when she met Nathan he'd surpassed her every expectation she had. She says that he has the ability to do anything before going outside to think, and is later joined by her biological father. Nathan, having pawned his watch, puts Noah Bennet's necklace back around her neck. They leave Mexico together. In \\"Turn and Face the Strange\\", after a message from Peter and Angela, Nathan and Claire make plans to meet up with them at an abandoned settlement known as Coyote Sands. When they arrive, Peter visibly displays his anger and distrust toward Nathan, while Claire breaks up the fight. Angela tells them that they will be digging for answers, literally, and she hands out shovels; the family digs well into the night. Shortly after Nathan uncovers a human skull buried underground, Claire spots a vehicle coming to a stop near their digging site. Noah Bennet gets out of the vehicle and joins his adoptive daughter and her biological family as Angela plans to reveal the truth. In \\"1961,\\" Angela is finally revealing to Claire, Noah, and her sons Nathan and Peter the secrets that have haunted her for over 4 decades. When a violent storm suddenly hits Coyote Sands, Angela goes out to face her demons. When Claire ventures outside seconds later, the storm has subsided, and Angela is nowhere in sight. After reconciling with each other, Noah and Claire, along with Nathan, continue to search the settlement, while Peter and Mohinder (who had heard of his father's involvement) find her in the underground shelter of Angela's younger sister, Alice, who is revealed to be the source of the violent storms that ravaged the settlement. The group leaves Mohinder behind to confront his own demons and reconvenes at the eatery where teenage Angela had danced with a young Charles Deveaux in 1961, the night of \\"Hurricane Alice.\\" Nathan tells Claire that he is going to own up to his mistakes and talk to the President. Claire notices on TV that another Nathan is already at a press conference doing the same thing. Nathan can't believe it, while Noah recognizes the fake Nathan as Sylar. In \\"I Am Sylar\\", with Peter having taken off to search for Nathan, Claire is shown with Angela and Noah in his vehicle. They are stopped at a roadblock and swarmed by agents. In \\"An Invisible Thread\\", Claire and Angela are shown to have escaped Noah's vehicle just before the car is swarmed with agents. Claire meets up with Nathan, and is instantly suspicious of his identity, especially when 'Nathan' fidgets with Noah Bennet's necklace. Claire's suspicions are confirmed when 'Nathan' starts taking control of her body and reverts into Sylar. Sylar then takes on Claire's form. When Noah calls her, Sylar/Claire answers the phone and tells him that Nathan is indeed Nathan, only to revert to himself and taunt Noah. Sylar then attempts again to sway Claire to his side of things, and lists things they have in common (both were adopted, both can't die), and taunts that Claire will grow bored of trying to kill him. He flings Claire out of the room just as Nathan and Peter arrive. When the Petrelli brothers go to battle Sylar, Claire is locked out of the room. After things quiet down, she enters the room to find it a mess, and Peter flies in. Claire and Peter go to search for Nathan and Sylar, only to run into an armed Noah, who wonders if Claire is Sylar in disguise. Claire proves it's really her just as agents hold them at gunpoint, and since they don't believe Noah's suspicions about Sylar, Claire saunters up to the guards and threatens them. That night, Claire, Noah, Matt, Hiro, Ando, 'Nathan,' Peter, and Angela are gathered around a burning centerpiece as they watch the cremation of \\"Sylar.\\" Redemption In part one, \\"Orientation,\\" Claire is starting college in Arlington, Virginia, where she meets her roommate Annie (Rachel Melvin). Annie tells Claire to plan her life as she has done, which she calls a \\"trajectory,\\" and asks what Claire's parents do; Claire tells her that Sandra breeds champion show dogs and Noah works for the government; Annie assumes that's how Claire got in. Whilst touring the campus, Claire meets Gretchen Berg (Madeline Zima), who to her surprise recognizes Claire from the Union Wells High homecoming disaster three years ago (see \\"Homecoming\\"). Claire and Annie meet again as they take their placement test for an advanced algebra class. Claire wakes from a nightmare in which one of Emile Danko's former agents tranquilizes her in the middle of the test and walks out, stating that \\"This class isn't for me.\\" As Annie catches a visiting Noah Bennet up on how his daughter is handling college, Claire and Noah have a heart-to-heart about who they want to be; she tells him that she doesn't want to be anybody but herself. Annie invites Claire to a mixer that night, where Claire meets up with Gretchen. Annie challenges Claire to a round of Guitar Hero 3, which she brags about kicking butt in. Claire, who doesn't know how to play, agrees on the condition that Gretchen be her opponent. After the mixer, Claire returns to her dorm. She sees that the window is open and goes to close it, only to discover Annie on the ground below, dead, in an apparent suicide. In part 2, \\"Jump, Push, Fall,\\" Claire is interrogated about Annie's suicide by the police in the dorm. After the interrogation, she is too shaken to stay in the dorm and decides to stay with Sandra for the night. Upon her return to college the next day, Claire is questioned again, this time by Gretchen, who debates over whether or not Annie's suicide was actually a suicide or a murder and wonders why Annie would map out her whole life only to end it. Seeing that Claire is unsure, Gretchen meets her in the campus cafeteria with a pile of forensics textbooks and explains the \\"Jump, Push, Fall\\" philosophy that she had learned about from an episode of Crossing Jordan. Gretchen wants to recreate Annie's \\"suicide\\" with a dead-body dummy, which later that night gives Claire the idea to recreate it herself...as the dead body in question. Relying on \\"Jump, Push, Fall,\\" Claire hurls herself off of her dorm window and lands in the spot where Annie's body was, and comes to the conclusion that Annie had, in fact, committed suicide. Claire puts herself back together and slides her ribcage back into place, only to discover that Gretchen had been watching. In \\"Ink\\", Claire is constantly pushed by Gretchen to admit that she had slid her ribcage back into alignment following her fall from the dorm window, and when Claire tries to brush it aside, Gretchen gets annoyed. Noah comes to Claire's dorm to take her out to dinner; Claire accepts, and despite her objections, Gretchen invites herself along. Vaguely referencing Claire but not by name, Gretchen tells Noah about a girl she saw on YouTube who couldn't feel any pain, tipping Noah off that Gretchen knows about Claire. When Gretchen excuses herself, Noah is aghast and motions to call the Haitian to erase Gretchen's memory, but Claire tells him that Gretchen is the only real friend she's made in college so far and threatens to cut him out of her life entirely (no calls or emails) if he calls the Haitian. On the way back to the dorm, Gretchen apologizes and admits that she is pushy, then reveals to Claire that everybody in high school called her \\"Retchin' Gretchen\\" because she was bulimic. Whilst in the dorm, Claire allows Gretchen to cut her (Claire's) hand with a pair of scissors to demonstrate her healing ability, then she decides to make Gretchen her roommate. In \\"Acceptance\\", Claire arrives at Noah's apartment as Peter is leaving. Claire suspects Peter picked up a new power, then checks in on her father to see how he is doing. Worried that Noah \\"Man with the Plan\\" has become \\"plan-less\\" since retiring from The Company and Sandra divorcing him, Claire takes it upon herself to find work for him. When Noah tells her about his usual line of work with The Company involving \\"bagging and tagging\\" for the last 20 years, Claire notes that he is a \\"people person\\" and checks the want ads for jobs relating to his line of work in addition to mock-interviewing him, reminding him that \\"You have to remember who you were to figure out who you want to be.\\" In \\"Hysterical Blindness\\", Claire and Gretchen are invited by a coed named Becky to a mixer to rush a sorority. While Gretchen is getting ready, a book \\"falls\\" off the shelf and when Claire picks it up, she notices Gretchen's computer, which is opened to various photos of Claire, the headline about the Union Wells cheerleader (Jackie Wilcox), and the \\"Jump, Push, Fall\\" philosophy, making Claire suspicious, believing that Gretchen is stalking her. Claire then lets Gretchen go to the mixer by herself, offering to join her later. At the mixer, Claire starts chatting up a fellow sorority rushee, but ends up pushing her out of the way of a flagstaff being thrust down between them. Claire looks up and sees only Gretchen looking nervous. Back at the dorm, Claire confronts Gretchen about what she found on the computer, including the stuff about Annie. Gretchen finally admits to \\"just a little bit\\" stalking Claire, kisses her and then admits to having a crush on her, to Claire's surprise. In the end, Claire and Gretchen are invited to join the sorority, which they do. Unbeknownst to either of them, it was Becky, who has the power of invisibility, who had been acting on Samuel Sullivan's orders to isolate Claire; staging Annie's \\"suicide\\", dropping the book, and thrusting the flagstaff, all to frame Gretchen and sever Claire's relationship with her. In \\"Tabula Rasa\\", Claire visits Noah's apartment to do some laundry; there she asks Noah about his unsuccessful job search when they are interrupted by Peter. When she learns Hiro Nakamura is dying of a brain tumor, she offers her blood to heal him, but Noah tells her that her regenerative blood will only accelerate the growth of the tumor. Peter and Noah leave to look for a healer named Jeremy Greer, leaving Claire to glance at Jeremy's file. In \\"Strange Attractors\\", Claire and Gretchen, as well as two other sorority rushees, are \\"kidnapped\\" by Becky Taylor as part of their initiation, and are sent on a \\"Screamin' Scavenger Hunt\\" through a horror-movie slaughterhouse. Claire and Gretchen talk about their relationship and Gretchen apologizes for kissing her, fueling Claire's curiosity about Gretchen's past relationships. They soon find themselves being attacked by several traps that Claire assumes are meant for Gretchen, fueling Claire's suspicion that maybe their hazing isn't a game. After saving Gretchen from choking to death on another trap, Claire and the other girls are attacked by an unseen force. When Claire, who was thrown against a stake on the wall, manages to hit the force, Becky rematerializes in front of the girls and takes off, going invisible and closing the doors she goes through. When Gretchen pulls Claire off of the stake, Claire heals in full view of all three rushees, freaking out everybody except Gretchen, who asks Claire what their next move will be since the rushees saw Claire heal, thus eliminating Claire's chances of a normal life. The \\"Genesis\\" Claire is shown in \\"Once Upon a Time in Texas\\" when Hiro Nakamura travels back to this time period to save waitress Charlie Andrews. Claire is amongst the Union Wells Wildcats cheerleaders, including Jackie Wilcox, cheering their team to victory against San Antonio when she spots her father Noah looking on. Noah expresses his regrets about not being able to attend the homecoming game, but Claire tells him not to worry about it, and that they can hang out whenever they want to. Noah then lets her rejoin the cheerleaders. In \\"Shadowboxing\\", Claire is determined to get answers about the sorority rush attacks. She convinces Noah and the Haitian to intervene to help her. When they arrive at the dorm, Claire is surprised to see Gretchen packing. Despite Claire's attempts to get her to stay, Gretchen is too scared for her life and leaves. After Claire gets the Haitian to accompany Gretchen, she is visited by Samuel Sullivan, who seems to understand what she and Becky Taylor are going through because of their abilities. That night, Claire tries to defuse an ensuing brawl between Noah and an invisible Becky, which ends when Samuel hits Becky with a taser. Noah walks Claire back to the dorm and tells her how special she is, to which Claire corrects him by saying she's \\"extraordinary.\\" Afterwards, whilst trying to sleep, Claire becomes restless and feels more alone than ever without Gretchen around. In \\"Brother's Keeper\\", Claire, still reeling from Gretchen's departure and the revelations regarding Samuel and Becky, arrives at Noah's apartment with a basket of laundry when she encounters Tracy Strauss, who had earlier force-frozen her way in. Claire arms herself but calms down and listens to Tracy, and gets her in a hot tub before making hot tea. Tracy only continues to lose control over her power and accidentally freezes Claire completely. Tracy tries to drag the frozen Claire into the hot tub but Claire's icy foot breaks off in her hands. Claire heals, however, surprising a hysterical Tracy. After everything calms down, Claire suggests that Tracy's problem is psychological rather than physical and that this is why Tracy cannot control her ability. Tracy and Claire talk about Samuel Sullivan and his offer for them to join the Sullivan Bros. Carnival, and Claire, whilst unsure of Samuel's offer herself, advises Tracy to take him up on the offer if she wants to break free of her old life, which she believes Tracy's body is telling her. Tracy is happy to find a confidant in Claire because of their abilities and how hard it is to trust people in the outside world, causing Claire to feel a pang of guilt, presumably over Gretchen. Noah returns home and after noticing Claire's severed frozen foot on the coffee table asks the women how their day was. In \\"Thanksgiving\\", Noah Bennet hosts a Thanksgiving dinner at his apartment, which Claire attends, along with Sandra and her new boyfriend Doug, who bring with them Mr. Muggles and Doug's dog Ms. Lovegood; and Lauren Gilmore, Noah's ex-Company partner and ex-flame. Over Thanksgiving dinner, everyone goes around the table to say what they're thankful for. When Claire's turn to give thanks comes, Claire states that she isn't feeling the mood of Thanksgiving and announces that she is dropping out of school, shocking everyone. Claire explains that she is sick of lying and hiding her powers and being a freak, defending her argument by saying that \\"People don't like freaks!\\". When Doug tries to explain the normalcy of Claire's feelings, Claire snaps and cuts open her arm for all at the table to see, causing Doug to pass out. After everything calms down, Claire looks at Noah's corkboard of newspaper clippings detailing the Samuel-induced collapsing of the police station (see \\"Strange Attractors\\") and the New York mansion (see \\"Ink\\") and is disappointed that Noah is slipping back into his old life and treating her like a child. Noah answers a knock at the door, and Claire is surprised and happy to find that Gretchen had come. When everyone is leaving, Claire tells Noah that she has decided to return to classes starting Monday. Claire meets Gretchen in the car and reveals that she had taken the compass that almost got Noah killed, and, despite Gretchen's reservations about Becky, tells Gretchen that they are going on a journey to the Sullivan Bros. Carnival. In \\"The Fifth Stage\\", Claire and Gretchen continue their journey. Claire receives a call from Noah admonishing her for taking the compass and going down a potentially dangerous road. When the girls arrive at the Sullivan Bros. Carnival, Claire begins to get cold feet believing that Becky is there, at which point they are greeted by Samuel. The girls tour the carnival, where Gretchen notices a man using his power to rip off a burly guy throwing balls at a pyramid stack of milk bottles, only to let a little girl win the prize. They arrive at a campfire where Samuel is telling a story to a group of kids, where Claire reunites with a now-clean-shaven Eric Doyle, who reveals that the new life he got from Claire during the \\"Fugitives\\" arc didn't work out so well until Samuel found him and took him into the Carnival, and tells her that they should talk. Samuel convinces Claire to tell the kids a story of her own, and she tells it based on her own life, personifying herself as a frog with a mother (Sandra), father (Noah), and a tadpole (Mr. Muggles), though she doesn't mention Lyle. Claire attempts to break up a fight between Samuel and the burly man who was ripped off at the milk bottles, who then shatters a glass and slashes Claire across her cheek. Claire's wound heals in seconds, scaring off the burly man, and Claire then tends to Samuel's wounds. As Samuel explains why he didn't fight back, he tells Claire that she has a purpose in the Carnival, and she seems convinced. Outside, Claire tells Gretchen that she is going to stay at the Carnival for a few days to figure out her purpose, and gives Gretchen a tearful goodbye hug before walking toward Samuel and Lydia. Samuel gives his next eulogy at Joseph's gravesite, where the members of the Carnival are in attendance; Claire is shown among them, and she and Samuel share a smile, indicating that she may be joining the Carnival after all, while remaining oblivious to Samuel's true intentions. In \\"Upon This Rock\\", Claire has joined the Carnival, and is made nervous by Eli, the replicating man. Lydia tells her about him, then has Claire deliver some blueberry muffins to Samuel for brownie points. She walks in as Samuel covers Noah's Primatech files and becomes suspicious. Samuel tells Claire that he is going into the city to pick up someone for his plan and tells Claire that it is her choice whether or not to stay. However, when he leaves Claire, Samuel implies to Eli that he is to make Claire stay. Claire spots Eli again at the tables, then overhears Lydia and Amanda arguing. She strikes up a conversation with Lydia and asks why Samuel wanted them here. Lydia tells her that Samuel is obsessed with building his \\"family\\", but she doesn't tell her why. Claire knocks on Samuel's trailer, but is confronted by Eli and his clones, who tell her that Samuel is away. Claire carries a box full of stuffed animals to the attraction only to cross paths with Eli and his clones again. She runs away into the house of mirrors, and Eli and his clones move to trap her inside. Claire uses the mirrors to fool Eli and make her attack, then runs to Samuel's trailer and peruses the Primatech files, where she finds a map of the Valley and a photo of a teenaged Samuel and Joseph. She is then puppeteered by a crazy Doyle, who believes her to be a spy and angrily tells her that she will not ruin his new life at the Carnival. Claire is attempting to convince an unflinching Doyle that Samuel is twisted and evil, as Doyle explains how Joseph helped him change, then lets Claire go, telling her to talk to Lydia. She does, and Lydia tells her that Joseph, not Samuel, was the one in charge, and that she misses Joseph. Lydia chokes up, and Claire realizes that Samuel killed his own brother. Lydia begs Claire to find somebody to stop Samuel. After her conversation with Lydia, Claire is once again attacked by Eli and his clones. Samuel returns to the fray, and reminds her of her choice, and Claire demands answers about Joseph. Samuel tells her about Emile Danko and how Joseph exposed them to the government, comparing him to Noah Bennet, and Claire asks about the Valley. Samuel shows her Ian, a man who can create gardens, and Claire watches as Ian uses his power to grow grass and vegetation around the rock at an accelerated rate, transforming the Valley into a lush landscape. Samuel explains his plan to Claire, who decides she wants to go back to her regular home, and Samuel agrees, but he tells her that they will always welcome her back if something should go wrong. Checking her phone, Claire receives voicemails from Noah and Peter Petrelli wanting to talk to her. Claire gets out of a cab at the memorial service of Nathan Petrelli and tells Noah that she is keeping the compass. In \\"Let It Bleed\\", after the memorial, Noah visits Claire and offers to give her a ride, however, Claire declines, sick of being lied to, and realizes that Sylar killed Nathan and that Noah had a hand in transforming Sylar into Nathan, and is upset at having been fooled all this time. Claire rejoins the funeral wake and reunites with Peter, and they walk into the kitchen together. While they cut up some food, Claire cuts her finger in anger, and discovers that she is not healing. She stalls Peter from getting The Haitian to stop using his power so that she can experience the normalcy of feeling pain, and remembers West Rosen, whom she dated in the \\"Generations\\" arc, and how he could fly, like Nathan. Later, Claire confronts Angela about her disappointment over Angela and Noah's deception; Angela tells Claire that Peter is on the roof, and begs her to help him grieve for Nathan's loss. Claire finds a police scanner and overhears a bearing, realizing that Peter is out to avenge Nathan. Claire confronts Peter about his intentions and tells her to suppress the bleeding of a woman named Wendy, who tells them of a crazy man named Adam Malamut. Claire tries to talk Peter out of his mission, but he refuses and leaves her to tend to Wendy. Claire is then confronted by the man himself, but Peter directs his attention to him and watches as he tries to calm the man down. He shoots Peter, and the wounded Peter wants Claire to continue the mission. After Peter copies Claire's power, Claire reminds him that Nathan would have been angry at how Peter is handling the situation, and they comfort each other and mourn together. Peter and Claire sit together on a rooftop, where Peter promises to be honest with Claire. Peter then asks Claire to call West. Claire returns to her dorm and discovers a note from Gretchen, then checks her phone, unaware that Sylar is hovering outside her dorm window. In \\"Pass/Fail\\", Claire is back at Arlington University with Gretchen. Claire apologetically rebuffs attempts to get close to Gretchen, then leaves to attend an evaluation with one of her professors. She arrives at the room expecting her professor, but discovers Sylar instead having scribbled \\"Why Claire Bennet\\" all over one side of the chalkboard. Sylar tells Claire that she needs to help him as he \\"hasn't been quite himself\\" lately, owing to his time spent as Nathan Petrelli. Claire angrily refuses, but Sylar mentions how much alike they are, having both been abandoned by their birth parents and adopted by parents who didn't understand them, refusing to get close to people because of their abilities. Holding Gretchen's fate over her head, Sylar telekinetically pins Claire onto a table and kisses her, calling Lydia's ability. Fearing for Gretchen, Claire stabs Sylar in the eye and races across campus back to her dorm, where she finds Gretchen bound and gagged on the floor. After rescuing her, Claire tells her how alike she and Sylar are. However, the Gretchen in the closet with Claire is really Sylar, who reiterates his problem of identity confusion. Claire enters the cafeteria where she finds the real Gretchen, exactly as she left her. Claire apologizes for trying to keep Gretchen at arm's length, and tells her that she \\"wants to hold [her] hand,\\" signifying their close relationship, and the girls begin to rebond with one another. In \\"The Art of Deception\\", Claire goes to visit Noah at his apartment but runs into Lauren instead, and realizes Noah had left for the Carnival. Despite prodding from Gretchen to leave it alone, Claire drives up to the Carnival. Whilst there, Claire negotiates a peaceful surrender for Samuel, which is rendered moot when gunshots ring out, killing Lydia and wounding Claire and Samuel. Eli arrives with a semi-conscious Noah and pins the blame on the Bennets, and Samuel has Noah imprisoned in the house of mirrors and Claire in Samuel's trailer. In \\"The Wall\\", Samuel decides to show Claire Noah's secret past in an attempt to sway her to his cause. She is taken to the house of mirrors and finally learns the truth about him, and is aghast to discover that Noah had a wife before Sandra, that Noah's joining the Company stems from his wife being murdered by a special, and that more recently, Noah had threatened Gretchen and told her what would happen if Claire stuck with the Carnival. Claire storms out of the house of mirrors to calm down, but Noah is taken to the souvenir trailer. Claire goes to free him, but as she does so, Samuel uses his powers to bury them deep under the earth. In \\"Brave New World\\", Claire and Noah are still trapped underground in the souvenir trailer, with the Carnival having gone to Central Park. Noah warns Claire that digging faster will only deplete their oxygen faster, and tells her that she is down there so that she can watch him die. Claire cries and tells him that she wants to protect him like he's done with her, but he rebuffs this, stating that it's not her job. As things begin to look bleak, Tracy Strauss coalesces into the trailer and manages to get them out from underneath and back to the surface, where they meet up with Lauren. They go to the Carnival in Central Park, where Claire goes to rally the carnies as Noah goes after Samuel; neither are aware that Peter and Sylar are there as well. No one will listen to Claire until she brings up that it was Samuel who killed Joseph. Edgar, having previously threatened Noah at knifepoint, arrives at the meeting to back Claire's side of the story, and Eli, brainwashed by Matt Parkman, admits to killing Lydia and framing Noah. As Samuel and Peter (who had copied Samuel's power) cause a tremor, Hiro Nakamura and Ando Masahashi arrive. Ando supercharges Hiro's power so that Hiro is able to teleport everybody away, knowing it will brutally weaken Samuel. Claire is teleported away with everyone but Peter and Sylar, who save Emma Coolidge from Eric Doyle; and Noah, who goes after Samuel. Brave New World Picking up from where Volume Five ended, Volume Six begins in the same episode of the same title, with Claire reuniting with Noah. Claire expresses that Samuel was right about the Heroes one day living freely amongst others. Despite Noah's protests, Claire goes to climb to the top of the Ferris wheel, watched by Noah, Lauren, Peter, Sylar, Hiro, Ando, Emma, and the press, who have arrived to cover Samuel's arrest. To everybody's shock, Claire performs her trademark swan-dive off the top of the wheel and faceplants on the ground. She then gets up and exhibits her power in front of everyone, and says to the camera, \\"My name is Claire Bennet, and this is attempt number... I guess I've kind of lost count.\\" Heroes Reborn While Claire doesn't make any appearance in Heroes Reborn, she nevertheless becomes a central character to the events that are now taking place and is mentioned several times. In \\"Dark Matters\\", Hero Truther shows the footage of Claire jumping off the Ferris wheel and goes over the aftermath of it including how other Evos revealed their powers in similar manners. In \\"Brave New World\\", it is revealed that she and Noah now have a strained relationship and haven't spoken since her public reveal. Noah calls her to renew the relationship between the two, and while she didn't answer, Noah leaves a voicemail for Claire to meet him in Odessa during the Evo Summit on June 13. Noah was present at the Summit when it was bombed and he believes Claire was there too and that she died in the attack. One year later, in \\"Odessa\\", Quentin shows Noah, who had somehow lost his memory, documentation that reveals Claire was not at the summit as they had originally believed. In \\"Under the Mask\\", while Luke and Joanne are driving, a man on the radio states how he wishes that when Claire jumped off of the Ferris wheel, that she would have just died instead of had an ability. Later, Noah watches security footage of himself in a morgue on June 13 with what appears to be Claire's body. Believing that Claire instead died at the hospital, despite her ability to heal, Noah ventures out to find Molly Walker for answers. In \\"The Needs of the Many\\", Molly Walker tells Noah that she remembers being at St. Jude's Hospital on June 13, 2014 and watched Claire die, but she doesn't elaborate much more and the mystery surrounding Claire's death remained as Molly soon after killed herself. In \\"The Lion's Den\\", Noah confronts directly Erica Kravid and asks her if she killed Claire, but Erica insists that she had nothing to do with Claire's death. In \\"Game Over\\", Emily Duval claims to Tommy Clark that superheroes were once adored, but then \\"a girl jumped off a Ferris wheel in New York\\" and brought about superheroes as a reality. After rescuing Hiro Nakamura from Evernow, Noah asks Hiro to take him back in time to the Odessa Unity Summit to find out the truth of what happened there and save Claire. Though reluctant, Hiro eventually agrees and the two travel back to the summit. In \\"June 13 - Part 1\\", The future Noah discovers that Claire was in fact at the summit that day and when he's found by Angela, who thinks him to be the present Noah, discovered that she was rushed to the hospital before the bombing for surgery. As both rush the hospital, they are informed Claire has died of cardiac arrest from a traumatic seizure. Future Noah can't understand how Claire died since her ability should've brought her back, but is faced with the unexpected revelation that Claire had died giving birth to fraternal twins, a brother and sister. Future Noah visits Claire's body in the morgue and says an emotional goodbye to her. Afterwards, Angela tells him that Claire's children must be protected as they hold the key to saving the world. Future Noah realizes he had his memory erased to protect Claire's children from Erica Kravid and it worked as she is still looking for them. Future Noah decides to erase all the security footage showing the children to protect them and that their safest place is in the past which will give them time to grow up and gain their abilities so they can save the world. Angela has Hiro take her and the twins back to 1999 to raise the children there and Future Noah and Angela name the children as Claire never got to. Angela names Claire's son Nathan after Claire's father and Angela's lost son and Noah names Claire's daughter Malina after his mother. Shortly after the bombing, Tommy Clark celebrates his fifteenth birthday with his mother Anne, the nurse who told Noah and Angela about Claire's death. Tommy is revealed to be Claire's son Nathan. In \\"June 13 - Part 2\\", Angela realizes how Claire died: the newborn Nathan has the same power absorption abilities that his great-grandfather Arthur Petrelli and to a lesser extent his grand-uncle Peter had. While still an infant, he took Claire's powers which allowed her to die during childbirth. However, as Nathan can only keep one ability at a time, unlike his great- grandfather, he lost her abilities soon after her death when he took Hiro's power. Afterwards, Angela raises Claire's daughter Malina while Hiro raises Nathan himself. In \\"Sundae, Bloody Sundae\\", Tommy Clark, who is really Claire's son Nathan, is told of his true history which had been erased from his mind by Caspar Abraham to protect him. Tommy is left stunned that he's Claire's son and Hiro's step-son. In \\"Company Woman\\", Claire's daughter Malina and Luke Collins go to Union Wells High School to draw Tommy Clark, Claire's son there to meet with Malina. Walking through the school, Malina comes across a picture of Claire in her cheerleading uniform in the trophy case and comments on how beautiful Claire was. When she broadcasts a message to Tommy, Malina refers to Union Wells as the place Claire went to school when asking him to meet her. Alternate futures *In the alternate future of \\"Five Years Gone\\", Claire has been hidden from the world by Mr. Bennet due to the world's newfound awareness and fear of those with special powers, having been shipped from place to place in an effort to keep her identity and whereabouts secret from her biological father and his \\"hero\\"-hunting Department of Homeland Security. She works as a brunette waitress in Midland, Texas, in the Burnt Toast Diner, under the alias of \\"Sandra\\". She discusses an upcoming wedding with her blond-haired fianc√©, Andy (Kellan Lutz). However, upon learning that others are aware of Claire's existence, Mr. Bennet travels to Midland in order to once again erase Claire from the map. Although he succeeds in persuading her to pack up and leave, he is later betrayed by the merciless Matt Parkman, who telepathically discovers Claire's location and apprehends her at the diner. Claire is taken to the Petrelli Mansion in New York, where she is visited by Nathan Petrelli. Nathan explains the necessity of the sweeping presidential measures he's taken against the genetically-advanced of the world. Though simply disgusted with her father at first, the situation takes a turn for the worse when \\"Nathan\\" reveals himself to be Sylar in disguise. He has killed both Nathan and Candice Wilmer, using her power of illusion to masquerade as Nathan. Sylar then telekinetically scalps Claire, but it is unknown if this killed her (given she was able to survive a similar encounter with Sylar in the 'normal' timeline). *In the alternate future of \\"The Second Coming\\", Claire is revealed to have black hair and a deep hatred of the oppression of evolved humans in that timeline. She encounters the future Peter, planning to kill him with a gun, but he stops time to avoid the bullet and teleports into the past. Before she shoots, she states that she always loved him. This version of Claire appears once more in \\"I Am Become Death\\", where she immediately shoots down Future Peter, whose powers are negated by the presence of the Haitian, and turns her attention to Present Peter. It is revealed that she is working alongside the Haitian, as well as Knox and Daphne Millbrook, to capture and/or kill Peter, who has been labeled as a terrorist. After Sylar's loss of control destroys Costa Verde, she captures Peter and begins to torture him with a scalpel in retribution for the deaths of the Costa Verde citizens, but doesn't get very far with it and leaves when Nathan arrives to speak with his brother alone. Peter's encounter with Future Claire continues to haunt him following his return to the present, to the extent that he attempted to force Present Claire to leave him alone even when he had lost his own powers in order to prevent her from becoming like her future self. Powers and abilities Claire can spontaneously regenerate any tissue in her body, allowing her to recover from almost any injury within seconds to minutes ‚Äî though she does need larger objects, embedded foreign objects (such as a branch or a shard of glass) to be manually removed from her body, or bones pushed back into position for the wounds to heal properly. Although Sylar, after studying and taking her power, remarks that he wouldn't be able to kill her even if he wanted to and that she will never die, writers Joe Pokaski and Aron Coleite have confirmed that methods such as decapitation or incineration would indeed kill her. On the other hand, she has survived nuclear explosions in \\"Company Man\\" and \\"I Am Become Death\\". In addition to simple healing, Claire has been shown to regenerate at least small extremities. In the second- season episode \\"Lizards\\", she experiments with the limits of her powers, cutting off a toe. A new toe rapidly grows into place. When her blood is injected into others, they are also healed, even if they were dead for a while, with no apparent ill-effects. In the graphic novel \\"Resistance\\", dark future-Claire is able to regenerate her entire right arm after detonating a grenade during a terrorist raid while working as an HLS agent. In the episode \\"Into Asylum\\" Claire reveals that she cannot become intoxicated. She has a drinking contest with a man to get more money for her and her father, Nathan. She drinks over 20 shots and does not demonstrate any signs of being intoxicated. She pretends to be drunk to hide her ability from the man. She later points out to Nathan that her tissue regeneration extends to internal organs like her liver. Thanks to her power, she has an incredibly high pain tolerance; Claire states in \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" that, when injured, she feels pain just as severe as anyone else who was injured in such a way, but her power quickly deadens pain. When asked about this, series writers Joe Pokaski and Aron Coleite would only comment that she \\"feels pain, but not the way most of us do.\\" Claire, describing her response to pain to West, says \\"I feel pain; I just get over it quickly.\\" Between her tolerance for pain and seemingly unlimited healing potential, Hayden Panettiere compares her character to the X-Men character Wolverine, although she is \\"less hairy and without claws.\\" Since having her brain examined by Sylar, Claire has stated that she no longer feels physical pain of any kind. With the temporary loss of her powers in \\"The Eclipse\\", it is shown that Claire's abilities protect her from diseases, although this also leaves her natural immune system weak, as she has not built up a resistance to any sickness. It is revealed in \\"Tabula Rasa\\" that her injected blood cannot cure tumors; her rapid cell reproduction would actually accelerate a tumor's growth due to it being living tissue. In \\"Brother's Keeper\\" Claire is able to continue regeneration even after being accidentally frozen by Tracy Strauss; she thaws out and her frozen foot, which had broken off in Tracy's hands, is replaced with another foot that regenerates, going beyond Claire's experimentation in \\"Lizards\\" in which she cut off her pinky toe from the same foot. In \\"June 13 - Part 1\\", Claire dies of cardiac arrest after having a seizure while giving birth to her children Nathan and Malina. She doesn't revive which shocks Noah as her ability should've brought her back and her weak spot is not damaged. In Part 2, Angela realizes that Claire's son Nathan has power absorption abilities and absorbed Claire's powers, resulting in her permanent death in childbirth. Casting Marc Hirschfeld, executive vice president of casting for NBC Universal Television stated, \\"When they were trying to decide who the cheerleader should be, I literally picked up the phone and said to the producers, 'You've got to meet Hayden Panettiere.How the 'Heroes' cheerleader got the part In an interview with Vanity Fair, Emma Stone revealed that she had auditioned for the role of Claire Bennet. She said it was her rock bottom Hollywood moment; She overheard \\"You are our pick ... On a scale of 1 to 10 you‚Äôre an 11\\" and then she realised the role had gone to Hayden Panettiere. Reception Panettiere received very positive reviews for her work on the show all throughout the series run, constantly being referred to as a \\"breakout star\\". Claire is also arguably one of the most popular characters on the show. UGO Networks listed Claire as one of their best heroes of all time.

In 1998, Transnistria's first commercial channel, \\"TSV\\" (Television of Free Choice) was started.\\"TV and Radio: freedom of speech?\\" Cable network operator \\"MultiTV\\" carries 24 television channels for its \\"premium\\" package and 5 channels for \\"social\\" package. Moldovan TV stations from outside Transnistria are not available through cable but can be seen via an aerial. However ProTV and NIT, two private channels based in Chi≈üinƒÉu, was introduced to on most cable networks in Transnistria from September 2009 and 1 November 2007 respectively. Telecommunications Internet Internet media is both stateowned and privately operated. In Russian, the websites include Dniester.Ru (news agency), Olvia Press (official state news agency), Tiraspol Info (news aggregator), Pridnestrovie.info. Many political organizations and government departments also have their own news services and online news pages, not listed here. dniester.ru has been blocked by Transnistrian authorities since November 8, 2012 according to the website. In August 2014, Yevgeny Shevchuk issued a decree on combating extremism that empowered the Transnistrian KGB to request the prosecutor's office to block internet content. Authorities would take such a determination following a review by a panel appointed by the KGB. Media freedom and pluralism Transnistrian media environment is restrictive, and is dominated numerically by state-owned media (e.g. Pridnestrovie and Dnestrovskaya Pravda, which are the region major newspapers), or by media controlled through public institutions, such as State Tele-radio Company and State Service media. They are subsidized, heavily politicized, and do not criticize the authorities. Sheriff company dominates the private media market, including private broadcasting, cable television, and internet service. Sheriff represents a \\"so-called opposition\\" according to IPRE. According to an IREX report they serve the interest of the company. There are some independent newspapers or magazines, with small circulation and little advertising, but they have been able to create a space of freedom of expression. They receive threats from the authorities, that sometimes even take direct control. The government hinders critical media and journalists are intimidated. Since 2014 government agencies, private organizations, and citizens are required to report instances of \\"extremist\\" material online. Journalists expressing opinions different from those of the media owners are easily dismissed. Self-censorship is practised, with local press avoiding subjects questioning the Transnistrian goal of independence or criticizing the pro-Russian foreign policy. Media of Moldova have little presence in Transnistria, being available mainly in Tiraspol. Moldovan channels are blocked. Moldovan journalists need accreditation to enter the country, and they are sometimes denied entrance or detained. In 2015 activist and journalist Serghei Ilcenko was detained for four months. The Transnistrian KGB then warned other activists who were accused of having posted \\"extremist messages\\" on the internet and, in general, warned internet users to trust only official sources, and not to contest Transnistrian independence. On September 1, 2014 Transnistrian ‚Äúpolice‚Äù detained a television crew from Publika Television while travelling to a school in Corjova village to produce a piece on the first day of school at a Latin script school. Transnistrian police detained the crew on the grounds that they lacked a special authorization from the Transnistrian Security Service. After a few hours of interrogation, police released the crew. Transnistrian propaganda In 2006, The Economist reported that an alleged propagandistic campaign, aimed at English-speaking audience had been underway. This was done through an agency entitled the \\"International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty\\" (ICDISS).article in \\"The Economist\\" It was claimed in The Economist that the ICDISS had links to a number of English-language websites that were all pro- Transnistrian but had very few details about how and where they are produced. In particular, it highlighted the Wikipedia article on the group, Pridnestrovie.net and Visitpmr.com. The latter two are both described as \\"propaganda sites for Transdniestria\\".The Economist August 3rd 2006 pridnestrovie.net and visitpmr.com have acknowledged help from the ICDISS . The ICDISS email is run by someone self-named Ms Stephenson, also interviewed in tiraspoltimes.com.  International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty The council is credited with producing a report in support of Transdniestrian independence. All but one of the alleged authors of the report has since denied involvement in the study. The case has provoked suspicions among Western officials like Louis O'Neill, the head of the OSCE Mission to Moldova. Journalist Edward Lucas, who wrote the original \\"Economist\\" story about the organization, says he could find little information about the think tank. \\"What's really remarkable is that nobody's been able to produce any credible proof or verifiable proof that they have any existence,\\" Lucas says.,\\"Economist\\" - comments by Edward Lucas Pridnestrovie.net The websites quote a number of Westerners marvelling at Tiraspol's new football stadium or saying Transdniester is the French Riviera compared to Moldova proper. Quotes from the site: It has a free market economy, 200% growth, and a multi-party democracy with the opposition in control of parliament. Tiraspol Times (tiraspoltimes.com) Tiraspol Times was a short lived (2006‚Äì2008) English language news provider focused on Transnistria. It published an online newspaper, a free news feed service, and, according to its own site, a weekly colour magazine and a print newspaper in tabloid format available at \\"select locations\\" in Transnistria, but not abroad and with no subscription available. It professed to be \\"committed to the truth\\" and whose content was largely dedicated to effusive praise of the government or endorsing independence.Archived link Online texts by the Tiraspol Times were licensed as freely distributable. Articles from it have been reprinted by UNPO and by the United Nations' Global Action on Aging,\\"Moldova: Parliament Takes on Smirnov Over Pension Reform\\" , October 10, 2006 as well as various news organizations. Tiraspol Times has been criticised as being strongly biased in favour of the Transnistrian authorities and Transnistrian independence.Radio Free Europe, \\"Moldova: In Cyberspace, Transdniester Doesn't Look That Bad\\", 15 September 2006 A report in the Economist described it as part of a concerted online campaign to promote Transnistria through expertly produced websites, saying that its background and funding were largely undisclosed.Economist, \\"Disinformation: Covering tracks - How to disguise, inflate and disappear on the internet\\", 3 August 2006(same article, no subscription necessary) The Radio Free Europe claims that its content was \\"largely dedicated to effusive praise of the government or endorsing independence\\". while the Economist associates them with ICDISS, which it alleges is an astroturfing attempt. Economist also names Tiraspol Times an online magazine produced \\"expertly, but mysteriously, in support of the authorities\\". The site published few ads and its funding sources are not known. Edward Lucas, a journalist for Economist, suggested it could have received its funding either from the government, from Vladimir Antyufeyev's State Security Committee or from one of the Transnistrian companies. This claim proved to be incorrect as it was in fact owned and funded by Desmond Grant, a prominent Irish newspaper publisher. Tom de Waal, a London-based journalist and author, was outraged to see an article under his name appear on the \\"Tiraspol Times\\" website. \\"I've certainly never been to Pridnestrovie, Transdneister, or Moldova, and I am certainly not arguing, as is written under my name, that Pridnestrovie has a better case for independence than Kosovo,\\" de Waal says.Radio Free Europe - Comments by Tom de Waal  See also  * Telecommunications in Transnistria * Human rights in Transnistria  References   External links  * Media Guide of the Republic of Moldova 2008 (also covers Transnistria.

During his nine years at The Atlantic prior to becoming editor, Goldberg became known for his coverage of foreign affairs. He has won many awards and written eleven cover stories for the magazine. Early life and education Goldberg is Jewish and was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Ellen and Daniel Goldberg, whom he describes as \\"very left-wing.\\" He grew up in suburban Malverne on Long Island, where he recalled being one of the few Jews in a largely Irish-American area. Retroactively, when describing his first trip to the Israeli state as a teen, Goldberg recalled his youth being among pugnacious youth of a different ethnicity. He found the Jewish empowerment embodied by Israeli soldiers exciting, \\"So, I became deeply enamored of Israel because of that.\\" He attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he was editor-in-chief of The Daily Pennsylvanian. While at Penn he worked at the Hillel kitchen serving lunch to students. He left college to move to Israel, where he served in the Israeli Defense Forces as a prison guard during the First Intifada at Ktzi'ot Prison, a prison camp set up to hold arrested Palestinian participants in the uprising. There he met Rafiq Hijazi, a Palestine Liberation Organization leader, college math teacher and devout Muslim from a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, whom Goldberg describes as \\"the only Palestinian I could find in Ketziot who understood the moral justification for Zionism\\". Goldberg lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife, Pamela (n√©e Ress) Reeves, and their three children. Career Goldberg returned to the United States and began his career at The Washington Post, where he was a police reporter. While in Israel, he worked as a columnist for The Jerusalem Post, and upon his return to the US served as the New York bureau chief of The Forward, a contributing editor at New York magazine, and a contributing writer at The New York Times Magazine. In October 2000, Goldberg joined The New Yorker. In 2007, he was hired by David G. Bradley to write for The Atlantic. Bradley had tried to convince Goldberg to come work for The Atlantic for nearly two years, and was finally successful after renting ponies for Goldberg's children. In 2011, Goldberg joined Bloomberg View as a columnist, and his editorials are also syndicated online, often appearing on such media sites as Newsday and Newsmax. Goldberg concluded writing for Bloomberg in 2014. Goldberg was a journalist with The Atlantic before becoming editor-in-chief. Goldberg wrote principally on foreign affairs, with a focus on the Middle East and Africa. Michael Massing, an editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, called Goldberg \\"the most influential journalist/blogger on matters related to Israel,\\"Michael Massing, \\"The News About the Internet\\", New York Book Review Volume 56, Number 13 (August 13, 2009). and David Rothkopf, the CEO and editor of the FP Group, called him \\"one of the most incisive, respected foreign policy journalists around.\\" He has been described by critics as a neoconservative, a liberal, a Zionist and a critic of Israel. The New York Times reported that he \\"shaped\\" the magazine's endorsement of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election, only the third endorsement in the magazine's 160-year history. On May 23, 2019, Goldberg delivered the Commencement address for The Johns Hopkins University Class of 2019. Notable articles \\"The Great Terror\\", The New Yorker, 2002 In \\"The Great Terror\\", Goldberg investigates the nature of the Iraqi Army's chemical attack on the Kurds in Halabja in 1988 that resulted in the deaths of between 3,200 and 5,000 people and injured 7,000 to 10,000 more, most of them civilians. \\"The Great Terror\\" won the Overseas Press Club's Joe & Laurie Dine Award for international human rights reporting. In a March 2002 CNN interview, former CIA director, James Woolsey said, \\"I think Jeff Goldberg's piece is quite remarkable, and he and The New Yorker deserve a lot of credit for it.\\" \\"In the Party of God\\", The New Yorker, 2002 In October 2002, Goldberg wrote a two-part examination of Hezbollah, \\"In the Party of God.\\" Part I recounts his time in the village of Ras al-Ein, located in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, meeting with Hezbollah officials, including Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's former spiritual leader, and Hussayn al-Mussawi, founder of the now-defunct pro-Iranian Islamist militia Islamic Amal in 1982. Part II examines Hezbollah's activities in South America, specifically in the area known as the Triple Frontier, a tri-border area along the junction of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil.\\" In 2003, \\"In the Party of God\\" won the National Magazine Award for reporting.Jeffrey Goldberg, \\"In the Party of God, Part One\\", The New Yorker October 14 and October 21, 2003; accessed January 22, 2007.\\"In the Party of God, Part Two\\", The New Yorker, October 28, 2003; accessed January 22, 2007; searchable database for National Magazine Awards on the website of the American Society of Magazine Editors (2003) \\"The Hunted\\", The New Yorker, 2010 In April 2010, Goldberg published \\"The Hunted\\", a New Yorker article on Mark and Delia Owens, a conservationist couple based in Zambia, who resorted to vigilantism in an effort to stop elephant poachers in North Luangwa National Park. Goldberg chronicles the Owens‚Äô attempts to counter the poachers‚Äô activity in Zambia in the 1970s/80s, which began with creating incentives such as bounty programs for the park‚Äôs scouts, but as the poaching continued, the Owenses methods turned more confrontational. The New York Times columnist Ross Douthat praised \\"The Hunted\\", noting that ‚ÄúGoldberg builds an extensive, persuasive case that the Owenses' much-lauded environmental activism in the Zambian hinterland led to at least one murder, and maybe more.‚Äù \\"The Point of No Return\\", The Atlantic, 2010 In September 2010, Goldberg wrote the cover story for The Atlantic, which examined the potential consequences of an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Based on his interviews with high level Israeli and American government and military officials, including, Benjamin Netanyahu, Shimon Peres, Ephraim Sneh, Ben Rhodes, Rahm Emanuel, and Denis McDonough, Goldberg writes, \\"I have come to believe that the administration knows it is a near-certainty that Israel will act against Iran soon if nothing or no one else stops the nuclear program; and Obama knows‚Äîas his aides, and others in the State and Defense departments made clear to me‚Äîthat a nuclear-armed Iran is a serious threat to the interests of the United States, which include his dream of a world without nuclear weapons.\\" After reading the article, Fidel Castro invited Goldberg to Cuba to talk about the issue. Goldberg published a series of articles on their interviews, including Castro's views about anti-Semitism and Iran, Soviet- style Communism, and theories on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. When asked by Goldberg if the Soviet-style Communism was still worth exporting, Castro famously replied that \\"the Cuban model doesn't even work for us anymore.\\" \\"The Modern King in the Arab Spring\\", The Atlantic, 2013 In April 2013, Goldberg published an article on the Jordanian King Abdullah and his government's approach to reform in the wake of the 2011 protests around the Arab world. In discussing a meeting between the King and the Jordanian tribes, Goldberg quotes the King as saying \\"I'm sitting with the old dinosaurs today.\\" This quote garnered controversy when published, and the King's Royal Court issued a statement claiming the article contained many \\"fallacies\\" and that his words \\"were taken out of their correct context.\\" However, in defending the accuracy of his quotes, Goldberg later tweeted, \\"I just spoke to a top official of the Jordanian royal court. He said they are not contesting the accuracy of quotes in my Atlantic piece.\\" \\"Is It Time for the Jews to Leave Europe?\\", The Atlantic, 2015 In April 2015, Goldberg published \\"Is It Time for the Jews to Leave Europe?\\". Goldberg's essay explores the state of the Jewish communities across Europe, especially in light of the resurgence of anti-Semitism and attacks against Jews in Europe. Historian Diana Pinto, who is of Italian Jewish descent, wrote a rejoinder to Goldberg's article in The New Republic, arguing that his article is excessively dire. She wrote: \\"If a plaster cast may be permitted to speak, I would say that Goldberg and his colleagues aren‚Äôt describing my reality; the world I come from isn't already destroyed; and the story of the Jews in Europe isn't yet ready to be relegated to museums or to antiquarian sites like Pompeii.\\" President Barack Obama President Obama Interviews (2008, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016) Goldberg has conducted five major interviews with President Barack Obama since 2008. Goldberg's interviews have centered around President Obama's views on U.S.-Israel relations, Zionism, the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and other issues concerning U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and North Africa. Peter Baker, the White House correspondent for The New York Times, recommended Goldberg's interviews with President Obama, writing, \\"For much of his time in office, President Obama has been having sort of a running conversation about the Middle East with Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic, one of the premier writers on the region based in Washington. In this latest interview, Mr. Obama defends his approach to the war against the Islamic State, warns Arab leaders not to pursue nuclear programs to match Iran and discusses his feud with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Along the way, Mr. Obama and Mr. Goldberg hash over the nature of the sometimes turbulent Israeli-American relationship.\\" \\"The Obama Doctrine\\", The Atlantic, 2016 In April 2016, Goldberg published \\"The Obama Doctrine\\", which was featured as The Atlantics April 2016 cover story. This essay covers many foreign policy issues, including his views of the U.S. role in Asia, the Middle East, ISIL, Russia, and Europe, focusing on the nature of American leadership in these different regions and the relative power that the United States wields in developing and executing policies that reflect American interests abroad. Goldberg's \\"The Obama Doctrine\\" was praised for its detailed accounting of the president's foreign policy views and sparked a debate about Obama's foreign policy legacy. Brian Katulis, a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress, wrote in The Wall Street Journal, \\"Jeffrey Goldberg's analysis of President Barack Obama‚Äôs foreign policy (\\"The Obama Doctrine\\") is required reading for those looking at the big picture on U.S. national security.\\" In a response piece in The Atlantic, Martin Indyk praised the article, writing, \\"Jeffrey Goldberg‚Äôs fascinating article taps into President Obama's thinking about foreign policy and reveals its wellsprings. In that sense, he does more to help the president define and explain 'the Obama Doctrine' than previous efforts by the White House itself, captured in those memorable lines 'don‚Äôt do stupid shit' and 'leading from behind', which do not do justice to a doctrine that is both complicated and far-reaching in its implications for American foreign policy.\\" Other interviews Goldberg has conducted interviews with President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, David Cameron, John Kerry, Benjamin Netanyahu, Isaac Herzog, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Ashton Carter, Ben Rhodes, Yair Lapid, Michael Oren, King Abdullah of Jordan, Ta-Nehisi Coates, David Gregory, and Tom Cotton, among others. \\"Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are 'Losers' and 'Suckers'\\", The Atlantic, 2020 In September 2020, Goldberg published \\"Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are 'Losers' and 'Suckers'\\". According to Goldberg's essay, in cancelling a 2018 visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial in France, which contains the remains of 2,289 U.S. service members killed in combat in World War I, President Donald Trump privately said, \\"Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers.\\" He also reputedly referred to the more than 1,800 U.S. Marines who lost their lives at the Battle of Belleau Wood as \\"suckers\\" for getting killed. CNN reported that Goldberg's article \\"immediately became a massive story, with Democrats‚Äîincluding Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden‚Äîrushing to condemn Trump for his alleged behavior and the White House rallying an aggressive pushback against the article, including the President himself.\\" Trump tweeted, \\"The Atlantic Magazine is dying, like most magazines, so they make up a fake story in order to gain some relevance. Story already refuted...\\" Referring to Goldberg's \\"blockbuster revelation,\\" the Intelligencer said \\"The scope and intensity of the pushback was nuclear.\\" It added, \\"While it's impossible to directly prove any of these allegations, there is an impressive amount of corroborating evidence. Almost all of it supports Goldberg's reporting,\\" which the Associated Press, The New York Times, Fox News, and The Washington Post \\"quickly confirmed.\\" Prisoners: A Muslim and a Jew Across the Middle East Divide Prisoners: A Muslim and a Jew Across the Middle East Divide (New York: Knopf, 2006), describes Goldberg's experiences in Israel working at the Ketziot military prison camp as well as his dialogue with Rafiq, a prisoner whom Goldberg would later befriend in Washington, DC. The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times named it one of the best books of 2006. The Los Angeles Times critic wrote, \\"Realization of the humanity of the ‚Äòother‚Äô is at the heart of New Yorker magazine correspondent Jeffrey Goldberg's sharply observed and beautifully written memoir.\\" The New York Times critic wrote, \\"Mr. Goldberg, a talented and ambitious writer for the New Yorker ... takes an engagingly personal approach to the issue in his story of a quest for mutual understanding with a Palestinian activist who had been his prisoner ... For the bittersweet complexity of that moment, offered in the context of all that has preceded it, this is a genuinely admirable book.\\" The Washington Post review of the book noted, \\"Prisoners is Jeffrey Goldberg's sensitive, forthright and perceptive account of his years as a soldier and journalist in Israel‚Äîand of his long-running conversation with a Palestinian whom he once kept under lock and key. It is a forceful reminder of how rewarding, and how difficult, discourse between Israelis and Palestinians can be.\\" CBS News critic wrote, \\"There is no shortage of histories, polemics and policy manuals about the Middle East. An honest but complex story, from what happens to be a personal perspective that many Americans can at least conjure, is a rarer opportunity for insight. And that is what Jeffrey Goldberg, a reporter for The New Yorker, delivers in Prisoners. To those of us who have followed Jeffrey Goldberg‚Äôs reporting on the Muslim world, the publication of his first book is cause for real pleasure...because his writing on the subject has always been exceptional: wise, unpretentious, and at times, unexpectedly funny.\\" Boris Kachka, a contributing editor for New York magazine, interviewed Goldberg in October 2006 about Prisoners in addition to other issues pertaining to journalism and the Middle East. Views on Iraq In 2002, Goldberg's \\"The Great Terror\\" published in The New Yorker argued that the threat posed to America by Saddam Hussein was significant, discussing the possible connection between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda as well as the Iraqi nuclear program, averring that there was \\"some debate among arms-control experts about exactly when Saddam will have nuclear capabilities. But there is no disagreement that Iraq, if unchecked, will have them soon ... There is little doubt what Saddam might do with an atomic bomb or with his stocks of biological and chemical weapons.\\" In a late 2002 debate in Slate on the question \\"Should the U.S. invade Iraq?\\", Goldberg argued in favor of an invasion on a moral basis, writing, \\"So: Saddam Hussein is uniquely evil, the only ruler in power today‚Äîand the first one since Hitler‚Äîto commit chemical genocide. Is that enough of a reason to remove him from power? I would say yes, if 'never again' is in fact actually to mean 'never again.'\\" Glenn Greenwald called Goldberg \\"one of the leading media cheerleaders for the attack on Iraq\\", claiming Goldberg had \\"compiled a record of humiliating falsehood-dissemination in the run-up to the war that rivaled Judy Miller's both in terms of recklessness and destructive impact.\\"Greenwald, Glenn (July 27, 2010) \\"The Jeffrey Goldberg Media\\", Salon.com; retrieved July 29, 2014. In 2008, in an article in Slate entitled \\"How Did I Get Iraq Wrong?\\", Goldberg explained the reasons behind his initial support of the Iraq War and wrote that he \\"didn't realize how incompetent the Bush administration could be.\\" Bibliography Books * Prisoners: A Muslim and a Jew Across the Middle East Divide.

Description The adults are dark with brown, grey and white patterning on the upperparts and breast; the long wings are black and show a white bar in flight. The tail is dark with white barring; the underparts are white with black bars. The adult male has a white throat; the female has a light brown throat. The most distinguishing characteristic to determine its identity from its closest relative the common nighthawk are the contrasting pale tertials near the back of the wings of a sitting bird. There are two color morphs, a gray and a rufous type. Like other nighthawks, this bird will display by flying upward with a distinctive call note, then diving, pulling out of the dive only a few feet from the ground. This creates a rush of air and distinctive sound. Habitat and distribution Their breeding habitat is open country of the Greater Antilles (except Puerto Rico), the Bahamas and the Florida Keys in the United States. They usually nest on bare ground, sometimes in raised locations including stumps or gravel roofs. They especially favor recently cleared areas in forests, airport fields, cane fields and pastures. Breeding The Antillean nighthawk migrates out of its breeding range after raising its young. It still remains unknown where the birds spend the winter. The two eggs are laid directly on bare ground - there is no nest. Incubation is performed largely by the female and lasts for about 20 days. Young fledge at about 20 days of age. Diet They catch flying insects on the wing, mainly foraging near dawn and dusk (crepuscular) or sometimes at night with a full moon. Call The call is a short pikadik usually heard overhead. The common nighthawk occasionally will make a similar call, but it is not as consistent.

In 1985, the film became the first Latin American movie to win an Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language Film. In 1992, Pi√±eyro premiered as a director with Tango Feroz (Tanguito, Wild Tango). In Argentina, the film set attendance records and initiated a debate about the country's past. Screened at such film festivals as the Toronto International Film Festival in 1993, the film won several awards including the Premio del Jurado Joven en el Festival de San Sebasti√°n (1993). Caballos Salvajes (Wild Horses) (1995), Pi√±eyro's second film as director, became the second-highest attended film in Argentina. It received a number of awards, including the Jury's Special Mention at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival. The film also played such festivals as the Mostra Internazionale del Film Venecia and the New Directors/New Films Festival (1996) at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, New York. Pi√±eyro's next film, Cenizas del para√≠so (Ashes of Paradise), was produced by Buena Vista International and became Argentina's highest- grossing film in 1997. It won a number of international awards, among them the Spanish Goya Award for Best Foreign Film in Spanish and was selected to present Argentina for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. In addition, the film was screened at a number of international film festivals, ranging from the Donostia-San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival to the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2000, Plata quemada (Burnt Money) gained international recognition and reached a considerable audience worldwide. In Uruguay, where a large part of the plot takes place, Plata quemada became even the most viewed film of the year. Screened at international film festivals like Venice, Biarritz, Toronto, and Rio de Janeiro, it also won a number of awards and award nominations. In 2001, Pi√±eyro contributed the short film \\"El Dorado\\" to Argentina Vivo 2001, an anthology of shorts by Argentine directors. The following year, his feature Kamchatka played at film festivals in Berlin, Germany, Bahia, Brazil; Miami, Florida, U.S., and Sydney, Australia, and was selected to represent Argentina for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. His next film, El m√©todo (The Method), premiered in 2005 and was shown at several international film festivals, including the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. It won two Goya Awards (2006), including one for Pi√±eyro for best adapted script. In 2009, Las viudas de los jueves (The Widows of Thursdays) was released.

Career With over 300 recorded songs, Vance co-wrote (with Lee Pockriss) such hits as \\"Catch a Falling Star,\\" recorded in 1957 by Perry Como, which topped Billboard's \\"Most Played By Jockeys\\" chart and became one of Como's signature songs, and \\"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini,\\" recorded in 1960 by Brian Hyland, which rose to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Vance got the idea for \\"Itsy Bitsy Bikini\\" because his daughter was too shy to wear a bikini in public. The song was a Top 10 hit in other countries around the world. In 1959, Vance and Pockriss released a single for Columbia records as \\"Lee and Paul,\\" a novelty tune called \\"The Chick.\\" Vance and Pockriss also provided English lyrics for the song \\"Calcutta\\". \\"What Will Mary Say\\", a Top 10 hit for the singer Johnny Mathis in 1963, was written by Vance with Eddie Snyder. In 1964, Vance and Pockriss wrote a song entitled \\"Leader Of The Laundromat,\\" a spoof of the then-popular \\"Leader of the Pack\\" by the Shangri- Las, and Vance produced a recording of the track by a trio consisting of Ron Dante, Tommy Wynn, and Vance's nephew Danny Jordan. The record was released under the name the Detergents, and its success led to an album called The Many Faces Of The Detergents, which Vance produced and for which he, along with Pockriss, penned all the songs. The release of \\"Leader of the Laundromat\\" earned a lawsuit against the group by \\"Leader Of The Pack\\" composers Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich, and George \\"Shadow\\" Morton. Dante would later work alongside Barry as lead vocalist for the Archies. In 1965, Vance and Pockriss wrote \\"What's Going On in the Barn,\\" which Billy Thornhill recorded for Wand Records as the B-side to his recording of \\"The Key,\\" written by Pockriss and Hal Hackady. The following year, Vance had a minor hit as a singer when his recording of \\"Dommage, Dommage (Too Bad, Too Bad)\\", intended as a demo, was released by Scepter Records. In 1969, Vance teamed up with Dante after the latter agreed to record a demo of the new Vance/Pockriss composition, \\"Tracy.\\" Dante provided all the voices on the recording, both leads and backgrounds, and the single was released under the name The Cuff Links. Its success prompted Vance to bring Dante back into the recording studio to record an entire album's worth of songs, and the resultant LP, also entitled Tracy, was rush-released to capitalize on the popularity of the single. As with The Detergents' album, Vance produced the recording sessions and co-wrote all of the songs with Pockriss. In 1972, Vance and Pockriss penned \\"Playground In My Mind,\\" which was recorded by Clint Holmes, and became a 1973 #2 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it remained for 23 weeks. The single was awarded gold record status on July 3, 1973. Vance's son, Philip, sang on the refrain on the recording along with Holmes. In 1974, Vance discovered singer/songwriter Joseph Nicoletti, later a successful singer of commercial jingles, and recorded \\"Changing Colors\\" with Nicoletti on RCA Records. Vance co-wrote and produced the song \\"Run Joey Run\\" for David Geddes in 1975; the song reached the top 5 on the Billboard charts that year. The songwriting duo also wrote the ballad, \\"I Haven't Got Anything Better To Do,\\" first recorded by Astrud Gilberto and covered by Natalie Cole, Esther Phillips, and Dee Dee Warwick. Through the years, Vance continued to produce various recording artists, including Kathy Keates, who recorded, among other songs on the RCA Records label, the hit single \\"I Think About You\\" with Al Martino. In October 2009, Vance was nominated for induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. False report of death On September 6, 2006, a man named Paul van Valkenburgh of Ormond Beach, Florida, died from complications of lung cancer. An obituary published in The News-Times of Danbury, Connecticut repeated Van Valkenburgh's claim that he had written the song \\"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka-Dot Bikini\\" under the pen name of Paul Vance, but that he had sold his rights to the song decades earlier. The report was picked up by the Associated Press, which ran a short obituary of Vance based on both the News- Times obituary and information received from Van Valkenburgh's widow. The AP obituary was picked up by newspapers and other media outlets worldwide. Vance contacted local media after viewing a report of his death on a local television news broadcast. He announced that he was still alive and was able to prove his identity to reporters with a stack of royalty checks from ASCAP for his songwriting. He told a reporter for The New York Times that his relatives and friends, shocked by the Associated Press report, had called to check on him after the media reports, and that two racehorses he owned had been scratched from races based on the reports. Vance also told the Times that he was considering legal action, since licensees outside the United States might be confused by the false report of his death and discontinue making royalty payments. He was quoted as saying, \\"Believe me, if they think you‚Äôre dead, they ain‚Äôt going to send the money.\\" Memoir In September 2014, after eight years in the making, Vance published his memoir, titled Catch a Falling Star. Personal life Vance currently resides in Boca Raton, Florida. His son, Philip, who sang the chorus of \\"Playground in my Mind\\" with Clint Holmes, died on December 13, 2009, at age 44.

The park was purchased by the DelGrosso family in 1946 and was named \\"Bland's Park\\" until 2000. In 2000, the DelGrosso family decided to change its name to \\"DelGrosso's Amusement Park.\\" The park is known for its family-friendly ride line-up, food, and games as well as free parking. The park hosts picnics and special music events in its pavilion/picnic area. History Crazy Mouse ride Formerly known as Bland's Park until 2000, the small family-friendly amusement park is located in Tipton, in Blair County, Pennsylvania. Altoona railroad businessman, Fred DelGrosso, purchased the amusement park in 1946. DelGrosso's Park was originally opened by the Rinard brothers on the Blands' family farm in 1907. The park fell into disrepair during the Great Depression. It was purchased in 1946 by Fred DelGrosso, at which time only a few picnic shelters remained. The DelGrosso family has continued to invest in the park with various additions (such as a waterpark addition in 1997 and expansion in 1999 and 2016) and improvements and continues to operate it today. The DelGrosso family is also the founder of DelGrosso Foods, Inc. DelGrosso Foods produces and distributes pizza sauce, spaghetti sauce, spaghetti noodles, and other Italian specialty items.

The ‚ÄúSummer Thunder‚Äù fireworks show for the 4th of July is a highlight of the park's season. Other events include the Native American Pow Wow, Italian Festival, and Harvestfest which is a fall festival held in September to close out the season. The park also hosts \\"Spaghetti Wednesday\\" which features a special Italian dish each Wednesday during the summer. Laguna Splash is an Italian themed waterpark that opened in 2016. Laguna Splash was an expansion of the park's existing waterpark amenities of a new wave pool, lazy river, and a variety of water features including a scale version of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and tipping buckets and vases. The Laguna Splash Water Park also features 12 Cabanas that can be rented on a daily basis when the water park is in operation. The water park is open seven days a week, typically 11 AM to 7 PM from approximately the end of May to mid-September. The park resides on both sides of Old Route 220 with Laugna Splash and parking on the southeast side of the road, while park-side resides on the northwest side of the road. There is a wheelchair-accessible walking bridge connecting both sides of the park over Old Route 220. Ride and water park passes may be purchased on either side of the park. At the beginning of each day, the park salutes the United States with \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\". At this time, everything in the park is halted as the national anthem is played. Roller coasters After the 2003 season, the park sold its Pinfari \\"Zyklon\\" roller coaster, installed in 1987, to Blue Diamond Park (which closed In 2008). This coaster replaced a smaller steel mini-coaster known for jumping the track every third lap. A Reverchon \\"Crazy Mouse\\" was installed in its place in 2004. In the same year, a Fajume \\"Wacky Worm\\" kiddie coaster was added to the park. In 2006, the park purchased the \\"Revolution,\\" an Arrow Dynamics loop and corkscrew, from Libertyland for $55,000 USD at auction.

Located off of State Highway 9 in Granite, Oklahoma, the facility has a maximum capacity of 1042 inmates. The medium-security area accommodates 799 prisoners, minimum-security area houses roughly 200, and the maximum-security area with about 43 inmates. The prison currently houses approximately 975 prisoners. The prison was established by an act of the legislature in 1909 and constructed through prison labor, housing its first inmate in 1910. The facility is well known for the significant roles women played in its foundation and governance, most notably having the first female warden administer an all-male prison in the nation. History Founding of the Prison In 1907, Kate Barnard was appointed Oklahoma Commissioner of Charities and Corrections. After visiting prisons in Kansas detaining Oklahoma offenders, Barnard concluded that a more civil and humane prison needed to be constructed in Oklahoma. Within two years, Barnard persuaded the legislature to authorize development of both the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and the Oklahoma State Reformatory. The Reformatory was established by an act of the legislature in 1909. Construction began shortly thereafter, housing its first inmate in 1910. Situated adjacent to Granite Mountain (also known as \\"White Mountain\\"), the Reformatory was constructed through prison labor using the granite quarried from the mountain. A large factor in the selection of the institution's site was the prospect of employing the prison's inmates to work in the quarry for minimal wages. No original structures in the complex remain. The oldest standing, the Oklahoma State Industries broom factory/upholstery building, was constructed in 1921. All other buildings currently in use have been constructed since 1957. In 1928, the institution had one main guard tower, dedicated to a former warden, on which stood cell houses on either side. The facility currently operates two of the four towers which are manned by armed officers for direct observation. The granite walls surrounding the compound of radiating cell blocks rise approximately twenty-four feet tall with a thickness of three feet at grade level and two feet at its top. Layers of razor wire extend along the top as well as inside of the wall's interior. These wires are linked up to an Intrepid Micro-Point Intrusion Detection system, monitored by the central control room, which detects vibrations caused by cutting and/or climbing. The Early Years In 1914, Barnard stepped down after seven years as Commissioner of Charities and Corrections and was succeeded by William D. Mathews. After her departure, the original rehabilitative goals of the facility were weakened. The governor of Oklahoma in 1915, Robert L. Williams was primarily concerned with the economic interests of the reformatory. Through his speeches, he saw no difference between the penitentiary and the reformatory, believing that the reformatory should become a second penitentiary and its warden to be businessman-like. In an attempt to make the prison more self-sustaining, Governor Williams negotiated with the Rock Island Railroad Company, using the state-owned mountain of granite and the reformatory's inmates for labor. After three years, Governor Williams claimed an enlargement and improvement within several prison industrial and buildings. During World War I, the institution assisted the U.S. military by supplying the Aviation Field at Fort Sill with building materials. The Waters Era When James B. A. Robertson replaced Williams as governor in 1919, Robertson appointed Dr. George A. Waters, a highly respected farmer and physician, as warden of the Reformatory. During his years as supervisor of the prison, Waters requested that the Board of Public Affairs create a general library for the inmates, consisting of 500 books while also connecting with local charity organizations willing to donate books. In addition to reforming the prison within its walls, Waters trained the prisoners in scientific agriculture on the farm land surrounding the Reformatory, establishing experimental seed farms and specialized husbandry for cattle, sheep, and hogs. Waters acquired technical aid from the Agricultural and Mechanical College at Stillwater. In 1923, John C. Walton replaced Robertson as governor, splitting the Robertson- Waters team and ousting Waters from his position as warden. During his brief term, Governor Walton exchanged Waters' employees with unqualified people to work in the prisons' shops, which greatly damaged the shop's inventories. He altered, even eliminated, several constructive projects Waters had helped create and build. Due to massive amounts of corruption at all levels, Walton was impeached only a year into his term and replaced by Lieutenant Governor Martin E. Trapp. Waters was reappointed as warden and began to clean up the damage to the Reformatory. In 1926, Warden J. J. Savage made his Annual Report of the Oklahoma State Reformatory and observed that the inmates were going to school for half a day and working for the other half. He was impressed by how many of the prisoners were learning a trade, such as bakery, cooking, plumbing, cleaners, and stonemasonry. With the death of Warden George Waters in 1927, Mrs. Clara Waters replaced her deceased husband, becoming the first woman to head an all-male prison in the United States. Mrs. Waters was well known for her unique style of punishment. It was not uncommon for the young men at the prison to be dressed in women's clothing and then displayed for visitors to taunt and ridicule them. In spite of her unusual punishments, Mrs. Waters focused mainly on educational and religious programs for prisoners. She created an educational program within the facility, which would later become the first official high school established behind the walls of a prison in the United States, Lakeside High School at Oklahoma State Reformatory. Mrs. Waters was highly regarded locally as well as nationally. In October 1930, she was appointed to attend the annual meeting of the American Prison Congress in Louisville, Kentucky by the governor at the time, William J. Holloway, as his personal representative and delegate from Oklahoma. There she was nominated to the board of directors of the National Prison Organization. She was considered one of the most convincing women speakers in the country; indeed Mrs. Waters was informed by the Democratic National Committee in September 1932 that her name was on the list of speakers designated to tour the country. In October 1933, she was also elected in Atlantic City, New Jersey as the vice-president of the National Prison Association and was appointed into Oklahoma's Hall of Fame in 1935. Mrs. Waters was warden during the infamous prison break in Granite on February 17, 1935. The prison employees of the Oklahoma State Reformatory were caught off guard when around 31 inmates attempted to escape. The prisoners had managed to smuggle two guns into their possession, using them to threaten the officers on duty. Eight surrendered and two returned voluntarily the day of the escape. Eighteen were still at large the next day. Mrs. Waters was fired from her position as Warden, ending the Waters' family era within the reformatory. Famous Inmates The Oklahoma State Reformatory was home for roughly fourteen months to one of Oklahoma's favorite citizens, Wiley Post. A native Texan, Post moved to Oklahoma to work in the prosperous oil fields in order to raise money for his own personal airplane. During 1921, he was involved in a robbery and was sentenced to ten years in the reformatory. After only serving about one tenth of his original sentence, Post was given a full pardon in December 1934. After his time at the Oklahoma State Reformatory, Post went on to be one of the first pilots to make a non-stop flight from the United States to Germany and the first to fly solo around the world, setting many record times. His life, as well as that of Oklahoma's beloved Will Rogers, ended on August 15, 1935 when his airplane crashed near Point Barrow, Alaska. In 1945, Clarence Carnes, known as \\"Choctaw Kid,\\" entered the Oklahoma State Reformatory charged with the murder of an Oklahoma service station attendant. During his time at the Reformatory, Carnes and two other men were convicted on federal kidnapping charges and were sentenced to 99 years in prison. Instead of serving his time at the Reformatory, Carnes was transferred due to his behavioral problems to Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay. At age 18, he was the youngest inmate ever imprisoned within its walls. While serving his sentence in Alcatraz, Carnes was involved in an escape along with five fellow inmates and took over a section of their cell block. U.S. Marines as well as prison guards from distances as far away as Kansas were sent to retake the facility. Three of the six inmates died during the assault, and two others were executed shortly thereafter. Carnes avoided the death penalty because he did not murder officers assigned to him during the escape, and he lived until 61, dying at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri.

The episode was written by Jeff Pinkner and Drew Goddard and directed by Paul Edwards, and premiered on October 11, 2006, on ABC. The characters of Sun and Jin are featured in the episode's flashbacks; on the Island, they and Sayid attempt to discover the whereabouts of Jack, Kate, and Sawyer. The episode was watched by an estimated 16.890 million viewers in the United States. It received mixed reviews, as multiple reviewers believed it was inferior to the previous week's season premiere; one stated the storyline caused the series to \\"take a step back [because it] delivers nothing new or substantial\\". Plot summary Flashbacks A young Sun-Hwa Kwon (Sophie Kim) breaks a glass ballerina and blames it on the maid, despite her father, Mr. Paik (Byron Chung), warning her the maid would be fired. Later, Sun as an adult (Yunjin Kim) is shown having an affair with Jae Lee (Tony Lee), who attempts to give her a pearl necklace. She refuses, afraid that her husband would see it. Then, to her shame, Mr. Paik barges in and finds them in bed together. Mr. Paik later summons Sun's husband, Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), saying that Jae has been stealing from him, and telling Jin to put an end to it (implying that he is to be killed). But when Jin ambushes and beats up Jae, he still cannot bring himself to commit murder, and instead orders Jae to leave the country. However, as Jin gets into his car, Jae's body suddenly lands on his windshield. Jae's corpse hand is clutching the pearl necklace, implying that he jumped from the window. At Jae's funeral, Sun runs into her father. She asks if he would ever tell Jin about the affair, but he says that it was not his place to tell Jin. On the island On the sailboat, Sun, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) argue about what to do because Jack Shephard's (Matthew Fox) party has not shown up; Sun goes against her husband's wishes and agrees with Sayid to sail to a new location. They find the Others' dock and come ashore to build a signal fire to try and lure the Others into an ambush. Meanwhile among the Others, Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) orders Colleen (Paula Malcomson) to put together a team and capture Sayid's boat. Her team avoids Sayid and Jin, and instead sneaks aboard the boat, where they encounter Sun below deck. Sun accidentally shoots Colleen in the abdomen and narrowly manages to escape overboard. Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) are forced to work in a quarry, digging and carrying rocks. Alex (Tania Raymonde) secretly asks Kate about Karl (Blake Bashoff). Sawyer creates a distraction by kissing Kate passionately, and steals a rifle, but is forced to relinquish it when Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) threatens to shoot Kate. Back in their cages, Sawyer tells Kate what he learned about the fighting abilities of the various Others. He says that Juliet would have shot her without a problem and criticizes the other Others. They start discussing plans to escape, not knowing Ben is monitoring their conversation via security cameras. Ben then visits Jack, telling him his real name, and that he has lived on the island all his life. He offers that if Jack cooperates, he can be sent home. Jack believes the Others are also stranded just as he is, but Ben informs him of the exact time and date of his plane crash and that 69 days have since passed (making the date November 29, 2004) and insists that they are in contact with the outside world. He shows this by citing various current events, such as the re-election of George W. Bush to the American presidency, the sudden death of Christopher Reeve and that the Boston Red Sox have won the 2004 World Series. Once Ben tells him about the Red Sox, Jack starts laughing and says that proves he is lying. Ben then proves it by playing a recording of the final play in the game as Jack watches in shock. Production \\"The Glass Ballerina\\" featured flashbacks from Sun, played by Yunjin Kim (pictured). Executive producer Jeff Pinkner and supervising producer Drew Goddard co-wrote \\"The Glass Ballerina\\", while cinematographer Paul Edwards served as the director. It featured recurring stars Byron Chung, Tony Lee, Michael Bowen, and Tomiko Okhee Lee, as well as the first of two appearances by guest actress Paula Malcomson. Though her character Colleen Pickett is shot in the episode, she does not die until the season's fourth episode, \\"Every Man for Himself\\". Leading up to the premiere of the new season, showrunners Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof foreshadowed the episode's adultery storyline in an interview; Cuse mentioned, \\"How truthful has [Sun] been with Jin about her past?\\", to which Lindelof added, \\"And related to that, is the baby his?\\". Previously, a season two episode had seemed to confirm that Jin was infertile, leading to ramped up speculation online that Sun was pregnant by her lover Jae Lee. A later episode in the third season would resolve this storyline, showing that Jin was cured of his infertility and is the father of their baby. Sun's deception over the affair would later be resolved in the season four episode \\"Ji Yeon\\", when Juliet tells Jin about Sun and Jae Lee. Actor Daniel Dae Kim enjoyed the fight scene between him and guest actor Tony Lee, commenting that \\"I really appreciate the fact that [Jin]'s just a down-and-dirty street fighter. I think his style of fighting fits his character\\". He continued \\"it was great to see a different layer to Sun's character. Because previously she had always been the good wife, and Jin was the bad husband\\". Actress Yunjin Kim added that \\"now we know that [Sun]'s not what she's been advertised to be for the last two seasons, but actually she has a lot of secrets.\\" Reception It was originally scheduled to air on October 18, 2006, but was swapped with the episode \\"Further Instructions\\" and broadcast one week earlier. When \\"The Glass Ballerina\\" first aired, it was the seventh most watched episode of the week in the United States, with 16.890 million viewers and a 6.9 rating in the key demographic of adults ages 18‚Äì49. Lost critic Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine noted that like the season premiere, the episode \\"mostly serves to add uncomfortable wrinkles to one of the show's saints, going so far as to make the consistently sympathetic Sun quite unlikable.\\" He added \\"While I... question the need for the flashbacks, I must confess to finding this particular episode more wonderfully twisted than usual.\\" Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly wrote \\"Last week's Jin/Sun episode was something of a disappointment, not because it was a bad episode of Lost, per se (I would give it a solid B), but because it wasn't as good as the exhilarating season premiere (which I would give an A+).\\" IGN's Chris Carabott rated the episode 6.8/10, explaining that after the premiere's \\"exciting, new direction\\" of an episode, \\"The Glass Ballerina\\" helped Lost \\"take a step back [as it] delivers nothing new or substantial\\". He felt the flashbacks were repetitive and \\"a lot more like filler than the basis for compelling television\\", but praised the final scene between Jack and Ben as \\"the only compelling scene in the whole episode\\". On a list ranking all the Lost episodes, the Los Angeles Times ranked \\"The Glass Ballerina\\" 80 out of 110 episodes, explaining \\"A good flashback (to Sun and her pre-island lover) and a terrific last scene -- wherein Jack learns the Sox won the Series -- can't make up for a listless on- island plot.\\" On a similar list, IGN rated the episode 106 out of 113 episodes, writing \\"it felt appropriate for Lost's third season to begin with an episode only featuring Jack, Sawyer and Kate, since their abduction by the Others was a big part of Season 2's conclusion. But having episode two of the season also focus so much on these three, with almost no plot momentum, was frustrating and rather uninteresting. Meanwhile, we do pick up with Sayid, Sun and Jin, but it's really only for yet another 'Sun and Jin have had a lot of big issues in their marriage' flashback ‚Äì a topic we were well familiar with at this point.\\" Daniel Dae Kim and Yunjin Kim each submitted this episode for consideration on their own behalf for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series respectively for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.

Like in other armies, the rank is higher than a lieutenant colonel and lower than a brigadier. {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" width=\\"60%\\" !colspan=12 bgcolor=\\"white\\"- !Uniform insignia |align=\\"center\\"|70px |- !Rank !Colonel |- !NATO equivalent !OF-5 |} {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" width=\\"100%\\" !colspan=12 bgcolor=\\"green\\"Pakistani officer ranks |- !Rank !Field marshal (5-star) !General (4-star) !Lieutenant general (3-star) !Major general (2-star) !Brigadier (1-star) !Colonel !Lieutenant colonel !Major !Captain !Lieutenant !Second lieutenant |- !NATO equivalent !OF-10 !OF-9 !OF-8 !OF-7 !OF-6 !OF-5 !OF-4 !OF-3 !OF-2 !OF-1 !OF-1 |- !Uniform insignia |align=\\"center\\"align=\\"center\\"align=\\"center\\"align=\\"center\\"align=\\"center\\"align=\\"center\\"align=\\"center\\"align=\\"center\\"align=\\"center\\"align=\\"center\\"align=\\"center\\"} External links Category:Military ranks of Pakistan ","title":"Colonel (Pakistan)"},{"id":"7171002","title":"Bogs Adornado"},{"id":"7171028","text":"Juan Antonio Bardem Mu√±oz (2 June 1922 ‚Äì 30 October 2002) was a Spanish film director and screen writer.

The strip centers on a nuclear family composed of mother Andy, father Roger, and their three children Peter, Paige and Jason, along with several auxiliary characters. Main characters Jason Fox Jason Fox is the youngest child of the family and is considered the nerdiest person in the family. A 10-year-old boy who wears glasses (though his pupils are unseen), he is shown to be very intelligent, and is often relied on to help Roger with taxes, or Peter and Paige with homework. Unlike his siblings, who sometimes make him pay them to do their homework, Jason actually wants to do his homework, and often receives incredibly high marks as a result (although 72 correct answers out of 20 questions is disappointing to him). He sometimes is disappointed when he has no homework because he did all the homework for the year in the first week of school. He tends to aggravate the teachers with his overly complicated answers, and is frequently in trouble for disrupting class. Despite his intellect, he is shown to take most things too literally on occasion. (Once, when Roger asked him for \\"java\\", meaning a cup of coffee, Jason gave him a mug with a printout from the Java programming language.) He also once placed an order for a pizza with \\"17/51 cheese, 109/327 sausage, and 86,499,328/259,497,984 mushroom\\" (which resulted in Roger receiving all his change in pennies and telling Jason that his ever being asked to order their pizza again was an \\"unlikely event\\"), and unsuccessfully makes attempts to get Roger and Andy to raise his allowance, which almost always results in sudden, sharp decreases in his pay. Like most stereotypical boys, Jason is a constant source of mischief. He is always coming up with jokes, pranks and tricks which include water bombs, snowballs, dart guns, squirt guns and other contraptions, Paige being his favorite target. She is also the center of his insults, like when he came up with a Slug-Man superhero comic, which included \\"Paige-o-Tron\\" as the villain, or uploading games to his website which included Pimple Command, Paige Invaders, Ms. Yap Man and Paige Don't Know Jack, on which she is respectively portrayed as a pimply, space alien, a constant talker on the phone and being unable to answer the easiest of questions. Although Paige is his regular target, Peter is sometimes the target of his tricks (such as reprogramming the auto-dial buttons on Peter's cell phone, resulting in Peter accidentally confessing to Andy about sneaking out when he thought he was talking to Denise). He also enjoys making comic strips with Slug Man (see below), substitutes for other cartoonists' work, e.g. Family Circus, or with his siblings as the characters, such as when he had a week of comic strips in which Paige was portrayed as a deadly monster (which resulted in Paige doing the same for him the following week). Portrayed as a stereotypical nerd, he has an interest in science fiction, particularly Star Wars, Star Trek and role-playing games (primarily the fictional fantasy-themed MMORPG \\"World of Warquest\\", a portmanteau of World of Warcraft and EverQuest), as well as a high level of knowledge in mathematics and science. He also seems to have a high interest in comic books and dinosaurs. In a few strips, it is revealed that he likes Pok√©mon and Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, as well as the fictional \\"Linuxmon\\", blending his interest in programming with card games, and brings them to school. Jason is also a frequent user of the family computer, and has been shown to be an amazing programmer, repeatedly constructed his own computer programs (including a search engine, which he built before breakfast) and viruses, which he often sends to the other computers in the house and Eileen Jacobson. He also has written at least two viruses that caused nationwide havoc, called the \\"Darth Jason\\" and \\"I-Don't-Love-You-Eileen- Jacobson\\". He included a copyright line in the latter, and in the former he completely eliminated the Internet (and Jason's web company, \\"Jasonzonbayhoo\\") as a result. It is also shown that Jason is a terrific snow sculptor. When it snows he and his best friend Marcus build monsters out of snow to scare Paige. Another example is a storyline in which Andy tells him to go outside instead of playing video games, so he and Marcus build the environments of their favorite video games to play in. In addition, he plays video games regularly ‚Äî either by himself, with Peter, with Roger, or with Marcus. In one series of strips, Paige plays one of his games and is more adept at it than Jason to his frustration, with common sense assisting her. He frequently attempts to recreate the work of cartoonists while they are on hiatus, usually as an excuse to make fun of Paige. He also makes his own comic called Slug Man, a parody of Superman and Batman. Occasionally, Jason will make exaggerated plans of his own, such as a large-scale animatronics Christmas display (which has everything but a sound system playing \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\" all day) or a skyscraper comic book shop in his backyard (which is squashed by the zoning commission). Like Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes, Jason is shown to have a fear/hatred of girls (see below), but admits to slightly liking one of his only female friends, Eileen Jacobson. He sometimes falls prey to advertising ploys, as illustrated in a 1991 arc where he becomes obsessed for a short while with The Simpsons products. Paige Fox Paige Fox is the middle child of the Fox family. A 14-year-old high school freshman, she is always portrayed with her hair in a ponytail. She enjoys shopping and will often demand that Peter drive her to the mall, sometimes using blackmail to force him into it. Like the rest of the family, she has interests expected of her age group. Her obsessions include fashion, pop music (particularly boy bands and, in earlier strips, Madonna), modern fads and trends, and attractive teenage boys. A running gag through the series is that she has a huge craving for candy and other sweets. For example, the ice cream man comes to her when she rings a bell and takes out his whole stock, asking Paige \\"the usual?\\". She has been shown to make a rainbow ice cream cone not by ordering rainbow sorbet, but instead by ordering seven different flavors in the colors of the rainbow, stacked in a rainbow shape in the right order on top of two cones. In an August 2013 strip she and Nicole suggest to a cupcake shop ideas for a pintcake, quartcake, 2litercake, and a galloncake, in case they ever wanted to expand beyond cupcakes. She shares her obsessions with her best friend, Nicole (see below). Paige often has sleepovers at Nicole's house to avoid Jason's pet iguana, Quincy (see below). She also appears to have an iPhone 4. Although persistent in her pursuit of a boyfriend, she has almost never dated in the strip. A running gag is nerd Morton Goldthwait's interest in her, though she openly despises him. Paige has tried learning to cook to attract boys, but the food she makes is often inedible or burnt. One time, Paige burned all of her cookies so badly that Roger used them as a substitute for charcoal briquettes after Andy \\"directed him towards a stash.\\" On another occasion, she used Diet Pepsi in baking Christmas cookies, thinking it was the same thing as baking soda. Paige often falls asleep in class, partly because she stays up late. She is slightly more diligent than Peter when it comes to schoolwork, but has had her own procrastination-related nightmares (like school starting two weeks early and getting a schedule with only math classes with quizzes every day). Paige will often ask Jason for help in homework, usually in the mathematics of geometry. However, he often gives her intentionally incorrect answers or charges her money in exchange for the correct ones. Paige also has difficulties with English class, particularly when reading Shakespeare. Although she is not flabby, Paige is also shown to be in poor physical shape, not participating in any outdoor activities or organized sports, and the smallest amount of physical activity is shown to wear her out. She once auditioned for the school cheerleading team in an effort to attract boys, which ended in a debacle similar to Peter's attempts to join the baseball team. Peter Fox Peter Fox is the eldest child of the Fox family. A 16-year-old high school junior, he is regularly shown wearing a blue/purple and white baseball cap with the letter A on it, as well as a grey hooded sweatshirt and blue jeans. Occasionally, his cap has an \\"H\\" instead of an \\"A\\", but only as a benchwarmer for the high school baseball team. He is often seen with his hat on, even at odd times such as swimming. Peter has been seen hatless in places where it is blatantly rude to wear a ballcap indoors, such as church. He is also depicted as having an exaggerated appetite, but is frustrated that no matter how much he eats, he cannot seem to gain any weight (except in one series of strips, where he gained 50 pounds at a pizza joint's all-you-can-eat pizza night, then losing it overnight by the Saturday strip.) He is also shown as a reckless driver, once claiming to have \\"flirted\\" with four-digit speeds. Peter has pulled many stunts with the family car, such as speeding, back-wheelies, deliberately spinning and fishtailing, driving so fast that zero-gravity was achieved, attempting to clear a yellow light from six blocks away, almost sideswiping Andy's car, and going over the speed limit while parallel parking. Peter is a procrastinator, and one of the running gags of the strip is the many ways he dreams up to avoid doing his homework or household chores. He once bragged that he was \\"sick of homework from day one\\" in response to Paige claiming that she's starting to get sick of homework barely two months after the start of school, as well as becoming two weeks behind on schoolwork only one week into the year, a fact he seems to be proud of. As a result, he often crams homework and study into an all-night session (and once blasted the Hallelujah Chorus on his stereo to celebrate success). In desperation, Peter invented a high-caffeine concoction: coffee-tea (black coffee with a tea bag). He also shows interest in sports, but is constantly shown to be inept at both football and baseball. This has been demonstrated by his name being preprinted on the list of people cut from the football team (and every other sports team, including girls' gymnastics). He even once had a dream of being a contender on the TV show American Gladiators but before the dream could be realized, he threw a muscle flexing in front of a mirror. He is also seen as occasionally power hungry, especially when their parents are away, as shown in an early storyline in which he forced Paige and Jason to be his servants, baking him cookies, cleaning his room, and the like; before locking them in the basement for \\"mutiny\\". Peter also holds other stereotypical interests for an adolescent male, including swimsuit models, video games, and guitar playing. He is known to be an avid Bruce Springsteen fan, once dating a girl named Susie Johnson only because she had Springsteen tickets, and during the Thursday strip, Peter touched Bruce's sweat. Since some of the earlier strips, Peter has been dating a blind girl named Denise Russo. Andy Fox Andrea \\"Andy\\" Fox is the mother of Peter, Paige, and Jason and the wife of Roger. She is portrayed in the strip as a 42-year-old mother. According to the strip, she graduated from a college prior to marrying, where she majored in English, but it is never revealed where she got her degree, so it could be possible she got it at a different university than her husband. While earlier strips portrayed her as a freelance writer and columnist for a local newspaper, references to her job were gradually dropped and she has mostly been portrayed as a stay-at-home mother. Andy has often clashed with her children about school. She fails to relate to Jason due to his interest in science whereas she was more artistic, and is entirely unsympathetic with Paige and Peter's hatred of school, being under the impression that due to her own love of education, all her kids should share it. Her locking horns with the kids on school is not without justification, as Peter and Paige are often shown as \\"go-nowheres\\", being lazy in school and rarely involved in extracurricular courses. Even on rare occasions Jason has flubbed his schoolwork, causing Andy to come down upon him like an iceberg meeting an ocean liner. Andy often prepares exaggerated vegetarian or vegan meals for her family (most often tofu, eggplants, spinach, beets, etc.), much to their chagrin, but she continues to try to get them to eat what she believes to be healthier meals. Another point of home living she places on her family includes lowering the thermostat to below-average temperatures in an attempt to lower the heating bill, which leads to contention from the kids (primarily Paige) who wish for it to be normal. She often criticizes her husband for his love of beer and meat, and children for what she sees as their bad habits, such as procrastination and use of improper grammar. She has been known to impose her will and beliefs rather harshly on her family, including Roger, such as occasions when she refused to buy coffee because she believed him to be \\"addicted\\" to it, and instructing Jason to play video games to prevent Roger from watching Super Bowl pre-game programming. In most cases, she has an intense hatred toward video games, often trying to get her kids disinterested in gaming. Her methods have ranged from directly throwing a console across the room during a particularly violent rant, to confiscating all games save for those approved by mother activist groups. This has also shown her to be something of a hypocrite as her attempt to use a Momvo to restrict her children's shows ended when it wouldn't record her soap operas. Andy has been shown to angry the most out of her family, although her anger never escalates to hurting others as Paige and Peter have been shown to do. She is easily the most high-strung member of the family and can start screeching about anything in an instant. It was never specified as to the source of Andy's anger, but hinted partly due to a combination of factors, the strained relationship with her mother, the somewhat strained relationship with her children's refusal to do things her way, and that her adult life has been poorer in comparison to the prosperous times she enjoyed as a child. Her father had a job similar to Roger's, but had a far more stable and rewarding career, whereas she shows annoyance that Roger's career is not progressing as well as her father's had when he was Roger's age. Andy has also been shown as being obsessed with bills, as she always leaves the thermostat too low and subscribes to only the most basic necessities for a household. A running joke has been that during the winter the house has been cold enough to freeze breath. This is contrasted with the spendthrift attitude of the kids and their locking horns with Andy over this. Arguably because Roger's money pays the bills, he is also careful with expenses, but shows nowhere near the parsimony of his wife. Andy has also been shown to obsess over certain other fads, such as \\"Bitty Babies\\" (a parody of Beanie Babies), the movie Titanic, and the Nintendo DS game Nintendogs. Although Andy has been apparently disappointed in Roger's lot in life, she has been supportive that he works to put a roof over their head. A more serious story arc in FoxTrot was when Roger had been tasked by J.P. Pembrook to prepare a presentation to the board of directors to increase Pembrook's pay package by $300,000 at a time when many of Roger's coworkers had been laid off due to low company profits. Andy is sympathetic with Roger's dilemma, and even suggests he should denounce Pembrook to his face. Roger Fox Roger Fox is the father of Peter, Paige, and Jason and the husband of Andy. According to the strip, he is 45 years old and was born in Chicago, Illinois. Roger has also stated that he majored in English studies at the fictional Willot College. He works at Pembrook and Associates. Roger's occupation is an unspecified white-collar office job, although his coworkers and his boss, Pembrook, have appeared in the strip. His hobbies include golf, camping, and chess, though he has almost no talent at any of them (or virtually anything else he attempts). When he is golfing, he often hits the ball wildly and completely off target, when camping he always messes up something, and in chess he is defeated in mere seconds. He often tries to involve his family in his interests, usually by taking them on vacations. He is also portrayed as being highly out of step with modern technology, especially computers. Many strips also show that he is overweight, balding and in poor physical condition, to the point of his tires sinking just by him sitting inside his car. Despite his wife's attempts to get him to eat healthy foods and exercise, he rarely does so. He also finds it extremely difficult to fully wake up, having been depicted as requiring a large amount of coffee to start each day. When he doesn't get his coffee, he makes many severe mistakes, such as working all day in the wrong building, tumbling down the basement stairs, and attempting to drink his answering machine. Despite being rather clueless at times, he can be clever in some matters. He fares well enough as a family man and clearly cares for his wife and children. Other recurring characters Roger's coworkers J.P. Pembrook is Roger's boss. In the strip, he always appears seated at his desk, with only his hands showing (and almost always folded). Pembrook is a stereotypical boss, showing little care about his company or his workers and is extremely greedy. In one strip, he has Roger be a clown for his son's 5th birthday party, resulting in Andy's anger at her husband being used in this manner. In another, slightly more serious storyline, Pembrook admits to Roger that the company has been in debt and laying off multiple workers; despite all this he has Roger convince the board to increase his CEO pay by $300,000. Roger, conflicted over the stress at home, is henpecked by an enraged Andy that he should tell off Pembrook. Fred is Roger's best friend and coworker and they are often shown playing golf together. Fred seems to be the better golfer as seen in one strip where Fred had a score of 81 while Roger had a score of 180. Fred and the other workers like having Roger around since he often causes the office's computer network to crash, thereby preventing them from having to work. Andy's contacts Katie O'Dell is the baby daughter of one of Andy's friends, Margaret O'Dell. Paige sometimes babysits for her, usually with disastrous results. One time, Paige fell asleep on the job allowing Katie to find scissors and chop up her brand-new dress while wearing it. In another case Paige watched an adult show, Jerzy Spaniel (a parody of Jerry Springer) with Katie discovering a swear word, repeating it over and over. Another time, Paige gave her cake, making her exceedingly hyper. Another time, Katie had been punished and could not watch TV or videos for misbehaving more than usual that morning, leading to Katie repeatedly yelling \\"Blue's Clues!\\" for hours on end. Paige described her as \\"a broken nonstop tape recorder\\" on the Saturday strip. Margaret O'Dell is one of Andy's friends in a book club and is the mother of Katie O'Dell. She is known to be very specific in details (such as with phone numbers or Katie's name). She usually pays Paige enough to make Paige happy to babysit again. Peter's classmates and teachers Denise Russo is Peter's blind girlfriend whom he met at school in the strip's first year. They are very close, and kiss constantly, although they do have their share of fights. Peter once attempted to break up with her so he could date other girls and \\"develop socially,\\" but had a change of heart when he realized dating is not a rite of passage and there is no \\"appropriate\\" romance, and later admitted he was subject to peer pressure and media stereotypes. Denise has a manipulative streak and knows exactly how to get what she wants from Peter. In several strips, Paige and Jason blackmail him with photographs of the two together. Since the strip's move to Sundays-only publishing, Denise has hardly been mentioned or shown. Steve Riley is a friend of Peter's. Peter and Steve are often seen watching sports, or playing video games or guitar together. Steve works at Luigi's Pizza. He often lets Peter borrow his guitar instruments and amps, which usually ends up with Peter destroying most of the objects in the house. Paige once noted that Steve was \\"cute\\", much to Peter's chagrin. Coach is Peter's unnamed baseball and football coach. For reasons unknown (other than Peter's implied lack of athletic skill), he always makes Peter sit on the bench during games, only using Peter in an emergency or when he needs a new bag of sunflower seeds. He is the opposite image of a good coach, showing little interest in improving skills and only thinking of the \\"easy way out\\" to win games. He is also portrayed with a fat belly that hangs over his pants; hardly the image of an athlete. Later coaches, though, have shown more competence, but share the same low opinions of Peter's athletic skill. The Science Teacher is an unnamed man who teaches science at Peter's high school. He wears glasses and a full beard. He seems to have little patience for the laziness of Peter and Steve, but will sometimes be helpful if he realizes students are making an honest effort. Sometimes Paige has been shown as a student of his classes. The Theater Manager is Peter's boss at the movie theater where he has a summer job. Paige's classmates and teachers Nicole is Paige's best friend. She is also a high school freshman who has similar interests. Paige and Nicole sometimes go shopping together. The two once broke off their friendship after Nicole was able to get a date for the prom and Paige was not, but they soon reconciled. Nicole once had a crush on Peter, but that disappeared after she learned of his slovenly persona. Morton Goldthwait is a stereotypical nerd who attends school with Paige, though he is half her size. Although Paige has mostly ignored him, he still has a crush on her. In a 1997 storyline, he was also Jason's summer camp instructor, running his part of the camp with a rod of iron and insisting that he be addressed as \\"Your glorious and all-powerful high eminence, sir.\\" Jason had planned to set him up on a date with Paige as revenge, until he discovered that Morton actually liked Paige. Jason has also taken advantage of Morton's crush on Paige by arranging to have him become a part of her friends page on Facebook and sending him a \\"gushy love note\\" on her behalf. Despite Paige's distaste for Morton, she seems to be at least somewhat flattered by his crush on her, as on one occasion when Morton asks another girl to a school dance because he figures Paige would turn him down, and Paige reacts jealously. It is mentioned that he took the SATs, and was angry about getting \\"only\\" a 1590 out of a possible 1600. Jason considers him a stud, which of course infuriates Paige. Morton has been a part of many antics involving school activities. In one series of strips he formed the varsity e-football team, which plays video game football. Dr. Ting is Paige's biology teacher at school. While generally kind and patient, he has been shown to have a sadistic streak, as on an occasion where he assigned his class a test that covered forty-six chapters. A torrential downpour becomes an electrical storm that knocks out the power to the Fox residence, but Paige is determined to study by candlelight. When she comes to school, she is ready for the test, only for the teacher to have to postpone on account of his house also losing power, and thus being unable to access his computer and print the tests. Paige walks off in frustration, without hearing that Dr. Ting remark he is proud of Paige's efforts through all this. Miss Rockbottom is Paige's Physical Education teacher, despite appearing to be somewhat overweight herself, and is depicted as being very strict. On one occasion, she gave Paige a detention for attempting to forge a note to get out of class and for calling her a \\"power-hungry neo-Nazi Fascist tub of lard,\\" leading Paige to speculate that the reason she'd been given only one detention instead of two was that Miss Rockbottom had taken the insult as a compliment. She also once made Paige's class do 500 laps around the track. Jason's classmates, friends and teachers Marcus Jones is Jason's best friend, and the only recurring African-American character in the strip. While similar to Jason in character, Marcus tends to be a little more sensible. Jason and Marcus usually play together, launching model rockets, flying kites, playing video games, or other activities, such as harassing Paige. Marcus has four sisters named Doreen, Lisa, Cybil, and Lana. He is always happy to take care of Quincy when Jason and the family go on vacation, so he can mess with his sisters; he also has a hamster. Eileen Jacobson is one of Jason's classmates. She attempts to converse with Jason regularly, only for him to show discomfort around her. Their relationship appears to be a mixture of hatred and grudging respect (in addition to Jason's fear of girls in general), though there may be romantic subtexts in the relationship. In one extended 1998 storyline, Eileen managed to trick Jason into admitting that he did sort of \\"like\\" her, leading Jason to spend weeks trying to figure out how to undo his \\"mistake\\" through time travel. At this point they even begin dating, though this is seemingly short- lived when Jason tries to keep the relationship confidential so that his friends wouldn't shun him. In another 1996 story arc, Jason accidentally sends a love note that was meant to be for Andy for Mother's Day to Eileen, and it takes several strips to correct the mistake. Even Marcus thought Jason had Eileen's \\"cooties,\\" which he confesses at the end of the strip. It is noted by Andy that Eileen has a \\"loud laugh\\". Eileen seems to have a knack for getting Jason to do whatever she wants him to do, as evidenced by a series of strips in which Eileen makes Jason be her partner on a school field trip in exchange for a Charizard Pok√©mon card. Miss O'Malley is Jason's teacher. At first, Jason disliked her because, unlike his former teacher, Miss O'Malley encouraged Jason's creativity (such as marking the sites of dinosaur bone discoveries on a map when he was only required to name the continents), but she eventually came to realize how big a problem Jason was. She sometimes forces Jason to stay after school and write sentences on the blackboard after he misbehaves. A common gag is that Jason tries to find excuses to stay at school when summer begins, despite Miss O'Malley's reminders for him to go home. Phoebe and Eugene Wu Phoebe is a friend of Eileen's, whom Jason and Marcus meet while attending science camp one summer. She and her younger brother, Eugene, are Chinese-American. While Phoebe appears to be a relatively normal girl, Eugene is an obnoxious braggart who does not get along well with Jason and Marcus and is regarded even by his big sister (who, it is mentioned, has a higher IQ than he) as an object of derision. Phoebe and Eileen are rivals of Jason and Marcus at first, but the rivalry ends when Jason and Marcus cast the votes for Phoebe and Eileen's science project to win over Eugene's in the camp's science fair, and the girls initiate Marcus and a reluctant Jason into their \\"super-secret friendship club.\\" The Wu siblings return in a second extended story line a few years later involving the theft of Phoebe's camp journal. The culprit turned out to be Eugene, who had hoped to foster discord among the \\"friendship club\\" and thus bring about its disbandment; however, Phoebe punishes him by incorporating a new friendship club with a non-disbandment clause. They have since made occasional guest appearances. Other Quincy is Jason's pet iguana. Jason regularly uses him to tease Paige, either by waving the iguana in front of her, putting him in the bathtub while she is taking a bath, or throwing him on her. Other times he will let Quincy into her room so he can chew up her belongings and throw them up. At other times, Quincy just sits on Jason's head, while sometimes he dresses Quincy and himself up as various fictional characters, such as The Lone Iguana, Quincy John Adams, Quincynook, and QUINCE-E. Quincy's species has never been revealed, but it is possible that he is a Green Iguana (Iguana iguana) of a smaller size. He has talked only once, in a strip where Jason built a Spider-Man web launcher, and his mother said \\"Comic books aren't real.\\" He denies this, and Quincy replies, \\"Listen to your mother, Jason\\" as a play on what Andy said. To his surprise Jason's teacher Ms. O'Malley actually thinks Quincy is adorable. iFruit is a parody of the iMac computer. iFruit is the Fox's talking family computer which, upon being turned on, opens with the phrase, \\"Welcome to iFruit. Hug me\\". It first appears in a 1999 storyline in which Andy buys it on a computer shopping spree (namely after, in an earlier storyline, Roger sells the old computer in a yard sale after he ends up losing so much money day trading stocks), but only because it was \\"darling,\\" much to the dismay of Jason, who comments, \\"Geekdom is dead.\\" However, later in the series, iFruit starts growing on Jason because Andy starts buying its peripherals saying they are \\"adorable,\\" unlike in the case of their previous computer. Later strips show that it has upgraded to resemble recent iMac flat- screen computers. However, the old model was shown in a recent strip in the Foxes' basement, where it is used in memory of Steve Jobs (following his death) via daylight saving time, with Andy stating that \\"you can't turn the clock back\\", and Jason replying that he just wants to pretend. Fauntleroy is the tiny pet dog of one of the Fox's neighbors. He is the main focal point of some arcs focusing on Peter, who is occasionally hired to take care of the dog, despite its tendency to bite. Other family Andy's mother (the maternal grandmother of Paige, Peter and Jason) has occasionally appeared in the strip as well. The grandmother is often referred to as \\"perfect\\"; as a result, Andy often feels inferior around her (according to the strip, this resentment started around seventh grade, as Andy's friends liked her mom more than her), and tries to prove herself by competing against her mother (usually by trying to cook a meal as well as her mother can). It has been mentioned that her cooking has won awards and that Martha Stewart has tried to get one of her recipes. In addition, her mother has also supplied Peter with a music CD called Lance and the Boils out of what was strongly implied to be revenge towards Andy for her choice of music as a teenager. She had also gifted the grandchildren with gifts more akin to their interests such as a Nintendo Wii, which Andy has great disdain for, wanting her children to be more like she is, which implies the grandmother is more accepting of the kids for who they are. She has been seen at least three times, usually around holidays like Thanksgiving, but at other times as well. Uncle Ralph is Roger's brother, an unseen character only mentioned during the early years of the strip, when the Fox family would go to \\"Uncle Ralph's Cabin\\" for, at one point, the ninth year in a row.

Aeromonas hydrophila is a heterotrophic, Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium mainly found in areas with a warm climate. This bacterium can be found in fresh or brackish water. It can survive in aerobic and anaerobic environments, and can digest materials such as gelatin and hemoglobin. A. hydrophila was isolated from humans and animals in the 1950s. It is the most well known of the species of Aeromonas. It is resistant to most common antibiotics and cold temperatures and is oxidase- and indole-positive. Aeromonas hydrophila also has a symbiotic relationship as gut flora inside of certain leeches, such as Hirudo medicinalis. Structure Aeromonas hydrophila bacteria are Gram-negative, straight rods with rounded ends (bacilli to coccibacilli shape) usually from 0.3 to 1.0 Œºm in width, and 1.0 to 3.0 Œºm in length. They can grow at temperatures as low as 4 ¬∞C. These bacteria are motile by a polar flagellum. Pathology Because of its structure, it is very toxic to many organisms. When it enters the body of its victim, it travels through the bloodstream to the first available organ. It produces aerolysin, a cytotoxic enterotoxin that can cause tissue damage. A. hydrophila, A. caviae, and A. sobria are all considered to be opportunistic pathogens, meaning they rarely infect healthy individuals. A. hydrophila is widely considered a major fish and amphibian pathogen,Prevalence and distribution of Aeromonas hydrophila in the United States and its pathogenicity in humans has been recognized for decades.Clinical and microbiological features of Aeromonas hydrophila-associated diarrhea The genomic insights of aeromonads could be a stepping stone into understanding of them Pathogenic mechanism The pathogenicity of Aeromonas species was believed to be mediated by a number of extracellular proteins such as aerolysin, lipase, chitinase, amylase, gelatinase, hemolysins, and enterotoxins. However, the pathogenic mechanisms are unknown. The recently proposed type-III secretion system (T3SS) has been linked to Aeromonas pathogenesis. T3SS is a specialized protein secretion machinery that exports virulence factors directly to host cells. These factors subvert normal host cell functions to the benefit of invading bacteria. In contrast to the general secretory pathway, the T3SS is triggered when a pathogen comes in contact with host cells. ADP-ribosylation toxin is one of the effector molecules secreted by several pathogenic bacteria and translocated through the T3SS and delivered into the host cytoplasm, which leads to interruption of the NF-Œ∫B pathway, cytoskeletal damage, and apoptosis. This toxin has been characterized in A. hydrophila (human diarrhoeal isolate), A. salmonicida (fish pathogen), and A. jandaei GV17, a pathogenic strain which can cause disease both in humans and fish. Occurrence of exposure Aeromonas hydrophila infections occur most often during sexual changes, stressors, changes in temperature, in contaminated environments, and when an organism is already infected with a virus or another bacterium. It can also be ingested through food products contaminated with the bacterium, such as seafood, meats, and even certain vegetables such as sprouts. It can also be transmitted by leeches. Fish and amphibians Aeromonas hydrophila is associated with diseases mainly found in freshwater fish and amphibians, because these organisms live in aquatic environments. It is linked to a disease found in frogs called red leg, which causes internal, sometimes fatal hemorrhaging. When infected with A. hydrophila, fish develop ulcers, tail rot, fin rot, and hemorrhagic septicemia. Hemorrhagic septicaemia causes lesions that lead to scale shedding, hemorrhages in the gills and anal area, ulcers, exophthalmia, and abdominal swelling. Human diseases Aeromonas hydrophila is not as pathogenic to humans as it is to fish and amphibians. One of the diseases it can cause in humans, gastroenteritis, occurs mostly in young children and people who have compromised immune systems or growth problems. This bacterium is linked to two types of gastroenteritis. The first type is a disease similar to cholera, which causes rice-water diarrhea. The other type is dysenteric gastroenteritis, which causes loose stools filled with blood and mucus. Dysenteric gastroenteritis is the most severe out of the two types, and can last for several weeks. A. hydrophila is also associated with cellulitis. It also causes diseases such as myonecrosis and eczema in people with compromised or suppressed (by medication) immune systems.Evolving concepts regarding the genus Aeromonas: an expanding panorama of species, disease presentations, and unanswered questions In very rare cases, A. hydrophila can cause necrotizing fasciitis.Necrotizing fasciitis caused by Aeromonas hydrophila Outbreaks Though A. hydrophila can cause serious disease, large scale outbreaks have not been reported. Outbreaks among vertebrates have occurred. One such incident occurred in Puerto Rico inside the intestinal tracts of lizards.Fulton, MacDonald. \\"The Bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila from Lizards of the genus Anolis in Puerto Rico\\". Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans. Some 116 different strains were found in the lizards. On May 1, 1988, a small outbreak happened in California. The 225 isolates in 219 patients caused their hospital admissions. Confidential morbidity report cards were used to report the cases to the local health departments. Investigations were conducted, and reports were sent to the California Department of Health Services for diagnosis and methods in treatment. Treatments Aeromonas hydrophila can be eliminated using a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution or 2% calcium hypochlorite solution. Brage et al., 1990 recommends fluoroquinolone administration as a prophylactic treatment during medicinal leech application.Braga A, Lineaweaver WC, Whitney TM, Follansbee S, Buncke HJ. Sensitivities of aerononas hydrophila cultured from medicinal leeches to oral antibiotics. J Reconstr Microsurg. 1990; 6(2):135-137 Antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, florfenicol, tetracycline, sulfonamide, nitrofuran derivatives, and Pyridinecarboxylic acids are used to eliminate and control the infection of A. hydrophila. Terramycin is placed in fish food during hatchery operations as another chemotherapeutic agent in preventing A. hydrophila. References Further reading *Hayes, John.

Approximately 45 riders qualify from 13 leagues around the world. Usually there are 20 riders from Europe, 15 from the United States, 5 from Canada and 5 from elsewhere in the world. In the 28 World Cup finals held until 2007, United States riders have emerged with the most titles, having won the championship seven times.www.worldcuplasvegas.com Hugo Simon was the first rider to win the FEI World Cup three times, followed by Rodrigo Pessoa. Mario Deslauriers is so far the youngest winner, aged 19, in the competition's history riding Aramis in 1984. At the beginning, the final was a rather complicated process and in 1981 its formula was modified. Since then it has not been changed. It starts with a table C (speed), followed by a jump-off competition and, after one day's rest, a two-round final not against the clock. The FEI World Cup Final is usually held in April of each year.

He is sometimes identified by his pen name, Song-un. He was born to a family of the Im clan in Miryang, Gyeongsang Province. After the deaths of his mother in 1558 and his father in 1559, he became a monk at Jikjisa on Hwangaksan in Gimcheon. Life In 1561, he passed the seon-gwa, the specialized gwageo (civil service examinations) for Buddhist monks. He corresponded with various scholars of the time including Pak Saam, Heo Hagok, and Im Baekho. In 1575, he was recommended as head of the Seon order, but refused and instead traveled to Myohyangsan. There he was instructed by preceptor Hyujeong. He went on to pass three years at Bodeoksa on Mount Kumgang, and later traveled through Palgongsan, Cheongnyangsan, and Taebaeksan. With the start of the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98) in 1592, Yujeong joined his teacher Hyujeong's righteous army of monks. After Hyujeong retired due to his age, Yujeong took over the leadership of the army. He led the army into battles at Pyongyang and Uiryeong County in 1592, set up mountain fortresses through Gyeongsang in 1594, and joined in battle again at Ulsan and Suncheon. In 1604, after the end of the war, he traveled to Japan on Seonjo of Joseon's orders to forge a peace accord with Tokugawa Ieyasu, and returned with 3500 Koreans who had been taken prisoner.

History It was designed by Emery Roth and Sons of New York City. Tishman Properties also of New York City was the developer. Ground was broken in March 1958 and in April 1959 it opened to the public. There is a 600-car parking garage attached to the tower. It was built on the site of the old Greyhound bus station, after Greyhound built a new bus terminal on Superior Avenue a few blocks away from the East Ohio Building in 1948. East Ohio Gas, Cleveland's natural gas supplier, occupied the tower until its merger with Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion Resources. On the lobby level, East Ohio had a customer pay center and exhibits of the benefits of natural gas appliances. In addition, they had a meter showing how much natural gas was supplied to Cleveland.

The single-ended primary-inductor converter (SEPIC) is a type of DC/DC converter that allows the electrical potential (voltage) at its output to be greater than, less than, or equal to that at its input. The output of the SEPIC is controlled by the duty cycle of the control switch (S1). A SEPIC is essentially a boost converter followed by an inverted buck-boost converter, therefore it is similar to a traditional buck-boost converter, but has advantages of having non-inverted output (the output has the same voltage polarity as the input), using a series capacitor to couple energy from the input to the output (and thus can respond more gracefully to a short-circuit output), and being capable of true shutdown: when the switch S1 is turned off enough, the output (V0) drops to 0 V, following a fairly hefty transient dump of charge. SEPICs are useful in applications in which a battery voltage can be above and below that of the regulator's intended output. For example, a single lithium ion battery typically discharges from 4.2 volts to 3 volts; if other components require 3.3 volts, then the SEPIC would be effective.  Circuit operation  The schematic diagram for a basic SEPIC is shown in Figure 1. As with other switched mode power supplies (specifically DC-to-DC converters), the SEPIC exchanges energy between the capacitors and inductors in order to convert from one voltage to another. The amount of energy exchanged is controlled by switch S1, which is typically a transistor such as a MOSFET. MOSFETs offer much higher input impedance and lower voltage drop than bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), and do not require biasing resistors as MOSFET switching is controlled by differences in voltage rather than a current, as with BJTs.  Continuous mode  A SEPIC is said to be in continuous-conduction mode (\\"continuous mode\\") if the current through the inductor L1 never falls to zero. During a SEPIC's steady-state operation, the average voltage across capacitor C1 (VC1) is equal to the input voltage (Vin). Because capacitor C1 blocks direct current (DC), the average current through it (IC1) is zero, making inductor L2 the only source of DC load current. Therefore, the average current through inductor L2 (IL2) is the same as the average load current and hence independent of the input voltage. Looking at average voltages, the following can be written: V_{IN} = V_{L1} + V_{C1} + V_{L2} Because the average voltage of VC1 is equal to VIN, VL1 = ‚àíVL2. For this reason, the two inductors can be wound on the same core, which begins to resemble a Flyback converter, the most basic of the transformer-isolated SMPS topologies. Since the voltages are the same in magnitude, their effects on the mutual inductance will be zero, assuming the polarity of the windings is correct. Also, since the voltages are the same in magnitude, the ripple currents from the two inductors will be equal in magnitude. The average currents can be summed as follows (average capacitor currents must be zero): I_{D1} = I_{L1} - I_{L2} When switch S1 is turned on, current IL1 increases and the current IL2 goes more negative. (Mathematically, it decreases due to arrow direction.) The energy to increase the current IL1 comes from the input source. Since S1 is a short while closed, and the instantaneous voltage VL1 is approximately VIN, the voltage VL2 is approximately ‚àíVC1. Therefore, D1 is opened and the capacitor C1 supplies the energy to increase the magnitude of the current in IL2 and thus increase the energy stored in L2. IL is supplied by C2. The easiest way to visualize this is to consider the bias voltages of the circuit in a d.c. state, then close S1. Figure 2: With S1 closed current increases through L1 (green) and C1 discharges increasing current in L2 (red) When switch S1 is turned off, the current IC1 becomes the same as the current IL1, since inductors do not allow instantaneous changes in current. The current IL2 will continue in the negative direction, in fact it never reverses direction. It can be seen from the diagram that a negative IL2 will add to the current IL1 to increase the current delivered to the load. Using Kirchhoff's Current Law, it can be shown that ID1 = IC1 \\\\- IL2. It can then be concluded, that while S1 is off, power is delivered to the load from both L2 and L1. C1, however is being charged by L1 during this off cycle (as C2 by L1 and L2), and will in turn recharge L2 during the following on cycle. Figure 3: With S1 open current through L1 (green) and current through L2 (red) produce current through the load Because the potential (voltage) across capacitor C1 may reverse direction every cycle, a non-polarized capacitor should be used. However, a polarized tantalum or electrolytic capacitor may be used in some cases,Dongbing Zhang, Designing A Sepic Converter. May 2006, revised April 2013 Formerly National Semiconductor Application Note 1484, now Texas Instruments Application Report SNVA168E. because the potential (voltage) across capacitor C1 will not change unless the switch is closed long enough for a half cycle of resonance with inductor L2, and by this time the current in inductor L1 could be quite large. The capacitor CIN has no effect on the ideal circuit's analysis, but is required in actual regulator circuits to reduce the effects of parasitic inductance and internal resistance of the power supply. The boost/buck capabilities of the SEPIC are possible because of capacitor C1 and inductor L2. Inductor L1 and switch S1 create a standard boost converter, which generates a voltage (VS1) that is higher than VIN, whose magnitude is determined by the duty cycle of the switch S1. Since the average voltage across C1 is VIN, the output voltage (VO) is VS1 \\\\- VIN. If VS1 is less than double VIN, then the output voltage will be less than the input voltage. If VS1 is greater than double VIN, then the output voltage will be greater than the input voltage.  Discontinuous mode  A SEPIC is said to be in discontinuous-conduction mode or discontinuous mode if the current through the inductor L2 is allowed to fall to zero.  Reliability and efficiency  The voltage drop and switching time of diode D1 is critical to a SEPIC's reliability and efficiency. The diode's switching time needs to be extremely fast in order to not generate high voltage spikes across the inductors, which could cause damage to components. Fast conventional diodes or Schottky diodes may be used. The resistances in the inductors and the capacitors can also have large effects on the converter efficiency and output ripple. Inductors with lower series resistance allow less energy to be dissipated as heat, resulting in greater efficiency (a larger portion of the input power being transferred to the load). Capacitors with low equivalent series resistance (ESR) should also be used for C1 and C2 to minimize ripple and prevent heat build-up, especially in C1 where the current is changing direction frequently.  Disadvantages  * Like the buck‚Äìboost converter, the SEPIC has a pulsating output current. The similar ƒÜuk converter does not have this disadvantage, but it can only have negative output polarity, unless the isolated ƒÜuk converter is used. * Since the SEPIC converter transfers all its energy via the series capacitor, a capacitor with high capacitance and current handling capability is required. * The fourth-order nature of the converter also makes the SEPIC converter difficult to control, making it only suitable for very slow varying applications.

Femina, the oldest women's English magazine in the country, has been published for almost six decades. It has evolved to cover a broad spectrum of topics, including relationships, career, fashion, beauty, and women achievers who have left a mark in their chosen field. Femina India has 2.8 million followers on Facebook,https://www.facebook.com/feminawoman 556,600 on Instagram,https://www.instagram.com/feminaindia/ and 552,000 on Twitter.https://twitter.com/FeminaIndia The bimonthly magazine branched out into regionals with Femina Hindi, Femina Bangla and Femina Tamil. Apart from this, it publishes Femina Salon & Spa, which is distributed directly to Indian beauty businesses monthly, and verticals such as Femina Brides, Femina Parenting, and Femina Cookbook at varying periodicity. Some of its Marque properties are Femina Beauty Awards, Femina Women Awards, Femina Stylista, Femina Showcase, and few more. History and profile Femina was founded in 1959. The magazine was first published in July 1959. It has organized and sponsored the Femina Miss India beauty pageant since 1964. From 1994 to 1999, it also sponsored the Femina Look of the Year contest to send an Indian contestant to the Elite Model Look competition.  Editor 1959‚Äìpresent  Frene Talyakhan, after working as an editor with magazines like Trend and Flair, became the editor of Femina in 1959, when Flair was bought over by the Times of India group. The staff under her editorship were Ina Sen, Vimala Patil, Anita Sarkar and Nina Merchant. Patil became the editor of Femina in 1973, and remained so for the next 20 years. Patil was followed by Sathya Saran, who served as the editor from 1993 till 2005. Amy Fernandes held the post for a brief period of two years, i.e., from 2005 to 2007, post Saran, and was followed by Tanya Chaitanya, who is serving as the current editor of the magazine.  Tagline 1976‚Äìpresent  Femina's efforts to keep in sync with the changing times, becomes evident through its choice of tagline that accompanied the issues over the years. It exemplifies what kind of women it was trying to target at a particular time, as well as, what image of itself it wanted to be associated with. The tagline played a crucial role in the magazine's market strategy. The March 1976 issue has the tagline \\"Something exciting to look forward to every fortnight.\\" By February 1978, the tagline is reduced to three precise words, \\"Thoughtful, Contemporary, Aware.\\" From January to July 1981, the tagline, \\"The Exciting World of Women\\", aligns Femina's identity more as a women centric magazine. By August 1981, it changes to \\"A woman's window to the world.\\" In September 1982 issue, the tagline accompanying the Femina logo is \\"Woman at her best.\\" In the 1990s, the magazine carried the tagline \\"For the woman of substance.\\" By 2000, the tagline shifts to \\"Generation W\\", replacing the earlier label, and so addressing all the woman of a generation, and not just a select few women who are considered to be of substance, becoming more inclusive and broad. It shifts to \\"Believe\\" till 2009 and then by 2010 changes to \\"For all the women you are.\\" According to Tarun Rai, the CEO of Worldwide Media the reason behind the new tagline was to \\"celebrate how far the contemporary Indian woman has come\\" and that Femina \\"continues to be a beacon of change for her.\\" For Prachi Tiwari, Femina's brand publisher, this tagline is to pay a tribute to the \\"multifaceted woman of today, who is more than one person, playing more than one role.\\" In 2014, Femina relaunched with the tagline \\"Be Unstoppable\\", which is its running tagline as of 2019. For Tarun Rai, \\"Be Unstoppable\\" seeks to capture what the Femina brand believes in, which is that the modern women of India today have the confidence \\"to lives their lives on their terms and achieve more.\\"  \\"Prescription\\" Column  A new column was introduced in the late 1980s, specifically dedicated to answer any form of sexual dilemmas faced by women.

He takes on the responsibility of drawing Dave, a fellow veteran now an alcoholic, out of his shell by coaxing him to enjoy life again, as well as urging him to face up to some of his darker memories. Megs finds himself attracted to Dave's meek sister Martha, who lives with Dave and looks after him. This attraction leads to a love affair, much to Dave's disapproval. Dave eventually vents his anger and frustration at a high school prom where Martha is a chaperone being accompanied by Megs. This leads to Dave finally facing his demons and acknowledging Megs and Martha for being there for him. Afterwards, despite initially ending what was a promising romance, Megs returns to Martha.

He was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and was the son of John Lawson and Sarah Shatford (who are both buried in the Old Burying Ground). Business and public career He was a founding director and first president of the Bank of Nova Scotia, now known as Scotiabank.http://scotiabank.com/cda/content/0,1608,CID13701_LIDen,00.html?browsBy=year&category;=0&page;=0&startPage;=0&startYear;=1671&endYear;=1831 The bank was incorporated by the Nova Scotia Legislative Assembly on Mar 30, 1831 in Halifax, Nova Scotia with William Lawson (banker) (1772‚Äì1848) serving as the first president. As a member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, he introduced a bill chartering a public bank. The bill ensured that any bank directors were responsible for double the amount of their holdings in case of insolvency. This clause was an innovation in British North America, and came at a time when most banks limited liability to the value of a shareholder's stock. As a means of building trust and ensuring the savings of depositors, the concept provided stability to the fledgling bank which prospered and spread quickly from its inception in the Merchants' Coffee House, Halifax to become an international financial institution. Besides his mercantile and shipping ventures he served as an elected member of the Nova Scotia Legislative Assembly from 1806 to 1836, and was appointed to the Legislative Council from 1838 to 1845. Private life Grave of William Lawson's father and family, Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia) On 26 December 1793, he married Elizabeth Handyside who was the daughter of his stepmother from a previous marriage. Although technically brother and sister, the couple were not biological relatives. William and Elizabeth had fourteen children and resided in a house at the corner of Hollis and Salter streets, built by Malachy Salter, about 1760. The house was sold by Lawson's heirs in 1856 to John Esson, and the land now comprises part of the site of Maritime Centre, in downtown Halifax.

The Girl in the Taxi is the English-language adaptation by Frederick Fenn and Arthur Wimperis of the operetta Die keusche Susanne (1910 in Magdeburg), with music by Jean Gilbert. The German original had a libretto by Georg Okonkowski. The story begins with a man and a woman, both married, who flag the same taxi and then decide to share it, as they have the same restaurant destination. Various naughty supper rendezvous, and much hiding under tables or behind screens, ensue. The musical opened at the Lyric Theatre in London, produced by Philip Michael Faraday, on 5 September 1912 and ran for 385 performances. It starred Yvonne Arnaud as Suzanne, Arthur Playfair as Baron Dauvray, and Charles H. Workman as M. Pomarel. B. W.

The show was adapted back into French by Mars and Desvalli√®res and produced in Paris and then Lyon in 1913 as La chaste Suzanne. It was also successful in South America in Italian (La casta Susana) and in Spanish (La chasta Suzanna). Synopsis Pomarel totters drunkenly into the Jeunesse Dor√©e restaurant In Paris, Baron Dauvray enters a taxi from one side, and Mme. Charcot simultaneously enters it from the other. They do not know each other, but agree to share the taxi. They are both on their way to the famous Jeunesse Dor√©e restaurant and enjoy each other's company so much that they agree to dine together. The restaurant is full of private rooms, ideal for intimate suppers. Others who come to the restaurant, mostly in pursuit of amatory enterprise, are the Baron's son Hubert; the Baron's daughter, Jacqueline; R√©n√©, her fianc√© and cousin; Suzanne Pomarel, wife of a provincial merchant, whom the Baron has awarded a prize for virtue; Mme Charcot's husband; and finally M. Pomarel. Mme Pomarel is an old flame of R√©n√© and has agreed to have supper with him, but Hubert, who is much smitten by her, has persuaded R√©n√© to let him take his place. The Baron, dining with Mme Charcot, has to hide under his table to avoid his wife. Pomarel arrives, quite tipsy, and greets Hubert. He does not suspect that the lady who has concealed herself behind a curtain, and whose outstretched hand he kisses with bibulous gallantry, is his own wife. Hubert does not have sufficient funds to pay the bill. In the ensuing flurry, the Baron discovers to his delight that his son is as immoral as he. Everyone narrowly avoids detection by his or her proper partner. Unfortunately for the errant men and women, the head waiter of the restaurant has been engaged as butler by Baroness Dauvray. All the main characters are present at breakfast at the Baron's house the next morning. They are horrified that the new butler knows everything about their escapades of the previous evening. In order to avoid being recognised by him, the Baron, Hubert and R√©n√© all try to get under the table at the same time. In the end they manage to convince Pomarel that all the confusion was his fault for coming to the restaurant drunk. He apologises, and everyone is safe.

Football career Tommy Walker signed Ford for Hearts from junior side Bo'ness United in 1964, Ford having previously played with Vale of Avon. Ford quickly made the adjustment to top flight football, playing 7 times in his first full season in Gorgie, as Hearts lost the 1964‚Äì65 League title to Kilmarnock on goal average. At this stage, Ford was still playing as an amateur, combining football with studies in chartered accountancy. This understandably affected his footballing development and Ford's appearances over the following seasons were sporadic. However, upon completion of his final accountancy exams in 1967, Ford signed professional terms and became an integral part of the Hearts first team. He played over 30 times in each of the following 8 seasons before eventually transferring to Falkirk in 1976 at the age of 32. A serious knee injury forced him into retirement the following year. Ford was capped 3 times for the Scotland national team, making his debut against Czechoslovakia in 1973. He had previously played 9 times for the Scotland national amateur team. He was selected in the squad for the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany but did not make an appearance. Ford's international recognition was especially notable as his career coincided with a gradual decline in Hearts' playing fortunes. Despite Ford striking up a successful front pairing with Drew Busby, the side struggled to match the standards set in the 1950s and early 60s. His only honours were runners-up medals: for the League in 1964‚Äì65, for the 1967‚Äì68 Scottish Cup and the 1970‚Äì71 Texaco Cup. Indeed, Ford was one of only two Hearts players capped in the 1970s, the other being goalkeeper Jim Cruickshank. Cricket career Ford was an all-round sportsman and, as well as playing professional football, he was also a competent cricketer. During his footballing years, he regularly played for the West Lothian County side during the summer off-season. Ford's cricket career outlasted his footballing one, and so he was able to devote more time to it in his veteran years, captaining West Lothian for 3 seasons in his mid-thirties. His undoubted cricketing highlight was selection in the first Scotland squad for the Benson & Hedges Cup, in 1980. After retirement Ford has remained active in the public sphere since his retirement from the sporting fields, serving on the Scottish Sports Council for a spell in the 1990s and as a local councillor in Linlithgow. He was also involved with Radio Forth's local football coverage in the 1980s. In 1991, Ford left the accountancy profession and became a professional landscape photographer, a field he continues to work in to this day. As a proud Hearts supporter, Ford has maintained an active interest in the club since his playing retirement. He played a significant role in persuading Wallace Mercer to invest in the club in the early 1980s, at a time when it teetered on the financial precipice. Within 5 years of Mercer's involvement the club had returned to the top flight and European football. Similarly, he was a vocal advocate of the fans campaign to prevent the sale of Tynecastle Stadium to clear debts by then Hearts chairman Chris Robinson during the 2004‚Äì05 season .

Although common in the early days of railways, by the 20th century they were largely confined to branch lines with little traffic. Typically, service was slower, because mixed trains usually involved the shunting (switching) of rolling stock at stops along the way. However, some earlier passenger expresses, which also hauled time-sensitive freight in covered goods wagons (boxcars), would now be termed mixed trains. Generally, toward the end of the mixed train era, shunting at intermediate stops had significantly diminished. Nowadays, most railway passenger and freight services are administered separately. Exclusions Not intended by this article is the definition of mixed train to describe: ‚Ä¢ mixed freight. ‚Ä¢ wagonload service (single wagons for various customers, assembled into trains), as opposed to trainload service (point to point, complete train for one customer). ‚Ä¢ a passenger train that runs sections as an express, but makes frequent stops elsewhere. ‚Ä¢ a train consisting of carriages of different classes (historical use). Mixed train near Ixopo, KwaZulu-Natal, 2005. Passenger trains that can carry travellers' cars on freight wagons at the rear of the train are excluded. Called motorail, such services operate in Austria, Turkey, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Finland, Serbia, Australia, Canada, Chile, and the US. Car shuttle trains, on which passengers travel within their vehicles, are also omitted. Africa and Asia In parts of Asia and Africa, mixed trains still operate along corridors with reduced traffic. Routes include Asmara‚ÄìGhinda, Bulawayo‚ÄìHarare, Elazƒ±ƒü‚ÄìTatvan, Fianarantsoa‚ÄìManakara, Kandy‚ÄìBadulla, Livingstone‚ÄìMulobezi, Phnom Penh‚ÄìPoipet, and Zahedan Mixed Passenger. Australia In Australia, mixed trains could also be called a \\"car goods\\", \\"goods train with car attached\\", or \\"mixed goods\\". However in some countries, the latter term refers instead to a freight train carrying multiple types of freight rather a single commodity. In most states, a mixed train was technically a goods train with passenger accommodation, meaning it had lower priority over other trains and could be cancelled without notice if there were no goods to carry. The Victorian Railways had a class of train called a \\"limited through mixed\\" which limited the amount of goods and ran to a set timetable and would be guaranteed to run even without waiting goods. Forming a further type of mixed train, railmotors or railcars might haul a one or two goods wagons or a goods brake van carrying some freight. PmG mixed train, Floh-Seligenthal, Thuringia, East Germany, 1989 Austria, Germany and Switzerland In German-speaking countries, two main types of mixed train (Gemischter Zug) existed: the GmP and the PmG. GmP The GmP was a \\"goods train with passenger service\\" (G√ºterzug mit Personenbef√∂rderung); namely a goods train with one or more passenger coaches. These were common on branch lines and were run for the following reasons: *Low numbers of passengers that did not warrant the use of dedicated passenger trains. *Insufficient rolling stock and/or railway staff to operate separate goods and passenger trains. *High levels of traffic, requiring combined services for safe and efficient operation. To reduce smoke exposure, the passenger coaches were usually located well back from the locomotive. However, when heating was required during cold weather, the coaches connected immediately behind the locomotive, because most goods wagons lacked heating-pipe conduits. Mixed train of the Hohenzollerische Landesbahn, 1985 Into the 1980s, the Deutsche Bundesbahn ran GmP trains occasionally, but adding or detaching rolling stock created long wait times at stops, which contributed to their demise. They are no longer found in Germany, Austria or Switzerland. PmG The other variant in German-speaking countries was the PmG or \\"passenger train with goods service\\" (Personenzug mit G√ºterbef√∂rderung). The Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany continued to operate some of these trains until the early 1990s. These comprised one or more goods wagons running behind the passenger coaches. Towards the end, no shunting took place at the intermediate stations. Some private railways once ran PmG trains. Passenger trains transporting skiers, in places like Interlaken, still haul an open wagon for ski equipment. New Zealand Mixed trains were once prolific in New Zealand. Although express trains operated on the main lines, mixed trains served rural branch lines where dedicated passenger services would be uneconomical. On the more significant provincial routes, substituting a mixed train during the off- season was common in the late 19th century (the Rotorua Express), or operating the provincial express twice or thrice weekly while mixed services ran daily (the Taneatua Express). Mixed train, near Hukanui or Ormondville, c.1929. The shortcomings of mixed trains for passenger travel led the New Zealand Railways Department to investigate railcar technology in the early 20th century. Overseas designs could not be easily adapted to New Zealand owing to its rugged conditions, narrow gauge track, and small loading gauge. Early railcars trials, such as the RM class Model T Ford railbuses, proved unsatisfactory. When successfully introduced from the 1930s, railcars primarily replaced unprofitable provincial carriage trains, and some mixed services in regions such as the West Coast and Taranaki. Mixed trains dominated the South Island's more extensive branch-line network, but as private car ownership increased in the 1930s, passenger traffic decreased, closing many rural train routes. However, some mixed services lasted into the 1960s in isolated regions with poor roads. In the North Island, the last mixed trains operated into the 1970s, where services on the North Auckland Line ran until 1976. An updated type of mixed train existed in the South Island for a few years during the 1990s, when a few wagons of express containerised freight were attached to the TranzCoastal Picton‚ÄìChristchurch express. Unlike prior era mixed trains, with their slow en route shunting, this time-sensitive freight travelled swiftly. North America In North America, most branch lines, and sections of main lines, were worked by mixed trains. One or more passenger trains had served some routes, which switched to mixed trains as increased use of cars after the First World War depressed passenger traffic. These were freight trains, that rarely had more than one passenger car, and sometimes ran with a combined passenger, mail and baggage car. Distinct from the typical slow version was the Prince Rupert fish/passenger express. The former slower types were sometimes called way freights, whose end coincided with numerous passenger services over several decades terminating in the 1970s. In the US, the Seaboard Coast Line Atlanta‚ÄìAugusta mixed train operated until 1983. The last mixed train on the Canadian Pacific Railway was the Midland's Windsor‚ÄìTruro, Nova Scotia mixed train, which operated until 1979. By 1990, mixed trains existed on only four routes in Canada, namely the Via Rail (formerly Canadian National Railway) Wabowden‚ÄìChurchill (ceased 2002) and The Pas‚ÄìLynn Lake, the Ontario Northland Cochrane‚ÄìMoosonee, and the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Sept Isles‚ÄìLabrador City/Schefferville. Currently, the Keewatin Railway's The Pas‚ÄìPukatawagan leases passenger cars from Via Rail. Tshiuetin Rail Transportation operates in northern Quebec. These operations are the two surviving mixed trains in North America. United Kingdom The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway added passenger coaches to its daily goods in each direction from November 1841 to avail of local traffic, Mixed train, Ffestiniog Railway, 1871. In 1864, the Ffestiniog Railway introduced mixed trains, with passenger coaches in the middle for the ascent. Down trains were run in up to four separate (uncoupled) portions: loaded slate wagons, goods wagons, passenger carriages and the locomotive running light. This practice changed to a whole descending train, headed by the locomotive, for safety reasons. Hythe Pier Train, 2017. Opened in 1866, the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway operated mixed trains during its early years. On market days when space was at a premium, passengers sat on coal in the tender and crowded onto the footplate. The Regulation Act of 1889 generally prohibited traditional mixed trains because the absence of continuous braking apparatus on wagons preceding the coaches jeopardized passenger safety. However, the Board of Trade exercised latitude in enforcing this rule, and some mixed trains ran until the end of the steam era. Goods wagons/vans requiring speedy delivery could be attached to the end of passenger trains. This included horse boxes, cattle wagons, parcels vans, newspaper vans, fish vans, milk tanks and churn vans. Possibly one of the last scheduled mixed services in the UK is the Hythe Pier, Railway and Ferry in Hampshire. This service is the oldest continually running pier train in the world (since 1922) and regularly carries diesel fuel to the pier head for the ferry.

The tower was designed by William R. Coats and built as part of an elaborate city waterworks project that began in 1889. Located on the highest point in Ypsilanti, the tower was built in 1890 at a cost of $21,435.63 (). Today the tower is frequently joked about for its phallic shape. It has become a well-known landmark in Ypsilanti, and due to the building's shape and location, the tower is frequently used by residents as a point for providing directions for visitors and residents. History An ordinance passed on April 14, 1898, established a yearly rate schedule for residences with running water. Rates were based on the number of faucets in use, the type of business that customers operated and the livestock they owned. A residence with one tap was charged $5.00 and a private bathtub cost an additional $2.00. Saloon keepers paid $7.00 for one faucet, $3.00 for each additional faucet and $1.00 for each billiard table. Each cow a person owned cost $1.00. People who failed to pay their bill were subject to a $50.00 fine and 90 days in the county jail. During the construction, hoping to protect themselves from injury, the builders made at least four crosses in the stonework, one over the west door, an elaborate but difficult to find Greek Cross on the east side and two inside the water tower. It was completed on February 3, 1890, at the cost of $21,368. The structure was the only water tower in the Ypsilanti water system until 1956. The Ypsilanti Community Utilities Authority began operating and maintaining the structure in 1974. That same year the tower was designated by the American Water Works Association as an American Water Landmark. It was also designated a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the Michigan Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers. In 1976 it was restored. Structure The exterior was designed in the popular Queen Anne style of the period. Queen Anne design was less formal than other popular styles at the time; instead it experimented with different shapes particularly towers. Queen Anne buildings also often had more decoration than this structure. The stone tower is located at the highest point of elevation of the city on Summit Street. The tower is made of Joliet limestone. The tower is tall, has an base. The substructure walls taper from a thickness of at the bottom to at the top. The reservoir holds a steel tank. When it was constructed it had a dual purpose. Not only did it store water but the falling water also generated electricity for the city street lamps at night. Bust of Demetrius Ypsilanti. Note cross in stonework over the entrance. A marble bust of Demetrius Ypsilanti stands between a Greek and a U.S. flag at the base of the water tower. The city of Ypsilanti is named after this hero of Greek independence. Present day The tower has long been a source of humor for comedians in the Ann Arbor‚ÄìYpsilanti area, for its decidedly phallic shape‚Äîfor which it has been nicknamed \\"the Brick Dick\\". (A long-standing urban legend holds that the tower will crumble if a virgin ever graduates from nearby Eastern Michigan University. This is similar to other legends surrounding various landmarks worldwide.) In 2003 Cabinet magazine ranked the tower as the World's Most Phallic Building.

Early life and rise to prominence Disston was born May 23, 1819 in Tewkesbury, England in 1819. He arrived in America, as a boy of 14 with his 16-year-old sister, Marianna. Three days after arriving in Philadelphia they were orphaned by the sudden death of their father, Thomas Disston, who had brought them there. Henry Disston took a job there as a saw-maker's apprentice. In 1840, he left Lindley, Johnson & Whitcraft started and started his own saw-making business. Around the time he opened his shop he married Amanda Bickley. She tragically died not long after giving birth to twins who only survived a few hours. He later remarried to Mary Steelman in 1843. By 1850, Disston's saws were renowned in the United States, even as compared against the English manufactures that were usually thought superior. Disston encouraged emigration from England to staff his factory with skilled workers. During the American Civil War, a protective tariff on foreign manufactured goods helped expand Disston's enterprise still more, and despite a fire that ruined the factory, Disston prospered through the 1860s. Move to Tacony By 1871, Disston's saw mill had outgrown its factory and he moved the business to the outlying neighborhood of Tacony, in what is now Northeast Philadelphia. At the time, Tacony was a small outlying area of Philadelphia, but it was located near the railroad and the Delaware River, and provided Disston with room for his saw mill to grow. Disston constructed homes for his workers, and designed them in an effort to improve their surroundings from their former dwellings in Philadelphia. This area of Tacony, known as the Disston Estate, was designed to bear Disston's imprint in the fashion of true Victorian utopianism. Skewback saw Disston's \\"skewback saw\\", was developed around 1874, anecdotally based on a chalk design created on an office floor, and gained significant market share, though whether the design itself was superior, or the all round high quality of Disston's materials and production is not clear. Failing health and death Disston mausoleum in Laurel Hill Cemetery By the late 1870s, Disston's business and social enterprises were succeeding, but his own health was failing. Despite his failing health, Disston generously supported the founding of a homeless shelter, Sunday Breakfast Rescue Mission. After falling ill in 1877, he suffered a stroke and died in 1878. He is buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery.

Before Highway 101 was constructed, this area was one with Whitley Heights and considered part of the original Hollywood Hills. The generally accepted borders of \\"the Dell\\" are east of Cahuenga, north of Franklin, west of Argyle, and south of the Hollywood Reservoir. It is fully encompassed by zip code 90068. The Hollywood Dell is so named because it sits \\"in\\" the hills just above commercial and tourist-popular Hollywood, rather than atop the hills. In general, one must travel downhill to enter the dell, and uphill to exit it. The roads within the dell are mainly hilly, and many homes are built on hillside lots. With its close proximity to the Hollywood Bowl, the Dell is a popular free parking area for concertgoers. Concert parking is prohibited for such purposes, and a number of entries are guarded. However, locals who know their way around can get into the neighborhood and contribute to a problematic overcrowded parking situation on concert nights. Typical residences in the Hollywood Dell are single-family dwellings with a heavy influence of Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture.

When the story begins, Randy only needs $500 to appeal his conviction. His mother is working to the bone in order to earn enough money to get the money. His mother soon finds out that his brother has been attacked and stabbed while in jail and is in medical care. Some members of the Scorpions want Jamal to join them until Randy is freed from jail so that there will be direct communication between the gang and Randy. Other members want to vote on a new leader because they feel Randy is dead to them and that letting a 12-year-old joining a gang would not be beneficial. Jamal wants to earn money the right way by working but is scared to go against the Scorpions. Eventually, Jamal breaks free from the bad influence and does the right thing.

Their first appearance was in Strange Tales #127 (Dec 1964). They are extra-dimensional creatures summoned via magic to do the bidding of others (they have no will of their own). They appear to have a thick, roughly humanoid shape standing taller than most men and a hide that appears to be made of rock. They have no faces to speak of except a single glowing eye. They have savage dispositions and minimal intelligence. Publication history The Mindless Ones first appeared in Strange Tales #127 (December 1964), and were created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. The Mindless Ones have also appeared in Darkhawk #19-20 (September‚ÄìOctober 1992), Sleepwalker #17 (October 1992), Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #82 (October 1995), Marvel Boy Volume 2, #5-6 (December 2000, March 2001), Fantastic Four #70 (August 2003), Amazing Spider-Man #57-#58 (November 2003), Amazing Spider- Man #500 (December 2003), and Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. #7-8 (November 2006), among other comics. Fictional history Long ago, the wizard King Olnar sat on the throne of the Dark Dimension. He is visited by Umar and Dormammu, siblings of a race of magical energy beings called the Faltine. During this time, Olnar melds the Mindless Ones' home dimension to the Dark Dimension. They rampage throughout the lands, killing many, including Olnar, and almost slaying the two Faltine. The siblings create a barrier to keep them contained. From that point they are most often seen in the employ of Dormammu, who develops an ability to slightly control their actions.Doctor Strange #25 (1991) They have also been utilized by others such as Doctor Doom, Dr. Midas (in the pages of Marvel Boy) and a fellow Faltine named Rorkannu (in Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.). Dr. Doom uses them after gaining high levels of magical power via a deal with demonic entities. The Mindless Ones are utilized to beat on Ben Grimm, a member of the Fantastic Four, in a test of Grimm's durability.Fantastic Four #500 (October 2003) Sleepwalker When Spider- Man is banished to the Dark Dimension by a brainwashed Portal, he is attacked by a group of Mindless Ones. To rescue him, Darkhawk and Sleepwalker battle the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and break Sauron's control over Portal so they could retrieve Spider-Man. A gang of Mindless Ones follow Spider-Man through the portal leading back to Earth, but the three heroes beat the monsters back and drive them back through the gateway before Portal seals the way.Darkhawk #19-20, Sleepwalker #17 (October 1992) Amazing Spider-Man In another, separate incident,Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2, #57-#58 (Oct. 2003) they invade and destroyed much of New York City's famed Times Square. A force that consists of Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Cyclops, Thor, Iron Man, Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Girl and the Human Torch help stop them, mainly by creating barriers. It is revealed this is the first instance Spider-Man has encountered these creatures. The Mindless Ones are temporarily defeated when Mr. Fantastic creates a machine that manipulates their magical energies, drawing them back to where they came from. This, unfortunately, results in the temporary return of Dormammu. Dr. Strange confronts the evil wizard. A punch from a single Mindless One sends Spider-Man straight into the magic Strange is utilizing, resulting in a time travel trip. Spider-Man sees a future where the Mindless Ones have reduced Times Square to rubble and killed Ben Grimm and Thor. A future Mary-Jane is chased by a batch of Mindless Ones and despite Spider-Man's efforts, she is killed.Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2, #58 (Nov. 2003) Further time-travel allows Spider-Man to prevent the usage of the machine in the first place. Doctor Strange's magic is what banishes the Mindless Ones, leaving Times Square damaged but still standing.Amazing Spider-Man #500 Around this time, a single Mindless One appears as a minion of the villain Doctor Midas.Marvel Boy Volume 2, #5-6 Nextwave Rorkannu, who physically resembles Dormammu and claims to be lord of the Dank Dimension, is stated to control a group of Mindless Ones.

His lair is discovered by the hero known as the 'Captain'. His summoning circle is destroyed. Rorkannu himself is severely beaten and left to an uncertain fate.Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. #8 (September 2006) Cable and Deadpool The Mindless Ones appeared in an issue of Cable & Deadpool in which Deadpool and Bob, Agent of HYDRA encounter them in their own dimension. The two are being manipulated by Doctor Strange. The Mindless Ones alternately attack and worship the two protagonists, evidently mistaking the light from a glow stick for some sort of magical power, and revering whoever it seemed to be emanating from. Deadpool and Bob end up causing the deaths of several Mindless Ones as a needed sacrifice to close down a magical catastrophe threatening innocent lives.Cable & Deadpool #47 (January 2008) Captain Britain and MI13 Plokta, a Duke of Hell, decided to conquer the world exponentially from a tower block in Birmingham.

It is about northwest of the centre of Meaford and northeast of the city of Owen Sound, about inland of Owen Sound on Georgian Bay, Lake Huron. Settled in the early 1850s by Scottish immigrants, Balaclava grew around a mill established by George Scott. The majority of settlers came as a result of the Highland Clearances and/or the Potato Famine (1846-1857). Balaclava was originally located at Lot 3, Concession B, and Lot 4, Concession C of Sydenham Township in Grey County (see External Links). Gradually the village moved a mile and a quarter south to its present location at the junction of County Grey Road 20 and Side Road 8. Its name is likely derived from the Crimean War (1853-1856) and the Battle of Balaclava, which occurred on October 25, 1854, and in which many Scottish soldiers died. Early businesses and services Balaclava School (March, 2007) A school was built in 1862. This building burned shortly thereafter, and classes were held in the Orange Lodge until a new log school was built on the site of the modern school building. Attendance in 1862 averaged 25 students. However, in the early days, many older students attended only in the winter as they were needed at home on the farm. The Balaclava school closed in June 1965. Students were transported to nearby Leith for the next two years until 1967, when Sydenham Central School was opened in Owen Sound. A post office opened on February 1, 1890; W.H. Hunt as the postmaster. The post office remained open until November 30, 1961. Balaclava Store (March, 2007) The first general store was opened in the 1860s and owned by John Kergan. The general store often incorporated postal services. Numerous proprietors ran the store in Balaclava's original location, including Larry Hunt, David Dodge, and George Howitt. As the village moved southward in the early 1900s, a new store was opened by John Watson in his frame home. The large brick building which would become the general store until the early 1960s was built in 1919. Mr. Herb Dickson ran the store until 1961. The store remained closed until 1965, when Bruce Keill opened it for summer business until 1967. There was never a church located in Balaclava. Nearby churches included Johnstone United, built in 1855, and Silcote United, built 1877. The last of these to remain open was Johnstone, which closed in the early 1970s. The congregations moved to Annan United, located in Annan, Ontario, six miles (10 km) south-west of Balaclava, and Woodford United, located some 10 miles (20 km) south-east. Balaclava's Original Post Office At least one blacksmith shop operated at Balaclava's original location. When the village moved, a new one was built on lot 8 of concession C. John Lourie took over the shop in the 1920s and continued to operate it into the 1970s. A telephone company was formed in 1912 to connect to the Bell Telephone Company (Bell Canada) at Owen Sound. The 34 original subscribers each paid $35 to join, and \\"bees\\" were held throughout that summer to erect the poles. There were three circuits: 695, 696, and 697. The line operated until 1960, when it was bought out by Bell. The switch board system was then replaced and updated to the dial system. At one time Balaclava boasted two blacksmith shops, a woodworking shop, a post office, three stores, and a hotel. Decline The economy of Balaclava was dealt a serious blow in 1942, when the government of Canada purchased 17,500 acres (68 km¬≤) to create what has become known as the Meaford Tank Range (LFCATC Meaford). This displaced dozens of local farm families. The land was deemed ideal for military training since it incorporated limestone cliffs, rolling open ground, and dense bush. The area was also interspersed with a year-round swamp, a lake, and 22 kilometres of shoreline to the east and north. Sports Throughout its history, Balaclava has had a strong sporting tradition. Local young men would work all day, and participate in cricket, football (soccer), softball, and hockey in the evenings. Or matches would often be the central entertainment at garden parties. Cricket teams were organized as early as the late 1850s, with the first township match occurring in 1864, in Balaclava. George Sr. and John Scott were strong players with this team. During the 1920s and 1930s, football (soccer) was the sport of choice. Members of Balaclava's 20s team included Walter Scott, Duncan Moulton, Luther Clar, Norm Waterton, Ben Johnstone, Robert Lourie, George Fraser, Will Moulton, Robert Watson, Albert Laycock, and Mike Robertson. In the late 1930s, Balaclava joined the Sydenham Soccer league, composed of teams from Annan, Bognor, and Strathaven. Balaclava won the championship in 1938. They went on to play Owen Sound, who had won the championship in their league. Although Owen Sound was strongly favoured to win, Balaclava managed to defeat them by the score of 1-0. By the 1940s, hockey had become the predominant sport. In the 1946/47 season, Balaclava entered a team in the Rural Hockey League, which included teams from Woodford, Chatsworth, Kilsyth, Tara, and Allenford. Balaclava won the league, and at the celebratory banquet Syl Apps and Gus Bodnar were guest speakers. Members of this championship team included Lloyd Spence, Harold Scott, Jim Lemon, Norm Bell, Ken Spence, and Tom Johnson, G. Abbot (coach), W. Spence, Gordon Scott, Carl Spence, Elgin Vanwyck, Earl Spence, Russ Farquharson, and Ernest Vanwyck (manager). Cricket teams were organized as early as the late 1850s with the first township match occurring in 1864, in Balaclava. George Sr. and John Scott were strong players with this team. 1989 Balaclava Burners Between 1950 and 1970, little sport was played in Balaclava. The youth of the area would often meet at the home of Harold and Doreen Scott for pick-up baseball games or at Jim and Lorraine Lemon's for impromptu soccer or hockey matches. This was a period when school expansion and amalgamation occurred. In the mid-1970s, three local young men - Lane Lemon, Paul J Scott, and Lloyd Mitchell - formed the Balaclava Burners. This team drew others from the communities of Leith, Annan, and even Owen Sound. Since the nearest year-round ice surface was in Owen Sound, practices and games were often held there, although the team also played in Keady, Chatsworth, Kilsyth, and Wiarton. Members of the team in 1987 included (from bottom left) Gary Tottenham, Joe O'Reilly, Ken Morrison, Pat Moore, and Steve Hiscox; and (from top left) Jeff Morrison (Equipment Manager), Paul J Scott, Lane Lemon, Craig Stephens, Scott Davis, Ted Van Balkom, Paul Smith, Tim Hughes, Bev Davidson, Jim Edmonstone, and Jeff Harron (managing due to suspension).  Culture  Great Lakes Jam In late August 2004, executive producer Wolfgang Siebert staged a three-day rock festival on top of Coffin Hill, west of Balaclava and with a panoramic view of Georgian Bay. The of rolling hills of the main site had camping, washroom, and shower facilities. Cheap Trick at Great Lakes JamBeginning on August 27, the festival featured Alice Cooper, Joe Walsh, The B-52's, Johnny Winter, Creedence Clearwater Revisited, Blue √ñyster Cult, Steppenwolf, Kim Mitchell, Rick Derringer, and Cheap Trick, among others. Part of the proceeds of the event were to go to the Grey County Cattlemen's Association as well as St. John Ambulance, which was building a new training centre and office called the Ed Tottenham House in Owen Sound. Siebert's plan was to stage further concerts at the site each summer. However, a local community group blocked his plans, because of improper clearances and concerns about traffic flows, and future concerts have been stopped until these concerns are addressed.Festival web site Housing development Two housing developments are in progress near Balaclava.

In 1997 they moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where they lived for nearly 12 years before returning to Tulsa in 2009. She has since divorced and relocated to McKinney, Texas. At age 53 in 2010, Ford went into sudden cardiac arrest while exercising on an elliptical machine. She had no prior knowledge that she had heart disease. Ford says she was \\"extremely lucky\\" that while she was in the gym, a surgeon was \\"walking up the steps\\" and \\"shocked\\" her back. She was revived with an automated external defibrillator. After her recovery, she was given a heart stent and pacemaker. She spoke of the experience on June 4, 2013 at the American Heart Association's Heart Ball in Grand Rapids.

Although he was found guilty of multiple crimes, he was first amnestied and then pardoned. Illegal detention centers and kidnappings Camps, then a colonel, led the police of Buenos Aires Province between April 1976 and December 1977, and oversaw twenty illegal detention centers. NuncaMas.org. Juicio por la verdad (La Plata) (transcriptions of court testimonies) During those twenty months, he was responsible for 214 extorsive kidnappings, 120 cases of torture, 32 homicides, two rapes, two miscarriages caused by torture, 18 acts of theft, and the appropriation (for illegal adoption) of 10 minors. Terra Actualidad, 18 March 2006. Ram√≥n Camps: el peor de todos. Camps led the operation known as the Night of the Pencils, in September 1976, on which 10 Montoneros were kidnapped, tortured, and killed or released months or years later. He was also responsible for the kidnapping, torture and confinement of journalist Jacobo Timerman, who published the left-leaning newspaper La Opini√≥n. Timerman was eventually released and deported in 1979, as the military command caved in to international pressure. Prison sentence and amnesty In December 1986, three years after the end of the dictatorship, he was sentenced to a 25-year term in prison, but he benefited from the amnesty granted to all but the higher officials by the law of Due Obedience and the full stop law). His second-in-command, Miguel Etchecolatz, was also tried and granted these benefits, but was sentenced to a life term for crimes against humanity in 2006, after the laws were repealed. The Catholic priest Cristian Von Wernich, former police chaplain and Camps' personal confessor, was convicted in 2007 of multiple counts of homicide, torture and kidnapping; he also received a life sentence.

Una gira por las comisar√≠as. Camps was initially to be let free because, given the precarious stability achieved in 1983, the democratic government of President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n had focused on the nine commanders of the juntas, who were tried and sentenced on the understanding that they were to take the blame for all the crimes committed under their rule. Camps, however, had publicly acknowledged his responsibility in human rights abuses of such nature that he brought justice on himself. The former police chief told Clar√≠n, in 1984, that he had used torture as a method of interrogation and orchestrated 5,000 forced disappearances, and justified the appropriation of newborns from their imprisoned mothers \\"because subversive parents will raise subversive children\\". Camps enjoyed an effective amnesty as a result of the two \\"Pardon Laws\\", which limited the responsibility for most crimes of the dictatorship to the top of the command chain and voided further investigations. The rest of the case against him was voided, as with other military and police officers, by the series of pardons granted by President Carlos Menem in 1989 and 1990. Public activities following amnesty After retiring from the police command, Camps appeared frequently in the media to speak against Timerman, Judaism and communism, as well as appearing as a commentator in the news show 60 Minutos during the Falklands War (1982). Together with First Army Corps Commander Guillermo Su√°rez Mason he set up a company called SCA, ostensibly a coffee and fruit trader, but in fact only a facade for an arms company, which sold weapons to counter-insurgency forces in Central America. Upon the return of democratic rule, Camps wrote articles for the far-right nationalist-Catholic magazine Cabildo, and published a book on financist David Graiver and about \\"the Zionist danger\\".

Plot Adam Adam, who is severely autistic, is learning shapes and words in his backyard. His father, Don, is trying very hard to show Adam words, but Adam seems more interested in drawing lines on his chalkboard. While eating his lunch, Adam gags as if choking, grabs at his chest, and screams loudly. While House and his team are doing the differential diagnosis for Adam, he notices that the blood-stained carpet in his office has been replaced. He goes to complain to Cuddy, who has no intentions of returning the carpet. As a result, House refuses to return to his office. Cuddy suggests working in the Clinic, but he begins to work in other people's offices during the course of the episode. While House is complaining to Cuddy, the rest of House's team tries to strap Adam down and get him into an MRI machine. It takes time because Adam must first finish a video game, which his father insists that the team does not want to interrupt. After the MRI, Chase and Cameron go to Adam's house to run tests. Foreman tells House that all the tests are negative. House then meets with his team in the clinic and orders his team to get a stool sample. Before the team can take the sample, Adam has another fit and coughs up fluid from his lungs. House moves into Wilson's office after he is evicted from the clinic by Cuddy, and Wilson is not happy. The team finds a heart problem, but House brushes this off and continues with his diagnosis. In the end, Foreman is instructed to do a biopsy of his lung. Foreman consults Wilson, who recommends taking a biopsy of the lymph node under Adam's arm to look for cancer. Foreman tricks Wilson into doing the biopsy in order to avoid dealing with Adam himself. The biopsy finds liver cells under Adam's arm. Another differential in Wilson's office suggests that Adam may have suffered liver damage, leading to its cells flowing into the lymphatic system. House then moves to Cuddy's office for the differential and is discussing the presence of calcium carbonate in Adam's stool when he is evicted by Cuddy again, with the news that Adam is in a cardiac intensive care unit. Adam is stabilized, and House considers the possibility of pica, believing that Adam may have been eating non-food items since calcium carbonate is found in blackboard chalk. He orders his staff to get samples from the house. While searching the backyard, Foreman finds jimson weed and suspects that might be the source of the problem. However, House is skeptical. When Adam's eyeball moves awkwardly, a surgery is scheduled for a possible tumor. House continues with the differential, this time in the hospital chapel. They decide to do a CT scan of Adam's head for tumors, and to remove the eye if the CT scan does not reveal anything. Sitting amongst Adam's toys, House finally makes a connection. He shows that the boy has roundworms floating in his eye; they have also infested his heart, lungs, and liver. Adam picked up the parasites by eating sand contaminated with raccoon feces from his sandbox. The lines he kept drawing were actually the worms that blocked his vision. House orders anti-parasitic medication and laser eye therapy to clear up the problems. Wilson notes that House's apparent interest and connection with his autistic patient indicates a possible diagnosis of Asperger syndrome in House himself, but soon dismisses this idea and concludes that House is simply a jerk. As Adam and his parents are leaving, House observes them from a nearby seat with Wilson. He comments on their lack of genuine joy, inventing an arbitrary happiness scale and giving them a relatively low score. He reasons that this is because they are dreading the return to their heavily regimented lifestyle with an autistic child. As they stop to thank House, Adam holds eye contact with House before giving him his handheld video game, a most unusual gesture for an autistic child. Upon seeing the reaction of the parent, Wilson gives them a 'ten' on House's scale. The old carpet is laid back down in House's office exposing the blood stain, and Cameron says to House, \\"All change is bad? It's not true, you know.\\" Ali While House is treating Adam, the seventeen-year-old daughter of a clinic patient in the last episode has developed a crush on him. She tracks House down by visiting the clinic, flirting heavily with him and exposing her breasts in exam. Cuddy tells House that Ali (Leighton Meester) is stalking him and that she will call security. Later, House finds Ali sitting on his motorcycle. She continues flirting, undeterred by earlier unanswered calls. However, Cuddy interrupts their exchange again and sends Ali away. Even though House is flattered by Ali's feelings for him, he really is not interested in her; however, he does not want to hurt her feelings. Cuddy lies to House, trying to get him away from Ali, but then cracks under House's pressure and reveals that Ali is locked in her office and House should talk her down and send her off for good. House observes Ali crying milky tears. Having recently experienced an earthquake in Fresno, she likely inhaled a fungal spore ‚Äì Coccidioides immitis in her brain, which was released during the earthquake. As most of her symptoms developed in her head, it may be that the spores mostly concentrated in her sinuses and resulted in headaches, cough, and her loss of inhibition and judgement. In his final speech to Ali in the episode in an attempt to scare her away, House indirectly quotes the famous romantic speech at the end of Casablanca: \\"We will always have Fresno\\". May‚ÄìDecember The theme of 17-year-old Ali (Leighton Meester) ignoring the appropriateness of age disparity in a (potential) sexual relationship with House (Hugh Laurie) would recur for the two actors in the 2011 film The Oranges, when Laurie's character enters into an affair with Meester's character, the 20-something daughter of his best friend.

A native of the state, he played baseball and football at what is now Oregon State University where he participated in three sports. On the football team, he played three positions and earned the nickname of Ironhorse and all-conference honors. In baseball, he was a right-handed outfielder and after leaving school started his professional career in the minor leagues. Schulmerich then became the first player from the school to make it to the Major Leagues, playing for three teams in the early 1930s. He is a member of the Oregon State University Sports Hall of Fame and the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame. Early life Edward Wesley \\"Wes\\" Schulmerich was born to German immigrants in Hillsboro, Oregon, on August 21, 1901.Wes Schulmerich: Trades. Baseball Almanac. Retrieved on April 26, 2009.

After two years he dropped out of the school and worked on his father's farm. In 1921, he enrolled at the Columbia Prep school in Portland, the predecessor to the University of Portland, a Catholic school. He had been recruited to play football for the school, and did, earning a scholarship to Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon State University). Schulmerich had been recruited to play football at the University of Notre Dame by Knute Rockne, but declined. He graduated from Columbia Prep in 1923 and headed south to Corvallis and college. There he participated in three sports: football, baseball, and track. Schulmerich earned the nickname of Ironhorse on the football field as he played fullback on offense, linebacker on defense, and on special teams was the placekicker.Edmonston, George, Jr. ‚ÄúUp Close and Personal: Expect the Unexpected‚Äù, Oregon State University Alumni Association. Retrieved on April 26, 2009. As a junior and senior he earned all-conference honors for his play on the team. On the track team he ran the 100 yard dash, clocking in at 10.5 seconds. In baseball, he played in the outfield and hit for a .459 average his senior year. Schulmerich graduated with a bachelor's degree in business in 1927 from Oregon State. Professional career Schulmerich was recruited to play in the National Football League after leaving college, but decided to play baseball instead. He began his career playing for the Clarks in the Butte Mining League in Montana, a semi-professional league. Ralph Coleman, the Oregon State coach got him the job, along with his second job with the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). In 1927, he hit for a .322 average with no home runs (HRs) and 14 runs batted in (RBIs) in 31 games for the team.Snelling, Dennis. (1995). The Pacific Coast League: A Statistical History, 1903‚Äì1957. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland &. Co.. p. 227. The next season, he hit .317 with 19 HRs and 96 RBIs in 192 games. For the 1929 season he played in 134 games at hit .328 with 19 HRs and 77 RBIs. Then in 1930 he hit .380, 28 HRs, and 130 RBIs in 189 games. He was signed by the Chicago Cubs, but before he played for the team he was traded on October 14, 1930, to the Boston Braves along with Bill McAfee for pitcher Bob Smith and outfielder Jimmy Welsh. On May 1, 1931, Schulmerich made his Major League debut with the Boston Braves.Wes Schulmerich: Stats. Baseball Almanac. Retrieved on April 26, 2009.

The next season, he hit .260, and in 1933 he batted .247 in 29 games before he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies. Schulmerich was traded on June 17 along with Fritz Knothe in exchange for outfielder Hal Lee and third baseman Pinky Whitney. Finishing the 1933 season with the Phillies, he hit .334 with 8 HRs and 59 RBIs in 97 games. Overall that year he hit .318 for fifth best in the National League. The next year, he played 15 games for the Phillies before being traded to the Cincinnati Reds on May 16, 1934. The Phillies included outfielder Art Ruble and pitcher Ted Kleinhans in the deal to acquire fellow Oregonian Syl Johnson (a pitcher) and outfielder Johnny Moore. Schulmerich played 74 games for the Reds, batting .263 with 5 HRs and 19 RBIs. He played his last major league game on September 30, 1934. He never returned to the Major Leagues, and in 429 career games he hit 27 HRs, drove in 192 runs, and had a .289 batting average. Schulmerich was sent to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League where he spent one season. Schulmerich returned to the Los Angeles Angels for the 1936 season and played in 142 games, batting .301 with 14 HRs and 85 RBIs. In 1937, he was traded to the Portland Beavers of the PCL upon his request. He played in only 19 games that year, hitting .241. Schulmerich was let go early in the season after an error cost the team a game, an error he laughed at during the play. He then signed with the Lewiston Broncos in Idaho of the Western International League as a player-manager, winning the triple crown on the field, but doing poorly as manager. After the 1937 season, the team relocated to Bellingham, Washington, and Schulmerich became just a player. Halfway through the 1938 season he was traded to Spokane in the same league where he also spent 45 games of the 1939 season. The rest of the season was spent playing in the Pioneer League for the Twin Falls Cowboys. The next year, he retired, though he did play in several games in 1941, again for Twin Falls. Later years and family During his final years as a player, Schulmerich began acting as an on-field jester, a routine he continued for several years after retirement. In 1929, Schulmerich was married to Cecile Hobro, and they had two daughters, Betty and Cecile. After leaving baseball he worked for Shell Oil until joining the United States Navy during World War II. He served from 1942 to 1945, leaving as a lieutenant commander. Schulmerich bought property in Beaver, Oregon, in Tillamook County where he ran a fishing resort. He also became a big Oregon State University fan, never missing a home football game in 62 years. Schulmerich served as a county commissioner in Tillamook for 11 years before moving to North Albany in 1958. He bought the Albany Golf Course that year, and sold it in 1960, using the profits to pay for retirement. In addition to OSU football games, he and his wife also attended most baseball, basketball, and track home events, as well as many road games. Schulmerich was inducted into the inaugural class of the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1980 followed in 1991 by induction into OSU's Sports Hall of Fame. He was diagnosed with cancer in the late 1970s and went through chemotherapy, but never regained his health. Edward Wesley Schulmerich died in Corvallis on June 26, 1985, at the age of 83 and was buried in his hometown of Hillsboro at the Valley Memorial Mausoleum.

He served as the governor of Jakarta, the country's capital, from 1966 to 1977.  Life and career  Sadikin would be known as the longest-serving governor of Jakarta from 1966-1977. Appointed by Sukarno, he likely had the full approval of Suharto. A former officer in the Indonesian Marine Corps, he saw the city as a battlefield.Sadikin 1992 He sought to improve public services, clear out slum dwellers, ban (cycle rickshaws), and outlaw street peddlers.

At the same time, he sought to kampung- ize city dwellers‚Äîto reinvest them with village sociality and mutual aid (gotong royong).Kusno, Abidin. 2000.

He issued residency cards in hope of enforcing the policy, but failed to curtail population growth.Forbes, Dean. \\"Jakarta: Globalization, economic crisis, and social change,\\" pp. 268-298, in Josef Gugler (ed.), World Cities beyond the West: Globalization, Development and Inequality, p. 273 One of the earliest and most outspoken advocates of family planning, Sadikin showed that Muslim groups would support these policies.Blackburn, Susan.

Hungry for revenue for his projects, Sadikin legalized gambling and steambaths (de facto brothels), much to the outrage of many Muslim groups.Dick, Howard and Peter J. Rimmer, 2003.

In 1975, Sadikin famously attended the wedding of Indonesia's first trans woman legally recognised as her true gender, Vivian Rubiyanti Iskandar. Although Sadikin's restructuring of land in Jakarta displaced countless urban poor, he also advocated for the LBH, the Legal Aid Society; an organization which was used by both the private sector and the urban poor. After having allegedly \\"allowed\\" Golkar to lose an election in Jakarta, Sadikin was removed from office.Aspinall, Edward. 2005. \\"Regime Friction and Elite Dissidence,\\" pp. 49-85 in Opposing Suharto: Compromise, Resistance, and Regime Change in Indonesia.

In 1978, mass student protests embroiled the capital, and students nominated Sadikin as an alternative president.Kingsbury, Damien. 2002. The Politics of Indonesia, 2nd edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 87 In 1980, Sadikin helped found and lead the Petition of Fifty, a group of powerful and highly influential critics of the New Order. He regularly hosted their meetings at his home.

The North Bay Aqueduct was envisioned as part of the State Water Project during the 1950s and 1960s when the project was being planned. Initial North Bay Aqueduct water service went to Benicia and Vallejo. In 1990, the North Bay Regional Water Treatment Plant, serving Fairfield and Vacaville, came on line and was able to treat water from the North Bay Aqueduct for these two cities. The aqueduct cost approximately $83 million to construct. The North Bay Aqueduct is an underground pipeline that runs from Barker Slough in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to Cordelia Forebay, just outside Vallejo. From the Cordelia Forebay water is pumped to Napa County, Vallejo and Benicia. Travis Air Force Base is also served off the NBA. The size of the underground pipeline varies from 72 inches at Barker Slough to 54 inches at Cordelia Forebay. The NBA is operated remotely by the State Department of Water Resources (DWR) at the Delta Field Division office near Tracy. The aqueduct cannot deliver the full 175 cfs flow it was designed and contracted for. Pumping tests have shown that it can deliver a maximum of 142 cfs. DWR, SCWA and Napa County are investigating methods to increase the capacity of the NBA at least to the contract amount of 175 cfs. The North Bay Aqueduct diverts this water from Barker Slough, in the Delta, to the Solano agencies for water supply. The major State Water Project facilities that deliver water to the North Bay Aqueduct include: *Barker Slough Pumping Plant, which pumps water from Barker Slough into the NBA; *North Bay Aqueduct, a pipeline that delivers water from Barker Slough to Cordelia Forebay; and *Cordelia Forebay, where water is pumped to Napa County, Vallejo, and Benicia.

In 858 Charles the Bald, granted rights to establish the female abbey of Notre-Dame de Soissons, which included extensive seigniory lands in Charly, which dedicated lands lasted until the French revolution. Before 1789, Charly did not have a local government. It was managed by the provost, then baillif, of the abbess of Notre-Dame de Soissons. After the revolution, in 1792, the former vicar of Charly became mayor. In 1652, the troops of Cardinal Mazarini were defeated by the Huguenots outside the walls of Charly.

Goodman (born 30 November 1956) is a former A-6 Intruder bombardier‚Äìnavigator and class of 1978 graduate of the United States Naval Academy. He was shot down over Lebanon on 4 December 1983. Captured upon ejection from his stricken plane, he was held captive for 30 days. His release on 3 January 1984 was facilitated by Reverend Jesse Jackson. Background In October 1983, was diverted to Beirut, Lebanon from her planned Indian Ocean deployment, after the Beirut barracks bombing killed 241 US Military personnel of the Multinational Force in Lebanon. The ship spent the rest of that year and early 1984 patrolling the region. On 4 December, in response to two US F-14 aircraft having been fired upon the previous day, ten A-6 Intruders of VA-85 Black Falcons along with A-6 and A-7 Corsair aircraft from USS Independence (CV-62) took part in a bombing raid over Beirut. Capture While on a bombing mission, the two-man crew from VA-85 was hit by an infrared homing missile (SA-7 or SA-9) into the engine nozzle upon dropping its bomb load, while still in a dive through 1,800 feet (554 m) AGL. The fuselage and a wing were immediately engulfed in flames, and then the right engine erupted. The pilot, Lieutenant Mark Lange, tried to control the aircraft in order to safely eject the crew. After a rapid, low-level descent, the Intruder was seen to pull up and likely stalled, resulting in a crash on a hill at 1,000 ft MSL, near a village surrounded by Syrian anti-aircraft artillery positions. Lange ejected both himself and Goodman in the final moment, but his parachute failed to properly deploy before he hit the ground. Lange's left leg was severely injured and he died shortly after capture by Syrian troops and Lebanese civilians. Goodman, rendered unconscious, broke three ribs, and injured a shoulder and a knee during the landing, but was otherwise stable. He was captured and awakened by the Syrians and taken to Damascus. Captivity Goodman was held for more than a month, during which the U.S. government made numerous attempts to free him. He had a few visitors, including Ambassador Robert Paganelli who brought him Christmas dinner. Freedom In December 1983, Jesse Jackson traveled to Syria with a delegation that included; Reverend Wyatt T. Walker, Louis Farrakhan, Jack Mendelson, Dr. Thelma C.D. Adair, Reverend M. William Howard Jr., Florence Tate (Press Secretary), Julia Jones (Photographer), Thomas Porter, Jesse Jackson Jr., Jonathan Jackson, and others. The mission's peaceful purpose was accomplished, as they secured the release of Goodman.Walters, Ronald (2007).

White House Reception On 4 January 1984, U.S. President Ronald Reagan welcomed Lt. Goodman at the White House, hours after he and Rev. Jackson arrived back in the U.S. Reagan said Lt. Goodman \\"exemplified qualities of leadership and loyalty\\" and said Jackson's \\"mission of mercy\\" had \\"earned our gratitude and our admiration.\\" In turn, Jackson praised Reagan for sending a letter to Syrian President Assad calling for cooperation in bringing peace to Lebanon.Stanley, Alessandra. \\"An Officer and a Gentleman Comes Home\\".

From its humble origins of just ten students, the college is today home to approximately 160 undergraduate and several postgraduate students during the university year. Location The college is located on the corner of Tin Alley and Swanston Street in Parkville, a suburb of Melbourne. History St Mary's College was originally established as St Mary's Hall in 1918, catering to women primarily from the country, and directly affiliated with the nearby male-only Newman College.St Mary's College: History Formerly housed in a stately home on the Avenue in Parkville known as 'Barbiston', the college moved to its present location in 1966. It was in that year, following the approval of Archbishop Daniel Mannix, that it became independent - a college in its own right - under the inspired leadership of Mother Francis Frewin. A renowned educationalist with a great love of English and French literature, Mother Frewin was a noted art expert and established the college's excellent fine art collection, as well its comprehensive academic library, before her retirement in 1969. In 1977, St Mary's became co-educational, seeing its first male president of the student body elected in 1980. In 1993, the college celebrated its 75th anniversary with a weekend of celebrations, including a ball in the Great Hall of the Victorian Arts Centre and a garden party in the presence of the Vice- Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, Dr David Pennington AC. For 96 years, from its foundation until 2013, the college was administered by the Sisters of Loreto, whose spiritual charism and educational philosophy remains a guiding force in the college's mission today. Today, the leadership and governance of the college is the responsibility of the Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne and the Catholic Bishops of the Country dioceses of Victoria in cooperation with the College Council, who appoint a Principal. The incumbent Principal is Dr Darcy McCormack. In 2004, the Allan & Maria Myers Academic Centre, a joint facility shared between St Mary‚Äôs and Newman College, was opened. It was designed by Maggie Edmond and Peter Corrigan to reflect the overall academic vision of both colleges to merge and enhance the educational facilities and opportunities available to the students of the University's Roman Catholic colleges. The centre contains a library, tutorial rooms, music practice rooms, student lounges and information technology facilities. It also houses the college's art collection which was for many years curated and managed by the internationally renowned art historian, and College alumna, Sr Margaret Manion AO. Student body It is home to approximately 160 students, the majority of whom are undergraduate students attending the University of Melbourne, although a very small percentage also attend either the Australian Catholic University, Monash University, Parkville campus, or RMIT University. The St Mary's College Student Club (to which all members of the student body belong) is a self-governing incorporated organisation which runs day-to-day social, cultural and academic events during term time in the college. The majority of students at St Mary's are from rural and regional Victoria, others from Melbourne, and some are interstate or international students. The college has a very strong sporting tradition, particularly in the disciplines of Australian rules football and netball. Its official colours are navy blue and red. In 2016 the St Mary's Women's Rowing VIII rowed their way to a drought- breaking victory in the second division, the first win since 1962. This victory was repeated in 2017.

She was an Associate Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court, where she also served as the administrative judge for the state appellate system, and as Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. Early life and family Katz was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents were Harry and Sayre Katz. She is married to Philip Rubin, CEO emeritus of Haskins Laboratories, and lives in Fairfield, Connecticut. They have two children, Jason Rubin and Samantha Katz. Education and legal training Katz went to high school at the Berkeley Institute in Brooklyn (now known as the Berkeley Carroll School). She received a bachelor of arts degree, graduating cum laude, in 1974 from Brandeis University and her J.D. degree, graduating cum laude, from the University of Connecticut School of Law in 1977. Early professional career Katz started her professional career in 1977 as an attorney at the law firm of Winnick, Vine and Welch (now Winnick, Vine, Welch & Teodosio ) in Shelton, Connecticut. From 1978 to 1981 she was as an assistant public defender in the appellate unit of the office of the Chief Public Defender in New Haven, Connecticut. From 1981 to 1983 she was an assistant public defender in the trial unit in Bridgeport, Connecticut. She served as Chief of Legal Services for the Office of the Chief Public Defender from 1983 to 1989 and was the first woman to serve in this role in Connecticut. Judicial career Katz was nominated for the Superior Court bench by Gov. William A. O'Neill in 1989. She was elevated to the state Supreme Court by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. in 1992. Her appointment at age 39 made her, at the time, the youngest justice ever appointed to the Connecticut Supreme Court. She was reappointed by Gov. John G. Rowland in 2001 and Gov. M. Jodi Rell in 2009 . From 2006 until her resignation on January 5, 2011, she also served as administrative judge for the state appellate system, a position she previously held from 1994-2000. Notable cases and opinions As an Associate Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court, Justice Katz sat on approximately 2,500 cases and authored nearly 500 opinions. Some notable and/or controversial opinions and cases include: * Sheff v. O'Neill, 238 Conn. 1, 678 A.2d 1267 (1996). Sheff v. O'Neill is a landmark 1996 Connecticut Supreme Court decision regarding civil rights and the right to education. The Court ruled that the state had an affirmative obligation to provide Connecticut's school children with a substantially equal educational opportunity and that this constitutionally guaranteed right encompasses access to a public education that is not substantially and materially impaired by racial and ethnic isolation. This was a split 4-3 decision, which was authored by Chief Justice Ellen Ash Peters. She was joined in the majority opinion by Justice Robert Berdon, Justice Flemming L. Norcott, Jr., and Justice Joette Katz. Justice David Borden authored the dissent, with Justices Robert Callahan and Richard Palmer concurring with the dissent. * State v. Johnson, 253 Conn. 1, 751 A.2d 298 (2000). Katz authored the majority opinion in this controversial case. The decision said that the shooting of a state trooper did not meet the statutory standard for \\"especially cruel or heinous.\\" As a result, the death penalty was overturned and the sentence was eventually changed to life without parole. While the Court claimed it was following the intent of the legislature, this decision and a subsequent death penalty decision State v. Courchesne led the General Assembly to pass a \\"plain meaning\\" statute regarding statutory interpretation. * Kelo v. New London, 268 Conn. 1 (2004). Justice Katz joined the minority in the Kelo v. New London case heard by the Connecticut Supreme Court (2004), which was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the Connecticut case, the majority sided with the city in an en banc 4-3 decision, with the opinion authored by Justice Norcott and joined by Justices Borden, Palmer and Vertefeuille. The dissent was authored by Justice Zarella (joined by Justices Sullivan and Katz). The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision in favor of the city, in a 5-4 decision, with the dissent written by Justice O'Connor and joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas. The Kelo decision is studied as a continuation of the expansion of governments' power to seize property through eminent domain, although the widespread negative popular reaction has spurred a backlash in which many state legislatures have curtailed their eminent domain power. * State v. Bell, 283 Conn. 748, 931 A.2d 198 (2007). Among her more publicized opinions was State v. Bell where \\"the high court unanimously upheld the conviction of Arnold Bell, who had shot a New Haven police officer, but found part of a law giving him a stiffer sentence as a persistent dangerous offender unconstitutional. The court ruled that a jury, not a judge, must make that determination.\\" This decision led prominent legislators to conclude it had effectively voided the state's persistent violent offender law, and a new law would need to be implemented. * Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health, 289 Conn. 135, 957 A.2d 407 (2008). On October 10, 2008, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health that gay and lesbian couples could not be denied the right to marry because of the Equal Protection Clause of the state constitution. This decision made Connecticut the third state (along with Massachusetts and California) to legalize same-sex marriage through judicial decree of the state supreme court. The majority opinion was written by Justice Richard N. Palmer, and joined by Justices Flemming L. Norcott, Jr., Katz, and Judge Lubbie Harper, Jr. Justices Peter T. Zarella, Christine S. Vertefeuille, and David Borden dissented. * Rosado v. Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., 292 Conn. 1 (2009). Katz authored the majority opinion in this case which effectively ordered the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport to release thousands of legal documents from previous lawsuits filed against priests accused of sexually abusing children. The Connecticut Supreme Court case stemmed from a suit brought by the Boston Globe, Hartford Courant, New York Times and Washington Post in 2002. In October 2009, the United States Supreme Court rejected requests by the Diocese to stay or reconsider the Connecticut opinion ordering the release of the documents . The documents were released at the Waterbury Superior Courthouse on Dec. 1, 2009 . The Diocese has provided background and a statement on the suit and its status . CT Department of Children and Families On November 30, 2010, incoming Gov. Dannel Malloy named Justice Katz to head the troubled Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF).http://www.transition.ct.gov/transition/cwp/view.asp?Q=469280&A;=11 She stepped down from the Connecticut Supreme Court on January 5, 2011 in anticipation of assuming the DCF post. Justice Katz said she looked forward to the challenge of leading DCF, noting, \\"I can think of few things more important than the mission of this agency.\\" Joette Katz was confirmed as Commissioner of DCF by unanimous vote of the Connecticut State Senate on February 4, 2011. Connecticut made considerable progress reforming the state child welfare system under the leadership of Commissioner Katz. In 2015, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, one of the leading organizations in child welfare issues in the U.S., published a case study that described changes at Connecticut's DCF as the \\"Connecticut Turnaround\\". In this report, they indicated that, \\"Over five years, Connecticut has made substantial progress in turning around its troubled child welfare agency. ... the state has instituted improvements, driven down the number of unnecessary child removals and ensured that children entering state custody live in families whenever possible, not in group placements.\\" A report (\\"The Malloy-Wyman Record: A Review Across Five Areas of Policy, January 5, 2011 ‚Äì January 9, 2019\\") released by Governor Malloy and Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman at the end of their terms, summarized some of the progress made at DCF under Commissioner Katz's leadership: * Achieved an almost 10 percent reduction in the total number of children in care. * Oversaw a 76 percent decline in the number of children living in group settings. * Doubled the number of youth living with a relative or other person the child knows well. * Decreased out-of-state placements from 357 children in 2011 to just 7 children in 2018. * Put the state on an achievable path to end decades of federal court oversight, affirming the remarkable transformation of the system. On Dec. 6, 2018, Richard Wexler, executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform , wrote an op-ed in the Hartford Courant titled, \\"Connecticut losing the gutsiest leader in child welfare.\\" He called her job as commissioner, \\"probably the hardest in state or local government.\\" In a year-end editorial, \\"Hearts and darts, Connecticut's highs and lows, for 2018,\\" the Hartford Courant awarded Katz a Heart, saying, \\"... we believe her policy of trying to keep struggling families intact did a lot of good.\\" Commissioner Katz retired from DCF in January 2019.

Clark's 30 years in public service, in combination with 33 in private practice, produced some of Australia's most notable public buildings, as well as at least one prominent building in New Zealand.Dodd, Andrew, John James Clark: Public Architect in Australia, unpublished PhD thesis, University of Melbourne 2009. Biography John James Clark, commonly referred to as JJ, was born in Liverpool, England on 23 January 1838 to parents George and Mary Clark. Clark was one of six children. The family relocated from Liverpool to Melbourne, Australia in March 1852, in hopes of capitalising on the Victorian gold rush. Whilst other family members took up employment working in the gold fields, 14-year-old Clark pursued his interest in architecture and was employed as a draftsman for the colonial architect's office. JJ continued in public service until 1878 when he was retrenched in the Black Wednesday dismissals. Clark took a brief sabbatical in 1858 to tour Europe In 1865 Clark married Mary Taylor Watmuff (1844‚Äì1871) they remained married until her untimely death at the age of 26 in 1871. The couple had one child, Edward James, in 1868. In 1889 when Edward was 21, Clark took him on a tour of Europe and America, mirroring that of the one Clark took in his own youth. In 1880 Clark set up private practice in central Melbourne. Between 1881 and 1896 Clark relocated several times between Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia in pursuit of commissions and employment. One of Clark's most notable achievements, during this time, was his appointment as Queensland Colonial Architect. In 1896 Clark and his son formed a professional partnership that lasted until his death, and saw them complete works in Perth, Brisbane and Melbourne. Clark died at his residence in St Kilda, Melbourne on 25 June 1915. J J Clark is the subject of a biography published in 2012 by NewSouth books. Works The old Treasury Building in Melbourne, now the City Museum ;Old Treasury Building Old Treasury Building is considered by many as one of the finest examples of Renaissance Revival architecture in Melbourne. Clark began designing this building in 1857 when he was nineteen. Construction began in 1858 using bluestone, sourced from Broadmeadows for its foundations, and sandstone, from Baccus Marsh, for its intricate external facade. The building was completed in 1862. Originally the treasury was designed to hold Victoria's state gold, and also offices major colonial leaders. In 1874 the Treasury offices were relocated, however the building was still used weekly for meetings with the Governor General. In 1992 the building was restored, and from 2005 it was the home of the City Museum. Melbourne City Baths ;Melbourne City Baths Designed by Clark and his son Edward James in 1904, the Melbourne City Baths were the result of a winning competition entry to redesign the existing baths. A significant example of the Edwardian Baroque style, the building uses a bold two tone palette of red brick and cream yellow rendered concrete. The highly articulated facade wraps around the corners of the site and displays multiple classical instances of cupolas, archways and triangular pediments that is considered by some as ‚ÄòFederation Freestyle‚Äô. These motifs also reflected a mesh of architectural styles popular in England and America at that time. Melbourne (Queen Victoria) Hospital pavilion ;Queen Victoria Women's Hospital Clark's original design for the Queen Victoria Hospital occupied an entire block in Melbourne's CBD. In later years the hospital was relocated and subsequently a significant portion of the building was deconstructed. Currently all that remains of the original design is one of the three pavilions that ran along Lonsdale Street. Designed by Clark whilst in partnership with his son Edward James, the hospital was completed in 1910 in an Edwardian Baroque style. The design worked as a network of pavilions connected by a large central corridor that ran through the site. Raised upon a bluestone base the red brick ‚Äòblood & bandage‚Äô Goad, P. 2006.

The yellow-green boundary defines the region where the meta-analysis p-value is below 0.05. For example, if both p-values are around 0.10, or if one is around 0.04 and one is around 0.25, the meta-analysis p-value is around 0.05. In statistics, Fisher's method, also known as Fisher's combined probability test, is a technique for data fusion or \\"meta-analysis\\" (analysis of analyses). It was developed by and named for Ronald Fisher. In its basic form, it is used to combine the results from several independent tests bearing upon the same overall hypothesis (H0). Application to independent test statistics Fisher's method combines extreme value probabilities from each test, commonly known as \\"p-values\\", into one test statistic (X2) using the formula :X^2_{2k} \\\\sim -2\\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\ln(p_i), where pi is the p-value for the ith hypothesis test. When the p-values tend to be small, the test statistic X2 will be large, which suggests that the null hypotheses are not true for every test. When all the null hypotheses are true, and the pi (or their corresponding test statistics) are independent, X2 has a chi-squared distribution with 2k degrees of freedom, where k is the number of tests being combined. This fact can be used to determine the p-value for X2. The distribution of X2 is a chi-squared distribution for the following reason; under the null hypothesis for test i, the p-value pi follows a uniform distribution on the interval [0,1]. The negative natural logarithm of a uniformly distributed value follows an exponential distribution. Scaling a value that follows an exponential distribution by a factor of two yields a quantity that follows a chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom. Finally, the sum of k independent chi-squared values, each with two degrees of freedom, follows a chi-squared distribution with 2k degrees of freedom. Limitations of independence assumption Dependence among statistical tests is generally positive, which means that the p-value of X2 is too small (anti- conservative) if the dependency is not taken into account. Thus, if Fisher's method for independent tests is applied in a dependent setting, and the p-value is not small enough to reject the null hypothesis, then that conclusion will continue to hold even if the dependence is not properly accounted for. However, if positive dependence is not accounted for, and the meta-analysis p-value is found to be small, the evidence against the null hypothesis is generally overstated. The mean false discovery rate, \\\\alpha(k+1)/(2k), \\\\alpha reduced for k independent or positively correlated tests, may suffice to control alpha for useful comparison to an over-small p-value from Fisher's X2. Extension to dependent test statistics In cases where the tests are not independent, the null distribution of X2 is more complicated. A common strategy is to approximate the null distribution with a scaled random variable. Different approaches may be used depending on whether or not the covariance between the different p-values is known. Brown's method can be used to combine dependent p-values whose underlying test statistics have a multivariate normal distribution with a known covariance matrix. Kost's method extends Brown's to allow one to combine p-values when the covariance matrix is known only up to a scalar multiplicative factor. The harmonic mean p-value offers an alternative to Fisher's method for combining p-values when the dependency structure is unknown but the tests cannot be assumed to be independent. Interpretation Fisher's method is typically applied to a collection of independent test statistics, usually from separate studies having the same null hypothesis. The meta-analysis null hypothesis is that all of the separate null hypotheses are true. The meta-analysis alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the separate alternative hypotheses is true. In some settings, it makes sense to consider the possibility of \\"heterogeneity,\\" in which the null hypothesis holds in some studies but not in others, or where different alternative hypotheses may hold in different studies. A common reason for the latter form of heterogeneity is that effect sizes may differ among populations. For example, consider a collection of medical studies looking at the risk of a high glucose diet for developing type II diabetes. Due to genetic or environmental factors, the true risk associated with a given level of glucose consumption may be greater in some human populations than in others. In other settings, the alternative hypothesis is either universally false, or universally true - there is no possibility of it holding in some settings but not in others. For example, consider several experiments designed to test a particular physical law. Any discrepancies among the results from separate studies or experiments must be due to chance, possibly driven by differences in power. In the case of a meta-analysis using two-sided tests, it is possible to reject the meta-analysis null hypothesis even when the individual studies show strong effects in differing directions. In this case, we are rejecting the hypothesis that the null hypothesis is true in every study, but this does not imply that there is a uniform alternative hypothesis that holds across all studies. Thus, two-sided meta-analysis is particularly sensitive to heterogeneity in the alternative hypotheses. One sided meta-analysis can detect heterogeneity in the effect magnitudes, but focuses on a single, pre-specified effect direction. Relation to Stouffer's Z-score method The relationship between Fisher's method and Stouffer's method can be understood from the relationship between z and ‚àílog(p) A closely related approach to Fisher's method is Stouffer's Z, based on Z-scores rather than p-values, allowing incorporation of study weights. It is named for the sociologist Samuel A. Stouffer. If we let Zi = Œ¶ ‚àí 1(1‚àípi), where Œ¶ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function, then : Z \\\\sim \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^k Z_i}{\\\\sqrt{k}}, is a Z-score for the overall meta- analysis. This Z-score is appropriate for one-sided right-tailed p-values; minor modifications can be made if two-sided or left-tailed p-values are being analysed. Specifically, if two-sided p-values are being analyzed, the two- sided p-value (pi/2) is used, or 1-pi if left-tailed p-values are used. Since Fisher's method is based on the average of ‚àílog(pi) values, and the Z-score method is based on the average of the Zi values, the relationship between these two approaches follows from the relationship between z and ‚àílog(p) = ‚àílog(1‚àíŒ¶(z)). For the normal distribution, these two values are not perfectly linearly related, but they follow a highly linear relationship over the range of Z-values most often observed, from 1 to 5. As a result, the power of the Z-score method is nearly identical to the power of Fisher's method. One advantage of the Z-score approach is that it is straightforward to introduce weights. If the ith Z-score is weighted by wi, then the meta-analysis Z-score is : Z \\\\sim \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^k w_iZ_i}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i^2}}, which follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis. While weighted versions of Fisher's statistic can be derived, the null distribution becomes a weighted sum of independent chi-squared statistics, which is less convenient to work with.

Origins and history  The Plummer Terrier was created by Dr. David Brian Plummer who began his type with a hard strain of Jack Russell Terrier from his home in Wales. He added Beagle, Fell Terrier, and Bull Terrier, creating an established and defined individual type. Initially known as the Huddlesford Rat Pack, the breed is now named after him. In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, Plummer worked as a somewhat reluctant teacher of several schools throughout southern Yorkshire and the Midlands. A self-confessed rustic eccentric, his passion was hunting rats with what was then his motley pack of Russell-type terriers. He became a leading author of books on hunting with lurchers and terriers. Well-versed in breeding, he strove to produce a unique strain of terrier using the aforementioned bloodlines with Jack Russell Terriers from Sealy Cottage lines as his foundation. These terriers were worked hard and as the breed developed, so too did Plummer's reputation as a breeder of hardy terriers that bred true to type. The dogs of this time consisted of Vampire, who died in 1980 aged nine; this Plummer Terrier was a veteran of the weekly rat hunts at the local battery hen farm. His brother Warlock, sister Beltane (who Brian regarded as the \\"matron\\" of his terrier team and indeed the prototype of the breed) and probably most famous sister Omega, bred by her sire Vampire to his own daughter Janey. Plummer dedicated a whole book to the hunting abilities of Omega. The Beagle introduced to Plummer's lines in the 1960s was out of Catherine Sutton's Rossut show-bred strain that originated from U.S. imports, brought to the U.K. to tidy up British exhibits. It was owned by Philip Ainsley, a fellow teacher friend of Plummer's. Further outcrosses were introduced along the way. The addition of Fell Terrier blood, Jaeger from Nigel Hinchcliffe's lines and Flint from Brian Nuttall's lines, both noted working lines and most likely descending from Cyril Breay and Frank Buck's stock, infused refinement of shape and to a certain extent contributed to fixing type, like that seen in Pagan, a black and tan terrier, acknowledged as one of the early pillars of the breed. Further additions included a Jack Russell terrier known as Errol Forsyth's Pip, Alan Thomas's Hamish, and Laddie from the Chiddingfold and Leconfield foxhound kennels. Performance as an earth dog was and is an essential prerequisite of most, if not all terrier breeds and Plummers are no exception to this rule. These three dogs were known to be full-on earth workers. In the early 1980s, during one of the many TV documentaries (Rat hunting man and Lone furrow) about Plummer and his terriers, he said that one day he would like his terriers to be known as Plummer Terriers and recognised by the Kennel Club. In 1985, he suffered a near-fatal heart attack which resulted in the dispersal of his substantial pack of terriers to friends. He eventually moved to a remote croft in Caithness, Scotland, and began to write full-time. By the early 1990s most of the pack's important gene pool was found and regrouped, albeit on a smaller scale. Work continued and other lines were sought; widening the gene pool enough to be able to limit inbreeding. At this point, two distinct types began to develop, the smaller, more snipe-nosed type and the more bully, stronger- headed type. Plummer opted for the latter, and by the late 1990s decided that the breed needed a wider gene pool in order to reach its maximum potential. Bull Terrier blood of known ancestry was sought and outcrossed into the breed. Plummer had cancer and died in September 2002. His work was carried on by others and the breed standard remains intact. As a working terrier, the Plummer is a versatile dog, which has many uses. They are keen retrievers, most generally take to water freely; quite intelligent, have excellent noses, are biddable and have many uses in the field. They are often found ferreting; some are found in the beating line on local shoots; occasionally they are used to ground but undoubtedly they are most commonly used in a pack hunting rats.  Appearance  ratting The Plummer Terrier is a striking dog to look at, its fiery red coat should conform to two distinct patterns collared (a white band around the neck) and caped (only showing white on the throat). They should be heavily coloured and preferably be no more than 14‚Äù at the shoulder. Terriers that do not possess collared or caped markings are labelled shattered, they are perfectly fine as workers, companions but are not classed as good examples of the breed. The same can be said for tricolours, dogs which carry black in their colouring. The ears fold over like most terriers, and the nose and eye are typically black, and the jaw has a good scissors bite.  Breed standard  Plummer defined a breed standard in 2000. *General Character: a Plummer Terrier should be strong, hardy, active and adaptable, with terrier characteristics and as much substance as possible. They should be equally at home in the house as in the kennel, be highly intelligent, courageous and tenacious. Affectionate, loyal and trustworthy with family and friends. Yet should present a bright, alert appearance without displaying any excessive aggression or nervousness. *Head: medium-sized, full of quality with strong bones and powerful cheek and jaw muscles. Slight bull terrier characteristics are encouraged as is a well defined stop. *Ears: dropped, rounded, and neatly pinned to head. Prick or rose ears are not encouraged. *Eyes: dark, prominent and oval, set widely apart. *Muzzle: strong, lips close with no excessive looseness. Teeth strong and even with full scissor bite. *Neck: strong, elegant, especially in the case of bitches, and well carried. *Shoulders and forelegs: strong, well laid back and developed without excessive muscle tone. Forelegs should be set square and straight and not tied in. Feet should be well shaped and dense. No resemblance of bend in front. *Back, hindquarters and hind legs: back and loins, muscular, strong and well coupled, with well defined muscle development. Hindquarters should be lengthy and strong, with a well set on tail. Hind legs - second thigh should be strong and muscular. Hocks clean and flat, turning neither inwards nor outwards. The hind leg must not be too bent. Feet: well shaped and dense. *Body: square in appearance when viewed from side i.e. distance of shoulder to ground. Depth through the heart should be easily spanned by two hands placed just behind the shoulders. *Tail: carried high. Preferably docked and balanced to the size of the dog. Curled tails not encouraged. *Coat: short, close and without guard hairs, yet with the ability to withstand weather. Loose / broken coats not acceptable. *Colour and markings: a bright fiery red with white. Full cape markings from head to tail, or a broad collar of white between head and shoulders are encouraged. Underside of the belly and chest, front and rear legs should be white although flecking is acceptable. Head either solid colour, or with stripe or badger marked. Tricolour Plummer terriers are still produced in small numbers today and whilst registerable with club registrars they are generally not encouraged. *Height: maximum height to the shoulder, dog or bitch 14 inches. *Movement: should be light, energetic, free, true and forcible and cover the ground. Hocks should be flexed under the body with straight powerful leverage. *Faults: undershot or overshot mouths. Unsoundness, coarseness or displaying a hereditary fault.  Future  Generally a game working dog, the Plummer Terrier is not a Kennel Club breed, and most owners today who work their dogs would prefer that this dog was not part of the Kennel Club yet for a myriad of reasons. While the Plummer Terrier generally breeds true in appearance, the standard is a working terrier standard. The most common serious health fault in this breed is cleft palate, followed by foul mouth, patella luxation and cryptorchidism.

Plot summary The protagonist (Uncumber) begins life in a privileged home where she is estranged from her family by their reliance on drugs to regulate their emotions and social interactions. She leaves them in order to pursue a man (Noli) that she falls in love with on first sight despite a language barrier existing between them, which stops her from forming any relationships with him or his family. Noli unlike Uncumber is from the working class and she finally abandons him when he insists on using the drugs which she abhors in their love making. She finally makes it full circle when she is picked up shortly afterwards by the police and imprisoned in a room remarkably similar to the one in which she began and is eventually reconciled to the medicated life where every emotion exists on tap and the most intimate experience is sex which has been replaced by lying next to your lover experiencing entirely private and separate hallucinations. Style The novel is stylistically unusual in that it is written mainly in the present tense. For example, a typical passage reads: \\"He turns his head from side to side, and then nods at her. Uncumber realises that he wants her to do the same. She feels herself blushing at the ridiculousness of it.\\" Occasionally, the narrative also uses future tense (for example, the book's opening line is \\"Once upon a time there will be a little girl called Uncumber\\"), however it eschews the past tense normally expected in novels.

They were distributed widely for use with Pay television channels. The DBox-1 was the first DVB-capable receiver to be produced and distributed in large quantity. It was commissioned by the Kirch group's DF1, an early German provider of digital television that later merged with Premiere. The hardware was developed and produced by Nokia though later also produced by Philips and Sagem under license. The combination of third- party developers and network connectivity which facilitates card sharing, makes DBox2 (and the DBox2 based Dreambox) use particularly common among enthusiasts and those who intend to obtain services without payment. It also enables the receiver to store digital copies of DVB MPEG transport streams on networked filesystems or broadcast the streams as IPTV to VideoLAN and XBMC Media Center clients. In 2001, following the bankruptcy of Kirch Media, production of the D-box ceased. However, many devices continue to be traded second-hand (often using online auction sites) and fairly high prices are paid because of the ability to gain services without payment. For this reason, there are also a significant number of, mostly German language, web sites and forums devoted to the devices. Linux on the Dbox-2 Since 1997 an alternative operating system has been available for the predecessor of the Dbox2, the Dbox. This was DVB98 (later DVB2000), developed by a single programmer. Despite programming the hardware directly using machine code, DVB2000 is superior in many respects relative to the original software. For the DBox2, an effort was created to port the Linux operating system. This is now the most popular choice. Installation involves first putting the box into its debug-mode, a mode intended for internal development. It is then possible to take a backup copy of the original operating system (including vital micro- code images for the MPEG decoder chipset) and flash an image based on Linux to the device. In addition to the Linux kernel and drivers, a significant amount of code is needed to allow the DBox2 to function as a digital receiver. This code is all maintained under a single open-source project - TuxBox.tuxbox.org There is, however, a choice of user-interfaces that can be used, the most popular being Neutrino and Enigma. Enigma is also used on the Dreambox. The Dbox2 has grown in popularity among home hobbyists due to the ability to use softcams to enable it to decrypt channels without the need for the physical access card to be present in the box, or with the use of a pirated key, without any card at all. Originally DBox2 use and development was limited the Germany and Austria, the market area of Kirch Media. Enthusiast groups outside Germany have however developed localized software versions for the DBox2 in Finland and the United Kingdom, usually buying their boxes over eBay.  Hardware upgrades  A \\"MultiCAM\\" module can be attached to the internal com port (disabling the internal modem) to enable the card readers to support multiple conditional access cards. Software support exists for many CA systems, including Conax used in Scandinavia The DBox2 does not have a hard disk or other internal storage. Modules have however become available for attaching IDE hard drivesFestplatten IDE - Interface f√ºr die dbox2 and SATA hard drivesHarddiskdrive IDE - SATA - Interface with MicroSD-Slot for dbox2 and MMC and SD flash memory cards. Support for these is included in some software distributions. An infrared keyboard is optionally available. Originally, the dBox was designed as a \\"multimedia terminal\\", with applications such as pay-per-view ordering, e-mail, and home banking in mind so support for a keyboard was a design consideration.

Biography When he was fourteen, Corky and his family moved from a small Missouri town to Chula Vista, California. Corky started a small construction company in Bonita, California in 1960, with his wife, Vonnie, who handled accounting duties. While McMillin was busy building houses, his passion was taking his family to the Imperial Sand Dunes on the weekends. As sons Mark and Scott got older, McMillin decided to try his hand at off-road racing. His first venture into a competitive event came at the 1976 Baja 1000 with his son, Mark. Although the father-son team did not finish that first race, Corky kept after it and his first win came in the 1979 Baja 1000. McMillin went on to win many more races including the San Felipe 250, Baja 500, Baja 1000, Parker 400, and Fireworks 250, most of them multiple times. Over the years, McMillin won three SCORE Points Championships and on two occasions won overall titles at both the San Felipe 250 and the Baja 500. As the McMillin Companies continued to prosper, Corky expanded into different markets, including Liberty Station, a conversion project on the site of the former San Diego Naval Training Center. He eventually became one of the largest private developers in the country. The Corky McMillin Companies donated $1.5 million to enhance the real estate program at San Diego State University's College of Business Administration. In the Poway Unified School District, McMillin contributed to anti-drug programs through Partners in Education. Corky McMillin died at the age of 76 less than two weeks after he had a heart attack while racing in his final desert race, the SCORE Las Vegas Primm 300. He has eight grand children. In 2000, because of his contributions to the community, an elementary school in Chula Vista was named after him. Vonnie McMillin died August 30, 2016, after an extended battle with Parkinsons disease. While his sons continue to run the family business ‚Äî The Corky McMillin Companies ‚Äî his daughter, Laurie Ann, an interior designer who is also on the board of directors of the family's corporation, decorates the company's model homes.

Career  Junko Miyashita was born in Tokyo on January 29, 1949. She was working as a waitress at a coffee shop when she was recruited to work in Pink films. Her debut film was in July 1971 with . Her work in Nikkatsu's Roman Porno genre included eight entries in the Apartment Wife series from 1972 until 1974. She worked with leading pink film director K≈çji Wakamatsu, and some of the best directors in Nikkatsu's Roman Porno films, including Noboru Tanaka, and Tatsumi Kumashiro. Among the highlights of her early career were starring roles in Tanaka's Showa Trilogy (A Woman Called Sada Abe (1975), Watcher in the Attic (1976), and Beauty's Exotic Dance: Torture! (1977)). An exceptionally good actress for the genre, she was nominated for a Japanese Academy Award for best new actress in her roles in Kihachi Okamoto's film Dynamite Bang Bang and Hideo Gosha's Bandit vs. Samurai Squad (both 1978). She was awarded the Blue Ribbon Award for both of these roles. She was again nominated for a Japanese Academy Award in 1979 for best actress for her role in Woman with Red Hair, and won the Hochi News award for both this role and for Wet Weekend. The following year, she was given a special award for her career at the Yokohama Film Festival. From the 1980s, she began working more in mainstream films, including two award-winning films for Mitsuo Yanagimachi: Fire Festival (Himatsuri) (1985) and About Love, Tokyo (Ai ni tsuite, Tokyo) (1992). Commenting on his work with Miyashita, director Noboru Tanaka later said, \\"I liked her natural manner. She always looks very natural, but you can feel the great power and strength that she has. She had a very traditional and conservative Japanese style, but her determination could be seen on the screen... she was a traditional Japanese beauty who also had energy and strength, and that was what I liked about her.\\"  Filmography   1970s  * (7/1971) * (9/1971) * (World Films) (10/1971) * (Million Film) (12/1971) * (12/1971) * (Wakamatsu Films) (12/1971) * () (Million Film) (1/1972) * () (World Films) (1/1972) * () (World Films) (2/1972) * (2/1972) * (2/1972) * () (Million Film) (3/1972) * (3/1972) * () (Million Film) (4/1972) * () (Million Film) (4/1972) * () (World Films) (5/1972) * (5/1972) * (5/1972) * () (Million Film) (6/1972) * (Nikkatsu) (7/8/1972) * (7/1972) * ( - Jofu) (Nikkatsu) (8/26/1972) (two roles) * (8/1972) * ( - Kage Gari: Hoero Taih√¥) () (10/10/1972) * ( - Danchizuma Onna-Zakari) (Nikkatsu) (10/28/1972) * () (Wakamatsu Productions) (11/7/1972) * (Nikkatsu) (11/18/1972) * ( - OL Nikki Mesuneko no Joji) (Nikkatsu) (12/16/1972) * Office Lady Journal: Poaching (OL Nikki: Mitsuryo) (1972) * ( - Danchizuma Ubawareta Yoru) (Nikkatsu) (1/13/1973 * (1/1973) * ( - Uresugita Chibusa: Hitozuma) (Nikkatsu) (2/3/1973) * ( - Maruhi Ooku Gaiden Amadera In no Mon) (Nikkatsu) (2/211973) * ( - Jitsuroku Kazuko Shirakawa: Hadaka no Rirekisho) (Nikkatsu) (2/21/1973) (cameo) * ( - Danchizuma Kanki no Yoru) (Nikkatsu) (3/14/1973) * (Nikkatsu) (4/4/1973) * (Nikkatsu) (4/14/1973) * () (Nikkatsu) (5/5/1973) * (Nikkatsu) (5/23/1973) * () (Nikkatsu) (6/13/1973) * (Nikkatsu) (7/4/1973) * ( - Ai ni Nureta Watashi) (Nikkatsu) (7/25/1973) * (Nikkatsu) (8/4/1973) * (Nikkatsu) (8/15/1973) * (Nikkatsu) (9/12/1973) * ( - Sasurai Kamome: Kushiro no Yoru) (Nikkatsu) (10/05/1973) * (Nikkatsu) (10/24/1973) * (Nikkatsu) (11/3/1973) * ( - OL Nikki Mitsuryo: Asaru) (Nikkatsu) (12/5/1973) * (Nikkatsu) (1/3/1974) * (Nikkatsu) (1/15/1974) * (Nikkatsu) (2/16/1974) * (Nikkatsu) (4/20/1974) * (Nikkatsu) (6/22/1974) * (Nikkatsu) (7/6/1974) * (Nikkatsu) (7/20/1974) * (Nikkatsu) (8/3/1974) * (Nikkatsu) (9/11/1974) * (Nikkatsu) (9/21/1974) * (10/26/1974) * (1/14/1975) * (Nikkatsu) (2/8/1975) * (Nikkatsu) (4/26/1975) * (Nikkatsu) (7/23/1975) * () (Shint≈çh≈ç Eiga) (7/1975) * (Nikkatsu) (9/6/1975) * (Nikkatsu) (9/20/1975) * () (Shint≈çh≈ç Eiga) (9/1975) * (Nikkatsu) (10/18/1975) * (Nikkatsu) (12/24/1975) * Documentary on High School Girls Prostitution Ring (Jitsuroku Jokosei Shudan Baishun) (Wakamatsu Films) (1975) * (2/21/1976) * (3/15/1976) * (Nikkatsu) (5/1/1976) * (Nikkatsu) (6/12/1976) * (Nikkatsu) (7/31/1976) * ( - Ah!!

The species was first described by F√©lix √âdouard Gu√©rin-M√©neville in 1847. The male has a wingspan of 20 cm and a tail span of 15 cm, making it one of the world's largest silk moths. The female lays from 120 to 170 eggs, and after hatching, the larvae feed on Eugenia and Weinmannia leaves for approximately two months before pupating. The cocoon has numerous holes to keep the pupa from drowning in the daily rains of its natural habitat. The adult moth cannot feed and only lives for 4 to 5 days. Although endangered in the wild due to habitat loss, the comet moth has been bred in captivity. In its natural habitat, larvae feed on Weinmania eriocampa, Uapaca species, Eugenia cuneifolia and Sclerocarya caffra. Substitution plants are Rhus cotinus, Eucalyptus gunnii, Pistacia terebinthus, Pistacia lentiscus, Rhus copallina, Rhus laurina, Rhus toxicodendron, Rhus typhina, Schinus molle, Schinus terebinthifolius, Mimosa species and Liquidambar styraciflua.Papillon- com√®te de Madagascar (Argema mittrei) This moths figures on the former banknote of 1000 Malagasy ariary.Madagascar Library File:Argema mittrei 02.JPG|Head of comet moth File:Komeetstaartvlinder 04.JPG|Adult on cocoon File:Argema mittrei (caterpillar).jpg|Caterpillar File:Argema mittrei (eggs).jpg|Cocoons and eggs File:Argema mittrei Comet moth male.jpg|Argema mittrei, male References Category:Saturniinae Category:Wild silk Category:Endemic fauna of Madagascar Category:Lepidoptera of Madagascar Category:Moths of Madagascar Category:Moths of Africa Category:Moth species ","title":"Comet moth"},{"id":"7172636","text":"The Scientific Monthly was a science magazine published from 1915 to 1957.

Pennington's works have largely featured on the covers of novels of Isaac Asimov, Clark Ashton Smith and Robert A. Heinlein, adopting both science fiction and fantastical themes. Pennington's past of speculation and youthful wonderment lead to his current outlandish form and style. Pennington's works are largely characterised by bold, daring colours; rich pinks and blues sustaining his continuing motifs of speculation as well as precise brush strokes, harmonious pigment blending as well as the acute concentration in the detail of his depicted subjects, usually landscapes of other times or worlds. Pennington, earlier disenchanted with traditional art methods, pursued his youthful fascination with that of the imagined and speculated. Works include 'Impossible Possibilities' and 'A Canticle for Leibowitz'. Pennington attended the Ravensbourne School of Art in Bromley during the early 1960s. He began working as a freelance illustrator in 1967. In 1976, Paper Tiger Books published an LP-sized graphic album, Eschatus, featuring Pennington's paintings inspired by the prophecies of Nostradamus. They followed this, in 1991, with a graphic album, Ultraterranium, collecting various private and commercial works.

It refers to lending money to a company or individual by a private individual or organization. While banks are traditional sources of financing for real estate, and other purposes, private money is offered by individuals or organizations and may have non traditional qualifying guidelines. There are higher risks associated with private lending for both the lender and borrowers. There is traditionally less \\"red tape\\" and regulation. Private money can be similar to the prevailing rate of interest or it can be very expensive. When there is a higher risk associated with a particular transaction it is common for a private money lender to charge an interest rate above the going rate. Private money lenders Private money lenders exist throughout all of the United States, seeking a chance to earn above average rates of return on their money. With that comes the risk that a private money loan may not be re-paid on time or at all without legal action. However, in the case of a real estate transaction the lender can ask for a deed on the property in their name & Insurance on the property the same as a bank lending money would require as collateral to help insure they be repaid in the event of a default on the loan or catastrophe to the property. In that case the lender gets the property and can sell it to recoup their investment. Private money is offered to clients in many cases in which the banks have found the risk to be too high or credit too poor. There are a few Private Money Lenders who offer a no credit check and loan amortization. Private money regulation Private money lenders must comply with state and federal usury laws. They are not exempt from banking laws. However they may be exempt from routine regulation such as banking exams etc. Further, if the loan is made to a consumer, the private money lender may have a limit on how many loans they may make in a particular state without being required to have a banking license. In the State of New York a private lender may make no more than five loans before being required to be a licensed lender. It is not advised for residential homeowners and should be considered only for business capital and with the careful advice and oversight of an accountant and real estate attorney as the collection methods may be more aggressive in the event a borrower cannot repay. Private investors do not usually have the means or interest in long protracted workout agreements, and will usually go to court quickly as a means of recovering their monetary investment.

It was begun in the 1830s as a fishing and hunting hotel on the then, scarcely inhabited Long Beach Island. Originally a small hotel, it was built expanded in the 1870s and 1880s. A large renovation, completed in 1903, led to the 3-story structure which was kept rather similar until the late 1990s when sections of it were gutted and rebuilt, completely out of style with the Victorian architecture. Mid-1800s drawing of Harvey Cedars Hotel (picture was framed, and there is glare off the glass) It served as the Harvey Cedars Hotel until around the 1910s when it went out of business. In the early 1920s the property was purchased by the Philadelphia YWCA and turned into Camp Whelen, a Christian summer camp for young girls. Camp Whelen survived until the Depression. After shutting down due to declining attendance, the hotel was abandoned for about 10 years. In 1941 Presbyterian minister Jack Murray purchased the hotel, and converted it into Harvey Cedars Presbyterian Bible Conference. In 1951 Jack left the operations to Al Oldham. The name was changed to Harvey Cedars Bible Conference, and was run by Al until 1995 when the director position was passed on to his son, Jon Oldham. Years of neglect to the physical property led to decisions to renovate in the 1990s up to the present time. Today, the hotel is named the Victorian Hotel and continues to serve as the main building for Harvey Cedars Bible Conference.

Formed in 1984, they were one of the earliest 'pure' garage bands in the European garage revival of the 1980s. Along with local colleagues the Crimson Shadows they pioneered the notion of a garage punk band that strove for authenticity in replicating the sound and the look of the original '60s inspirators, primarily from the US. The Stomachmouths received immediate international attention with their self-released debut 45, which raised interest on the independent music scenes in England and the US. The band toured extensively in Europe, appearing on German television and receiving major newspaper coverage in Italy. Originally a quartet, Anna Nystrom joined the band in 1986. In 1987, Kjellen and Stavborg left to form the Livingstones. Jens Lindberg, formerly of the Crimson Shadows and High- Speed V joined as a replacement bass player for the last recordings and European tours. Band leader Stefan K√©ry later went on to form the successful independent Xotic Mind/Subliminal Sounds record label.
