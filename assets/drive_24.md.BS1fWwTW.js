The game pitted the Missouri Valley Vikings and the East Texas State Lions (now Texas A&M; University–Commerce). This was the first time the bowl was played before New Year's Day, as organizers wanted to \\"attract television coverage in the future\\". The December game date made this the second of two Tangerine Bowls played in calendar year 1958. Background The University at Buffalo's first bowl bid was to this game. The Tangerine Bowl Commission hoped that the Orlando High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), which operated the stadium, would waive its rule that prohibited integrated sporting events. When it refused, the team unanimously voted to skip the bowl because its two black players (halfback Willie Evans and end Mike Wilson) would not have been allowed on the field. Missouri Valley entered the game with an 8–0 record, and had previously played to a tie in the 1956 Tangerine Bowl. East Texas State entered the game with a 9–1 record, and had recorded two wins and a tie in three prior Tangerine Bowl appearances. Game summary In wet conditions, the teams played a scoreless first quarter. In the second quarter, East Texas scored first but missed the extra point, allowing Missouri Valley to take a 7–6 lead when they scored a touchdown and converted their extra point. East Texas scored another touchdown, but again missed the extra point, and had a 12–7 lead at halftime. After a scoreless third quarter, East Texas scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, successfully making one two-point conversion, to win by a final score of 26–7. Scoring summary Aftermath East Texas would not play again in the postseason until 1972, when they won the NAIA Football National Championship. They then joined NCAA Division II, and have subsequently made several playoff appearances there. Missouri Valley's next postseason appearance would be the Mineral Water Bowl in 1971. They have subsequently appeared several times in the NAIA's postseason playoffs. The University at Buffalo would not appear in a bowl game until the 2009 International Bowl.

Willis was convicted of murder after a 1986 fire in his West Texas home killed two women. He was sentenced to the death penalty. In 2004, Willis was released from prison after new fire investigators examining the case could not reach a determination as to the fire's cause, and they said that there was no evidence that the fire had been an arson case. Background Willis was from New Mexico. Before he was 40 years old, he had been divorced several times, and he had back problems that prevented him from working and made him dependent on food stamps. He developed an addiction to pain medication, and he had three convictions for driving under the influence. Willis had moved to Odessa, Texas, to live with his cousin, Billy Willis. They later moved to the town of Iraan, Texas. On the night of June 10, 1986, Ernest and Billy Willis came home accompanied by two women that they had met that day, Betsy Beleu and Gail Allison. Ernest Willis said that he awoke to the smell of smoke around 4:00 a.m. on June 11. The Willis cousins were able to make it out of the burning house, but the flames had pushed Ernest back when he had tried to rescue Beleu and Allison. Both women died in the fire. Police became suspicious of Ernest, and they arrested Ernest four months later, charging him with murder. Ernest Willis first raised the suspicions of police with his behavior at the scene of the fire; he was smoking as firefighters extinguished the fire, he did not seem to have inhaled much smoke in the fire, and his feet were not burned as police thought they should have been. Later, Willis failed a polygraph examination. Given that they had only circumstantial evidence against him, prosecutors were surprised when they were able to secure a capital murder indictment against him. Trial and imprisonment At trial, Willis appeared cold and emotionless, and prosecutors commented to the jury about his demeanor. Willis did not realize that his behavior was abnormal; after his arrest, for reasons that were unclear, he had been started on high doses of antipsychotic medication. These medications are commonly associated with an apathetic appearance. Willis was convicted of capital murder and sent to death row in August 1987. In 1990, fellow death row inmate David Martin Long gave a three-hour confession to starting the fire in Iraan. He had been involved in some criminal activity with Billy Willis, and he said that he hated Billy. The confession was recorded on video, but Long subsequently refused to testify in court on the matter. The confession generated new interest in the case among attorneys, and appeals lawyers worked to confirm the information in Long's story. An analysis of crime scene evidence indicated that the fire could have involved the use of Everclear and Wild Turkey as accelerants as Long claimed, and Long seemed a plausible suspect because he admitted to previously killing a man by starting a fire.White, pp. 59–60. Willis met his wife, Verilyn Harbin, while he was on death row. Harbin was the sister of death row inmate Ricky McGinn, who in June 2000 had been the first Texas inmate to receive a stay of execution from governor George W. Bush. (Bush had declined to halt 131 earlier executions during his tenure.) Willis and Harbin corresponded and later met at McGinn's insistence. McGinn was executed in September 2000, and Willis and Harbin were married a month after the execution. As his appeals went by, Willis said that he became depressed and stopped exercising. Willis weighed 185 pounds when he went to prison, and his weight eventually reached 300 pounds. Exoneration After many years of trying to corroborate Long's story, his confession could not be fully supported by the evidence. However, the interest generated by the confession led to new investigations into the Willis case.White, pp. 65–66. In 2004, a U.S. district judge threw out the conviction, ruling that Willis had been unnecessarily drugged during his trial and that the state suppressed testimony from a psychologist who found that Willis was not dangerous to society. The Texas attorney general and the Pecos County district attorney declined to pursue the case further. The DA said that new investigators labeled the fire's cause as undetermined and could not find any evidence to substantiate an arson case. Willis was released from prison in October 2004. Willis was the eighth Texas death row inmate exonerated since the state resumed executions in 1982, and he was thought to have served the longest sentence on death row among that group.

It is about a 13-year-old girl named Rynn Jacobs who lives alone in a house, and murders people who threaten her solitary life. Plot Adaptions Koenig adapted his novel into a 1976 film of the same name, directed by Nicolas Gessner and starring Jodie Foster as Rynn with supporting roles from Martin Sheen, Alexis Smith, Mort Shuman, and Scott Jacoby. In 1997, he adapted it into a stage play. Reception In 1974, the science fiction magazine Luna Monthly reviewed it as \\"A light, gripping, smoothly written thriller.\\" The review also assessed the character of Rynn Jacobs as not precisely a villain, but \\"brilliant\\" and \\"warmhearted.\\" However, The Critic journal concluded \\"This doesn't work\\", saying Rynn was so clever and effective she did not come across as a teenager, comparing her to \\"an IBM computer\\". In 2015, Rynn was voted the 20th most evil child in literature by Abebooks experts and readers.

It was produced by Anjul Nigam, Frank Lotito, and Steve Straka and directed by Frank Lotito. Prior to its theatrical release, the film was originally produced and exhibited in some festivals under the title \\"Good Ol' Boy\\". The movie takes place in 1979, when an Indian family moves to America with hopes of living the American Dream. While their 10-year-old boy Smith falls head-over-heels for the girl next door, his desire to become a \\"good old boy\\" propels him further away from his family's ideals than ever before. The film premiered on June 1, 2015, at the Seattle International Film Festival, where it won the Best of the Fest Top Five. Growing Up Smith went on to win the Audience Awards at the Woodstock Film Festival, Naples International Film Festival, Prescott Film Festival; the Jury Prize at CAAMFest; and the Best Family Film at Garden State Film Festival. It was the Opening Night Film at the Cleveland International Film Festival and the SouthSide Film Festival. The movie had its theatrical release in select cities in the United States on February 3, 2017, and expanded wider on February 10, 2017. Produced for $2 million, it received mostly positive reviews including TIME Magazine's Pick of the Week. Plot Growing Up Smith is a coming-of-age story of Smith, a 10-year-old boy from India growing up in small-town America in 1979. As the boy's family tries to straddle the fine line between embracing the American Dream and preserving their Indian heritage, the awkward little hero sneaks out for a taste of Kentucky Fried Chicken (even though his family is vegetarian), dons a Saturday Night Fever costume, and contends with his parents as they send him to school with a yellow squash instead of a pumpkin to carve for Halloween. And as Smith falls head-over-heels in love with Amy, the girl-next-door, he finds in Amy's father Butch the all-American cowboy he wishes his own father could be. But alas, when Smith goes on a hunting adventure with Butch, Butch injures himself while chasing a doe. Smith's rescuing Butch makes him a local hero, but also strains his relationship with his father. With Butch unable to work, his wife decides to move away from the house and takes Amy with her. Amy, unable to deal with the turmoil in her own family, threatens to run away. Smith leaves the house on his bike to meet up with her, though Butch arrives soon after and prevents her from doing so. Smith's parents, in the meantime, search for him and find his sister making out with a boy. Furious, they condemn his sister to studying, and upon Smith's return banish him back to India after he declares his love for Amy. Nineteen years pass in India, with Smith becoming a neurosurgeon and finding a woman to marry. Smith's wife dies of a complication - though unknown - that Smith himself tries to cure. Smith returns to his hometown in America, where his sister has a family with Patrick (the same boy she was found making out with nineteen years earlier) and lives in the same house as before. Smith reconnects with Butch, and finds out Amy still lives in her grandmother's house as a fourth-grade teacher, though she is unmarried and has a child. The movie concludes with Smith re-affirming his desire to meet Amy and riding out on the same old bike to do so.

Institute infrastructure A new campus of Alexander Butlerov Institute of Chemistry The main building of the Institute is located at the intersection of Kremlyovskaya and Lobachevskaya streets. This four-story building built in 1953 in the style of Soviet neoclassicism under the guidance of architect A.G. Bikchentaev. The building of the museum of Kazan chemical school is located in the campus of the main university building, built in the 1830s in a classical style under the guidance of architect M.P. Corinfskiy. In 2015 construction of a large laboratory building in the campus of Alexander Butlerov Institute of Chemistry was finished. The 7-storey building housed classrooms and laboratories of departments of Alexander Butlerov Institute of Chemistry, Institute of Geology and Petroleum Technologies, Institute of Physics. The building was constructed with the support of the President of Tatarstan R.N. Minnikhanov and PSC \\"TAIF\\". Museum of Kazan School of Chemistry The museum is located in a small two-storey building where laboratory of physics (on the first floor) and chemical laboratory (on the second floor) was designed. It was the first chemical laboratory of Kazan University. The first professor was N.N. Zinin, who studied abroad and learned new method of teaching chemistry and began to apply it in Kazan University. This method combined practical and lecture classes that is still familiar to students. Discoveries that brought glory to Kazan University were made in this chemical laboratory. There are no usual stalls and stands in the museum. It is a memorial laboratory of the 19th century which includes Butlerov's lecture room, a library, the laboratory itself, a hall for exhibiting chemical preparations and laboratory equipment of 19–20th centuries, and the study of the head of the laboratory (Butlerov's study). There are about six thousand items of storage in the museum. Nowadays in the main hall of the museum lectures and seminars and defence of master's and doctoral theses are conducted. In the side rooms you may observe modern laboratories. Interesting facts *Alexander Butlerov Institute of Chemistry trains students for school chemical Olympiads of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation. At various times, professors of the Institute of Chemistry headed Russian teams at International School Chemistry Olympiad among them were Andrey N. Vedernikov, Arkady I. Kuramshin and Igor A. Sedov; *The old building of the Alexander Butlerov Institute of Chemistry since it was built in 1953, was not only a laboratory building of chemical faculty of Kazan University, at different times, it also placed historical-philological faculty of Kazan University, military department, some rooms were used as a hostel for young teachers and graduate students of the University. *For nearly 10 years (since 2006) Alexander Butlerov Institute of Chemistry issues student newspaper \\"Hi.Zhi.Na – abbreviation in Russian stands for Chemistry, Life, Science\\", which highlights institute events, university, scientific news, educational articles and interesting quizzes.

Bharathi's wealthy father (Balaiah) wants to donate some of his properties for charity. This is objected to by his nephew (Asokan) who intends to marry Bharati and seize all the properties.

Rodrigo was in the service of the House of Trastámara, and was a court composer for Ferdinand I of Aragon when he received the Crown of Aragon in 1412. At Ferdinand's death in 1416, Alfonso V was crowned King of Aragon, and Rodrigo remained in his service under the title ministril de camara. He was sent to visit the Count of Foix and the courts of Navarre and Castile, accompanied by Diego, a singer who also served the Aragonese royalty.\\"Rodrigo de la Guitarra\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. 2nd edition, Oxford, 2001. Rodrigo accompanied Alfonso on a visit to Naples in 1421; while he was away the following year, his wife, Ines Gonzalez, was kidnapped in Valencia, and his house was robbed. The abductors were caught in Seville and punished.M.C. Gómez, \\"Some Precursors of the Spanish Lute School\\". Early Music 20 (1992), pp. 583-593. By late 1423 he had returned to Spain, and is recorded as being in Barcelona; he remains in Aragonese records until 1427. He then disappears from the historical record until 1458, when he was one of several instrumentalists who accompanied the Feast of the Assumption in Toledo that year. No surviving works have definitively been attributed to Rodrigo, though it has been suggested that he is the author of Angelorum psalat, a ballade from the Chantilly Codex.

In Chile he is known also as a scholar in law; in Spain, and especially in Catalonia, he is recognized as a member of the Catalanist movement. Active in Carlism during his youth, he is considered a typical case of a transitional political identity, moving from Carlism to peripheral nationalism. Increasingly concerned with social issues, by the end of his life he sympathized with Francoism and Nazism; he also focused more on his extended family and became increasingly religious. His manuals, published anonymously and related mostly to health, hygiene and cuisine, were fairly popular in Spain in the 1920s and 1930s. Family and youth Sant Boi de Llobregat Joan Bardina Castarà descended from a working class Catalan family. His paternal grandparents, Josep Bardina and Maria Savarich, lived in a Pyrenean village of Llogaret de Santa Creu, Alto Urgel county, and had 12 children.Anna Forés i Miravelles, Joan Bardina Castarà: Educator Catalán y sus proyecciones pedagógicas en Chile [PhD thesis Universidad de Barcelona], Barcelona 1996, p. 52, Artur Martorell, Enric Cassasses, Josep Parunella, Joan Bardina I Castará.

It is there where he commenced working, first as a locksmith and then as a blacksmith. He married a local girl, Dolores Castarà Sigró. She also came from a humble, though somewhat better positioned family; her parents, Josep Castarà Marigó and María Ciuró (originally Sigró) Puig, were handicraftsmen specializing in lace-making; especially the latter was recognized in the town.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 52 The newly married couple had one child, a daughter, before Dolores died. A widower, Joan married her younger sister, Josepa Castarà Ciuró. They had 4 children, Josepa, Joan, Baldiri and Magdalena.Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 52-53 Educated in a kindergarten, at the age of 5 Joan was able to read and write.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 53, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 5-6 In 1884 he moved to elementary school, excelling as an extraordinary student. It was the headmaster who suggested that the boy pursues a more ambitious career. In line with the advice,and somewhat against the standard practice, since the oldest son was supposed to succeed his father in 1887 Joan entered the Barcelona seminary.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 54 He kept collecting awardsForés i Miravelles 1996, p. 55 until the mid-1890s,Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 56-58 as a teenager developing interest in photography, folk customs and tourism.Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 55-56 However, path towards an ecclesiastical careerin 1897 he was close to signing up to ecclesiastical service in Mexico, with other seminarians, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 156 was abruptly abandoned. Trying his hand in local journals, Bardina published a pamphlet deemed disrespectful towards the cardinal Sancha y Hervás;titled El Cardenal Sancha y otros excesos = media vuelta a la derecha es igual que media vuelta a la izquierda, pero todo lo contrario. Though Bardina signed the piece, published in Lo Mestre Titas, as “Valcarlos”, it was well known who the author was, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 13, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 155 he considered a heavy reprimand received unfair. When his work on Kant, winning the first prize at a Valencia Seminary contest, was declared arrogant in his home seminary, in 1898exact date is not clear, some sources mention 1896. However, later on Bardina explicitly referred to “nine years spent in the seminar”, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 13 Bardina left the school.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 59 He obtained bachillerato in 1899 in Instituto de Girona and graduated in philosophy and letters from University of Barcelona in 1900.thesis titled Orígenes de la Tradición y del Régimen Liberal, Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 14, 68.

Bardina’s biographer claims that 1904 was the year when his thesis was published Himself exempted from military service,as the oldest son of a widow, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 68 in 1901 he volunteered to spare conscription of his sickly brother Baldiri.the sacrifice was useless; Baldiri died shortly afterwards, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 68-69. The military service was not very challenging anyway; during few months Bardina had to show up at a Barcelona military office to perform bureaucratic duties, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 159-160 At that time he was already trying to make a living by contributing to Barcelona periodicals and publishing own booklets.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 13; since the early 1890s he was used to earning money by winning various literary contests, the first one in 1889, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 18, p. 152. With premature death of his father, his widowed mother and his sisters moved to Barcelona, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 18, 155 Barcelona seminary In 1906 Bardina married Josepa Soronellas Brosé (1880-1910),Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 15 a feminist activist;she was the nominal author of Historia Sagrada Educativa, fathered probably (at least partially) by Prat de la Riba, issued 1906, El Presupuesto Extraordinario de Cultura y la Institución de Cultura Popular (1908) del Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, [in:] filosofia.org service, available here; Bardina wrote a prologue to the book her father was involved in housekeeping, printing and distribution of a periodical Bardina worked with.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 18, 164 In 1907 their only child, Remedios (Reimei) Bardina Soronellas, was born.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 15, Artur Martorell, Joan Bardina i l’Escola de Mestres, Barcelona 1961, p. 16 The girl initially lived with her parents and then with her widowed father in Barcelona, after his departure to stay with her grandmother. Remedios was the first female law graduate of the University of Barcelona and among the first three female PhD graduates from the University of Madrid, to gain another PhD from the University of Berlin. She married Yen Huai Liu, a fellow PhD student from China.Yen Huai Liu was a famous Chinese explorer of the Great Gobi Desert, a college Professor, author of many college textbooks, and a decorated war hero. He served in the Nationalist Kuomintang Air force fighting the Japanese invasion In the 1930s the couple settled in China and later, together with seven children, in Taiwan.the children were: John, b. 1933 (pilot in USA; three daughters), Henry- 1936-2009 (PhD Professor & inventor in USA- three sons), George - 1939-2012 (USA- one daughter one son), Mary- 1942 (PhD in USA; one daughter and one son), Annie- 1946 (IT in Australia; two sons), Helen- 1948 (IT in USA; one daughter), Vincent-1952 (inventor & engineer in USA; two sons). Yen Huai Liu died in Taiwan in 1982 and Remedios passed away in San Diego, USA in 1999. Remedios' life in China was captured in her self published memoir: \\"My Fifteen Years In China\\" by R. Bardina Liu, 1996. In 1921, already in Chile, Bardina remarried with a local girl Raquel Venegas (born 1902);death date unknown (after 1950) none of the sources consulted offers any information on her family.she was personal assistant to Bardina, and already had one child on her own, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 223 The couple had 4 children, Joan, Raquel, Rebeca and Marta, born between 1922 and 1927.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 18, Martorell 1961, pp. 75-76 All of them got married and had children;dates of birth unknown; it is not clear whether Bardina lived to see any of his Chilean grandchildren none has grown to prominence.in Chile and Argentina, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 194 Carlist Carlos VII Bardina did not demonstrate political sympathiesit is not clear whether there were any political antecedents among Bardina’s ancestors; as to their general outlook it is only known that his parents, and especially his mother, were profoundly religious until the mid-1890s; influenced by the spirit of fellow seminarians,\\"la gran mayoria de los seminaristas es carlista\\" – read an internal ecclesiastical document, Canal 1996, p. 52; Carlism was not an unusual preference among lower clergy, in some seminaries and in some religious orders - John N.

In 1895 he published first poems in the Carlist press,in a satirical weekly El Voluntario, Canal 1996, p. 48 signed with a histrionic pen-name \\"Valcarlos\\",a village on the Spanish-French frontier; it is there where defeated during the Third Carlist War and heading for exile in France, in 1876 the claimant Carlos VII declared “I will come back!” The statement became a Carlist war cry and kept raising the Carlist spirits for decades to come and kept contributinginitially poems; e.g. one of them, A mi novio, was styled as a letter from a girl to his fiancé; she explained why she would never marry a Liberal; in another one, A Carlos VII, en lo dia del seu sant, Bardina was offering his life to the claimant, Carlos VII to various Traditionalist titles;El Nuevo Cruzado, publication of Joventut Carlista de Barcelona, or Lo Geni Català, publication of a Carlist circle in Vilafranca de Penedès, Canal 1996, p. 49, Jordi Canal, ¿En busca del precedente perdido?

It was a proverbial reference to a helpful but poor teacher, whose educational premises were used also for breeding chicken, see elnasdecardedeu service, available here. The director was Juan Maria Roma, Canal 2005, p. 69 and quickly emerged as one of its key contributors.according to some scholars periodically Bardina provided most of the contents, Canal 1996, p. 55; it is quite possible, given the weekly usually did not exceed 4 pages, in one fourth filled with cartoons. Bardina contributed under various pen-names; the ones identified so far – not only in case of Lo Mestre Titas – are \\"Said\\", \\"Pepet de les Pomes\\", \\"Abel\\", \\"Fusta\\", \\"Tofolet\\", \\"Dra.

The climax of Bardina's Carlist engagement fell on 1899-1900, when he published an unorthodoxBardina hailed Aparisi as “el primero que presentó el carlismo a los españoles como el partido más firmemente liberal y cristianamente democrático”, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 61 biography of Aparisi Guijarro,Joan Bardina, Aparisi y Guijarro. Apuntes biogràficos del que fue honra de Epaña y Gloria de la comunión tradicionalista, Barcelona 1900 first volume of an intended series on history of CarlismOrígenes históricos del carlismo, Barcelona 1900. It was intended as first out of three, but the second one went to print in 1916, Canal 1996, p. 65, Canal 2005, p. 78 and two treaties discussing his vision of Carlist Catalonia;Catalunya autònoma. Programa carlí català en forma de Constitució Codificada, Barcelona 1899 (two editions) and Catalunya y els carlins, Barcelona 1900 they raised many eyebrows, and in 1900 Llauder explicitly prohibited Bardina propagating his Catalanist-Carlist outlook.Canal 1996, p. 69, Canal 2005, p. 83 Militant tone of Lo Mestre Titas brought administrative fines, which in April 1900 led to disappearance of the title.in April 1900 Lo Mestre Titas fell under the penalties applied; inability to pay was the reason why the weekly was definitely suspended, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 157 Bardina was trialed for instigating to rebellion and fined;Canal 2005, p. 78; in 1900 Bardina accused Guardia Civil of torturing the Carlists; the issue was banned and Bardina was fined, Canal 1996, pp. 63-4, Canal 2005, p. 77. Another fine followed once he attacked the Cortes deputies and was mentioned in Cortes himself, Canal 1996, p. 64, Canal 2005, p. 78 indeed by scholars he is considered representative of a “catastrophist” approach.a theory that a crash of the Restoration system – perhaps a violent one – is inevitable, Canal 2005, p. 77 La Octubrada It is not clear whether Bardina took part in Carlist military gear-up to overthrow the regime in 1899-1900; his publications, including a self-devised infantry tactical rulebook,Táctica de Infantería, Barcelona 1899 (another edition followed in 1900). The booklet triggered juridical investigation, which was terminated with no action undertaken, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 158, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 60 were clearly pointing in this direction. The conspiracy boiled down to few isolated attempts in October 1900, and most of those detained afterwards were Bardina's friends.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 161, Canal 2005, p. 81 He was profoundly disappointed by ambiguous stand of the claimant,Canal 1996, pp. 67-68 whose official condemnation of those involved alienated Bardina further on.he was present at the funeral of general Soliva in 1901 and later supported his cause as \\"Dr. Leal\\", lambasting general Moore and Carlos VII as traitors, Canal 1996, p. 68 His Carlism started to assume increasingly offshoot tone. In 1901-1902 he was engaged in El Cañón, an even more heterodox successor of Lo Mestre Titas, and niche Catholic periodicals La BarretinaMartorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 157-158 and Luz Católica.a periodical of father Corbato, who remained anti-Carlist Traditionalist in a somewhat millenarian format, messianic and supporting Milicias de la Cruz, Canal 2005, p. 82 He might have been involved in conspiracy to replace Don Carlos with his son, Don Jaime.Canal 2005, p. 81 In a symbolic gesture, he shortened his pen-name from “Valcarlos” to “Val”.Canal 1996, p. 68, Canal 2005, p. 81 Bardina's anti-regime stand cost him another detention; he was spared sanctions thanks to private links.the 1902 La Barretina piece juxtaposed hunger and misery of the people and luxury gifts given out by the king. A mother of the children he was teaching was friend to wife of the military governor, and intervened successfully. The governor called Bardina, interviewed him, released him, and made him the teacher of his own children, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 160 In 1903 he openlyin La Veu de Catalunya lambasted Carlist executive for ineptitude. Ridiculed by the party press as ex-Carlista,Canal 2005, p. 79, Canal 1996, p. 66 Bardina declared having been a Traditionalist but never a Carlist,Canal 1996, p. 66, Canal 2005, p. 79 and in his later booklet openly challenged the “Carlo- traitors”.C. P. M. Apsmav (José Domingo Corbató), Dr. Leal (Juan Bardina), Los Carlo-traidores, Barcelona 1904 Between Carlism and Catalanism Carlist standard Support for historical territorial identities and for loose organization of state has been major component of the Carlist vision; initially it seemed that Bardina's view on the Catalan question was firmly anchored within this outlook. Feeling profoundly Catalan, in line with orthodox Carlism he confronted the emerging Catalan nationalism as a chaotic medley; lacking tradition and social base, according to Bardina it was advocated by a handful of intellectuals and students,Canal 2005, p. 70 indulging in sectarian exaltation and producing discord.Canal 2005, p. 71 Tending to separatism, they were “descendants of the federalists and republicans in political terms, atheists in religious terms, and Jacobins in social terms”.Canal 1996, p. 62 The only viable offer for Catalonia – Bardina argued - was this of Carlos VII, who already in the 1870s hailed Catalan identity and pledged to restore traditional regional establishments.Canal 1996, p. 63, Canal 2005, p. 70; The Catalanist manifiesto known as Bases de Manresa (1892) was, according to Bardina, copying 20-year-old manifestos of Carlos VII, Canal 2005, p. 76 Writing to Lo Mestre Titas, Bardina engaged in hostile exchange of arguments with Catalanist periodicals La Renaixensa or La Nació Catalana, lambasting their anti-Carlism.Canal 1996, pp. 57-58, Canal 2005, p. 72 By the turn of the centuries militant and zealous Bardina's tone gave way to somewhat moderated polemics, mostly with Enric Prat de la Riba; discussing differences of programs and contradictory positions of Carlism and nationalist Catalanism, he abandoned earlier venom.Canal 2005, p. 73 Declaring himself a Catalanist and a Carlist at the same time, he criticized the latter for scarce use of Catalan, provincial organization, cuñerismo,the practice of endorsing cuckoo candidates and giving precedence to Rey over Patria.Canal 1996, p. 59, Canal 2005, p. 74 Bardina's treaties published started to stress an autonomous concept of Catalonia.it was selling well and the second edition soon went to print, Canal 2005, p. 74 Though explicitly rejecting full political independence in favor of a self-government, his vision was mounted in a general, federal or confederal view of an Iberian peninsula as a conglomerate of kingdoms, principates, señorios and other entities.Canal 1996, p. 60, Canal 2005, p. 75; according to some scholars, his vision “podría condensarse en independencia de Catalunya, dentro de una unidad federal ibérica” - Buenaventura Delgado, Ramon Cortada, Josep Gonzalez-Agapito, Claudio Lozano, Joan Bardina. Un revolucionario de la pedagogia catalana, Barcelona 1980, , p. 29 Such Catalonia would be a confessional Catholic entity with an own concordat,Canal 1996, p. 61 with freemasonry banned and no freedom of religion. It would be based on democratic principles, including political parties and universal suffrage, crowned with own Catalan parliament;Canal 1996, p. 60, Canal 2005, p. 75 the only official language would be Catalan.Canal 2005, p. 75 Catalan standard Though Carlism adopted an ambiguous position on the question of autonomy and though federative concepts were vaguely advanced by some key Carlist pundits, definitive and adamant stand of Bardina was barely acceptable for the party executives.Canal 1996, p. 63 Aware of this skepticism, in 1900 Bardina declared he was prepared to abandon the Carlists if they adopt a centralist position.Canal 1996, p. 59 His relations with Prat de la Riba changed into rapprochement,Canal 1996, p. 65, Canal 2005, p. 79 acknowledged by his contributions to La Veu de CatalunyaCanal 2005, p. 79, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 161 and other similarly formatted periodicals.starting 1904 Bardina started to contribute Catalanism-flavored pieces to Pla de Bages, a daily from Manresa Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 162 In late 1902 he was entrusted with drafting educational program of Lliga RegionalistaCanal 2005, p. 79 and in 1904 entered its Comisión de Escuelas,El Presupuesto Extraordinario de Cultura y la Institución de Cultura Popular (1908) del Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, [in:] filosofia.org service, available here though Bardina is not known to have held any posts in the party. In the mid-1900s he was already within the “intellectuales orgánicos” circle of Prat de la Riba,Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 79, 81 individuals staying clear of politics but engaged in ground-level work within the conservative, bourgeoisie Catalanism. Starting mid-1900 Bardina was to engage in a variety of Catalanist educational initiatives, be it congresses, lectures, newspapers, schools, self-governmental or private institutions and various associations. Catalanist educator Enric Prat de la Riba Apart from work as a private tutor in well-to-do Barcelona familiesMartorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 160 Bardina had no experience as to education, though he grew enthusiastic about the subject and befriended individuals from the scholarly realm; among them were the Giner de los Rios brothers, chief promoters of Krausism in Spain.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 77 His interest in Catalanism and education led to taking part in the 1903 Congreso Universitario Catalán, one of mushrooming Catalanist education-related initiatives.Estudios Universitarios Catalanes, Los Estudios Normales de la Mancomunitat, Patronato Escolar de Barcelona, los Grupos Escolares, El Instituto Escuela, la Escuela Normal de la Generalitat, Escuela Vallparadís, Colegio Mont Cor, Escuela Blanquerna, Escuela Sant Jordi and other, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 162 He offered own views on a future Catalan academic system,Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 163, Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 14, 83-84 declaring also that all primary education should be in Catalan.Claudio Lozano, La pedagogia política de Bardina, [in:] Buenaventura Delgado, Ramón Cortada, Josep Gonzalez-Agápito, Claudio Lozano, Joan Bardina.

In the mid-1900s Bardina was contemplating educative plans of his own; he launched Biblioteca Escolar Moderna, a series intended to provide comprehensive textbooks.5 volumes were issued prior to 1908, covering math and grammar, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 165-166 His most notable initiative was a college for future teachers.

Only one issue went to print before Bardina lost control over the review and it re-formatted into Spanish as Revista de Educación, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 138 gave lectureshe spoke, among others, in Ateneo Obrero, Centro Excursionista and Juventud Nacionalista, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 181-182 and set up new institutions.he entered Sociedad barcelonesa de Amigos de la Instrucción, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 182, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 89 He remained engaged in numerous self-governmental activities.e.g. he was appointed member of a jury reviewing application for grants, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 15; in 1908 he was to become secretario of a planned Institución de Cultura Popular, El Presupuesto Extraordinario de Cultura y la Institución de Cultura Popular (1908) del Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, [in:] filosofia.org service, available here The most important of them was Presupuesto Extraordinario de Cultura, a long term educational project developed by the Barcelona city council and launched in 1908. Asked by Prat de la Riba to work on the document a few years earlier,El Presupuesto Extraordinario de Cultura y la Institución de Cultura Popular (1908) del Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, [in:] filosofia.org service, available here Bardina heavily contributed to its pedagogical section, mostly within the Krausist- Catalanist framework and occasionally assuming a somewhat anti-conservative flavor.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 99 Semana Trágica In the summer of 1909 Barcelona and Catalonia were rocked by Anarchist-dominated and anti-religious riots, known as Semana Trágica. With army restoring order and massive casualties, political establishment took a decisively conservative turn; also Prat de la Riba and La Lliga re-considered the question of alliances and enemies. Liberal educational initiatives became the focus of suspicion. The Presupuesto project was cancelled by the civil governor.Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 99-100 Francesc Ferrer Guardia, founder of Escuela Moderna, was sentenced and executed; also Bardina got ostracized and stigmatized, and police developed interest in his activities.Jiménez Serradilla, p. 17 1909 marks the breakup date between him and Prat de la Riba.Lozano 1980, p. 29 Subsidies for Bardina's projects dried out. Unable to cope financially on their own, both Escola de Mestres and Collegio del Remei closed in 1910;Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 166-181 Bardina became sort of an outcast. At the crossroads Paris, 1912 Cut off from public money, Bardina ensured private support. In 1911 the Dural couple, owners of a well- to-do trading company, agreed to finance a new school. It materialized as Institución Spencer;named after Herbert Spencer Bardina, apart from having been a headmaster, taught math, geography, languages and history. The enterprise was largely a private Durall tuition affair, as the only alumni known were their numerous children and Bardina's own oldest daughter. For financial reasons or reasons which are not clear, the school closed after just one year, in 1912.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 183-185, Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 135-137 Bardina found himself in financial dire straits, especially that creditors of Escola de Mestres threatened him with legal action.the school closed with 30,000 ptas in debt, Jiménez Serradilla, p. 16 With life in Barcelona becoming unbearable, he pondered upon starting an entirely new life elsewhere.Jiménez Serradilla, p. 16 In 1912 with some of his former alumni he moved to Paris to learn the French educational system, the stay financed initially with private money; having obtained public grant,Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 186-188 he then extended the mission to Belgium and Britain.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 17 He viewed it already as a way to leave Spain forever,Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 137 but at this stage things did not work out that way. He had to return to Barcelona; in 1914 the newly formed Mancomunitat launched a number of new educational establishments, but Bardina was not invited to take part in any.in 1914 Prat launched L’Institut d’Estudis Catalans, la Biblioteca de Catalunya, Les Biblioteques Populars, La Universitat Industrial, La Instrucció Pedagògica, but there is no mention of Bardina engaged in any of them, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 79 He resumed collaboration with La Veu de Catalunya;it was terminated in 1910, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 162 under a pen- name \\"Capitán de Estado Mayor\\", in 1914-1917 he contributed fairly popular chronicles of military developments of the Great War.it seems that editor-in- chief of the daily was unaware of identity of his correspondent. The column was quite popular and at one point it drew attention of the military; the army requested to see the “captain”; Bardina did not show up and from that moment onewards he used to sign as \\"C.E.M.\\", Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 189-190 In the 1910s he published also a few self-devised and hugely successful manuals on hygiene, medicine, self-defense, savoir-vivre and home cuisine.as \\"Dra.

It seems that he has even written anonymous articles, referring to “methods of doctor Saimbraum, see Madrid Sport 18.07.18, available here In the mid-1910s Bardina's idea of leaving Spain focused on Colombia, where some of his alumni settled.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 216 However, in 1916 it was the government of Bolivia which sought assistance in Madrid to fill the post of philosophy and letters director at Instituto Normal Superior in La Paz. As initial recruitment process, staged by Ministry of Education, proved fruitless,out of 30 candidates applying, the one selected by Madrid was rejected by the Bolivians on political grounds, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 216 advised by a Bolivian consul in Barcelona Bardina applied for the job. It is not clear whether his PhD dissertation, accepted in early 1917, was anyhow related to the recruitment process;titled Educación mediante el entrenamiento libre y graduado; it is not clear at which university it was accepted. Bardina himself admitted that his work was of limited originality (“tiene un cierto aire de originalidad”), Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 18, 212-215, Canal 1996, p. 50 one month later he signed a contract with the Bolivian government.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 217 In May 1917 Bardina already assumed his duties in La Paz, having found Instituto as a miserable institution adhering to medieval educational standards.Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 217-220 He immediately attempted to implant his unorthodox methods, which instantly produced acute conflict with local staff.the school was initially organized by the Belgian legacy, and there were still some Belgians among its directors, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 221 After 45 days in charge, Bardina resigned.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 221 La Paz (present-day view) In La Paz Bardina befriended Rafael Edward Salas, head of military ordinariate of the Chilean armed forces. Acting on his advice, Bardina accompanied Salas on his return trip to Santiago de Chile and settled in the city.Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 222-223 He took up assignment at a local religious school and commenced collaboration with a Catholic Valparaíso periodical, La Unión; it is also in Santiago where he remarried.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 223 Shortly afterwards La Unión managers offered Bardina a job in Valparaíso, the proposal he accepted. In 1921 he moved to the coastal city, where he would remain until the end of his life.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 227 Pundit La Unión In Valparaíso Bardina commenced teaching at Seminario San Rafael,Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 228, 231 a very prestigious establishment set up by the local archbishop and aimed at modelling not only future priests, but also as a stepping stone towards a lay career.see the official web page of the Seminario, available here He started contributing to Boy, a periodical issued by the college and in 1925 renamed to Lux. In the 1920s he published numerous pieces, centered on education though at times dealing also with social and political issues;see the list published in Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 229-230 set in the Catholic framework, they nevertheless kept advancing innovative views on schooling. He also dedicated himself to family life, enjoying birth and education of his 4 children. At unspecified time in the 1920s he commenced teaching at a customs officer training center, which proved to be a safe source of income and provided him with esteem of the civil servant.referred as “escuela de Aduanas”, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 196 In the early 1920s Bardina and his local collaborator Joaquín Blaya launched Annuario Internacional Americano, a business magazine focused on commerce. The project proved hugely successful, with the review distributed in many American countries; it also consumed lots of his time, as gathering information and establishing new links Bardina started to travel across the continent; his trips took him to Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina and Ecuador. For the first time he enjoyed affluence, travelling extensively, staying in the best hotels and basking in the growing prestige.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 196 As he maintained contacts with his former Barcelona editors, he kept re-issuing manuals written back in Spain; posing as an expert and hailed by friendly periodicals as “celebre Dr. Saimbraum”, one of the pen-names he assumed, Bardina used to recommend booklets of “Dra. Fanny”, another nome de plume of him.La Hormiga de Oro 22.07.26, available here Valparaíso, former La Unión office Apart from contributing to periodicals issued by Seminario San Rafael, Bardina kept supplying other newspapers and reviews, like Diario Hispano-Americano of Valparaíso or Diario Ilustrado of Santiago de Chile; some, however, refused to publish his pieces due to “exceso de originalidad”.El mundo español, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 193 His key partner remained La Unión, the assignment which originally brought him to Valparaíso; in fact, his contributions assumed massive scale. Bardina's flagship product was La Semana Internacional, a weekly Monday column discussing international politics which kept appearing until the early 1930s.the list in Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 235-240 His pieces fell chiefly into three fields: education, international politics and internal social and political issues, the last one covered mostly from the Catholic social perspective.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 241; he was perceived as “infatigable difusor de la doctrina Social Católica”, see comments on him in a Chilean periodical Lux in 1938, referred at estudiobardina website, available here It was his contributions to La Unión which over time earned Bardina the status of a pundit and high position in the Valparaíso societé. However, co-operation with the daily ended abruptly. In 1932 Bardina sided with the striking staff against the La Unión management; as a result he had to leave the newspaper.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 242 Scholar Escuela de Derecho (current view) In 1928 Bardina was appointed professor of labor law at Escuela de Derecho, a newly establishedcompare Agustín Squella, Ricardo Loyola, Escuela de Derecho. Breve historia ilustrada, Valparaíso 2011, Valparaíso outlet of Universidad de Chile.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 197 Since he had neither juridical education nor juridical practice, circumstances of his nomination are not clear.he claimed having undergone scrupulous scrutiny before landing the job, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 197-8, perhaps also his already recognized standing in the Valparaíso realm was not unrelated The academic post gradually became his principal activity. He retained jefatura of Cátedra del Derecho de Trabajo throughout the 1930s and most of the 1940s, putting into practice his concepts of education. Bardina remained very distinct from other professors; he is remembered by his former disciples as attentive, encouraging, partner-like and sort of an “iconoclast”. Instead of lecturing the audience, he preferred – much in line with his educational outlook, though also perhaps not unrelated to his lack of juridical background – to engage in discussion.Mario Alegría Alegría, Recuerdos de un almuno de Don Juan Bardina y Castara, [in:] Crónicas de Valparaíso, 12.04.05, available here Periodically he was entrusted also with other academic assignments, e.g. temporarily holding Cátedra de Sociología y Economía Social.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 200 In 1932 Bardina set up another weekly on his own, La Semana Internacional. The periodical, very much a one-man show, kept appearing for some 15 years and was distributed in America and in Europe. It turned into his personal tribune; apart from review of international politics, it covered a vast array of other topics,Forés i Miravelles 1996, pp. 246-7 earning him position also abroad.one of his readers in Europe was Agustí Chalaux Le Semana demonstrated Bardina's increasingly democratic penchanthe has long abandoned earlier monarchism, turning not only a republican, but also supporter of universal suffrage, including the feminine vote, compare his comments on the Spanish republican constitution, La Semana Internacional 16.04.34, available here combined with concern about social issues and poverty. Initially sympathetic towards the Spanish Republic, he later started to view it as incapable of solving structural issues; following a period of hesitation, during the Civil War he tended to side with the Nationalists.Bardina viewed the Spanish Civil War as a social conflict, though his view was from orthodox. According to him, the Republicans offered unworkable recipes of false democracy, while the Nationalists sought a holistic solution; \\"El general Franco, en dos de sus discursos, ha esbozado un excelente programa de gobierno, cuya mitad ya quisiéramos ver realizado. Con ello bastaría para salvar a España\\", La Semana Internacional 24.10.36, available here Posing as an impartial observer, he welcomed Falange's program\\" la juventud falangista de Badajoz publicaba un programa que verá la luz en estas columnas.

Y siente por Hitler una profunda simpatía y por su régimen –que es de transición- un gran respeto”, La Semana Internacional 06.02.37, available here developed along the same lines; he considered Hitlersee e.g. his opinion on Hitler, written in May 1945, La Semana Internacional 12.05.45, available here a champion of genuine democracy, the voice of the people, against façade democracy and capital-driven imperialism of Britain,e.g. in 1945 he considered monarchic claims of Don Juan merely a vehicle of pursuing imperialist British interests, “los reyes son los brazos desnacionalizantes de Gran Bretaña, tanto en Grecia y Yugoslavia como en España. Son rebrotes afrancesados cuya nacionalización no se ha realizado todavía. Un Bobón es un impermeable”, and criticised Franco for his complacency versus Britain, La Semana Internacional 28.07.45, available here France“claro está que esta Libertad y Democracia, aunque lleven Mayúscula, han de caer irremisiblemente bajo el desprecio de los pueblos, antes que nadie de los pueblos francés y británico”. According to Bardina, Hitler was an icon of democracy as “en ese movimiento liberador del pueblo alemán, a nombre de la democracia y autodeterminación de los pueblos, Adolfo Hitler ha tenido papel tan descollante, que nadie estaría en razón si no colocase a ese hombre en la cumbre de los que actúan en estos instantes”, La Semana Internacional 20.04.40, available here and their sidekicks like Poland.Poland was presented as imperialist country, with its raison d’etre oppressing other nations, which in 1939 fell victim to its own imperialism, La Semana Internacional 02.09.39, available here Politically he neared Movimiento Nacional-Socialista de Chile of Jorge González von Marées.William Thayer Arteaga, Humanismo cristiano chileno (1931-2001): sus inspiradores, sus seguidores, sus polémicas y luchas, Santiago de Chile 2002, , p. 135 Chilean fascists, 1940s The 1930s are perhaps the period of Bardina's professional and social climax. Holding a prestigious academic post, he enjoyed friendship with some highly positioned Chilean dignitaries, including the president of Chile, Carlos Ibañez del Campo; young people were turning to him when seeking jobs.Alegría Alegría 2005 He was offered newspaper management posts back in Spain,at the Carlist Barcelona daily, El Correo Catalan. Bardina neither accepted nor rejected; he commenced discussion on terms and conditions. Outbreak of the Civil War in 1936 ruined the plans, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 198-9 awarded prestigious medalsin 1936 the president of Bolivia conferred upon him Golden Cross of Orden Nacional del Condor de Los Andes, a recognition of his Americanist contributions and other international honors.like the 1938 Premio de Exposición Internacional de Publicaciones in Cuba Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 200 The period of prospect lasted until the mid-1940s, when fortune abandoned Bardina again. Due to its pro-Nazi sympathies, La Semana was blacklisted by the US authorities, which caused problems in print and in distribution;Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 200-201 the weekly went into decline. His manuals, reprinted for years in Spain, were already 20 years old and dried out as a source of royalties.the last one identified is La cocina casera (Barcelona 1941), compare antiquamarilda service, available here Though in 1945 Bardina was still noted as an energetic, elderly gentleman,Alegría Alegría 2005 his health soon deteriorated rapidly and he had to abandon the academic post.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 201 As a result, his last years were plagued by financial problems.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 201-202 Thought primary education, Catalonia Bardina's views on education are reconstructed predominantly on basis of his theoretical works. His opus consists mostly of articles, scattered across numerous periodicals issued in Spain or in Chile.their number is not clear. Those referred in works dealing with Bardina do not exceed one hundred His manuals, published anonymously and few of them covering education-related topics, attracted far less attention. How Bardina put his ideas into practice remains rather obscure; the 1906-1910 period at Escola de Mestres is analyzed in detail,and not necessarily representative of his concept of education. Escola de Mestres was not designed as a model school; it was envisaged as a specific institution, supposed to provide cadres for the future education but there is no study of his term in the Santiago seminary in the late 1910, in the Valparaíso college in the 1920s, in Escuela de Derecho in the 1930s and 1940s or in fiscal and customs training schools in Chile. It is not completely clear how Bardina developed his interest in education and what his inspiration was. His ideas on the long term relationship between forming teachers and its socio-economic consequences are only reflected on his work. Some scholars assume that his first observations were a negative one, namely own 9-year period in the seminary.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 13 Having learnt the basicssome scholars claim that was aware of trends in education all over the world, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 113, which is probably correct when applied to his Chilean period during university studies, he kept reading; personally he neared the Gines de los Rios brothers. Later on he admitted influence of Torres, Rey, Bolívar, Ortega, Bartolomé, father Manjón, Ribera and Altamira,Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 77 which adds up to an amalgamate of innovators encompassing Escuelas del Ave María, technocrats, Liberals and heterodoxes from Institución Libre. Bardina rejected what he perceived as antiquated education system and strove to build a new one. Its objective was not to pass on knowledge, but to prepare for life within a system.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 111 The means was to reinvigorate and channel natural potential of students;Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 106 this in turn was to be achieved by focus on effort instead of result, on searching instead of absorbing, on satisfaction instead of awards/penalties and on co-operation instead of competition.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 106 The role of teachers was an apostolic one; to inspire and lead by example rather than to enforce and execute.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 106 School was to be a natural setting – hence the stress on Catalan as native tongue,Jiménez Serradilla, p. 16 excursions, hygiene, physical exercises,detailed discussion in Xavier Torrebadella Flix, La aportación bibliográfica de Joan Bardina a la Educación Física moderna (1911-1939), [in:] Cabás 9 (2013), pp. 1-22 experiments and interfacing with the non-scholarly realm in general;Jiménez Serradilla, p. 12 mixed-sex education and a social mixForés i Miravelles 1996, p. 180 were considered components of this natural realm. Catholic moral formation was an indispensable part of the curriculum;some scholars claim that his vision was based on religious neutrality, Jiménez Serradilla, p. 16 it was formatted in functional rather than transcendent termsthe stress was on common good, support and love for the neighbours, with Franciscan-flavor of enjoying beautiful world made by God, embodied in Jesus - a friend of children and fishermen, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 155-156 with stress on freedom of choice rather than obedience.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 251 academic education, Chile Though Bardina remained highly sympathetic towards ILE, his vision differed by stress on Christian values and role of the family.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 78 Also the Montessori school was charged with excessive “institucionalismo”, apart from issues related to mixing ages and inward- leaning perspective.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 108 Padre Manjón was suspected of excessive stress on rules and the followers of Spencer were criticized for chaotic “robinsonismo” in education;Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 112 a libertarian pedagogue Alexis Sluys found himself under particularly heavy fire for archaic concept, a clash perhaps related to Bardina's episode in Bolivia.Escola Normal Superior in La Paz, where Bardina commenced teaching, was organized along the lines advised by the Belgian legacy Currently Bardina is counted among scholars forming l’Escola Nova,Jiménez Serradilla, pp. 12-14 a common term applied retroactivelyhimself he spoke of “Educación Nueva”, Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 105 to a number of Catalan educators who commenced activity in the late 19th century and consolidated in the 1920s.for their 30 principles see Jiménez Serradilla, pp. 13-14 According to some, he was its “activista e impulsor”,Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 105 and l’Escola de Mestres “provided an extraordinary momentum which from the onset directed all pedagogical renewal in Catalonia”.Otilia Defis, Artur Martorell, l’home, Barcelona 1995, , p. 85. Reception and legacy Catalonia, 1920s During the period of 1904-1909 Bardina seemed a rising star of the Catalan education system; afterwards he remained sidetracked, to disappear entirely in 1917. Some scholars claim that schooling initiatives of Mancomunitat, launched in the 1910s and 1920s, were influenced by the Bardinian vision,his heritage is influencing the Catalan educational thought of the era but also spirit of the institutions ran by Mancomsunitat: Patronat d'Escoles, Consell de Pedagogia, Quaderns d’Estudi,and on his alumni, Jiménez Serradilla, p. 18 though they note also that he was merely one of many contributors to the ongoing change in education.apart from l’Escola Sant Jordi of Flos i Calcat, L’escola Horaciana of Pau Vila, Integral of Alban Rossell and a number of Mancomunitat initiatives, Jiménez Serradilla, pp. 12-14 The most visible sign of Bardina's presence in Spain in the 1920s and 1930s were countlessLa cocina casera was issued by the publishing house Hymsa at least 7 times editions of his anonymous manuals.the last one identified was published in 1940 In the local Valparaíso realm he gained recognition as a press pundit; his academic role earned Bardina appreciation among the disciples, though he is not noted as an influential figure among Chilean scholars of law. It is rather his commentaries on international politics, especially on the American continent, which were acknowledged in Chile and some other Latin American countries. In 1944 he first earned a biography in Diccionario Biográfico de Chile, to be dropped in subsequent editions published after his death.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 2, 12 Upon the news of Bardina's demise, in 1951 his former disciples and alumniJoan Gibert Camins, Alexandre Galí, Josep Agell, Ramon Sastre, Joan Llongueras, Miguel Fornaguera and others organized a homage in his native Sant Boi.Forés i Miravelles 1996, p. 276 Soon afterwards three of them started to collect data for his brief biography, which was published in 1959;Artur Martorell, Enric Cassasses, Josep Parunella, Joan Bardina I Castará.

A few streets in Catalonia, including the one where he was born, are named after him. Centre d’Estudis Joan Bardina, a 1984-founded Catalan think-tank promoting “a third way” within democracy between socialism and capitalism, chose him as their icon.founded in 1984 by Agustí Chalaux i de Subirà and Lluís Maria Xirinacs; its declared objectives are fighting “bribery, corruption, poverty, budget shortages and abuse of power”, see the official Institute website, available here Within a decisively hagiographic ambience, Bardina's pro-Francoist and pro-Nazi views are generally ignored.though not entirely, compare Precisiones sobre el ideario político, social y económico, an analysis by Estudis Bardina, available here In social history he is considered a typical case of transitional identity in-between Carlism and a peripheral nationalism.compare extensive passages in Canal 2005 Numerous self- devised manuals he published are barely notedexcept those dealing with physical education, see Torrebadella Flix 2013, pp. 10-18 and await evaluation. So far it remains unclear whether Bardina's textbooks on topics ranging from infantry tactics to grammar, self-defense, hygiene, savoir-vire and home-made confectionery are charlatanrya dilettante in many fields he wrote about, throughout all his life Bardina wrote as an expert; under a pen- name he wrote recommendations for another of his pen-names, and under this one to write prologues to works written also by himself, but under one more pen- name. At least some of his works contain entirely erroneous claims, compare his discussion on history of the Spanish national flag, written in 1936 for the Latin American audience, La Semana Internacional 24.10.36, available here or rather useful contributions to popular education.

Rodericus is known through a single ballade attributed to him in the Chantilly Codex as S Uciredor, which is \\"Rodericus\\" spelled backwards.Nors S. Josephson, \\"Rodericus\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd edition, 2001. The piece, Angelorum Psalat, is in two voices and is an exemplary work of the Ars subtilior style, with many similarities to works of Jacob Senleches. Angelorum Psalat exhibits considerable rhythmic complexityNors S. Josephson, \\"Rodericus: Angelorum Psalat\\". Musica Disciplina 25 (1971), pp. 113–126 (includes transcription). and its text employs contrasting imagery of original sin and the harmony of the spheres, a common poetic device of the age.M.C. Gómez, \\"Some Precursors of the Spanish Lute School\\". Early Music 20 (1992), pp. 583–593, at p. 585. Nothing is known of Rodericus's life, although Gilbert Reaney suggested that he is Rodrigo de la Guitarra, since Rodrigo is the only known contemporaneous musician with the same name.Gilbert Reaney, \\"The Manuscript Chantilly, Musee Conde 1047\\". Musica Disciplina 8 (1954), pp. 78–79. However, this Rodrigo appears in Toledo as late as 1458, which would have made him extraordinarily long-lived, even assuming he composed maturely from a young age. No other supporting evidence had arisen since Reaney's conjecture.Young, p. 6, footnote 5. Crawford Young suggested in 2008 that Rodericus is the musician and clergyman Johannes Rogerii.Crawford Young, \\"Antiphon of the Angels: Angelorum psalat tripudium\\". Recercare 20, No. 1/2 (2008), pp. 5–23 (includes a new transcription). pp. 13–14 about the identity of Rodericus Young argues that the author of Angelorum Psalat must have been an extremely well developed composer and musician. Rogerii is a plausible candidate, since his terms of service in various courts closely tracked with those of composers whose style resembles that developed in Angelorum Psalat. He preceded Jacob Senleches at the cardinal's court in Aragon and was contemporaneous or nearly so with composers such as Hasprois and Guido de Lange at the court of Pope Benedict XIII. Guido makes use of the semiminima very similarly to Rodericus. Young's main argument is the veiled reference to Pope Innocent VII, who appears in the last word of the ballade as \\"Innocui\\" (innocent) with an otherwise unmotivated first initial letter. In other sections of the ballade there are other letters \\"i\\" as initials, or an \\"in\\" aside from the meter of the poem, indicating that this \\"in\\" is a wild beast corrupting the unity of the world, or the papal world, since pope Benedict, for whom Rogerii worked, felt himself to be the true pope: \\"in retro mordens ut fera pessima\\" (in ...: retreat! biting wild horrible beast).Crawford Young, p. 7, footnote 13 Rogerii also named himself \\"Vatignies\\", apparently after a little northern French community until today (Wattignies),Ursula Günther, \\"Zur Biographie einiger Komponisten der Ars subtilior\\". Archiv für Musikwissenschaft 21 (1964), p. 188 footnote. in the close vicinity of either Senlecques or Salesches, where the composer Senleches may have come from. Senleches was the main reference point for the new signs for subtle note values used in \\"Angelorum psalat\\". In his later years, Rogerii was a distinguished member of the papal chapel, which he reentered in 1396 earning the commendation \\"omnes et singule exemptiones, immunitates, franchisie ac libertates capellanorum et familiarum\\" Ursula Günther, p. 188 footnote.

History The church foundation is probably medieval, but the current building was built around 1761 as a private chapel for Holbrook Hall. It was consecrated for use as the parish church for the village in 1835. It was rebuilt in 1842 by W. Evans of Allstree. In further alteration in 1887 it was re-seated by Mr Thompson of Derby for Sir William Evans, 1st Baronet. It was re-opened on 1 December 1887 by the Bishop of Southwell. After a disastrous fire on 27 January 1907 caused by a defective flue it was rebuilt by Naylor and Sale of Derby. They took this opportunity to add a new south aisle, which increased the seating by 75. The church before the fire had no chancel, but this was remedied. Three arches span the old nave, leaving the sanctuary in the centre with new traceried east window, and on one side an entrance with new porch, the other being the organ chamber. The chancel was floored with marble and Hopton stone. Messrs Walker and Slater were the general contractors. The carving in the chancel was done by R. Bridgman of Lichfield, and the altar provided by Wippell and Co of London. The altar hangings were made by Hawes and Son of Norwich. It reopened on 15 April 1908. A further restoration was undertaken when the church was closed for a few weeks in 1929.

Biography  Traverse in an Anishinaabe, specifically Ojibwe, from Winnipeg, Manitoba. She spent her early years with her biological father living in Winnipeg, MB. Her father encouraged her early interest in art, buying her art supplies. Her early life was difficult growing up in Winnipeg's North End when her mother died at a young age and her siblings were apprehended in the Sixties Scoop. Traverse draws inspiration in her art and activism from her experience growing up as an indigenous woman in one of Winnipeg's toughest neighbourhoods. She studied at the School of Fine Arts at the University of Manitoba and graduated in 2009. Traverse is currently working out of Winnipeg, MB.  Artwork  Traverse is known for her acrylic/oil paintings and stop-motion animated films that feature indigenous women, the sacred feminine, motherhood, urban indigenous lifestyle and traditional native american spiritual themes, including the seven traditional teachings of the Anishinaabe. She has also created artwork for schools in Winnipeg to inspire and educate youth on indigenous culture and traditions. Traverse has displayed her paintings at The Wah-Sa Gallery and The Winnipeg Art Gallery in Winnipeg, MB. In 2009, Coca-Cola announced the Aboriginal Art Bottle Program as part of a mission to showcase indigenous art at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Out of hundreds of submissions from professional and amateur indigenous artists from across Canada, fifteen sculptures were selected to be showcased across Canada and in Vancouver during the 2010 Winter Olympics.

It is the largest inland port in Saudi Arabia. The port is located on off Exit 16 in Al Malaz, adjacent to the Riyadh railway station. Riyadh Dry Port covers an area of 918,639 m2 and accommodates six 6,480 m2 warehouses. The port handled 250,000 TEU in 2003, and 500,000 TEU in 2013, recording an 18% growth from 2012. Riyadh Dry Port handled 26,000 TEU in May 2013, and 30,749 TEU in May 2014. On 5 June 2014, handled a record 987 containers in a single day.  History  Riyadh Dry Port was established in 1982. The port was initially operated by the Saudi Railways Organization (SRO), which also operates the cargo line and manages empty container yards in Dammam. SRO later decided to privatize the port's operations. BAAS International Group (BIG) won a 10-year contract to handle operations at Riyadh Dry Port in 2011. In May 2012, Musaid Al-Sayyari, the Head of the National Committee for Customs Clearance (NCCC) at the Council of Saudi Chambers of Commerce and Industry, stated that \\"poor operation of the dry port [had] caused enormous damage to the goods\\". Customs brokers filed complaints with the SRO regarding BIG's port operations, after the clearance of 7,000 goods faced disruptions over a 45-day period. On 3 April 2013, Navis announced that it had completed the deployment of the Navis SPARCS N4 terminal operating system (TOS) at the port. The port also installed SAP enterprise application software making Riyadh the fifth port in the world to run a combination of the SPARCS N4 V2.2, XPS and ECN4 NAVIS modules. In December 2016, customs authorities discovered nearly 5 kg of hashish hidden inside a consignment at the port.

Previously described as Avicularia avicularia variegata, it is synonymous with Avicularia bicegoi. When sold as pets, various English names have been associated with the scientific names of this species. As A. avicularia variegata, it has been called the grizzled pinktoe. As A. bicegoi, English names often refer to the red hairs on the abdomen of one colour form – Manaus brick-red rump tree spider, brick red pink toe. Taxonomy In 1896, Frederick O. Pickard-Cambridge described spiders he had observed during an expedition to the Amazon basin as the subspecies variegata of the species Avicularia avicularia. He based the distinction on variations in colour, particularly of the leg hairs (setae), considering them insufficient to justify separation into two species. In 2017, Caroline Fukushima and Rogério Bertani made a detailed study of the genus and concluded that there were other differences that did justify specific status. Avicularia variegata has legs I and IV of more-or-less the same length, Avicularia avicularia has the fourth leg more than 10% longer than the first leg, and in the female the spermathecae of A. variegata are wider in the middle whereas those of A. avicularia are as wide in the middle as at the base. In 1923, Cândido Firmino de Mello-Leitão described Avicularia bicegoi. Fukushima and Bertani considered this to be the same species as A. variegata.

The lease shares a boundary with Shaw Station. The property was established at some time prior to 1907 and was regarded as one of the smaller leases in the area. It was producing wool for export in 1908, and was stocked with a flock of 5,300 sheep in 1912. In 1913 the lease was held by Archie McGregor and Percy Charles Riches. The station occupied an area of and was not yet completely fenced. The flock was 10,000 sheep but it was estimated that the area could support 17,000. The owners were also breeding donkeys and mules which they thought would be useful for general station work and well repairing work.

He reached the rank of major-general. Early life He was the second son of Major- general Sir Henry Torrens and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Robert Patton, governor of St. Helena, born on 18 August 1809; he was a godson of the Duke of Wellington. In 1819 he was appointed a page of honour to the Prince Regent. Torrens passed through the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and obtained a commission as ensign in the Grenadier Guards, becoming lieutenant on 14 April 1825. He was appointed adjutant of the second battalion with the temporary rank of captain on 11 June 1829. He was promoted captain on 12 June 1830. He continued to serve as adjutant of his battalion until 1838, when he was appointed brigade-major at Quebec on the staff of Major-general Sir James Macdonell, commanding a brigade in Canada. He took part in the operations against the Lower Canada Rebellion at the close of that year. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 11 September 1840, when he returned to England. Royal Welch Fusiliers Torrens exchanged into the 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers, and obtained its command on 15 October 1841. On the expansion of the army in April 1842 a second battalion was given to the regiment. The depot was moved from Carlisle to Chichester, where, with two new companies, it was organised for foreign service under Torrens, who embarked with it at Portsmouth for Canada on 13 May, arriving at Montreal on 30 June. In September 1843 Torrens went, in command of the first battalion, from Quebec to the West Indies, arriving at Barbados in October 1843. The battalion was moved from one island to another, but for two years and a half Torrens commanded the troops in Saint Lucia and administered the civil government of the island. The sanitary measures adopted by Torrens for the preservation of the health of the troops were considered exemplary, and correspondence on the subject was published in November 1847 by order of the Duke of Wellington, as commander- in-chief. Torrens declined the offer of the lieutenant-governorship of Saint Lucia as a permanent appointment. He sailed with his battalion from Barbados in March 1847, arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia in the following month. The battalion returned to England in September 1848, and was stationed at Winchester, where, on 12 July 1849, Prince Albert presented it with new colours. In April 1850 Torrens moved with the battalion to Plymouth, and the following year relinquished the command. On 1 January 1853 he was appointed an assistant quartermaster-general at the Horse Guards, and became a member of a commission researching the military of France, Austria, and Prussia. Crimean War Memorial to Maj. Gen. Torrens by Carlo Marochetti at the St. Paul's Cathedral In the Crimean War, Torrens was nominated a brigadier-general to command an infantry brigade. He joined the 4th Infantry Division under Sir George Cathcart at Varna, just before its embarkation. He was at the head of his brigade both at the Battle of Alma and at the Battle of Balaklava, where he was engaged in support of the cavalry and lost some men in recapturing two redoubts. On the morning of 5 November 1854, at the Battle of Inkermann, under the direction of Cathcart, he attacked the left flank of the Russian forces, his horse falling under him, pierced by five bullets, and was praised by Cathcart just before his mortal wound. He was struck by a bullet that passed through his body, injured a lung, splintered a rib, and was found lodged in his greatcoat. Torrens was invalided home. He received the Crimea medal and clasp, the thanks of Parliament, was promoted to be a major-general for distinguished service in the field on 12 December 1854, and was made a knight commander of the Bath, military division. Death On 2 April 1855 Torrens was appointed deputy quartermaster-general at headquarters, and on 25 June the same year was sent as a major-general on the staff to Paris as British military commissioner; but his health broke down, and he died in Paris on 24 August 1855. He was buried in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise. Works Torrens published Notes on French Infantry and Memoranda on the Review of the Army in Paris at the Feast of Eagles in May 1852 (London, 1852). Family Torrens married in 1832 Maria Jane, youngest daughter of General Sir John Murray, 8th Baronet.

He launched the magazine upon his return to Italy from exile in Moscow. He also edited the magazine until his death in 1964. Rinascita, published on a monthly basis, was headquartered in Rome. It was an official organ of the Italian Communist Party (PCI). Rinascita was established to serve as an ideological guide for militants and to revive the Marxist movement. The magazine described the party as the one, which had the most comprehensive vision of the nation's interests. It attempted to make a connection between Gramsci and Stalin. From 1962 the magazine was published weekly. At the end of the 1980s Rinascita temporarily stopped publication due to low circulation figures. It was soon relaunched, but again ceased publication in March 1991. Alberto Asor Rosa was the last editor of the magazine.

Life The son of a vintner in Greyfriars, London, who was admitted to St. Paul's School, he was sent to Cadiz while still young, to be trained in commerce. He was captured on his return voyage by a Sallee rover, and enslaved in Morocco. After three years' captivity Lucas went to Gibraltar. Edward Cornwallis, Gibraltar's governor, sent him back to Morocco as a vice-consul. He spent 16 years there. In 1785 Lucas returned to England, and was appointed oriental interpreter at court. He undertook a journey in Africa for the Association for Promoting African Exploration, set up in 1788. He left England in August 1788 with the intention of crossing the desert from Tripoli to Fezzan, in what is now Libya. The plan was to collect information in Fezzan, and from traders, on the interior, and to return home by way of The Gambia or the Guinea coast. At the end of October 1788, Lucas landed at Tripoli, and was received by Ali I Pasha. A revolt on the intended route delayed his journey, but two sharifs offered him safe conduct. Lucas started off on a mule, in an armed company with 18 others persons, in February 1789. They reached the ruins of Lebida, and then within a week \\"Menrata\\" (apparently Mesurata, i.e. Misrata). Adverse conditions meant the journey planned by Lucas had to be scaled back. He obtained information from one of the sharifs, who had travelled as factor in the slave-trade for the king of Fezzan, by trading a copy of a map of Africa for accounts of Fezzan, the Bornou empire, and Nigritia. Lucas turned back ar Memoon on 20 March 1789, reaching Tripoli on 6 April, and England on 26 July. He was succeeded in his African Association position by Daniel Houghton, and became consul in Tripoli in 1793. Works Lucas's account of Africa was published in the Reports of the African Association.

Personal life and education  Born on 21 May 1946 in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen, Utzon spent her childhood in Hellebæk, Denmark. When she was 15, she moved with her family to Australia where her father, architect Jørn Utzon, was to embark on the construction of the Sydney Opera House. After attending classes in painting and sculpture at East Sydney Technical College in Sydney, Australia (1967–1969), she studied textile arts at Copenhagen's School of Arts and Crafts (1967–1970). When she was 19, after disputes over the opera house, she and her family left Australia at short notice in April 1966. Back in Denmark, she married the architect Alex Popov who had worked with her father in Australia. The couple had two children in the early 1970s, Naja and Mika. After an early divorce, the children mainly lived with Utzon in her Danish home. Artistic work San Jose Convention Center Utzon's early creations included brightly coloured textiles for Bagsværd Church (1975–1977). In the mid-1980s, she spent three years decorating the new Volvo headquarters in Göteborg, Sweden, with a 36-metre wall and a 16-metre tapestry. In 1988, she completed a large red, white and black mural at the San Jose Convention Center resembling a flock of birds in flight. She has since decorated walls in the library of the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural College in Frederiksberg, and has added ceramic reliefs to the Finger B extension of Copenhagen Airport. Her creations have also included costumes and scenery for the Royal Danish Ballet. Since the early 1990s, Utzon has been married to the blind French writer Hugues de Montalembert. The couple spend their time between Denmark, Paris and Cap Feliz, the house on the island of Mallorca Utzon inherited from her father.

It is a generalisation of the parallelogram law which in turn can be seen as generalisation of the Pythagorean theorem. Because of the latter the restatement of the Pythagorean theorem in terms of quadrilaterals is occasionally called the Euler–Pythagoras theorem.  Theorem and special cases  For a convex quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d, diagonals e and f, and g being the line segment connecting the midpoints of the two diagonals, the following equations holds: :a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=e^2+f^2+4g^2 If the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then the midpoints of the diagonals coincide so that the connecting line segment g has length 0. In addition the parallel sides are of equal length, hence Euler's theorem reduces to :2a^2+2b^2=e^2+f^2 which is the parallelogram law. If the quadrilateral is rectangle, then equation simplifies further since now the two diagonals are of equal length as well: :2a^2+2b^2=2e^2 Dividing by 2 yields the Euler–Pythagoras theorem: :a^2+b^2=e^2 In other words, in the case of a rectangle the relation of the quadrilateral's sides and its diagonals is described by the Pythagorean theorem.Lokenath Debnath: The Legacy of Leonhard Euler: A Tricentennial Tribute. World Scientific, 2010, , pp. 105–107  Alternative formulation and extensions  Euler's theorem with parallelogram Euler originally derived the theorem above as corollary from slightly different theorem that requires the introduction of an additional point, but provides more structural insight. For a given convex quadrilateral ABCD Euler introduced an additional point E such that ABED forms a parallelogram and then the following equality holds: :AB^2+BC^2+CD^2+AD^2=AC^2+BD^2+CE^2 The distance CE between the additional point E and the point C of the quadrilateral not being part of the parallelogram can be thought of measuring how much the quadrilateral deviates from a parallelogram and CE^2 is correction term that needs to be added to the original equation of the parallelogram law.Deanna Haunsperger, Stephen Kennedy: The Edge of the Universe: Celebrating Ten Years of Math Horizons. MAA, 2006, , pp. 137–139 M being the midpoint of AC yields tfrac{AC}{AM}=2. Since N is the midpoint of BD it is also the midpoint of AE, as AE and BD are both diagonals of the parallelogram ABED. This yields tfrac{AE}{AN}=2 and hence tfrac{AC}{AM}=tfrac{AE}{AN}. Therefore, it follows from the intercept theorem (and its converse) that CE and NM are parallel and CE^2=(2NM)^2=4NM^2, which yields Euler's theorem. Euler's theorem can be extended to a larger set of quadrilaterals, that includes crossed and nonplaner ones. It holds for so called generalized quadrilaterals, which simply consist of four arbitrary points in mathbb{R}^n connected by edges so that they form a cycle graph.Geoffrey A.

He was formerly the leader of a parody political party Sarmu probo nisi (SPN) formed in Mladenovac in 2016. His party participated in the 2016 local council election in the municipality of Mladenovac, winning 20 percent of the votes and 12 seats. He participated in the 2017 Serbian presidential election under his Preletačević persona, finishing third with 9.44% of the votes. In 2018, Maksimović left the \\"party\\". Name The surname \\"Preletačević\\" is a humorous pun. The word preletač (similar to \\"defector\\") is used in Serbian language for a politician who switches political parties for personal gains. The nickname \\"Beli\\" means \\"The white\\" in Serbian. Biography Maksimović was born in 1991 in Velika Ivanča, Mladenovac. He is a communicology student. =2016 local election= Sarmu probo nisi (SPN) started as a fictional political party created by a group of comedians from Mladenovac. They became popular after they filmed a humorous parody promotional video for their fictional leader \\"Ljubiša Preletačević Beli\\". After the video became popular on YouTube, they were persuaded by their followers to participate in the election. The group vowed to make a lot of false promises and false hope. The focal point of their campaign was the promise to open a euthanasia department for pensioners in the local hospital in order to spare the country of their expenses. Local council elections were held in the most municipalities and cities in Serbia on 24 April 2016, together with the 2016 parliamentary election. Maksimović and his followers formed a parody political party called Sarmu probo nisi (SPN) and participated in the local election in the Municipality of Mladenovac. Because SPN is not officially registered as political party, they participated as an independent list called \\"Beli - Samo jako\\" (Beli - Go hard!). This list surprisingly won 20% of the votes and 12 seats, becoming the second strongest group in the local council of Mladenovac, behind only the ruling Serbian Progressive Party. =2017 presidential election= Maksimović launched his campaign for the 2017 Serbian presidential election on 4 March 2017. He campaigns under his Preletačević persona with the political slogan \\"Samo jako!\\" (Go hard!). Saša Radulović, one of the Serbian parliamentary opposition leaders, supported his campaign, saying that his candidacy will contribute to the raise of the turnout in the first round of the elections, thus preventing the Prime Minister and ruling party presidential candidate Aleksandar Vučić from achieving more than 50 percent of the votes, and forcing the runoff; Maksimović also said that this is one of his main reasons for the candidacy. On 11 March 2017, Maksimović announced that he collected 10,000 signatures of support needed for candidacy. On 13 March, national Electoral Commission officially declared his candidacy for the presidency. Despite running as a joke candidate, he finished the election in the third place, winning 326,055 or 9.44% of the votes cast.  Platform  The Beli platform was entirely humorous and tongue-in-cheek. Some prominent campaign promises included building a Serbian coastline and constructing hills in Pancevo so that residents could sled in the wintertime. He would tell voters that he would offer \\"three times as much\\" as the other candidates. He noted that he supported universal employment, increased pensions for all people, and endorsed \\"uniting\\" the Balkans to become a superpower. =2018 local election= In early 2018, Maksimović announced that he will participate at the March 2018 local election for the Assembly of the City of Belgrade with new group of supporter, leaving Sarmu probo nisi (a.k.a. \\"Beli - samo jako\\" movement). Subsequently, the movement dissociated itself from Maksimović. At the March 2018 local election, Maskimović participated with an electoral list named \\"Ljubiša Preletačević Beli - Zato što volimo Belovgrad\\". Electoral commission refused to approve his list without permission from a person whose name is used (although there was no person with that name at that moment). After that, it was reported that that same day Maksimović's cousin Ognjen Maksimović legally changed his name to \\"Ljubiša Preletačević Beli\\" and gave written permission for his name to be used on the electoral list. After that, electoral commission approved the list. Some political commentators and opponents criticized this unusually quick name changing procedure and accused Maksimović for secretly working for the ruling party. Luka Maksimović dismissed those accusations and said that his cousin already filed a request for name change two weeks earlier.

They did identify the best of the short stories as, \\"Marcia Muller's bittersweet memoir of a young woman's abortive homecoming, Linda Grant's reunion of a daughter with her eccentric, threatened father, Susan Dunlap's deadpan account of a loony hostage-taking in Berkeley, Ed Gorman's spare, chilling tale of a boy whose father is maddened by a run of bad luck -- typically subordinate atmosphere to the exploration of (generally troubled) family ties.\\" And they noted the \\"least successful -- the undernourished whodunits by Dana Stabenow, Bill Crider, and Rex Burns, the postcard landscapes of Karen Kijewski and Bill Pronzini -- seem swallowed up by their settings; and the main interest of the tales by Carole Nelson Douglas and Stuart M.

Library Journal recommended this book and another anthology of stories by Western writers for library collections, for the different perspective of each book. One is Talking Up a Storm: Voices of the New West by Gregory L.

In sum, the 20 stories had \\"fictional landscapes here [that] range from the desolation, silence, and danger of Death Valley, and the small, dying towns of southern Colorado to the sophisticated originality and zaniness of Berkekey, California.\\" The two books together introduce a reader to Western literature.

He started his career playing as a flanker, but switched to the front row midway through his career and from then on played predominantly at hooker. Career =Beginnings= Norman learned his rugby at Medway Street School and was a school-boy international in 1911 captaining England to their first win over Wales. Norman served in the First World War with the Royal Artillery in Mesopotamia. =Leicester= Norman made his Leicester debut on 17 January 1920 at Welford Road against Headingley playing at flanker and scoring 3 conversions in a 54-11 win for Leicester. Norman featured a further eight times for the Tigers in the 1919/20 season scoring tries in away wins against Cardiff and Gloucester. Norman was then on a regular in the first team's back row starting over 30 games in six of next seven seasons. For the 1927/28 season Norman switched to the front row where he spent the second half of his career. Predominantly a hooker he also played games as a prop. Norman's finest achievement was captaining Leicestershire and the East Midlands to victory over the touring South Africans the Springbokson 14 November 1931, the only defeat the side suffered on their tour. That performance earned him an England Test debut against the same opposition on 2 January 1932 at Twickenham. He also played two weeks later against Wales at St. Helen's in Swansea. England however lost both and Norman did not represent his country again. =Final season and retirement= The 1932/33 season was Norman's last and for it he was appointed as Leicester's captain. Unfortunately he was injured in the second game of the season against Old Blues, where he was substituted for the only time, and missed the next seven games. He returned to the side in October against Gloucester and played 24 games that the season. His final match for the Tigers was an 8-15 loss on Tuesday 18 April 1933 against Bath at The Recreation Ground. Norman's 453 games place him fourth all time for most appearances, against Bath in on 5 September 1931 he became only the second player to play 400 games for the club. During the Second World War he was a member of the home guard and organised the Leicester Harlequins side, which became the base for the re-formed Tigers in 1945. He was president of Leicester Tigers between 1965 and 1968.

Chave Collisson, was an activist in Australia and Great Britain for several feminist causes. History Collisson was born in America the elder daughter of Rev. Reginald Kingsmill Collisson (1857 – 5 August 1932) and his Irish-born wife Katherine (or Catherine) Elizabeth Collisson, née Gamble (1862 – 28 December 1944). The Rev. R. K. Collisson was born in London; his father was an Anglican clergyman, as were his three brothers. He served the Church in England for ten years; four years in America; the remainder of his 51 years' service was spent in Tasmania and South Australia. His last and longest charge was the Church of the Epiphany, Crafers, where many of Adelaide's leading lights were married. Their other daughter Nora Winifred Collisson (died 1963) was headmistress of Lowther Hall Church of England Grammar School for Girls, and author of The Warrior and a play To the Day. Chave Collisson was educated at home, the Collegiate School, Hobart, and Sydney University, where she was elected one of the first directors of the newly founded Women's Club and the first secretary of University of Sydney Women's Union. She spent a year on the staff of the University as Assistant to the Director of Tutorial Classes and Lecturer in History. She was active in the Workers' Educational Association and a proponent of further education for women, so they could take a leading place as workers and citizens. In 1919 Collisson earned her MA from Columbia University in New York. During The Great War she was an effective organiser for the Red Cross Society among university students. She strongly supported the push for conscription, often appearing on the same platform as the NSW Premier, W. A. Holman, and insisted that soldiers should not be returned to Australian society until they were physically and mentally fit. One brother was killed in the War, and the other seriously injured.Donald Marsden Collisson, (c. 1 September 1889 – 13 January 1954) schoolmaster at Guildford Grammar School, enlisted on 1 May 1916; discharged with severe head injury 13 June 1918. He married Kate Bridgman ( – 3 April 1954), of Queen Alexandra Imperial Nursing Service and daughter of Fred Bridgman, general manager of the Adelaide Steamship Company c. January 1934. Frederick Norman Collisson (c. 21 November 1893 – 1 October 1916), station hand, enlisted 21 July 1915; killed in action, Belgium on 1 October 1916. On his enlistment form spelled mother's name \\"Catherine\\". Collison was an ardent monarchist: in 1924 she was presented to Queen Mary, who remembered Rev. Collisson fondly. In 1925 she was appointed secretary of the British Commonwealth League, an offshoot of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. She was, with Bessie Rischbieth, a founder of the Women's Non-party Political Association. She represented the Australian Equal Citizenship Federation at the International Woman Suffrage Alliance summit in Paris in 1926. She was the organiser of Maude Royden's tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1928 and her companion throughout the tour. She was a delegate to the International Women's Congress in Berlin in June 1929. While continuing to represent Australian feminists, Collisson spent most of her life in London, living in hotels, and in later years, the Nightingale House care home, Twickenham.

It is the sequel to Fire and Forget, which was developed by Titus France SA for a number of platforms including the ZX Spectrum. Fire & Forget II is one of a number of similar games which emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the wake of Sega's popular arcade driving game Out Run (1986). It is notable for the variety of its enemy sprites, and for its use of parallax scrolling. It is also notable for being one of the first video games to be launched simultaneously on two consoles.Mean Machines, Issue 2, November 1990  Gameplay  The object of the game is to prevent a convoy of vehicles from reaching the city of Megapolis where a terrorist attack has been planned against the 3rd International Conference for Peace.Sega, Fire & Forget II Instruction manual, pp.4-6 Taking control of a weaponised flying car named the Thunder Master II in pursuit of this goal, the player is presented with a combination of racing, flying and shoot 'em up gameplay elements. The player must navigate the road to Megapolis at high speed, working their way up the convoy and destroying a wide array of opponents, ranging from armed motorcycles, cars and jeeps, to road-side cannons, bomber aircraft and robotic walkers.Sega, Fire & Forget II Instruction manual, pp.14-34 The ultimate aim is to reach and to disable the lead vehicle which is equipped with a nuclear weapon of mass destruction called the 'Life Thirsty'.Sega, Fire & Forget II Instruction manual, pp.6, 34 Despite a notable variety of enemies, the player has a limited range of abilities and power-ups available to them. The Thunder Master II vehicle is equipped with only two weapons: the basic 'ionic phaser' gun (activated with Button 1), and missiles (activated with Buttons 1 and 2 together).Sega, Fire & Forget II Instruction manual, p.10 The player must keep the Thunder Master II fuelled by making contact with cans placed in the road: blue cans contain fuel which allow the vehicle to continue driving on the highway, and red cans contain kerosene which permit the vehicle to fly.Sega, Fire & Forget II Instruction manual, p.12 The two types of fuel are indicated by two separate fuel gauges.Sega, Fire & Forget II Instruction manual, p.36 The in-game user interface displays the player's score as well as written messages, such as an indication of when the Thunder Master II is ready for take-off.Sega, Fire & Forget II Instruction manual, p.36  Reception  The Master System version was well received. The reviewers at Mean Machines magazine praised the smoothness, the speed and the level of difficulty, and preferred the game to similar titles such as Battle Out Run and Chase H.Q. One reviewer described it as \\"a must for addicts of highway violence\\".Mean Machines, Issue 2, November 1990 Mean Machines awarded the Master System version an overall score of 82%. The GX4000 version fared less well: the Mean Machines reviewers expressed surprise at the poverty of its graphics and gameplay in contrast to the Master System version. One reviewer stated: \\"The scrolling is jerky, the car moves and responds like a badly crippled slug, the road update is juddery and unconvincing, and most of the sprites look like marauding blue cabbages\\", concluding that playing the game was like having one's teeth pulled out.Mean Machines, Issue 2, November 1990 Mean Machines awarded the GX4000 version an overall score of 33%.

Life Born in Edinburgh on 17 May 1736, he was the son of Alexander Lind of Gorgie, and nephew of George Lind the Edinburgh Member of Parliament, the sons of George Lind of Gorgie. He was the first cousin of James Lind (1716–1794) the naval physician, whose father James Lind was the brother of George Lind of Gorgie. He was also first cousin to James Keir.Barbara M. D. Smith and J. L. Moilliet, James Keir of the Lunar Society, Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London Vol. 22, No. 1/2 (Sep. 1967), pp. 144–154, at p. 144. Published by: Royal Society. His mother Helen was daughter of George Allardice, Member of Parliament. He studied Medicine at Edinburgh University and graduated in 1765. In 1766, he then joined the East India Company as surgeon and sailed to China. In 1768 he received his doctorate (MD). On 6 November 1770 he was admitted a Fellow of the College of Physicians, Edinburgh. Lind accompanied Joseph Banks on his voyage to Iceland, the expedition setting sail 12 July 1772. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London 18 December 1777. Around the same time he seems to have settled at Windsor, where he later became physician to the royal household. When the coffin of Edward IV was opened and examined at Windsor in 1789, he made an analysis of the liquid found in it. He kept up a correspondence with Banks, and with Tiberio Cavallo.Christopher Goulding, The Real Professor Frankenstein?, J. R. Med. Soc. 2002; 95, 257–259, at p. 258 (PDF) He corresponded with Patrick Wilson about William Herschel's work.Christopher Goulding, Shelley's Cosmological Sublime: William Herschel, James Lind and \\"The Multitudinous Orb\\", The Review of English Studies New Series, Vol. 57, No. 232 (Nov. 2006), pp. 783–792, at p. 788. Published by: Oxford University Press. Charles Burney described Lind as extremely thin, and in her Diary Fanny Burney mentioned his wife as \\"about six times as big\\". She also cast doubt whether he obtained much of a private practice: \\"people were afraid of his trying experiments with their constitutions, and thought him a better conjuror than a physician\\". Lind died at the house of his son-in-law, William Burnie, in Russell Square, London, on 17 October 1812. Freemasonry Lind was a Scottish Freemason. He was Initiated in Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No. 2, on 2 August 1758. He was also active in the affairs of the Grand Lodge of Scotland and was Senior Grand Warden 1769-1771.History of the Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No. 2, compiled from the records 1677-1888. By Alan MacKenzie. 1888. P.242. In literature Lind was alluded to by Percy Bysshe Shelley in two poems from 1817, the old man who rescues Laon in The Revolt of Islam, and Prince Athanase, where he appears as the magus Zonoras. Shelley, in his final two years at Eton College, had Lind as a mentor, around 1809. He is also thought to be the source for the character of the blind old man De Lacey and galvanism in the novel Frankenstein, as applied by the eponymous Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Works Lind's inaugural dissertation, De Febre Remittente Putrida Paludum quæ grassabatur in Bengalia A.D. 1762, was published at Edinburgh in 1768. In 1772 he produced a translation, Treatise on the Fever of 1762 at Bengal. In three papers for the Royal Society, Lind discussed: the 1769 transit of Venus observed at Hawkhill, near Edinburgh; an eclipse of the moon, same place and year, with remarks by Nevil Maskelyne; and in 1775 a portable wind gauge. He gave Thomas Pennant a map of Islay, and a measurement of its longitude. At his private press at Windsor, Lind printed The Genealogy of the Families of Lind and the Montgomeries of Smithson, by Sir Robert Douglas, 6th Baronet. He produced pamphlets, and experimented with typography. Family Lind's wife was Ann Elizabeth Mealy. Their daughter Dorothy Sophia Banks Lind married Isaac Gosset (1782–1855); and was mother of Helen Dorothea or Dorothy Gosset, who married William Driscoll Gosset. Their daughter Anne Lind married William Burnie in 1806. There was a third daughter, Lucy Maria, and a son Alexander. Lucy, the eldest, married Markham Eeles Sherwill, and they had three sons (Markham Eeles, Walter Stanhope and James) and five daughters (Ariana Maria, Julia Sophia, Lucy Maria, Anne Elizabeth and Helen Matilda).

United States, 541 U.S. 176 (2004), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided sand and gravel are not \\"valuable minerals\\" reserved to the United States Government under the Pittman Underground Water Act of 1919. The Court sided in a 6–3 decision with the petitioner, BedRoc Limited, and reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court. BedRoc Limited had removed sand and gravel from lands obtained under the Pittman Act, and the United States, the respondent, argued those were reserved to the U.S. Government under that law. William Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, that relied on a textualist approach, and was joined by three justices. He argued sand and gravel were not considered \\"valuable minerals\\" in Nevada when the Pittman Act was passed in 1919. A concurring opinion was written by Clarence Thomas, and joined by another justice. Two justices joined John P. Stevens' dissenting opinion, that relied on legislative history and a previous decision of the Supreme Court.  Background  In 1940, Newton and Mabel Butler patented of land under the Pittman Underground Water Act (). The land was situated in Lincoln County, Nevada, north of Las Vegas. A tenant started extracting sand and gravel in the early 1990s. The land was sold to Earl Williams in 1993, and he continued to remove sand and gravel from the land. That same year, Williams received two trespass notices from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), that argued he was removing mineral materials from public lands. Williams challenged the notices, but the BLM ruled that the government held a reservation to the \\"valuable minerals\\" on the land.. In 1995, BedRoc Limited, LLC bought the land, and continued to remove sand and gravel under an interim agreement with the Department of the Interior. Under the agreement, BedRoc Limited had to place money in escrow from the sale of each cubic yard of sand and gravel that the company removed, pending a final resolution. A year later, BedRoc Limited transferred of the land to Western Elite, Inc. The Interior Board of Land Appeals upheld the decision by the BLM in 1997, relying on the legislative history of the Pittman Act and on Congress' intent. Subsequently, BedRoc Limited filed an action to quiet title in the United States District Court of Nevada. BedRoc Limited demanded ownership of the sand and gravel, while the American government asked for trespass damages. On May 24, 1999, Justice Philip Martin Pro of the Court decided that sand and gravel were \\"valuable minerals\\" reserved to the American government under the Pittman Act. The Court asked itself whether sand and gravel were minerals, whether they were valuable, and whether the \\"nonmineral\\" certification of the Pittman Act had any influence. The Court argued sand and gravel were minerals, and decided they were valuable under the Pittman Act based on Congress' intent and on debates. Besides, the Court argued lands containing minerals could be classified as nonmineral. BedRoc Limited appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court, and Western Elite was added as a plaintiff. The three-judge panel consisting of Judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Susan P. Graber, and Richard C. Tallman argued on November 7, 2002, and affirmed the decision by the District Court. The opinion was written by Graber. After concluding the language of the Pittman Act itself was ambiguous, the Court deserted to the purpose of the law and to the legislative history. The Ninth Circuit Court decided sand and gravel were \\"valuable minerals\\" reserved to the United States, because there was a market for sand and gravel when the Pittman Act was enacted, and because Congress intended the reservation of the Pittman Act to be the same as the mineral reservation of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act. The Court said \\"the mineral reservation [was] to be read broadly in the light of the agricultural purpose [of the law]\\". BedRoc argued a site-specific analysis had to be used to determine whether sand and gravel were valuable, but the Court disagreed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on September 30, 2003, and the oral argument occurred on January 20 of the following year. During the argument, BedRoc Limited was represented by R. Timothy McCrum, while the United States Government was represented by Thomas L. Sansonetti. All justices asked questions or made remarks except for Clarence Thomas.  Legal background  The patent to the land was granted under the Pittman Underground Water Act, that went into effect in 1919. Under that law, the Secretary of the Interior could grant patents to people who established a water supply. It only applied to Nevada. The eighth section of the Pittman Act stated that each patent contained \\"a reservation to the United States of all the coal and other valuable minerals in the lands\\" and the right for the government to \\"prospect for, mine and remove the same\\" under the laws in force during a disposal of the minerals.BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 179. The Supreme Court cited Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., a 1983 Supreme Court decision, in which the Court interpreted the mineral reservation of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (SRHA), that was enacted in 1916. The Supreme Court decided gravel was a mineral reserved to the government under the SRHA. The Court looked at whether gravel was part of the surface estate, which belongs to the patentee, or to the mineral estate, which belongs to the government. It decided substances are reserved to the government when they are mineral in character, can be removed from the soil, can be used for commercial purposes, and when there is no reason for the substance to be included in the surface estate. The mineral reservation of the SRHA differs from the one of the Pittman Act, as the SRHA does not include the word \\"valuable\\".BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 181.  Opinion of the court  The Court decided on March 31, 2004, and delivered three opinions. The majority opinion was supported by four justices, the concurring opinion by two, and the dissenting opinion by three. The majority argued sand and gravel were not valuable when the law was passed in 1919 according to common sense, while the dissenting opinion said the emphasis on the word \\"valuable\\" was unjust, and said it was Congress' intent to include sand and gravel in the reservation. The concurring opinion acknowledged the emphasis on valuable was unjust, while saying the word \\"mineral\\" itself includes the requirement of commercial purpose as was decided in Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. = Majority opinion = Chief Justice William Rehnquist The majority opinion was written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, and Anthony Kennedy. Adopting a textualist approach, the majority held that sand and gravel were not \\"valuable minerals\\" reserved to the government. The Court said it would not extend its decision in Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. to say that sand and gravel are valuable minerals. According to the majority, the Court had to focus on the meaning of the law when it was enacted, and it asked itself \\"whether the sand and gravel found in Nevada were commonly regarded as \\"valuable minerals\\" in 1919\\". According to the majority, common sense said no, as sand and gravel were abundant, had no intrinsic value, and were commercially worthless in Nevada in 1919. The Court said sand and gravel could not be mistaken for \\"valuable minerals\\" no matter if they would be regarded as minerals.BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 177. Furthermore, the Pittman Underground Water Act stated the disposal had to happen \\"in accordance with the provisions of the coal and mineral land laws in force at the time of such disposal\\". The Court said Congress was referring to the General Mining Act of 1872, that stated \\"all valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the United States\\" were \\"free and open to exploration and purchase\\". The majority said it was undeniable that \\"common sand and gravel could not constitute a locatable \\"valuable mineral deposit\\" under the General Mining Act\\".BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 186. The majority did not consider the legislative history as it did in Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., as the Pittman Act explicitly used the word \\"valuable\\" in contrast to the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (SRHA). Because of the absence of the word \\"valuable\\" in the SRHA, the Court had to speculate about Congress' intent in Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. Furthermore, by deciding in favor of the plaintiff, the Court left its principle that \\"land grants are construed favorably to the Government... and if there are doubts they are reserved for the Government, not against it\\", which it called an \\"established rule\\" in Wat v. Western Nuclear, Inc. Justice Clarence Thomas = Concurring opinion = Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion, that was joined by Justice Stephen Breyer.BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 187-89 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment). Thomas agreed with the dissenting opinion that no distinction could be made between the mineral reservation in the Pittman Underground Water Act and in the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (SRHA). He, however, argued that sand and gravel are not part of the mineral reservations of both laws, disagreeing with Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. Thomas argued the emphasis the majority lays on the word \\"valuable\\" was unjust, as the Pittman Act uses \\"valuable minerals\\" and \\"minerals\\" interchangeably. Thomas said both phrases therefore were meant as synonymous. Moreover, Thomas said if \\"valuable\\" was the source of the requirement that the minerals should have commercial worth, that would be inconsistent with Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., because that decision said that a substance was a mineral when it could be used for commercial purposes. Thomas, in his opinion, disagreed with the conclusion of Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. He did not agree that sand and gravel are minerals under the SRHA only because, hypothetically, \\"they could have been used for commercial purposes,\\" when the SRHA was passed. Thomas agreed with the majority opinion that according to common sense and the statutory context sand and gravel could not be used for commercial purposes, when the Pittman Act was passed in 1919. Thomas wrote in his opinion that he did not advocate overruling Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. despite disagreeing with the decision.BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 189 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment). = Dissenting opinion = John P. Stevens Justice John P. Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion, that was joined by Justices David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 190-92 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Stevens said the majority opinion depended entirely on the word \\"valuable\\", and he rejected this emphasis. He said the reservation of the Pittman Underground Water Act was meant to be the same as that of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (SRHA).BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 191-92 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Stevens called it highly unlikely that Congress meant to make a distinction between the reservation of the Pittman Act and the one of the SRHA, as it would be illogical that Congress would have wanted a reservation to the sand and gravel in lands covered by the SRHA, but not to the sand and gravel in lands covered by the Pittman Act. Besides, Stevens referred to a House Committee Report which said section 8 of the Pittman Act contained the same reservation of minerals as the SRHA. Stevens criticized the majority opinion for ignoring the fact that Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. already stated that a substance must be valuable to be a mineral. Moreover, he said \\"valuable minerals\\" and \\"minerals\\" were meant to be synonymous, as the Pittman Act contains the phrase \\"valuable minerals\\" twice and the words \\"minerals\\" and \\"mineral\\" without the word \\"valuable\\" eight times. Stevens did not rule out the possibility that the majority opinion in Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. misinterpreted Congress' intention, but he said there was no reason to choose another assessment of the Congress' intention over the old one. Stevens criticized the majority opinion for not using legislative history in order to find the Congress' original intent, which could result into decisions based on personal preference.BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 192 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The majority argued looking at the legislative history was unnecessary because of the clear language of the Pittman Act.

Specimens from the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Rondônia have regularly been misidentified as Avicularia juruensis. One difference is the vivid yellow rings on the legs of A. rufa compared to the paler rings of A. juruensis. Description Mature individuals have brown carapaces with short golden hairs (setae) with a slight purple sheen. Females have abdomens with long greyish brown hairs on the front of the upper (dorsal) surface and the sides; males have these longer hairs evenly distributed. Both sexes have legs and palps with short brown hairs with a pink sheen and long brown hairs with darker bases and a whitish apex. The femora, tibiae and metatarsi of the legs have vivid yellow rings on the ends furthest from the body. Taxonomy Avicularia rufa was first described in 1945 by Schiapelli and Gerschman. Specimens from the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Rondônia have been consistently misidentified as Avicularia juruensis. This area is south of the range in which A. jurensis is considered to occur. Apart from differences in the male and female genitalia, A. rufa has bright yellow leg rings, hairs (setae) with a whitish apex on the legs, and leg I shorter than leg IV, whereas A. juruensis has paler yellow leg rings, leg hairs more uniformly coloured, and legs I and IV more-or-less equal in length. Venom The neurotoxic venom of Avicularia rufa (misidentified as A. juruensis) has been analysed for potential as an antimicrobial. 11 antimicrobial peptides were found, one of which (named juruin on the assumption that the species was A. juruensis) showed strong activity against fungi. The active components of the venom closely resembled those of other theraphosid spiders, such as Haplopelma schmidti.

The community was previously known as Riley.  History  Advertised as an “ideal and natural orange land,” a post office was established at what was then Riley on October 12, 1894. The community was named for one of its earliest property owners and first postmaster, William O’Riley. That same year, a church established by O'Riley was built in Riley and named Bethany Missionary Baptist Church. A school was also opened and was called Bethany School. By 1897, the Riley community was home to 14 households. As the citrus industry in the area grew, new nearby communities such as Waterbury and Oak Knoll were developed. The Riley Post Office was discontinued on April 7, 1914 in favor of delivery at the newly established Oak Knoll post office. After the post office closed and there was no official reason to refer to the area as Riley, it quickly became known by Bethany in reference to the community's school and church.

She showed good form as a juvenile in 2011, winning the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot and a valuable sales race at Newmarket Racecourse as well as being placed in the May Hill Stakes and the Fillies' Mile. In the following year she recorded an upset win in the Irish 1,000 Guineas before being sent to race in North America where she won the Garden City Stakes. She remained in training as a four-year-old and won stakes races at Belmont Park and Saratoga. Background Samitar is a bay filly with no white markings bred in England by the Wiltshire-based Norman Court Stud. As a yearling she was consigned to the Tattersalls sale in October 2010 and was bought for 39,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Gill Richardson. She entered the ownership of Nick & Olga Dhandsa and John & Zoe Webster and was sent into training with Mick Channon at West Ilsley in Berkshire. Samitar was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Rock of Gibraltar who won seven Group 1 races in a row, including the 2000 Guineas. He has gone on to sire a number of other top racehorses, including Society Rock, Eagle Mountain, Varenar (Prix de la Forêt) and Mount Nelson. Samitar's dam Aileen's Gift was unraced but produced several other winners including the Albany Stakes winner Nijoom Dubai. She was a granddaughter of Optimistic Lass, who won the Nassau Stakes in 1984 and was the female-line ancestor of Golden Opinion, My Dream Boat and Alice Springs. Racing career =2011: two-year-old season= Samitar was ride in her first five races by Jamie Spencer. She made her debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 27 May in which she started at odds of 8/1 and finished third of the twelve runners behind Regal Realm. Despite her defeat she was stepped up in class for the Group Three Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot on 17 June and started a 16/1 outsider in a thirteen-runner field headed by the Fillies' Sprint Stakes winner Teolane. After being restrained by Spencer in the early stages she was switched to the left approaching the final furlong, took the lead in the closing stages and won by three quarters of a length from Inetrobil. After the race Channon said \\"I believed in this filly and this was the plan... The 1,000 Guineas is so far away, but she's a nice filly. I will give her a break and probably bring her back for the backend\\". After a break of over two months Samitar returned in the Tattersalls Millions Median Auction Stakes at Newmarket on 27 August ain which she started the 11/10 favourite but was beaten a short head by the colt Mehdi to whom she was conceding one pound in weight. Two weeks later the filly was stepped up in class and distance for the Group Two May Hill Stakes over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse and finished strongly to take third place behind Lyric of Light and Fallen For You. Samitar faced Lyric of Light and Fallen For You again in the Group One Fillies' Mile at Mewmarket on 23 September. After leading for most of the way ahe was challenged by Lyric of Light and was beaten a head into second place after a sustained struggle over the final furlong. On her final appearance of the season she started the 5/4 favourite for the Tattersalls Millions 2yo Fillies' Trophy (a race for horses sold at Tattersalls) over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 1 October. Ridden by Sam Hitchcott, she tracked the leaders, took the lead approaching the final furlong and stayed on well to win by one and a quarter lengths from Hazel Lavery. =2012: three-year-old season= In early 2012 Samitar was bought privately by Martin S. Schwartz. She began her second season by finishing unplaced in another Tattersalls sales race over six furlongs at Newmarket on 18 April and was then sent to France for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which she finished ninth of the thirteen runners behind Beauty Parlour. On 27 May at the Curragh, Samitar was one of eight fillies to contest the Irish 1000 Guineas in which she was ridden by Martin Harley and started at odds of 12/1. Homecoming Queen (horse) started favourite after a nine-length win in the 1000 Guineas while the other runners included La Collina (Phoenix Stakes) and Yellow Rosebud (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial). After racing in third place behind Homecoming Queen, Samitar took the lead approaching the final furlong and stayed on well to win by one and a half lengths from the 33/1 outsider Ishvana. Her victory gave both her trainer and her jockey their first classic race success. After the race Harley said \\"It was a big opportunity to be given my first ride in a Classic. The boss has given me a lot of chances and to give me a ride like this in a Classic is unbelievable. She travelled like the winner the whole way\\". Explaining the filly's poor form in her last two starts Channon said \\"She didn't run badly [in France] but she made the running and she should have been held up. It was my fault for running her in a sales race at Newmarket before that, I was trying to be clever dropping her back to six furlongs. She needed some decent ground and she's got it now\\". On her next appearance Samitar started the 9/2 third favourite for the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. After disputing second place for mot of the way he was outpaced in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Fallen For You. She was then sent to the United States for the Grade II Lake George Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Saratoga Race Course on 25 July and finished a close third, beaten a neck and a head by Centre Court and Better Lucky. Following the race she was moved permanently to the United States where she was trained by Chad Brown. On 15 September, Samitar, ridden by Ramon Domínguez, started odds-on favourite for the Grade I Garden City Stakes over nine furlongs at Belmont Park. Her rivals included Karlovy Vary (Ashland Stakes), Tannery (Kilboy Estate Stakes) and Somali Lemonade. Karlovy Vary went to the front and set a steady pace with Samitar settled in fourth place. amitar was switched to the outside entering the straight, took the lead inside the final furlong and held off the late challenge of Somali Lemonade to win by a head. After the race Brown said \\"She had been training great and blended into our program nicely. She came to me in good shape to begin with. I was happy to see her get a mile and an eighth. That was my one reservation, watching her train and in her races. She has the quality to do it, but I needed to see it, and I saw it today, which is great. Ramon rode a terrific race\\". She ended her season in the Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup Stakes at Keeneland Racecourse on 13 October in which she finished strongly to take fourth place behind Dayatthespa. =2013: four-year- old season= In the spring of 2013 Samitar finished second to Centre Court in both the Honey Fox Handicap at Gulfstream Park and the Jenny Wiley Stakes before running fourth behind her stablemate Pianist when favourite for the Gallorette Handicap at Pimlico Race Course. In the Fairy Garden Stakes at Belmont Park on 4 July she was ridden by Javier Castellano and recorded her first success of the year as she prevailed by one and a quarter lengths from Baffle Me.

It is the only extant species in the genus Notopus. Description Notopus dorsipes has a carapace which is broadened anteriorly and regularly convex from side to side with no median dorsal carina. There is a transverse ridge of small spines between the larger antero-lateral spines on an otherwise smooth surface. The front border of the orbit is less than half the width of carapace at its widest point and has five fronto-orbital spines. The antero-lateral borders have a single spine. The thin eye stalk folds backwards and downwards obliquely. The dorsal border of the cheliped palm lacks spines. The fifth pereiopod, is slightly smaller compared to the preceding pereiopods. The pereiopods are fringed with long, thin bristles with a broad dactylus and a flattened merus and carpus. The carapace length is up to 25mm. The carapace is coloured bright reddish-brown with white mottling and there is a pair of obvious spots on either side of the carapace near the middle. Distribution Notopus dorsipes is found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans from the Red Sea and eastern Africa to Japan to the Great Barrier Reef, although there are few records from the Sunda Shelf region in south-east Asia. It was recorded in the Mediterranean for the first time in 1964 off Israel and off the Egyptian coast in 2000 and 2016. The species is now most likely established in the Mediterranean and the probable route of colonisation was from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal, i.e. Lessepsian migration. Biology Notopus dorsipes is a burrowing animal of shallow seas with sandy substrates. To burrow it lifts the anterior end of its body using the chelipeds digging backwards at an angle. The chelipeds are used to push the animal backwards while burrowing. The burrowing is quick, the flattened and spade-like dactylus of the periopods is used to burrow, and the crab can bury itself completely in the sand in a matter of seconds.

It is located between the squares Plaza de Independencia and Plaza de los Coches. The name \\"Puerta del Reloj\\" responds to the clock with which it was crowned at the beginning of the 18th century. While the name of Boca del Puente is due to the fact that during the colonial period, a drawbridge was raised at the foot of the channel of San Anastasio, which linked the walled city to the legendary Getsemaní neighborhood. In addition the bridge served like defense of the city, since in case of enemy attack, this one was raised to prevent the access of buccaneers and pirates. Also the gate was protected by the bastions of San Pedro Apóstol (now disappeared) and the one of San Juan Bautista. It has a Postclassic style in its facade, precursory of those that advocated the treaties on fortification of second half of 18th century. The Puerta del Reloj is the work of the military engineer Juan de Herrera y Sotomayor, founder of the Cartagena Academy, and its style recalls the facade of the main church of the Monasterio de San Francisco in the Colonial City of Santo Domingo. In fact both gates present a half-point Roman arch, flanked by two pairs of Tuscan columns, and the same entablature with a frieze decorated with triglyphs. For the connoisseurs, this gate is one of the most successful works of the Spanish- American Fortification School and possibly one of the best preserved in the New World, as it strictly complies with the opinions of the Vauban school. Among the locals this gate is known as Boca del Puente, but for non-natives of Cartagena it is simply the Puerta del Reloj. History This building has witnessed the great physical and social changes that the city has suffered for more than five centuries; Being in its origins, the entrance of the city, to be considered today as a tourist site of great historical value, which is no longer visited by slave merchants, but by people from all over the world. Starting in 1704, Herrara undertook the repair of the 1631 \\"Puerta del Puente\\" or Gate of the Bridge, which overlooked a wooden bridge dating from 1540. This was a wooden viaduct that passed over the Cano de San Anastasio, a seawater rivulet separating the island of Getsemaní from the island of Calamarí. This 1631 main gate of the city from when the walled enclosure was complete, was partially destroyed by Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis. In the 1704 repair, Juan Herrera y Sotomayor added the Baroque portal and the four Tuscan columns that adorn it, adding also, two side bombproof vaults for the storage of food and ammunition. In 1874, a clock was placed in that lodging that was brought from the United States, and after 63 years it was replaced by the present, imported from Switzerland, being transferred the first to the Templo de Torices, in the city.

Epstein. The script, style, and look are heavily influenced by 1970s Euro lesbian vampire films. The film is distributed in North America on VOD and DVD/blu-ray by Launch Over and VHS by SRS Media. Description Chris Hallock of the Boston Underground Film Festival, where the film had its world premiere on March 27, 2016, calls it, \\"a love letter to offbeat lesbian vampire films that offers powerful discourse on self-identity, feminism, and the violence wrought from religious dogma.\\" The film is notable for reversing the typical structure and focus of lesbian vampire films, with ambush bug of Ain't it Cool News noting, \\"The lesbian vampire is not new in the realm of horror, but whereas in the past, male filmmakers did their best to make lesbianism seem both erotic as well as the outcast other, this film actually makes these vamps sympathetic and shifts gears to change the subject to male oppression versus judgment upon free-spirited feminine wiles.\\" Starburst Magazine's Andrew Marshall examined the film's religious and political allegory in which the words of an ancient religious leader are corrupted over time in order to build favorable power structures: \\"Through its sex and violence, the film examines the perception of women in an oppressively masculine society, one in which they are taught obedience and complacency, remaining the unwitting victims of theocratic doctrine weaponised by dogmatic fundamentalists. From sapphic symbolism misappropriated by the patriarchal religion to character names representing a disparate assortment of mythologies, the film gradually constructs a culture that could conceivably exist apart from whatever domain may or may not lie beyond the village's borders, while the rampant histrionic misogyny is not only believable within the story's context, but is also rendered all-too plausible by recent real- world developments.\\" Premise 2000 years after the great vampire Bathor established the village of Bathory, superstition and religious violence take over as the men and women battle for control. When the men are afflicted with a mysterious illness, they become certain that the vampire women of Bathory are responsible for their ills, and thus, the hunt begins! Long-forgotten lovers Élisabeth and Fantine find that, with the help of those who were banished, it is their fate to piece together the past and help preserve what little of their society remains before Bathor's impending return and judgment.

A sequel to Bit.Trip Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien, Runner3 is part of the Bit.Trip series, starring the character CommanderVideo. The game was released on May 22, 2018 on Windows, macOS, and Nintendo Switch, and was released on the PlayStation 4 on November 13, 2018. Gameplay Runner3 is a rhythm platformer video game in which players take control of CommanderVideo, protagonist of the Bit.Trip series. =Core Levels= CommanderVideo runs forward automatically and the player controls actions such as jumping, sliding, and kicking to overcome obstacles and collect things. Everything that comes his way will hit in rhythm to the background music, so keeping the beat is crucial to getting through the game. There are goods scattered across every level. The most common are gold bars. There is a set amount of gold in each level, and collecting them increases the score. Second, the Mode-Ups. A mechanic across all Bit.Trip games is the Mode system; the higher the mode, the higher the scoring and the better the music. Although Moding-Up varies in Bit.Trip games, in the Runner series, the player needs to jump into a Mode-Up to immediately go up a Mode. There are five modes in the Runner games, in ascending order: Hyper, Mega, Super, Ultra, and Extra. The player starts at Hyper and works their way up. One notable difference is that in previous Runner games, the Mode-Up appeared as a red 3D plus; in Runner3, it is a blue boombox. Third, the Gems. Gems are on a path of their own, an alternate and harder path. Gems can be collected only once, and they are used to unlock cosmetic items. New mechanics such as riding vehicles and the ability to double jump have been introduced in this installment. While previous Runner games featured different routes through a level by jumping on vertical platforms, Runner3 has stages with alternate paths that branch off into the background. The game also features side-quests, called Hero Quests, in which CommanderVideo stops to interact with non-playable characters that, for example, might task him with collecting specific items in certain levels. Completing Hero Quests unlocks new playable characters. In addition to past characters from the Bit.Trip series, the game includes the Shovel Knight character from the game of the same name, Eddie Riggs from Brütal Legend, and the Narrator, a caricature of voice actor Charles Martinet. There are 27 main levels, and three main worlds (Foodland, Spookyland, and Machineland), but each level has branching paths, secrets, and more variety in music and scenery. =Retro Challenges= Throughout the Runner series, retro challenges have been implemented for more hardcore players. In BIT.TRIP RUNNER and Runner2, the retro challenges are smaller levels based on older video games, and run on the same mechanics as the main game, but with only gold bars to collect. Runner3 has a different sort of retro challenge. The player has full control over CommanderVideo's movement, making it play as a more traditional platformer. There is a retro challenge for every core level. Each retro level has five \\"Gildan Coins\\", which can be traded in for other cosmetics. Development Runner3 was developed by video game development studio Choice Provisions. One focal point of Runner3's design was creating a rewarding and enjoyable experience for playing on any difficulty. Choice Provisions' co- founder Alex Neuse emphasized that many games rewarded only hardcore players and offered a lesser experience for playing on lower difficulties. Voice actor Charles Martinet reprised his narration role in Runner3 and had a playable appearance. Release Runner3 was announced in September 2016. In February 2017, Nintendo revealed that Runner3 would launch on the Nintendo Switch console in the latter half of 2017. However in August 2017, Choice Provisions announced that the game would not release until 2018. A physical version of Runner3 was announced by Nicalis on December 13, 2017. It was released on Steam and Nintendo Switch on May 22, 2018. Following the release, Choice Provisions had announced upgrades to the game, which will include such features as enemy density, more checkpoints, stair assist, bonk counter and gold bars and gems. Reception The video game aggregator site Metacritic gave the Nintendo Switch version a 73/100 while the PC version got 78/100. Kevin Tucker of Shacknews, who reviewed the Steam version of the game, gave it 9 out of 10. Seth Macy of IGN criticized the game’s “outdated” graphics and repetitiveness of levels.

In 1870 she became the first woman staff reporter on a Boston newspaper when she was hired by the Boston Post, and she continued to write for local newspapers until her death in 1909. She co-founded the New England Woman's Press Association, and was an officer in several national press groups. White was a strong supporter of women's suffrage and women's education. In addition to her regular work as a journalist, she wrote and lectured on the subject of career paths for women. Having had a valuable mentor in suffragist Mary A. Livermore, she in turn mentored countless younger women over the course of her long career.  Early life and education  Sarah Elizabeth \\"Sallie\\" Joy was born in Brattleboro, Vermont, in 1847, the only child of Samuel and Rhoda Joy. She attended the Glenwood School for Girls. While still a teenager, she began publishing articles, poems, and short stories in local newspapers and journals, sometimes using the pen name \\"Flora Forrest.\\" After graduation she moved to Charlestown, Massachusetts (now part of Boston), where she lived with family friends.Burt (1998), pp. 366-367.  Career  She worked for some time as a schoolteacher before being hired as an assistant for the Loring Circulating Library. The Loring was a gathering place for authors and intellectuals at the time, and it was there that she met two women who became her mentors: a magazine editor named Mrs. Bingham, and the suffragist Mary A. Livermore. During this period she continued to publish articles in New England newspapers and journals. In the winter of 1869, when her employer increased her hours without raising her pay, she wrote in a letter to her mother that she planned to leave that job as soon as she could find something else, adding, \\"I will not be bullied by any man.\\" = Journalism = At Livermore's invitation, she went to work for the Woman's Journal in 1870. That was to be a temporary position, however, as Livermore and Bingham believed she would be more useful to the women's movement as a reporter for the mainstream press. Livermore introduced her to several editors, and in February she was hired by the Boston Post to cover the Woman Suffrage Convention in Vermont. She soon made a name for herself as \\"the bright particular star\\" of the convention. She was a fast and accurate reporter, and her writing style was engaging, with touches of wry humor.Burt (1998), pp. 368-369. That spring she traveled throughout New England reporting on the suffrage movement, and making news herself simply by being a woman reporter. One journalist, after describing her charming appearance and demeanor, declared that she had \\"made a reputation as a newspaper correspondent and reporter of which any man may be proud. And this is saying a great deal for a woman.\\" The Post offered her a permanent position, making her the first woman staff reporter on a Boston newspaper. In 1871 and 1872 she wrote an acclaimed series for the Post on Boston's North End Mission. Meanwhile, she supplemented her income by publishing letters and articles in several other newspapers, such as the New York World. She quit her job at the Post to get married in 1874, but soon returned to the workforce. During the late 1870s she wrote two women's columns for the Boston Sunday Times and another for the Detroit Free Press, as well as articles on a variety of topics for the Boston Daily Advertiser, the Boston Chronicle, and other papers. In the early 1880s, carving out her niche as a \\"woman's\\" writer, she took a home economics course so as to be able to write more knowledgeably on the subject. By 1885 she had secured a full-time position at the Boston Herald, where she remained for the next 21 years. Most of her work for the Herald appeared with no byline. From 1904 to 1906 she published a column under the pen name \\"Penelope Penfeather.\\" (Historian Elizabeth Burt suggests that the \\"ludicrous\\" pen name may have contributed to earlier historians' failure to take White seriously.)Burt (1998), pp. 372, 381, 392. = Club activities = During the 1870s White became secretary of the Middlesex County Suffrage Association. She was a founding member of the Daughters of Vermont and the Fortnightly Study Club of Dedham, and a member of the New England Women's Club.Burt (1998), p. 374. In November 1885, White hosted a meeting at her office with five other Boston newspaper women, and together they founded the New England Woman's Press Association. White served as president for the first five years, and again from 1907 to 1908.Lord (1932), pp. 49, 200, 204. In 1889, she was involved in the founding of the General Federation of Women's Clubs.Lord (1932), p. 207. She was elected president of the International Federation of Women's Press Clubs in 1891. Also in 1891, after finishing her term as NEWPA president, she established the Boston Woman's Press Club, which restricted admission to women working on Boston newspapers. The following year she was elected vice president of the International League of Press Clubs, a mixed-sex group in which she was the only female officer. She also served several times as a delegate to the National Editorial Association.Burt (1998), pp. 375. = Lecturing and authorship = As a nationally known woman journalist, she was often invited to speak on the subject of women in journalism.Boston Post (February 11, 1894). In 1891 she traveled to California to speak at a meeting of the Pacific Coast Woman's Press Association. At the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, she presented a paper on the role of women in the press.Burt (1998), pp. 376-377. The same year, she traveled to St. Paul to speak at the convention of the International League of Press Clubs. Although more women were entering the field, they were still a minority, and White was surrounded by prominent male journalists. She wrote to her daughter afterwards, \\"I was the one woman to make a speech at the banquet, and was said to have made the best speech of the evening. When I tell you that Murat Halstead, Col. De Long, and two members of Congress made the other speeches, you may imagine that I felt proud.\\" White also wrote and contributed to books about various occupations open to women. After taking a home economics course in the 1880s, she wrote two books for women about housekeeping and cooking. She wrote the chapter on \\"Newspaper Women\\" in Frances Willard's Occupations for Women; two years later, she published her own book on the subject, Business Openings for Girls. She contributed a series of \\"letters to American girls\\" to George J. Bayles's 1905 book, American Women's Legal Status, with such titles as \\"Your Place in Life,\\" \\"The Girl and the Professions,\\" \\"The Architect and the Decorator,\\" \\"The Private Secretary and the Library Worker,\\" and \\"The Life of Home, the Ideal Life.\\"Bayles (1905), p. 2.  Personal life  Sallie Joy White (1897) She married musician Henry K. White, Jr. in 1874 and quit her job at the Post. The couple had two daughters, Bessie and Grace. In 1879, shortly after the birth of their second daughter, Henry moved to California, leaving Sallie to support herself and the children. Her widowed mother came to live with her and care for the children while she worked.Burt (1998), p. 370. White later dedicated her book, Housekeepers and Home-makers, to her mother, \\"the best housekeeper and the dearest home-maker I ever knew.\\"White (1888), p. v. She died of anemia at her home in Dedham, Massachusetts, on March 25, 1909, after a long illness.Boston Globe (March 26, 1909).

After the House of Habsburg established itself in the 11th century, it grew in power. Various domains were added to its empire in central, eastern and western Europe. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740, and again between 1745 and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. The house also produced kings of Bohemia, Germany, Hungary, Croatia, Portugal, Spain, England and Ireland, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian principalities amongst many others. The Austrian Empire was declared as the Holy Roman Empire dissolved itself and became a successor state. The former Holy Roman Emperor Francis II became the Emperor of Austria. In accordance with tradition and the titles that were already held, he promulgated the grand title to codify the most important monarchical titles of various countries and territories under Habsburg rule, and also of titular rulers of former possessions. With the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 the grand title was again slightly modified. Although the Austrian emperor was also the nominal head of the German Confederation, this was not included in the grand title. The grand title was not a complete listing of all the titles held; instead it ends with an etc. There were also a middle title and a small title. The empress was also given the feminine version of the title.  Grand title  The full title (in German) of the Austro-Hungarian monarch as of 1914 was: which translates to:  Explanation of the individual titles listed in the grand title in their order  =Emperor of Austria= In 1804 Holy Roman Emperor Francis II foresaw the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, so he sought to preserve his family's imperial status by creating the new title \\"Hereditary Emperor of Austria\\". =Apostolic King of Hungary, King of Bohemia= The kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia were originally elective monarchies, but like many elective monarchies heredity was respected. Ferdinand, the future Holy Roman Emperor, married the daughter of King Vladislaus II (who held both kingdoms), and when Vladislaus' son died Ferdinand was elected in 1526. Eventually his descendants made the throne hereditary. =King of Dalmatia= Dalmatia became a crown land of the Habsburgs with the Treaty of Campo Formio and finally following Napoleon's defeat. It was previously claimed by the Habsburg emperors in their capacity as kings of Hungary and Croatia, as it was part of the Croatian and later Hungarian royal title since the High Middle Ages. =King of Croatia= In 1102 the Croatian nobles agreed to share the same King as Hungary. In 1527 Ferdinand I was elected king, and the title made hereditary. =King of Slavonia= In the 1490s king Vladislaus II of Hungary officially included Slavonia into the royal title. In 1526 when Ferdinand I was elected king he inherited the title and passed it to his descendants. =King of Galicia and Lodomeria= Galicia and Lodomeria was annexed by Austria in the First Partition of Poland, creating a new kingdom for the Habsburgs. The title had been claimed by the Kings of Hungary in the Middle Ages. =King of Illyria= With the re-annexation of the Illyrian provinces in 1815 the Habsburgs created a new crown land. Although abolished in 1848, the title was kept. =King of Jerusalem= The Kingdom of Jerusalem was abolished upon its conquest by the Egyptian Mamluks in 1291 AD. The Habsburgs were one of many dynasties to claim the title. They inherited it through the House of Lorraine. In the 18th century, the title was added by Leopold I of Lorraine, Francis I's father, in order to claim a royal title. =Archduke of Austria= In 1282 King Rudolf I of Germany enfeoffed himself with the Duchy of Austria. His descendant Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor officially elevated it to an archduchy in 1453, confirming a 1356 forgery by Duke Rudolf IV. =Grand Duke of Tuscany= Following the War of the Polish Succession, future Holy Roman Emperor Francis I was forced to exchange his native Duchy of Lorraine for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. He later passed the grand duchy to a younger son, but the main branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine continued to use the title. =Grand Duke of Kraków= The Free City of Kraków was incorporated into the Austrian Empire in 1846 following the Kraków Uprising, and transformed in a crown land under the name of Grand Duchy of Cracow. It was later incorporated into Galicia. =Duke of Lorraine= The male line of the original House of Habsburg went extinct with Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. His daughter Maria Theresa married the aforementioned Francis, Duke of Lorraine (later Emperor Franics I), and their progeny became the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. =Duke of Styria= Rudolf I of Germany enfeoffed one of his sons as Duke of Styria. The title passed down to the Leopoldian line, which became the sole remaining branch of the House of Habsburg after the death of king Ladislas the Posthumous, last descendant of the senior, Albertinian line. =Duke of Carinthia= In 1335 Otto, Duke of Austria was enfeoffed as Duke of Carinthia. The title passed down with the Leopoldinian line. =Duke of Carniola= The March of Carniola was part of the Habsburg domains since Rudolf I of Germany, although it was leased to the House of Gorizia until 1335. In 1364, duke Rudolf IV of Austria elevated it to a duchy. The title passed down the Leopoldinian line. After the death of Ferdinand I, the Inner Austrian domains (Carniola, Styria and Carinthia) were passed down to a junior branch which in 1619 finally reunited all the Austrian Habsburg lands. =Duke of Bukovina= In 1775 the Habsburgs annexed the northernmost part of the Principality of Moldavia and created the Duchy of Bukovina out of it. =Grand Prince of Transylvania= In the 16th century Transylvania was conquered by the Ottomans from Hungary and created as a separate principality. In 1711 the Habsburgs reclaimed it and added the Principality of Transylvania to their titles. In 1765 it was elevated to a Grand Principality. =Margrave of Moravia= Moravia was a Crown Land of Bohemia; thus when the Habsburgs became Kings of Bohemia they also acquired Moravia. =Duke of Upper and Lower Silesia= Silesia was originally owned by the Kingdom of Poland, but it was gradually broken up and acquired by Bohemia as a crown land. After losing most of historic Silesia to Prussia in the Silesian Wars, the Habsburgs consolidated what remained into Upper and Lower Silesia. =Duke of Modena= Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este, daughter of the last Duke of the House of Este, married Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este, allowing this title to pass to the Habsburgs. It was subsequently lost to Sardinia during the unification of Italy. =Duke of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla= Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor acquired the Duchy of Parma after the War of the Polish Succession, but his daughter Maria Theresa lost it after the War of the Austrian Succession. =Duke of Auschwitz and Zator= Historically one of the duchies of Silesia, it was acquired by the Polish kings in the 16th century and incorporated into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Habsburgs acquired this title in the First Partition of Poland. =Duke of Teschen= The Duchy of Teschen was one of the Silesian Duchies that were part of the Bohemian Crown Lands. It was granted to Leopold I, Duke of Lorraine as a compensation for Mantua and Monferrato. When Leopold's son Francis I married Maria Theresa of Austria, the title returned to the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. =Duke of Friaul= This title was created by Maximilian I during the Italian wars in the early 16th century. Friuli had been part of the Holy Roman Empire, but it was lost to the Republic of Venice in 1420. The title was created in order to strengthen the Emperor's claim to the region, but the Habsburgs acquired Friuli only in 1797 with the Treaty of Campo Formio, and then again after Napoleon's defeat. It was lost to Italy in 1866. =Duke of Ragusa= Ragusa (modern-day Dubrovnik) was a maritime republic, which in the late Middle Ages recognized the suzerainty of the Hungarian kings. It was abolished by Napoleon in 1806 and incorporated to Austrian Dalmatia after his defeat, when the title was created. =Duke of Zara= Zara (or Zadar) is a city in Dalmatia, modern-day Croatia. In the Middle Ages, it was contested between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Republic of Venice. It was considered an integral part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia by both parts, but the title was assumed by the Hungarian kings in order to assert their rights over the city. It became a Habsburg domain for the first time with the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, and then again in 1813 after Napoleon's defeat. =Princely Count of Habsburg= Habsburg was the original seat of the House of Habsburg. =Princely Count of Tyrol= Duke Rudolf IV of Austria acquired the County of Tyrol in 1363. =Princely Count of Kyburg= Rudolf I of Germany claimed the County of Kyburg when its ruling dynasty went extinct. A brief period of rule by the city of Zürich became permanent from 1452 when it was used as collateral for a loan the Habsburgs never repaid; they continued to use the title despite no longer being in possession of the land. =Princely Count of Gorizia and Gradisca= The Habsburgs acquired the County of Gorizia (German ) in 1500. In 1647, the nearby town of Gradisca and the surrounding area on the right bank of the Isonzo river was elevated to an immediate status and given to the Eggenberg family as a Principality. After its extinction in 1754, it was again merged with Gorizia. =Prince of Trent= In the 1300s Trent was annexed by Tyrol and thus was controlled by the Habsburgs. =Prince of Brixen= In 1803 the Prince-Bishopric of Brixen was secularized and annexed by the Habsburgs. =Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia= Lusatia was a Crown Land of Bohemia. =Margrave in Istria= Central Istria was acquired by the Habsburgs in the late 14th century. In 1466, they acquired the eastern parts, as well, and added their Istrian possessions to the Duchy of Carniola. With the annexation of Venetian Istria in 1797, the Habsburgs joined all their Istrian possessions into one unit and revived this title which had been abandoned in the late 13th century. =Count of Hohenems= When the male line of the original counts of Hohenems died out in 1759 the county came under suzerainty of the House of Habsburg. =Count of Feldkirch= When the last count of Feldkirch Frederick VII of Toggenburg died in 1436 the county passed back under the suzerainty of the House of Habsburg. =Count of Bregenz= After 1451 the title of count of Bregenz was held by the House of Habsburg and Bregenz was incorporated into the duchy of Austria. =Count of Sonnenberg= Sonnenberg was a partition of Waldburg and was annexed by the Archduchy of Austria in 1511. =Lord of Trieste= By the Peace of Turin in 1381, Venice renounced its claim to Trieste and the leading citizens of Trieste petitioned Leopold III of Habsburg, Duke of Austria, to make Trieste part of his domains. =Lord of Cattaro= After the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, it passed to the Habsburg Monarchy. However, in 1805, it was assigned to the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy by the Treaty of Pressburg, although in fact held by a Russian squadron under Dmitry Senyavin. It was restored to the Habsburg Monarchy by the Congress of Vienna. =Lord on the Windic March= Since the 11th century, Carniola was known under the double name of Carniola and the Windic March. In 1282, a cadet branch of the House of Gorizia was enfeoffed with part of the region, which became known as the County in Metlika and in the Windic March. In 1374, the county was acquired to the House of Habsburg who assumed the title of Lords of the Windic March. =Grand Voivode of the Voivodeship of Serbia= The Voivodeship was formed by a decision of the Austrian Emperor in November 1849, after the Revolutions of 1848/1849. It was formed in accordance with privilege given to Serbs by the Habsburg emperor in 1691, recognizing the right of Serbs to territorial autonomy within the Habsburg Monarchy. Subsequent use After 1918, the grand title was invoked for historical commemorative reasons in two Habsburg burial ceremonies in Vienna. At the burial of the last empress, Zita (1916–18), on 1 April 1989 in the imperial mausoleum, three prayers were said for the deceased by a speaker commissioned by the family, before the gate was opened and the sarcophagus was borne into the mausoleum. The first prayer started with the feminine form of the grand title: \\"Zita, Empress of Austria, crowned Queen of Hungary, Queen of Bohemia ...\\". In the list of ducal titles, the title of Duchess of Parma claimed by the Habsburgs was omitted, as she had a closer tie to Parma. Her father, Robert of Parma, was the last Duke of Parma (1854-1860) and as a pretender to that title she was a princess, even though she was not born until 1892. Thus the title ended with \\"Infanta of Spain, Princess of Portugal and of Parma\\". Zita's son Otto von Habsburg was buried on 16 July 2011, and a prayer was said in the mausoleum: \\"Otto of Austria, first Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, royal prince of Hungary and Bohemia ...\\" The titles of King of Jerusalem and Archduke of Austria were omitted. No Austrian emperor was actually sovereign over Jerusalem, and in 1961 Otto had renounced all claims of sovereignty in the Republic of Austria.

Biography The daughter of William and Ada Luker, both artists, Burrell was born in London and studied at the South Kensington Art School. Her parents put her to work as an art teacher before she had completed her training there. She earned a scholarship to the Bushey School of Art, where she studied with Hubert von Herkomer. Some of her miniatures were accepted for display at the Royal Academy of Arts. She left England for Cape Town where she married Philip Burrell. Burell returned to England for the birth of her daughter; unfortunately, her husband suffered a heart attack while boarding a ship to rejoin them. In 1912, Burrell became a member of the Royal Miniature Society. She returned to Ottawa in 1912, where she painted members of Ottawa society. Unable to return to England due to World War I, she moved to Victoria where she operated a boarding house for a time. From 1916 to 1919, she lived in Hollywood, where she painted portraits of film stars. She returned to England and established a studio in Knightbridge where she painted two watercolour portraits a day at five guineas each. An early customer was Lucy Baldwin who was the Prime Minister's wife and she became a friend. She enjoyed good custom for some years but she found the task difficult. She met E.G.John Moore who was divorced, he had been a civil servant and was once the vicar of Amblecote. Burrell married Moore in 1922; the second marriage lasted six months. With Lucy Balwin's patronage she started to create larger portraits in oil paints. Commissions from Lucy for paintings of herself and a daughter and another of her grandson in addition to water colours of the interiors of 10, Downing Street were part of her work. She moved to India in 1929 and painted members of the royalty there. In 1931, she returned to London with a six-month stopover in Cairo. Burrell was awarded a grant by the artists' general benevolent fund for her support in 1952. She died in London in 1971. Her daughter, Philippa Burrell, wrote an autobiography, The Golden Thread, which contains accounts of her experiences with her mother. Her work is included in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Bushey Museum, the University of Hull Art Collection, the Djanogly Art Gallery at the University of Nottingham, the Ashmolean Museum, the Herkomer Museum, Landsberg am Lech in Bavaria and the National Gallery of Canada. In 1979, the National Book League in London exhibited her work.

This church and its convent are located in the Plaza de San Pedro Claver. The church is part of a set of religious buildings that is complemented by the Cloister of San Pedro Claver and the archaeological museum. It was built between 1580 and 1654, under the parameters of colonial constructions. Originally known as the church of San Juan de Dios, it has been called the church of San Ignacio de Loyola since 1622 and is now known as San Pedro Claver. The church is colonial, except for the dome, in 1921 the colonial dome was eliminated and the present dome was erected, the work of French Gaston Lelarge. At its altar lie the remains of Saint Peter Claver, who died in 1654 in Cartagena, after devoting practically all his life to evangelizing and redeeming the black slaves of New Granada. Description It suffered many vicissitudes after the expulsion of the Jesuits, first ordered by Charles III of Spain in 1767, and then in the years 1850 and 1861, during the early years of the republican era. For many years it served as a park to the adjacent barracks, which occupied part of the house-school of the Company of Jesus. Its architecture corresponds to the style called \\"Jesuitic\\", of type denominated \\"of preaching\\". Much of the façade was carved in stone from the island of Tierrabomba, and inside, at the bottom of the marble main altar imported from Italy by Bishop Eugenio Biffi, lie the relics of the owner in a golden bronze and glass urn, gift of Pope Leo XIII. In 1921 the typical orange half was eliminated and the present dome, the work of Lelarge, was erected. The front of the church departs from the Baroque style of other entrances. There is a second floor above the chapels, which are intercommunicated through arches of half point and covered with arista vaults. This church has an organ and a choir similar to those of the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran in Rome. The interior of the church of the Company is distinguished by the severity of its architectural elements, in contrast to the Baroque profusion used by Jesuits in other parts of Spanish America. Its facade is considered as the richest and most monumental of Cartagena.

Throughout this period she was the party's only female deputy in the assembly.Ingrid Langer: Zwölf vergessene Frauen. Die weiblichen Abgeordneten im Parlament des Volksstaates Hessen, ihre politische Arbeit – ihr Alltag – ihr Leben, Frankfurt 1989, .  Life  = Provenance and early years = Elisabeth Hemmes was born in Bensheim, then as now a prosperous mid-sized town located halfway between Darmstadt and Mannheim. (1840-1925), her father, was a teacher who later achieved notability as the director of the Royal Deaf-Mute Institute (\\"Bensheimer Großherzoglichen Taubstummenanstalt\\") and as the author of a pioneering six-year teaching programme for the deaf-mute. Despite her father's pedagogic career, when his daughter also became a teacher, she did so only in the teeth of her father's opposition. She taught English and French at secondary schools in Vallendar and Cologne. When she was 28 Else Hemmes married Karl Hattemer (1869–1913), one year her senior and, like her, a secondary school teacher. His family came, originally, from Gau-Algesheim (near Mainz). By the time of her husband's relatively early death the marriage would have produced four recorded children. In 1901 the couple relocated to Darmstadt where Karl Hattemer taught at the Neue Gymnasium (secondary school - subsequently subsumed into the \\"Ludwig-Georg Gymnasium\\". After she was widowed, in 1913, Elisabeth Hattemer increased her involvement in social and political matters. Her commitments included work for the \\"City Poverty and Welfare Operation\\" (\\"Städtische Armen- und Fürsorgedeputation\\"), the \\"Darmstadt Catholic Girls Protection League\\" (\\"Katholischer Mädchenschutzverein Darmstadt\\") and in the \\"Catholic Women's Association\\". = Politics = Elisabeth Hattemer was a member of the Centre Party (Hessen). Military defeat in 1918 had been followed by a wave of revolutions across the country during 1918/19. The Grand duke, after refusing to abdicate, had been forced from his throne, and by 1919 the Grand Duchy of Hesse had become the People's State of Hesse (Volksstaat Hessen). The old bicameral legislature had been replaced by the unicameral \\"Landtag\\", its franchise broader and the voting systems more direct than before. Following the first election, held on 26 January 1919, the Centre Party vote share entitled it to 13 of the 70 seats. There were few women. However, Elisabeth Hattemer was elected to the assembly, after which she continued to be elected in successive elections up to and including the 1932 election. She was one of only five members with this record of continuity. During the Weimar years she was one of just twelve female members in the chamber, and the only woman sitting as a member for the Centre party. Her particular focus was on girls' education and social welfare, also backing measures designed to help the socially disadvantaged. = Beyond politics = A record from the Darmstadt branch of the Caritas (Catholic charity organisation) records that from March 1925 the Centre Party Landtag member, Mrs Elizabeth Hattemer, was the head of the Caritas secretariat set up, initially, on land belonging to the priory of St. Ludwig, (and which relocated to an address along the Hügelstraße in 1926). She continued to play a prominent co-ordination role within the city's Caritas organisation for many years, although in 1937 the leadership function was taken over by Valentin Degen. Later she became a member of the Caritas board for the diocese. Another focus of her work was the Darmstadt regional theatre, of which she was a member of the supervisory board (\\"Verwaltungsbeirat\\"), and which was at this time enjoying a strong reputation both for staging classical productions and for some modern pieces that confronted contemporary morality and preconceptions. Till 1939, when she moved house, Elisabeth Hattemer was living at an address in the Hermann Street (\\"Hermannstraße 43\\") which also accommodated the Darmstadt Caritas secretariat, the Children's Welfare office of the Darmstadt branch of the Catholic Women's Association, and its children's day-care center. Shortly before the outbreak of war the Nazi authorities, who always nurtured suspicions of any community involvement by \\"proxies\\" for the Roman Catholic Church, closed down the day-care center. A few years later, the failed assassination attempt against Hitler in July 1944 failed in its primary objective, but was highly effective in unnerving the government, which promptly dusted down a long list of people who had been politically active as non-Nazis before 1933. It turned out that many names on the list belonged to people who had fled abroad or died. Nevertheless, on the night of 22/23 August mass arrests took place across Germany. Elisabeth Hattemer's name was on the list and an attempt was made to arrest her. However, possibly aware of what was about to happen, she had taken the opportunity to move to live with her son in nearby Viernheim, which was sufficient to preserve her from arrest. After the war ended, in 1945, she continued to support her son with his youth work, and renewed her involvement with the Catholic Women's Association.

Succeeding on the death of his father Grigol Dadiani, he ruled—initially under the regency of his mother Nino from 1804 to 1811—as a loyal subject of the Russian Empire. Levan Dadiani took little interest in the details of government and resigned in favor of his son, David Dadiani, in 1840, remaining a titular Prince of Mingrelia until his death.  Early life and rule  Levan Dadiani was the eldest son of Grigol Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, and his wife, Nino, daughter of George XII, the last king of Georgia. Grigol died in October 1804, having placed his principality under the Russian suzerainty several months before. The Russian government confirmed, in absentia, the boy-prince Levan as Grigol's successor. At that time, Levan resided in Abkhazia, at the court of Kelesh Ahmed-Bey Shervashidze, whom Grigol had surrendered his son as an honorary hostage in exchange of the Abkhaz support in a power struggle in Mingrelia in 1802. The Russian military intervention, in April 1805, freed Levan, who, on his arrival in Mingrelia, took a solemn oath of fealty to the Russian monarchy and was confirmed as Prince of Mingrelia, receiving, on this occasion, the rank of major-general and Order of Saint Anna, 1st Class, in July 1805. Levan's accession was opposed by his uncle, Manuchar Dadiani, but the power struggle was eventually won by Levan's loyalists through the efforts of his mother Nino and the archbishop of Chqondidi.  In Russian service  As Levan was underage at his accession, the regency council presided by his mother was established. The council was ridden with internal tensions; Princess Nino was sidelined from the government and Levan assumed full ruling powers in 1811. He championed Russian interests in the region and took part, at the head of Mingrelian forces (\\"militia\\"), in Russian military campaigns. At the age of 16, he was present at the successful siege of Poti, in 1809, during the war against the Ottoman Empire. Next year, he aided the Russians in the conquest of the Kingdom of Imereti, which had, for centuries, claimed suzerainty over Mingrelia, and in an expedition against the Ottoman-held province of Akhaltsikhe, for which he received the Order of Saint Vladimir, 2nd Class. Levan was also instrumental in extending Russian influence into Abkhazia, where he supported his relative, Prince Sefer Ali-Bey Shervashidze. He took control of Samurzakano, a borderland between Mingrelia and Abkhazia, in 1813 and campaigned with a Mingrelian force in Abkhazia's interior in 1818 and 1824. In 1819 and 1820, Dadiani joined the Russian forces fighting the rebels in Imereti and Guria. Levan's younger brother Giorgi, also an officer in the Russian service, collaborated with the rebels, and was handed over by the Prince of Mingrelia to the Russian authorities. In August 1829, during the Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829), Dadiani and his Mingrelians, serving under Major-General Karl Hesse, were instrumental in defeating the Turks at Mukha- Estate. For his services, Levan Dadiani was made lieutenant-general in 1820 and granted the Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky in 1830.  Mingrelian state of affairs  Levan Dadiani's rule was autocratic. Personally, he was devoted to hunting and had little interest in the administrative affairs of his principality, which he had effectively relegated to his relative Didi-Niko Dadiani until the latter died in 1834. He still helped establish a school at the Martvili Monastery in 1830. Levan, anticipating riches by selling timber to Egypt, dreamed of turning Zugdidi, Mingrelia's chief town, into a modern city called Grigoriopolis and filed a request to the tsar Nicholas I to be allowed to do so in 1837, a few months after he hosted the Russian monarch in his possessions in September 1837. Nicholas I ruled the place could be named Grigoriopolis to appease Dadiani, but withheld his approval to grant to it a city status. After Niko Dadiani's death in 1834, Levan summoned his eldest son David, an energetic and educated officer in the Russian service in Tiflis, to manage a growing political crisis in the principality. David's efforts at modernization were not popular with the local nobility and even his father, causing the disillusioned young prince to retire from Mingrelia in 1838. With his health declining and Mingrelia facing a breakdown of law and order, Levan Dadiani resigned government duties in favor of David on 11 May 1840, retaining formal titles of a Mingrelian ruler. He died six years later in Zugdidi and was buried at the Martvili Monastery.  Family  Levan Dadiani was married twice. He wed first, in 1810, Princess Nino (died 1811), daughter of Prince Zurab Tsereteli (1747–1823), Mayor of the Palace (sakhlt-ukhutsesi) of Imereti. Levan's second wife was his late consort's younger sister Marta (died 1839), mother of his three sons and two daughters. * Prince David Dadiani (1812–1853), Prince of Mingrelia (1840–1853), major-general; * Prince Grigol Dadiani (1814–1901), general of the infantry and a poet; * Princess Nino Dadiani (1816–1886), Lady-in-waiting of the Imperial Court of Russia.

Such foreign campaigning is illegal under Turkish law. The Netherlands barred the aircraft of Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu from landing, and expelled Turkish Minister of Family and Social Policies, Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya from the country, when both tried to speak at rallies. In response, Turkey expelled the Dutch ambassador from the country, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called the Dutch \\"fascists\\" and \\"remnants of Nazism\\" and accused the Netherlands of \\"massacring\\" Muslims in Srebrenica during the Bosnian War in 1995. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called Erdoğan's remarks \\"unacceptable\\" and a \\"vile falsification of history\\" and demanded an apology. Rutte also called for talks to resolve the impasse, adding that Turkey had crossed a diplomatic line.  Background  The Turkish referendum held on 16 April 2017 concerned a series of constitutional amendments that, if approved, would transform the country from a parliamentary democracy into a presidential system, under which President Erdoğan would be able to stand in two more elections, theoretically allowing him to govern as a powerful head of state until 2029. Critics of the proposed changes have expressed their fears of increased authoritarianism, whereas supporters claim the new system would make the Turkish state stronger and safer. In the 'Yes' campaign's attempt to persuade Europe's Turkish diaspora (many of whom still hold Turkish citizenship and thus are allowed to vote on the referendum) several high-ranking Turkish government officials sought to campaign in European cities with large Turkish populations. This included the Dutch city of Rotterdam, which contains a large portion of the 400,000 people of Turkish origin living in the Netherlands. The Turkish plans to campaign in European cities met a mixed reception in many European states, including the Netherlands. Overseas election campaigning, even in diplomatic missions, is illegal under Turkish law; yet most political parties in Turkey, including the ruling AKP, have flouted this law. The Turkish referendum came at a time when the Netherlands, too, was scheduled for its general election, which was held on 15 March 2017.  Escalation  Protesters at the Consulate General of the Netherlands in Istanbul On 3 March 2017, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte got confirmation from the Turkish authorities that a campaign manifestation was planned on Dutch territory, on 11 March. That day he announced on his Facebook page that the Dutch authorities would not cooperate.Elsje Joritsma, Enzo van Steenbergen, & Kees Versteegh, 2017, \\"Waarom laten ze die vrouw niet gewoon binnen?\\", NRC Next, 15 March 2017, p 6-7 On 6 March, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs received diplomatic mail requesting the admission of the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu with the intention of attending a campaign meeting. The same day, the Dutch foreign minister Bert Koenders replied in a note verbale that such a visit would not be allowed. This led to a series of telephonic contacts between Koenders and Çavuşoğlu, as well as between Rutte and the Turkish prime minister Binali Yıldırım. According to Çavuşoğlu, the Dutch government told him that it objected to a visit because it feared that it would lead to an electoral victory of the anti-Islamic Party for Freedom. The Dutch government has denied that such a motive was ever communicated to Çavuşoğlu. Dutch diplomatic sources have indicated that Çavuşoğlu offered Koenders to postpone a visit to a date after the Dutch elections on 15 March, e.g. to 18 March, but that this option was refused by Koenders who wanted to avoid any suggestion of a connection between the two events, fearing it might give the impression that the Dutch government deliberately escalated the situation. As an alternative for a ministerial visit to a mass gathering, the Dutch authorities offered to allow the visit of Turkish ex-parliamentarians, or Çavuşoğlu visiting some closed session. When no consensus was reached, the Dutch made a final offer on 10 March: Çavuşoğlu would be allowed access to the Turkish embassy in The Hague. This was accepted by the Turks. Then the Dutch demanded that no more than fifty people were invited to the meeting and the session would not be made public beforehand. While Turkey considered this condition, a third one was made in the evening: the names of those invited would have to be disclosed beforehand to the Dutch authorities. On 11 March 03:00, it was added that if Turkey would not accept this offer, landing rights might be refused. Turkey considered this to be an unacceptable infringement on its sovereignty and a deliberate attempt by the Dutch to sabotage the visit. Koenders told the Dutch press that the Netherlands would not facilitate a planned visit by Çavuşoğlu to Rotterdam on 11 March, meaning that he would not meet with Çavuşoğlu in any official capacity and that the Dutch state would not provide support in any way during his planned visit. Koenders cited risks to public order and security for the decision, and further stated that, although the Dutch government did not approve of the planned visit, he would not infringe upon the constitutional right of freedom of assembly. Çavuşoğlu was very dismayed by what he saw as a Dutch ultimatum. He publicly requested \\"all Turkish citizens in the Netherlands\\" to come to the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam on 11 March. In an interview with CNN Türk around 09:00 he claimed to have been threatened by the Netherlands and announced \\"heavy sanctions\\" if his visit was prevented. Koenders watched the CNN programme; when he heard the remarks by Çavuşoğlu, he said \\"This is the signal\\" and immediately phoned Rutte. On 11 March, around 10:00, Rutte denied Çavuşoğlu's government plane the right to land on Dutch soil. Mounted police in front of the Turkish consulate, Rotterdam Meanwhile, Geert Wilders, the leader of the anti-Islamic Party for Freedom, had on 8 March demonstrated against the visit in front of the Turkish embassy in The Hague, heading a small group of party candidates. Together with member of parliament Sietse Fritsma, he held a banner with the words Blijf Weg! Dit is ons land (\\"Stay Away! This is our country\\"). On 11 March, Wilders too became aware of Çavuşoğlu's remarks; on 11:20 he sent a tweet to his many Twitter followers to re-tweet to Rutte: \\"don't let the Turkish minister into the country; do NOT let him land here\\". Later that day, Wilders in an interview with Al Jazeera claimed it was pressure from his party that convinced Rutte not to grant landing rights. At the time, the Turkish Minister of Family and Social Policies, Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, was touring Germany. A visit to the Dutch town of Hengelo, close to the German border, had already been scheduled. On 11 March, the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service received information that Kaya would try to reach Rotterdam by car. She could freely cross the border because of the Schengen Treaty. A crisis centre was established on the twenty-third floor of the Rotterdam World Port Center to coordinate police actions. Earlier, the Turkish consul in Rotterdam had indicated to the Mayor of Rotterdam, Ahmed Aboutaleb, that there were no plans for such a visit. It now proved impossible to contact the consul, which gave Aboutaleb the conviction that the consul knew of Kaya's attempt. A motorcade was intercepted but the car with the minister managed to drive away. It reached a small yard at the rear of the Turkish consulate. The Dutch police stopped Betül Sayan Kaya's entourage just metres from the Turkish consulate building. About twenty police officers, forming a special forces unit, the Dienst Speciale Interventies, masked and equipped with body armour and automatic weapons, arrested ten members of Kaya's bodyguard, on suspicion of illegally carrying firearms. A German source had indicated they had obtained a German weapons permit. No arms were discovered. Two other men were also arrested, who later proved to be the Deventer Turkish consul and the chargé d'affaires of the Turkish embassy. They in principle enjoyed diplomatic immunity. The twelve arrested men were detained for two hours and their passports were seized. A stand-off ensued for several hours in which the Turkish minister refused to leave the car. Just after midnight, a special heavy tow truck, a lift flatbed, was driven into the yard and prepared to vertically hoist the 3.5 tonne car onto the flatbed, with the minister still in it, to transport her back to Germany. The minister now left the car and demanded entrance to the consulate invoking the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The Dutch police had orders to arrest the minister if necessary.https://joop.vara.nl/nieuws/nederlandse-politie-mocht-geweld- gebruiken-turkse-minister Ultimately, she gave in to the police demands to leave the country. At the time, many news sources assumed that she had been declared persona non grata. She was, loudly protesting, taken to another car, a black armoured Mercedes,Bart Dirks & Natalie Righton, 2017, \\"Hoe twee vrienden kemphanen werden\\", Volkskrant. Vonk, 18 March 2017, p. 6-7 by masked Dutch police officers who accompanied her to a police station at Nijmegen near the Dutch–German border. Her passport was seized. She was not allowed to leave the station for one and a half hours, while being reunited with the ten bodyguards. She returned to Germany under German escort. Sporadic rioting occurred among the about a thousand pro-Erdoğan protesters who had come to the Turkish consulate. They were met by Dutch riot police, who arrested twelve people for violent assault and not following police instructions.DUTCH RIOT POLICE BREAK UP PRO-ERDOGAN DEMONSTRATION AS TURKEY VOWS RETALIATIONDutch Deport Turkish Minister After Standoff With Police Kaya's passport was returned on 12 March, 18:00, to the Turkish consul. In April 2017, Kaya's lawyer said they would file a complaint against the Dutch government at court claiming that her expulsion from the Netherlands was illegal because she was not given a written statement of the reasons for the expulsion. However, on 2 May the case was dropped when it transpired that Kaya had never been formally declared persona non grata and that from a judicial point of view she had left the Netherlands voluntarily.https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/05/22/kaya-laat- rechtszaak-nederlandse-staat-varen-a1559877 The Dutch actions prompted President Erdoğan to characterise the Dutch as \\"fascists\\" and \\"remnants of Nazism\\" and to accuse the Netherlands of mass murder in Srebrenica, which resulted in a hardening of positions on both sides. Rutte called Erdoğan's remarks \\"unacceptable\\" and a \\"vile falsification of history\\", and demanded an apology. Rotterdam councillor Turan Yazır, a Dutch-Turkish citizen and supporter of Fethullah Gülen, was granted leave of absence after receiving threats and having his details published by the Daily Sabah newspaper, which also accused him of working with Geert Wilders.

Some protesters also burnt the flags of France since they assumed French President François Hollande was the President of Holland (Netherlands). Similarly, some Erdoğan supporters intended to call the Rotterdam police department and force the operators to listen to religious and nationalistic Turkish songs. However, they mistakenly called the police department of the town of Rotterdam in New York State, United States. A man replaced the Dutch flag of the Dutch Consulate General in Istanbul with a Turkish one with some protesters making signs of the ultra-nationalist Grey Wolves and shouting \\"Allahu akbar\\", \\"Racist Holland\\", and \\"Damn Holland\\". * On 13 March, Turkey barred the Dutch ambassador (who was out of the country during the incident) from returning to Turkey and said it was suspending \\"high-level diplomatic relations\\". In addition president Erdoğan announced the two ministers involved would file a complaint against the Netherlands with the European Court of Human Rights. *On 14 March, Erdoğan accused the Netherlands of mass murder in Srebrenica. Also, he called on Turks, Muslims and foreigners living in Germany and the Netherlands not to vote for parties that espouse anti-Turkish policies. *On 15 March, President Erdoğan urged the city of Istanbul to cut their (nonexistent) sister city agreement with Rotterdam.

However, Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière said that Turkey had no business to campaign in Germany. Merkel defended the Netherlands and rejected Erdoğan's accusations towards the Netherlands as \\"completely unacceptable comments\\". She further stated that \\"the Netherlands could count on her full support and solidarity\\". :On 20 March, Chancellor Merkel told President Erdoğan that his comparing German officials to Nazis must stop. She also said that permission that had been granted for rallies to be held in Germany might be rescinded. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that he had let his Turkish counterpart know that \\"a line had been crossed\\". * – State Department spokesman Mark Toner called on both sides to avoid escalatory rhetoric.  Later developments  On February 5, 2018, the Dutch Foreign Ministry announced that it was formally withdrawing its ambassador from Turkey and that it would not accept any new ambassador appointed by the Turkish government. The ministry added that on-going talks aimed at resolving the dispute had come to a halt, and that neither of the parties involved has agreed to normalize diplomatic ties.

Built in 1930, it is an architecturally distinctive stone building with medieval features, designed by Alfredo S.G. Taylor. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Childs Sports Building is located in a rural-residential setting south of the village center of Norfolk, on the north side of Windrow Road near its junction with Gamefield Road. This area is part of what was once a large country estate of the Childs family. The building is a 1-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of rough fieldstone and capped by a roof with clipped gables. It is roughly rectangular in plan, with a round turret rising at its northeast corner to a low-pitch conical roof. The interior and roof framing are done with massive timbers recycled from old barns, which were also the source of the rough planking on the interior walls. The ground floor offers indoor courts for playing squash, badminton, and fives, as well as men's and women's dressing rooms. The upper level has a trophy hall and a billiard room. The building was built in 1930 to a design by New York City architect Alfredo S.G. Taylor. Taylor spent many summers in Norfolk, and is credited with more than thirty commissions in the community. A number of them share the medieval features used in this building: the rough rustic stone and wood finishes, and heavy slate roof. Details of the building were published in American Architect and Building News after its construction. Taylor's work for the Childs family also included the Starling Childs Camp on Doolittle Lake, and the Tom Thumb House.

As Page Morton Black she was known for singing the \\"Heavenly Coffee\\" jingle on the company's televised advertisements and sponsored broadcasts. When Black died in 1983, she took over his charitable work with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation. Background Morton was born Page L. Mergentheim on October 15, 1912 and raised in Winnetka, Illinois. Her father was Morton Adolf Mergentheim, a lawyer and professor of law working in the Chicago area. For a period he was a partner in the law firm of Sigmund Zeisler. Her mother, Rose Heymann, was a classically trained pianist who had studied with Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler, wife of Sigmund. Morton's only sibling was Morton Alexander Mergentheim who was about 3 years older. They were both educated at New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois where her highest grade was 4th year. Career Morton came from an affluent family but her father lost his money on the markets so she moved to New York with her mother to find work. In 1940 at the age of 18 she was living with her mother on East 43rd Street, having changed her name from Mergentheim to Morton. Her occupation in the 1940 census was given as model, and one newspaper of the period indicates that she was connected to the John Robert Powers modelling agency.1940 Census Place: New York, New York, New York; Roll: T627_2648; Page: 3A; Enumeration District: 31-1028 When her father died in 1943, his obituary described her as an actress with the stage name of Page Morton. During the 1940s and '50s she sang and played piano in various New York clubs, hotel bars and restaurants including the Warwick Hotel's Raleigh Room, Café Pierre, the Vanderbilt and the Sherry-Netherland. The band leader Guy Lombardo saw her perform in the Pierre and suggested to William Black that she could sing the advertising jingle for Chock full o’Nuts coffee. In the 1960s Morton started to work on radio and television shows. She appeared on the Guy Lombardo New Year's Eve special, sponsored by the Chock full o’Nuts company. In 1961 she had her own radio programmes, and appeared on two further New Year's Eve specials, one hosted by Lombardo and the other by Xavier Cugat. She released her first album for MGM called May You Always and sang a duet with Jimmy Durante advertising the coffee brand. Marriage William Black had started his business by selling nuts from a stand on Broadway with a $250 start-up fund. As the company grew, he began selling his own vacuum-packed blend of coffee that eventually accounted for 60% of his multi-million dollar turnover. In 1951 he divorced his first wife and married singer Jean Martin. She featured on sponsored radio and television programmes for Black and sang the \\"Heavenly Coffee\\" jingle. By 1960 Black and Martin were separated and divorced in 1962. Black married Morton in Connecticut on March 27, 1962.Original data: Connecticut. 1959-77 Connecticut Marriage File.

One route of begins at Highway 306 near Hunter and runs southeast to US Highway 79 (US 79). A second route of begins at Highway 121 and runs west to a junction with Lee County Route 132 (CR 132) and CR 173. A short spur route in Moro, Highway 78 Spur connects the parent route to Highway 238. All routes are maintained by the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD). Both segments of Highway 78 serve the Arkansas Delta, an extremely rural part of the state. Passing through only a few small towns, the highway's setting is a flat agricultural landscape in cultivation crossed by drainage ditches, swamps, and bayous. One of the original Arkansas state highways, Highway 78 was slowly extended in the middle of the 20th century during a period of rapid growth in the Arkansas Highway System. The Aubrey-Big Creek route was created in 1973, marking the last change for the highway designation until the addition of Highway 78 Spur in 2001. The entire route between Hunter and US 79 is designated as an Arkansas Heritage Trail, a route used by John S. Marmaduke's Confederate Missouri cavalry prior to the Battle of Helena during the American Civil War. Route description =Hunter to US 79= The route begins in southeastern Woodruff County at Highway 306 near Hunter. Running south as a section line road, the highway enters St. Francis County, passing through Posey before entering Wheatley. Highway 78 intersects two national east-west routes in Wheatley, Interstate 40 in the north part of the city, and US 70 in the southern portion. Following this intersection, Highway 78 takes a southeasterly turn and angles into Lee County. Entering from the county's sparsely populated northwest corner, Highway 78 passes through Nash Corner before a brief overlap with Highway 259 at South Plains. Now turning due south, Highway 78 enters the small town of Moro. Highway 78 Spur in downtown Moro offers access to Highway 238, leading toward Brinkley. Following this intersection, Highway 78 exits Moro to the southeast, intersecting US 79, where it terminates. =Aubrey to Big Creek= Highway 78 begins at Highway 121 in Aubrey in southern Lee County. The route runs due west as a section line road until crossing into the riparian zone for Big Creek. Highway 78 crosses McNulty Lake, created by a slow moving portion of Big Creek, on an open deck steel bridge. Shortly after this bridge, the highway terminates at an intersection of gravel county routes. History Highway 78 was designated as one of the original state highways on April 1, 1926. Running between US 70 in Wheatley and State Road 3., the route remained unchanged for almost 50 years. An extension north to I-40 on February 28, 1968 was part of a program to connect newly built Interstate highways with the US highways they paralleled. On July 29, 1970, the highway was extended by the Arkansas State Highway Commission (ASHC) to the current northern terminus at Highway 306.. A second segment of Highway 78 was created between Aubrey and a county road intersection near Big Creek on March 28, 1973 pursuant to Act 9 of 1973 by the Arkansas General Assembly.. The act directed county judges and legislators to designate up to of county roads as state highways in each county. Major intersections Spur route Highway 78 Spur western terminus at Highway 238 Highway 78 Spur (AR 78S, Ark. 78S, and Hwy. 78S) is a spur route of in Moro. Route description The route begins at Highway 78 in downtown Moro and runs southwest for one block to Highway 238.

Before committing to her art career, she worked at Ralph Lauren as a Design Director for a decade, which has influenced her practice. Her work lives in numerous private collections throughout the United States and Europe. Her work is included in the Elizabeth A.

Nehrbass is currently represented by Central Features Contemporary Art in Albuquerque, NM, Goodwin Fine Art in Denver, CO, and Brunnhofer Galerie in Linz, Austria. Her work is in many private collections in the United States as well as Europe. Recently her work was included into the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art :Feminist Art Base at the Brooklyn Museum. Her art work functions somewhere between reality and fantasy, and is often referred to as surrealism. She makes collages, oil paintings and cameos, which are also oil on canvas but their distinct shape references the Victorian era. In addition to making collages, her figurative oil paintings emulate collage because the subjects appear to be cut from the surface. The independent, yet sensual, female figure is often the central focus in Nehrbass' work. Her Cameos are inspired by Margaret Atwood's book, The Penelopiad, and a Victorian obsession with sex and death.

Overview  Founded in 1967, the distinctive feature of the Caja de Ingenieros cooperative model is that the partner is both client and owner of the entity. Clients have to join one of two cooperatives: Usuarios de Caja de Ingenieros or Caja de Ingenieros. Caja de Ingenieros acts as the parent company of the Caja de Ingenieros Group, which includes: * Caja de Ingenieros Gestión (fund management company) * Caixa de Ingenieros Vida y Pensiones (insurance, reinsurance and pension fund management company) * Caja de Ingenieros Banca-Seguros (insurance operator) * Caja de Ingenieros Foundation (CSR tool) * Ingenium Shopping (consumer cooperative) * Norbolsa (a company specializing in stock exchange brokerage and value-added financial services). In February 2011 Caja de Ingenieros founded the Caja de Ingenieros Foundation with the purpose of promoting its corporate social responsibility activities. It is a private and non-profit institution that emerged from the transformation of the former Socio-Cultural and Technological Association of Engineers. The Foundation intends to optimize the efficiency of the resources for the promotion of engineering and activities of cultural, social, environmental, beneficial-assistance, professional and technological interest. The social help includes donation of 2 million euros for projects, 105 scholarships and prizes, educational courses for unemployed people, training for members, etc. Politics During the 2017–18 Spanish constitutional crisis, Caja de Ingenieros and Caixa Guissona were the only banks that did not relocate their nominal headquarters out of Catalonia.Cómo es la Caja de Ingenieros, la cooperativa vinculada al 'procés' que ha dado la hipoteca a Pablo Iglesias e Irene Montero , Manuel Gutiérrez, El Mundo, 18 May 2018.

The game generates levels based on music supplied by the player. The player blocks incoming \\"notes\\" with a shield of matching color.  Gameplay  The player uses the HTC Vive's handheld motion sensing controls to operate two shields, colored blue and orange. The player uses these shields to block incoming orbs of the corresponding color. Sometimes the player must block purple orbs by holding both of the shields together. The level generation is done in a similar way to Fitterer's previous Audiosurf series. The user supplies the song, and the game generates a series of orbs to match the beat of the song. Songs can be stored locally, and they could run through YouTube Streaming before YouTube blocked this feature as it violated its license policy.  Reception  Audioshield got generally favorable reviews from critics, with an 81/100 score on Metacritic. Some praised Audioshield for its innovative approach to the music game genre, while others opined that the game lacked replayability, even with a large variety of songs.

World Prodigy, a long ship operated by Ballard Shipping under the Greek flag, was inbound to Providence and Tiverton, Rhode Island when at about 16:40 local time she ran aground on Brenton Reef, about offshore from Brenton Point State Park, after passing the wrong side of a buoy marking the channel. She had a cargo of about 8.1 million gallons of fuel oil. The grounding damaged four of the ship's eight cargo compartments; early reports indicated that as much as a million gallons of oil had spilled, but later estimates put the total at about 300,000 gallons. Oil covered about 50 square miles and washed up on shore, but due to its low viscosity and choppy seas that broke up the slick it evaporated fairly quickly. The Coast Guard estimated that the cleanup cost about $2 million. The collision damaged the hull of World Prodigy in two places, but she was floated off the reef in early July and repaired at a shipyard in New York City. After the collision, World Prodigy's captain, Iakovos Georgudis, was charged with two violations of the Clean Water Act and Ballard Shipping with one. Both the captain and company pleaded guilty; Ballard paid $1 million and Georgudis $10,000 in fines. In December 1990, the National Transportation Safety Board released the results of their investigation of the spill, finding that Captain Georgudis had been suffering from sleep deprivation and was distracted by working on paperwork at the time of the collision. World Prodigy, having arrived at the mouth of the bay earlier than planned, had not taken on a harbor pilot, and shortly before she ran aground, Captain Georgudis had sent both his first officer and watchman away from the bridge to work on other tasks, which the NTSB judged left the ship \\"without a qualified deck watch officer for several minutes prior to the grounding.\\" References Narragansett Bay 1989 Oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill Narragansett Bay oil spill ","title":"1989 Narragansett Bay oil spill"},{"id":"53464269","text":"Davon Montel Godchaux (born November 11, 1994) is an American football nose tackle for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL).

Vázquez has produced and performed experimental dance events in countries including the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina. In 2013, Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art hosted a 30-year retrospective of Vázquez's work.  Biography  Vázquez trained at New York University, where she explored the \\"geographical schizophrenia of many Puerto Rican New Yorkers by dividing her time between the island\\" and the United States. In 1979, she co- founded Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the Taller de Otra Cosa company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as Rompeforma (co-produced and co-directed with Merián Soto), a key festival in the development of the experimental dance scene in Puerto Rico. Her work examines \\"human relationships\\" and has been noted for using \\"fragmented movement in conceptually risky ways.\\" Since 1984, Vázquez has produced and performed experimental dance events in the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina, among other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and improvisation. In 2013, Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art hosted a 30-year retrospective of Vázquez's work entitled Choreography of Error: CONDUCT. For the exhibitions concluding performance, This is NOT a Viveca Vásquez piece/ Esto NO es una pieza de Viveca Vázquez, Vásquez engaged with elements from her prior work in a guided choreographed work performed throughout the museum. In 2018, Vásquez participated as a mentor in a Northwestern University initiative to rebuild arts programs in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, alongside other Puerto Rican artists including Awilda Sterling-Duprey.

First published in the United Kingdom in 2003 by Orion Publishing Group, the book examines police corruption within the Metropolitan Police Service and South Eastern Regional Crime Squad—with particular focus on the 1990s and early 2000s—and the establishment and activities of the force's anti-corruption \\"Ghost Squad\\". Its publication led to a 4-year legal case resulting in a landmark ruling in English defamation law. Libel case Following publication, McLagan and Orion were sued for libel by Michael Charman, a former detective constable with the Flying Squad who had been \\"required to resign\\" from the Metropolitan Police for \\"discreditable conduct\\". Charman alleged that the book libelled him by \\"suggesting that there were 'cogent grounds' of suspecting him of being involved in corruption.\\" In seeking to have Charman's claim for damages dismissed, the author and publisher cited the \\"Reynolds defence\\" of qualified privilege, which protected publication of an allegation if it was made in the public interest and satisfied the test of responsible journalism. In June 2006, at the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Mr Justice Grey ruled that the book \\"did not pass all the necessary tests of \\"responsible journalism\\" and was not entitled to protection\\" of qualified privilege. Following the reaffirmation of the Reynolds defence in Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe Sprl in October 2006, in which the Law Lords sitting in the House of Lords determined that libel judges in the lower courts had been interpreting the criteria too strictly, McLagan and Orion appealed their case. On 11 October 2007, Lord Justice Ward, Lord Justice Sedley and Lord Justice Hooper, sitting in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, allowed the appeal and dismissed Charman's claim for damages—the first time that the Reynolds defence had succeeded in the publication of a book. In their ruling, the judges said they were satisfied that the book was a piece of responsible journalism, that McLagan had taken steps to verify the story and that \\"as a result of his honesty, his expertise on the subject, his careful research and his painstaking evaluation of a mass of material, the book was protected.\\" Caroline Kean, McLagan's solicitor, called the ruling \\"ground-breaking and momentous\\", and said: \\"This is an unambiguous confirmation by the Court of Appeal that Reynolds is alive and kicking. It is not limited to newspapers, it means all media and there is no time constraint. It applies equally to a book and, by analogy, it will apply to a film or a TV programme, providing it is something of proper public interest and a journalist has done his very best to act in the course of responsible journalism.\\" References 2003 non-fiction books British non-fiction books Corruption in the United Kingdom Law enforcement scandals Non-fiction crime books Police misconduct in the United Kingdom English non-fiction books ","title":"Bent Coppers"},{"id":"53464418","text":"Zacharovanyi Krai National Nature Park () (meaning: \\"Enchanted Land\\") is one of the National Parks in Ukraine, located in Zakarpattia Oblast in the country's southwest.

Remezov joined the Red Army in 1918 and fought in the Russian Civil War as a junior commander. After the war, he graduated from the Frunze Military Academy and went on to command the 45th Rifle Division in 1937. Remezov commanded several military districts between 1938 and 1940. After Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June 1941, Remezov briefly commanded 20th Army and subsequently took command of the 13th Army in Belarus on 8 July after its previous commander was mortally wounded. While leading a counterattack four days later, Remezov was severely wounded. After recovering in September, he took command of the North Caucasus Military District and then the new 56th Army in October 1941 which he led in the Battle of Rostov in November 1941. This was his last front-line command; in January 1942 Remezov was transferred to command the South Ural Military District. In April of that year he took command of the 45th Army, which he led for the remainder of the war in rear-security duties. Postwar, he became head of the faculty of the Frunze Military Academy, deputy head of the Dzerzhinsky Military Academy, and assistant commander for military educational institutions of the Moscow Military District, before retiring in 1959.  Early life and Russian Civil War  Remezov was born on 7 June 1896 in Kasli, Perm Governorate. He joined the Red Army in 1918. In 1919, he graduated from the Vyatka Infantry Command Courses. Remezov graduated from the Komintern Higher Tactical Infantry School for Red Army officers in 1921. He fought on the Russian Civil War's Eastern Front against the White Army of Kolchak, commanding a company and a battalion. Remezov transferred to command a separate battalion in the 9th Army's 33rd Kuban Rifle Division on the Southern Front, fighting against the White Army of Wrangel. He later fought in the suppression of an uprising in Vitebsk Governorate.  Interwar  After the end of the war, Remezov became assistant chief of a rifle division's Operations staff department, and later a senior assistant chief. He subsequently became chief of staff of a rifle regiment. In 1930, he became head of a staff department in the Volga Military District and in April 1931 commander of a rifle regiment. In July 1937, he was appointed commander of the 45th Rifle Division. In July 1938, Remezov was promoted to command the new Zhitomir Army Group, and in July 1939, he became commander of the Transbaikal Military District. Remezov took command of the Oryol Military District in July 1940.  World War II  After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, between late June and early July, Remezov temporarily commanded the new 20th Army, formed in the Oryol Military District. On 8 July, he took command of the 13th Army after its previous commander, Pyotr Filatov, was mortally wounded. The 13th Army fought in defensive battles on the Western Front against German troops from the 3rd Panzer Group in the Minsk Fortified Area. Under attack from superior forces, the army was forced to withdraw to the Berezina River around Borisov, and then to the Dnieper, where the army defended the line from Kopys to Novy Bykhov. From 10 July, the army fought in the Battle of Smolensk. On 12 July, he was severely wounded while personally leading a counterattack against the advancing XXIV Army Corps, and was replaced by Vasily Gerasimenko. After recovering, Remezov took command of the North Caucasus Military District on 4 September, leading it until 18 October. During this time, several cavalry divisions were formed in the district. He was transferred to command the 56th Army (initially a separate army) in late October. The army was tasked with defending Rostov-on-Don from the north and northwest. When the German troops broke through, the army's troops were forced to retreat across the Don River. On 23 November, the army became part of the Transcaucasian Front. During the subsequent Rostov Offensive, the 9th and 56th Armies recaptured Rostov. At the end of November the army was transferred to the Southern Front. In mid- December, the army advanced to the Mius River north of Taganrog, where it switched to the defensive and fought in positional battles. In January 1942, Remezov was transferred to command the South Ural Military District. During his tenure in command of the district, he organized new and reserve units to be transferred to the active army on the frontlines, and new training units and schools were created.

Mall was granted a fellowship for the Department of Pathology at the Johns Hopkins University and after positions at other universities, later returned to be the head of the first Anatomy Department at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. There, he reformed the field of anatomy and its educational curriculum. Mall was the founder and the first chief of the Department of Embryology at the Carnegie Institution for Science. He later donated his collection of human embryos that he started as a postgraduate student to the Carnegie Institution for Science.  Biography  = Early life = Franklin Mall was born to German immigrants Franz Mall and Louise Christine Miller, on a farm in Belle Plaine, Iowa. At the age of ten, Mall's mother died, and his stepmother showed no affection towards him. Mall was unhappy in his childhood, and he had little opportunity to challenge his intellect both at home and in school. Mall later met John McCarthy, a teacher at the local academy who greatly impacted Mall's learning experience and life. Mall, in a personal correspondence, wrote that while he hated history as a child, Mr. McCarthy \\"showed [him] he liked it.\\" In addition, Mall had the support of his father who recognized the importance of education. With this newfound appreciation of academic pursuit, Mall was able to attain higher education. = Education = Mall was accepted into the Department of Medicine at the University of Michigan, the school where his family physician had received his training. During his time at Ann Arbor, Mall was drawn to three of his professors: Corydon Ford, Victor Vaughn, and Henry Sewall. Mall was impressed by their pedagogical approach and their extensive knowledge in their respective fields. Their lectures were factual and objective; in addition, laboratory experiments were assigned to reinforce the knowledge that students had gained from lecture. Mall also noted that the majority of the students in his class favored rote memorization as a means to academic success. This was in contrast to his own preference for critical thinking and reasoning, a difference that emerged in his subsequent educational reforms. Mall graduated in June 1883 and went to Germany to further his education in 1884. He spent his first year abroad in Heidelberg to study ophthalmology. In Germany, Mall found his peers to be especially driven and better educated; they were independently planning their future studies. Mall heavily valued the freedom of choice and the liberty afforded to him while studying in Germany. In 1885, Mall went to Leipzig to begin his career in research under the guidance of Wilhelm His. Mall's first project resulted in evidence that contradicted his mentor's position on the origin of the thymus, concluding that it develops from the endoderm instead of the ectoderm. His later revisited the issue and acknowledged the validity of Mall's work. During his time with His, Mall also started a collection of human embryos that he would continue to expand for the rest of his career. With His' recommendation, Mall moved to Carl Ludwig's laboratory later that year, where he was assigned to study the blood vessels and lymphatics of the intestinal villus. Under Ludwig's tutelage, Mall learned methods of injecting blood vessels and lymphatics. Mall took apart the layers of the intestine to examine the blood supply of each layer and the organ as a whole. Using this knowledge, he constructed a model that demonstrated the circulatory relationship in the intestinal organ; he simplified the pattern of blood vessels into a five-ordered model that could be generalized to circulation in all organs. Mall's strong relationships with his mentors grew his curiosity and his affinity to scientific research. He later spread his focus on laboratory research to the American education system. = Personal life = As described by a student, Mall was modest and shy on outward appearance. He was cheerful and known to have a good sense of humor among his friends. Mall was deeply immersed in his research, heavily focused on solving any complications that were presented during the course of his work. Often deep in thought, Mall would sometimes be seen wandering around the hospital building and the city of Baltimore. Otherwise, he was known to be engrossed with work for long periods in his laboratory. Mall first met Mabel Glover while teaching his first class at Johns Hopkins. They got married in 1894 and had two daughters, Margaret and Mary Louise Mall. Mall fell ill after complications from a second operation for the removal of gallstones. He died while being treated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in November 1917.  Career  = Early career = In 1886, Mall returned to the United States to undertake a fellowship in pathology at the Johns Hopkins University. Training under William H. Welch, Mall studied the anatomy of the intestine and stomach. He also expressed interest in bacteriology and connective tissue, discovering the ability of certain bacteria to digest connective tissue. Mall's collaboration with William Halstead on connective tissue led to the development of a new method of surgical suturing for the intestine. In 1888, Mall became a professor of Pathology. After a three year stay in Baltimore, Mall accepted an offer from Stanley Hall for the position of adjunct professor of anatomy at Clark University. While at Clark, Mall used the Born wax-plate method to create the first model of a human embryo in the United States. Furthermore, Mall discovered the vasomotor nerves of the portal vein and founded an embryological research program at the university. In 1892, Mall followed Charles Otis Whitman to Chicago, becoming the professor of Anatomy at the University of Chicago. After a year in Chicago, Mall accepted a professorship at the then newly opened Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. = Return to Johns Hopkins University = Accepting a personal request from William H. Welch, Mall returned to Baltimore in 1893 and set up the Department of Anatomy at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Mall became the first professor of Anatomy, continuing his research on organ structure and embryology. Mall was also given the freedom to run the department and teach according to his ideals of medical education; his focus on explorative learning led him to set up a dissection teaching laboratory that was conveniently located close to the neighborhood abattoir. During his tenure, Mall advanced the methods and conditions employed to preserve biological material. Prior to Mall's exploits, medical schools would only conduct dissections in cold weather to stymie the decomposition of cadavers. Through experimentation on dog cadavers, Mall developed a method of embalming and cold storage that enhanced the preservation of human cadavers and other biological samples. This method subsequently spread to other medical schools and rendered previous practices obsolete. = Educational reforms = As chair of the Department of Anatomy, Mall criticized the existing anatomy curriculum at Johns Hopkins and was especially particular about the lack of practical work such as dissection. Mall introduced a revised curriculum that rarely involved lecture; instead, he believed that self-directed learning, facilitated by practical experience, was optimal. Mall emphasized a strong grounding in human anatomy that would be instrumental in solving pressing anatomical issues. Mall's students would study using primarily the cadavers, textbooks, and models provided. In addition, instructors (himself included) were always present to assist the students during their practical work. His training produced several accomplished biologists, such as Florence R. Sabin and George L. Streeter. However, one of Mall's students, Simon Flexner, noted that Mall's pedagogical approach could not always replicate the same results elsewhere. The available study guides and the competence of the instructors were found to be essential to the success of Mall's curriculum. One of Mall's other goals was to raise the prestige of anatomists and the study of anatomy in America. During his tenure, anatomy was deemed as a basic science, a prerequisite for entering the highly respected surgical field. Mall's convictions led him to expand the anatomical curricula to include histology, histogenesis, and embryology. The collective research spearheaded by Mall and his coworkers at the Department of Anatomy demonstrated an impact comparable to that of the surgical field. Mall's call for educational reform extended beyond anatomy to medical education in general. Mall argued that the largest obstacle was the professors and practitioners themselves, many of whom were involved in private practice. This, coupled with the lack of regulation of tenure faculty meant that students had greatly diminished learning opportunities. Mall was a strong critic of private practice, and felt strongly for the concept of a full-time faculty. Mall often argued with William Osler as a result of their contrasting opinions. He supported the ideals of William H. Welch, Abraham Flexner, and John D. Rockefeller in their bid for the reform of medical education. However, Mall defended the importance of research, criticizing the implementation of policies that established full-time teaching faculty, treating their classroom obligations as an obstacle to scientific advancement.  Embryology  = Contributions to embryology = Mall started his collection of human embryos in 1887 while working under William H. Welch at the Johns Hopkins University. The collection continued to grow while working with Wilhelm His, further expanding after his return to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In his 1917 paper studying abnormal embryo and fetus growth, Mall reported that his collection consisted of approximately 2000 embryos, growing quickly at the rate of about 400 a year. Mall's collection became the foundation of the Carnegie Collection and his embryos were extensively used in scientific papers and reviews. Before founding the Department of Embryology at the Carnegie Institution, Mall looked for ways to standardize the study of human embryology. In collaboration with Franz Keibel, Mall published the Manual of Human Embryology in 1912. The book described the piecewise development of the human body from the embryo and compiled substantial knowledge from the available scientific literature. Mall was also the first person to stage human embryos using photographs of their external structure, first grouping 226 human embryos into 14 stages. This was then expanded to 23 stages by Mall's successor, George L. Streeter. These 23 stages are the standard for the study of embryology and the Carnegie Collection of Embryos. = Department of Embryology = Mall advocated strongly for the establishment of a specialized embryological institution. In a proposal to the Carnegie Institute for Science, Mall noted the sluggish advancements in anatomy and embryology compared to astronomy. This was despite the greater number of faculty and additional resources present within the biological fields. Mall championed the recruitment of scientific talents and the conducive organization of research institutes to efficiently conduct research. In addition, Mall described the institute as a catalyst for the consolidation of embryonic collections which were scattered, poorly maintained, and possessed insufficient detail at that time. Mall laid out several key requirements for this specialized institution. Firstly, it would require a large embryo collection for research. Subsequently, this collection would have to be staged to furnish a more complete understanding of embryonic development in humans. Secondly, the institution would have to be in a large city with a significant medical establishment, such as Berlin, Boston, or Baltimore. This would allow the institution to work closely with gynecologists and private practitioners to expand the collection. Lastly, Mall hoped that the institution would be located in a hub of medical activity where research and medical breakthroughs were continually occurring. In early 1913, Mall received a preliminary grant of $6000 from the Carnegie Institute for Science to organize a broad-spectrum lab addressing scientific problems of varying disciplines. The nature of the work was intentionally designed to be impossible to achieve without collaboration; this was to demonstrate the validity of Mall's argument for an entire Department of Embryology. In the next year, Mall recruited four researchers and many other skilled technicians, modelers, and artists from Europe and the United States to carry out the process of staging the embryos. This group of researchers eventually became the basis of the Department of Embryology. By the end of 1914, Mall successfully obtained a $15,000 grant to found and chair the Department of Embryology at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, that was to be housed in the Johns Hopkins University campus. He served as its first Director, assisted by George Linius Streeter, who took over the Directorship on mall's death.  Scientific research  In his 1905 publication in the American Journal of Anatomy, Mall was the first to show that both the main arteries and the primary veins of the embryo pig could be reached by via the delivery of India Ink directly into the blood vessels of the liver. In 1907, Mall identified a precursor of the internal jugular vein in the head, naming it as the anterior cardinal vein. In addition, Mall showed that the anterior cardinal vein was implicated in the formation of dural sinuses. In a 1910 article entitled \\"Determination of the age of human embryos and fetuses\\" in the Manual of Human Embryology, Mall demonstrated that the nascent atrium of the heart could be identified based on the close proximity of endothelium to the heart muscle. This is in contrast to the significant distance observed between the endothelium and the heart muscle in other localities in the embryonic heart. In 1913, Mall developed an empirical method for calculating the age of a human fetus. Namely, the age of an embryo could be obtained by: Embryo Age (days) = sqrt of total foetal length in cm X 100)  Publications     Franklin P. Mall, Franz Keibel (1910).

This particular work, executed in about 1623 to 1625, now hangs in the Detroit Institute of Arts. The narrative is taken from the deuterocanonical Book of Judith, in which Judith seduces and then murders the general Holofernes. This precise moment illustrates the maidservant Abra wrapping the severed head in a bag, moments after the murder, while Judith keeps watch. The other three paintings are now shown in the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, and the Musee de la Castre, Cannes. The 2001 exhibition catalogue on Artemisia Gentileschi and her father Orazio remarked that \\"the painting is generally recognized as Artemisia's finest work\\".. Others have concurred, and the art historian Letizia Treves concluded that with this painting \\"Artemisia rightly takes her place among the leading artists of the Italian Baroque.\\"  Provenance  The painting was in possession of Prince Brancaccio in 1952, where it was co-owned by Alessandro Morandotti of Rome, Italy, and Adolph Loewi of New York. The whereabouts regarding ownership before this time are unknown. It was then purchased by Leslie H. Green in the same year of 1952 and gifted to the Detroit Institute of Arts in Michigan.  Dating and Attribution  This painting is attributed to Artemisia due to her adoption of Caravaggesque technique and composition. Despite following the works of their contemporary Caravaggio, Artemisia and her father developed their own independent styles. The explicit nature of the artist's interpretation has led writers to believe that there is a deeper meaning behind Artemisia's Judith, drawing back to the rape trial against Agostino Tassi. Identification with the protagonist of the painting is also believed to be an indicator of ownership. The precise date of execution is up for debate, since Artemisia had been traveling around Italy at this time.  Artistic background  Gentileschi was trained to compose still life paintings and portraits, which was common for female artists of the time. Apart from this, she also developed an interest in historical compositions that derived from both biblical and mythological stories. Women artists were limited to particular categories of art to paint from because they were deemed appropriate by societal expectations of the era. Gentileschi was educated by her father, among other artists, to produce these portraits, still lifes, and history paintings. It was frowned upon for women to study the anatomical structures of nude models, especially as a virtuous unmarried woman. Susan Dixon notes that historians have analyzed Gentileschi's works that emphasize the naked female form, building on the idea that the female artist may have used her own body as a reference in the mirror.Dixon, Susan M.; Cavazzini, Patrizia (2008). \\"Artemisia in Her Father's House\\". Italian Baroque Art. Blackwell Publisher. pp. 98–112. . It has been considered that the gender- based limitations of her Roman hometown, along with the absence of a mother for the majority of her life, assisted in Gentileschi's interest and focus on powerful female figures.Cropper, Elizabeth (Winter 1989). \\"Artemisia Gentileschi: The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art. by Mary D. Garrard\\". Renaissance Quarterly. The University of Chicago Press. 42 (4): 864–866. – via JSTOR. Speculation from Elizabeth Cropper asserts that Gentileschi painted the feminine figures in a more heroic lighting, attributing characteristics of tragedy and sadness to these women, while also justifying their actions from an ethical standpoint. This representation of women in positions of power communicated Gentileschi's endorsement of female strength and potential.Garrard, Mary D. (1989). Artemisia Gentileschi: The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art. New Jersey: Princeton University Press. . To the knowledge of historians, Gentileschi's patrons were all male. According to a string of Venetian poems that were sent to Gentileschi in 1627, those that followed the artist and purchased her work did so because she was female. Even though her figures were painted in the nude, contemporary critics expressed that there was more of a sensual wonder related to her womanly traits as an artist. After practicing and honing her artistic abilities for only three years, Gentileschi's father Orazio described his daughter's talent as having superseded the level of the masters. Others who were very close to her, like academician Joachim von Sandrart, commended her work from which exuded \\"knowledge and rationality\\", traits that were not normally connected to women of the time.  Visual Analysis  Judith Slaying Holofernes by Adam Elsheimer, c.1601–1603 The Temptation of St. Francis by Simon Vouet, 1624 Much like her father, Gentileschi's style in the formative years of her career followed that of Caravaggio, mirroring his methods of dark shadows and overall execution. The artist utilized dramatic forms of chiaroscuro, most notably across Judith's half-lit face, her hand shielding the glow of the candle. Jesse M. Locker expresses this particular painting's definitive qualities that quintessentially represent the dramatization within baroque art. Vivid tones of color, ranging from Judith's golden dress to the deep crimson curtain, contribute to an elemental component that is unique to Gentileschi's style, unlike Caravaggio.Richardson, E. P. (1952–1953). \\"A Masterpiece of Baroque Drama\\". Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Arts. The University of Chicago Press. 32 (4): 81–83 – via JSTOR. The shadow cast on Judith's face resembles a crescent moon which is a symbol of Artemis, a reoccurring connection the artist made between the female figures. Artemisia's Judith is always seen with a weapon at the ready. Gentileschi painted the figures and components of the composition with a strong sense of realism. Art historian Mary Garrard attributes this detailed attention to the influence of the Caravaggesque style. The dramatic lighting, playing with the limited glow from the candle and dense shadows, builds tension in the scene. The style of this composition is compared to Adam Elsheimer's Judith Slaying Holofernes, with the tenebristic lighting from the single candle and the drapery at the top corner of the canvas. The dramatically shadowed crossing of Judith's arms connects to the manner and style of Simon Vouet's Temptation of St. Francis, along with the theme of sexual power. There is still much debate over the specific date in which this painting was created, however most scholars secure it within the mid-1620s. = The Story of Judith and Holofernes = This Jewish narrative begins with the attempted siege of Bethulia, an Israelite city, by the Assyrian army, conquering their way to Jerusalem. Judith, a widow living in Bethulia, offers herself up in order to combat the surrender of her people. Accompanied by her maidservant Abra, Judith accepts an invitation to a secluded feast from the Assyrian general Holofernes. His desire to lay with Judith, upon donning her finest garments, along with the large consumption of alcohol ultimately lead to his demise. Once asleep in his bed chamber, Judith arms herself and has Abra keep watch outside. The Hebrew heroine beheads Holofernes and brings the severed head to her people, where they rejoice over her victory. News travels through the ranks of Holofernes' death, leading to the Assyrian army's defeat at the hands of the Bethulians.  History of Judith in Art  Pendentive – Judith and Holofernes by Michelangelo, 1509 The notion of Judith's attempt at seducing Holofernes was not something the early Christian Church deemed appropriate. Religious interpretations instead relayed that God enhanced her beauty without interfering with her innocence as a woman, which led to the increased imagery that connected her to the Virgin Mary. In the Middle Ages, Judith was often cast in the same light as the Virgin, comparing their similar triumphs of beheading characters that represented evil—Holofernes and the devil, respectively. Steering away from an all-encompassing approach to story-telling, Renaissance art marked the beginning of focusing entirely on the suspenseful moments of Judith's tale, particularly when Holofernes is beheaded. A prime example of this is Michelangelo's pendentive of Judith in the Sistine Chapel. Mythological symbols have been implemented in the decoration of Judith's armor, referencing the female war/hunting figures of Artemis, Athena and the Amazons. Donatello is most well-known for this application, but the tradition is connected to other artists, like Sandro Botticelli, Michelangelo, Andrea Mantegna, Giorgio Vasari, Caravaggio and Artemisia Gentileschi. It is speculated by art historian Mary Garrard that Judith served as a righteous symbol from which people in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries looked to in religious and political situations. During the Counter-Reformation, Catholics saw Judith's conquest of Holofernes as their battle and victory over Protestantism, specifically Truth over Heresy.  Interpretations  Women depicted in these biblical times traditionally wore sandals or were barefoot, as opposed to Judith's attire in this painting. Judith, being clad in armor with heavy shoes—typically seen on a warrior or a member of the military—alters the perception of power coming from a source that is usually associated with the sensuous form. Art historians Keith Christiansen and Judith Walker argue that the gauntlet in her hand aims to emphasize the symbolic act of a military champion's defeat and loss of power. This notion is also addressed in regards to Judith, a young widowed woman, being the one to strip Holofernes of his heroic attributes. Holofernes' attraction to Judith, which ultimately leads to a calamitous case of deception and violence, almost mirrors the events of Gentileschi's own life. The symbolic nature and personification of the characters in the biblical story, however, are opposite to the true proceedings of the artist. Art historian E. P. Richardson points out that this painting might serve as somewhat of a self-portrait, as Judith's maidservant possesses physical qualities that match those of Gentileschi, herself. From the analysis of Diane Apostolos-Cappadona, the interpretation of Judith under Artemisia serves as an indicator of the female hero no longer painted in the righteous light of God. = Mary Garrard = In her book, Artemisia Gentileschi: The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art, art historian Mary D. Garrard notes that Gentileschi's depiction of female figures places them in a more heroic lighting. Garrard notes the symbolism that writers have attributed to Judith beheading Holofernes, believing it to be Artemisia's version of retaliation from her personal life. The aftermath of the rape trial involving her father's friend Agostino Tassi, as well as the opinions of those that challenged her virtue, may have influenced her style and content. Having said this, Garrard believes the meaning behind Gentileschi and Judith is much more complex. This inclusion of self-portraiture was common among a wide range of artists, like Titian, Michelangelo, and even Caravaggio. Garrard infers that men feared Gentileschi's series of Judith beheading Holofernes because it brought to life the notion of a woman taking control and ruling over a man. The author analyzes that Artemisia may have also integrated some characteristics of herself into Judith's maidservant, Abra, whose supportive appearance diverges from the unfaithfulness of Gentileschi's former friend, Tuzia. Garrard concludes that the symbolic differences between Judith and Abra connect to the past and present iterations of the artist, herself. Through this, Gentileschi painted a more complex description of the biblical heroine and her loyal companion, in order to, in Garrard's mind, break them free from confining stereotypes.

Investigation A massive search was conducted to find McNaughton as thousands of volunteers led by the armed forces searched the area where Adrien had gone missing. While extensive searching was conducted, no clue to his whereabouts was found. Aftermath In 2009 with the use of new digital technology, his parents hoped to find him as an adult. Also in 2009 when Adrien's parents were contacted by the Toronto Sun, his mother declined to be interviewed and referred questions to the police. A CBC original podcast called Someone Knows Something investigated Adrien McNaughton's disappearance, beginning in 2015. The show is hosted, written and produced by award-winning Canadian filmmaker David Ridgen, and its first episodes were released in March 2016. On April 23, 2016, as part of the investigation for SKS, five highly trained volunteers conducted a search dive of Holmes Lake, looking for the remains of McNaughton, after four separate cadaver dogs indicated that they were detecting human remains in the area. A tooth-like object and small piece of rubber that may have belonged to a shoe were uncovered under eight feet of water. The tooth-like object when examined by the police was found not to be human.

He accompanied William III to England in the 1688 Glorious Revolution and served as Member of Parliament and Governor for Berwick-upon-Tweed from 1689–1690. In April 1690, he was appointed Colonel of Babingtons Regiment, later the 6th Foot, which was sent to Ireland. He fought at The Boyne in July and died of disease before the end of 1690. Life Bolam Parish Church; Babington's first wife Katherine was excommunicated for having the priest pulled from his pulpit. Philip Babington was born in 1632, eldest of seven surviving children of William Babington (died 1648) and Elizabeth Helmes. His family had long-standing links with Northumberland ; during the 1642–1646 First English Civil War, his father was county commissioner under the Militia Ordinance and a Colonel in the New Model Army. Philip attended Christ Church, Oxford in 1650 and later studied law at Gray's Inn, London; in 1662, he married Katherine, widow of George Fenwick, MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed and daughter of Arthur Hesilrige, one of the Five Members whose attempted arrest sparked the Civil Wars. He and Katherine had a son, also called Philip, before her death in 1670; in 1679, he married Anne Webb, daughter of William Webb, headmaster of Berwick School. Hayton & Cruickshanks, Babington, Philip (c.1632–1690) After his death in Ireland, she received a small pension from the government; in 1707, she was still being paid an annual pension of £100. Career Setting near Battle of Dalnaspidal, 1654; Babington's first major military action Babington's military career began in 1654 when he was part of the Protectorate army that ended Glencairn's rising at the Battle of Dalnaspidal. When the 1660 Restoration returned Charles II to the throne, he was a Captain in the Northumberland Militia. Hayton & Cruickshanks, Babington, Philip (c.1632–1690) Katherine's father Sir Arthur escaped execution by the new regime but was held in the Tower of London, where he died in January 1661. Shortly after his marriage, Babington moved to Harnham Hall, near Bolam, Northumberland; he and his wife were both Puritans and in 1666, Katherine was excommunicated by the Church of England for pulling the Bolam parish priest from his pulpit in protest at his sermons. As a result, she was denied churchyard burial when she died in September 1670 and Babington instead built her a tomb in the grounds of Harnham Hall, which still exists. Battle of Saint-Denis (1678), last battle of the Franco-Dutch War; Babington was wounded and taken prisoner In 1674, Harnham Hall was leased to William Veitch (1640–1722), a Scottish Presbyterian radical outlawed from Scotland for his involvement in the 1666 Pentland Rising. Babington resumed his military career by joining the Scots Brigade, a mercenary unit in the Dutch Republic whose origins went back to the 1580s. Despite the name, it normally contained three Scots and three English regiments; the latter were withdrawn when England allied with France in the 1672–1678 Franco-Dutch War but restored after the 1674 Treaty of Westminster ended their involvement. By 1674, the remaining regiments had lost much of their national identity and a deliberate policy was adopted to re-establish them as English and Scottish units. Babington was appointed Captain in one of the restored English regiments, which eventually became the 6th Foot or the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. He was promoted Major after the Battle of Cassel in 1677, then wounded and taken prisoner at Saint- Denis in 1678. Released when the Treaties of Nijmegen ended the Franco-Dutch War in August, in 1682 he was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the English regiment commanded by Sir Henry Belasyse. At this time, his former tenant William Veitch joined the group of English and Scots exiles in Holland, one of whom was the Earl of Argyll; when James II became King in 1685, Veitch reappeared in Northumberland, recruiting for the proposed Monmouth Rebellion in South-West England and Argyll's Rising in Scotland. Gardner, Veitch, William Babington's connection with Veitch meant that when William of Orange, later William III of England sent the Brigade to England to suppress these revolts, James demanded his dismissal. William refused, although he agreed to remove him from command of English troops; he described him as 'a very prudent and honourable man, and assuredly a very brave and excellent officer – even one of the best who have served me here of his nation.' Hayton & Cruickshanks, Babington, Philip (c.1632–1690) In the event, the Brigade arrived after the rebellions had been crushed and returned to the Netherlands in August without seeing any fighting. Battle of the Boyne, July 1690 In early 1688, James demanded the repatriation of the entire Brigade; William refused to comply but used the opportunity to remove officers of doubtful loyalty. For reasons that are unclear, Sir Henry Bellasyse returned to England in April 1688 and Babington replaced him as Colonel. His unit formed part of the army that accompanied William to England in the Glorious Revolution of November 1688; en route, a ship carrying four of its companies was captured but the soldiers released after James went into exile. Columbine's regiment of foot Babington was appointed Governor of Berwick-upon-Tweed and elected to the Convention Parliament as MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed. Hayton & Cruickshanks, Babington, Philip (c.1632–1690) In 1690, his regiment was transferred from the Dutch to the English military establishment, with its seniority backdated to 1685. It was now listed as 'Babington's Regiment' or simply 'Babingtons;' at this time, regiments were considered the personal property of their Colonel and carried their name, which changed when transferred to another. In April 1690, his unit joined the army led by Frederick Schomberg fighting the Jacobites in the 1689–1691 Williamite War in Ireland. Three companies were detached to garrison Charlemont Fort after its capture in May, while the rest fought at the Battle of the Boyne in July, suffering heavy casualties. Following the battle, Babington's was part of a detachment commanded by Lieutenant-General James Douglas that unsuccessfully attempted to capture the Jacobite-held town of Athlone. These minor operations continued and Babington died of disease in Ireland shortly before the end of 1690. References Sources * Cannon, Richard (1839).

Location The Gurupa várzea ecoregion is named after the Ilha Grande de Gurupá, an alluvial island in the mouth of the Amazon. The várzea extends along the lower Amazon River from the mouth of the Tapajós down to the mouth of the Xingu River. It has an area of . The Tapajós-Xingu moist forests lie to the south and the Uatuma-Trombetas moist forests to the north. The Monte Alegre várzea is upstream and the Marajó várzea is downstream along the Amazon. Physical In this region the whitewater Amazon is fed by the blackwater Xingú, Jari, and Tapajós rivers. Elevations are no more than . The Gurupa várzea contains floodplains along the river that are affected by daily Atlantic Ocean tidal fluctuations and seasonal flooding. At the height of the rainy season when the Amazon is in full flood water levels may fluctuate by in a tidal period as the river water is dammed by the rising ocean tide. Outside the rainy season fluctuations may still be from in a tidal period. The region contains a complex maze of channels and sedimentary islands. The soil is made up of sediments carried from the eastern Andes by the rivers during the present Holocene epoch. The river sediments form levees along the margin of the river, behind which are areas of savanna on clay soil and open lakes. Both the savanna and the lakes flood daily, and the lakes grow much larger at the height of the flood season. Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Climate= The Köppen climate classification is \\"Am\\": equatorial, monsoon rainfall. Temperatures are fairly steady throughout the year, ranging from with an average of . Mean annual precipitation is about , with rainfall varying from in October to in April. =Flora= The levees hold tropical rainforest with a height of around . Behind them the ecoregion holds a distinctive form of várzea that is mostly savanna rather than dense rainforest. The clay soil supports robust savanna known as canarana. The rich sediments make the várzea very fertile compared to the terra firme land further from the river. The vegetation stabilizes the soil and is home to a very diverse population of aquatic mammals and freshwater fish. The flooded savanna holds large grasses such as Echinochloa polystachya, Echinochloa spectabilis, Hymenachne amplexicaulis, Hymenachne donacifolia, Leersia hexandra, Paspalum platyaxix, Luziola spruceana, Panicum elephantipes, Paspalum fasciculatum and several Oryza species. Some of the grasses also grow on former channels of the river. Among the grasses there are sedges such as Scirpus cubensis, Cyperus luzulae, Cyperus ferax and Scleria geniculata. The areas of transition between the forest and river hold shrubs and small vines that include Artemisia artemisiifolia, Ipomoea carnea, Polygonum punctatusm, Justicia obtusifolia, Alternanthera philoxeroides, Capironia fistulosa, Sesbania exasperata, Mimosa pigra, Montrichardia linifolia, Clamatis aculeata, Senna reticulata, Phaseolus lineatus, Rhabdadenia macrostoma and Clitonia triquetum. The forest holds larger trees such as Hura crepitans, Triplaris surinamensis, Calycophyllum spruceanum, Cedrela oderata, Pseudobombax munguba, Virola surinamensis and Ceiba pentandra. A variety of trees produce fleshy fruit that supports species of fruit eating primates, bats and fish that enter the forest when it is flooded. These include yellow mombim (Spondias mombim), buriti palm (Mauritia flexuosa), açaí palm (Euterpe oleracea), socoró (Mouriri ulei) and tarumã (Vitex cymosa). =Fauna= This ecoregion hosts 148 mammal species including ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), kinkajou (Potos flavus), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), red-faced spider monkey (Ateles paniscus) and Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus). Endemic mammals include red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas), bare- eared squirrel monkey (Saimiri ustus), red-bellied titi (Callicebus moloch), silvery marmoset (Mico argentatus), black dwarf porcupine (Coendou nycthemera), red acouchi (Myoprocta acouchy), white-faced spiny tree-rat (Echimys chrysurus), giant tree rat (Toromys grandis), crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous) and several species of bat. Endangered mammals include the white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), white-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). 558 bird species have been recorded, including herons and egrets (genera Egretta and Ardea), whistling duck (subfamily Dendrocygninae), sharp-tailed ibis (Cercibis oxycerca) ibis (Theristicus species), roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja), dark-winged trumpeter (Psophia viridis), eared dove (Zenaida auriculata), crimson topaz (Topaza pella),scaled spinetail (Cranioleuca muelleri) and spectacled thrush (Turdus nudigenis). Endangered birds include the scaled spinetail (Cranioleuca muelleri), green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster) and yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis) The waters are home to many fish and turtles, including Arrau turtle (Podocnemis expansa). The largest fish include pacu (genera Metynnis and Mylossoma), tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) and sardinha (Triportheus angulatus). Other fish include piranha (genus Serrasalmus), discus (Symphysodon aequifasciatus), cichlids, characins (family Anostomidae), tetras (genera Hemigrammus and Hyphessobrycon), and catfish (families Aspredinidae, Callichthyidae, Doradidae and Loricariidae). =Status= As of 2017 the World Wildlife Fund classed the ecoregion as \\"Critical/Endangered\\". Human activities in the ecoregion include fishing, subsistence agriculture, selective logging and cattle or water buffalo ranching. The small-scale farmers typically practice diverse agriculture that depends on the forest and does not degrade the land. In the past, large scale production of jute damaged the environment, and mechanized rice production continues today. Elsewhere large areas of natural forest along the Amazon banks have been cleared and the savanna converted to pasturage. Most of the commercially value timber species such as Virola surinamensis and Ceiba pentandra have been harvested. The remaining forest is mostly secondary growth, either managed or unmanaged. Urban sprawl in the city of Monte Alegre has also affected the ecoregion.

In early 2017, she was selected to represent Russia in the 2017 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Flame Is Burning\\", but was subsequently banned from the contest's host country, Ukraine, due to violating Ukrainian law by entering Crimea through Russia in 2015, shortly after the region was annexed by Russia. In response to the ban, Russia ultimately withdrew from the contest. The following year, Samoylova was instead chosen to represent her country in the 2018 edition of the contest in Portugal. Performing \\"I Won't Break\\", she placed 15th out of 18 contestants in the second semi-final, failing to qualify for the grand final. \\"I Won't Break\\" was the first representation of Russia to not reach the final since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004.

He is the Chief Executive of ICCE Ltd., Director of Research at Growth Coaching International, Managing Director of Growth Coaching UK and Professor of Coaching and Positive Psychology at the University of East London. As author, he is best known for his best-selling book An Introduction to Coaching Skills: A Practical Guide. He is also the editor-in-chief of Coaching: An International Journal of Theory, Research and Practice.  Biography  Christian van Nieuwerburgh was born to a Belgian father and a Japanese mother in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1971, thereafter spending his formative years there. While living in Beirut, van Nieuwerburgh attended the American Community School and later completed a BA and MA in English Literature at the American University of Beirut. At the time of his studies, he worked as an English Literature teacher at both secondary school and university level, took up jobs in journalism and translating, and supported the family's Japanese restaurant business. Later on, he moved on to work in the sales and marketing industry. In 1997, van Nieuwerburgh moved to the United Kingdom with his wife and son in order to obtain a PhD in English from the University of Birmingham, where his thesis was titled \\"Representations of Politically Empowered Women on the Elizabethan Stage\\". While working on his PhD, he worked various jobs, including at Waterstones and the Royal Shakespeare Company. He completed his PhD in 2007. In 2012, he completed an MSc in Psychology at the University of East London.  Coaching career  In 2002, van Nieuwerburgh started working at the Warwickshire County Council as Deputy Head of Service, a position he held for 9 years until 2011. In his role, he provided training and professional development services to West Midlands schools and colleges. He took up the role of Executive Coach for the West Midlands Councils in September 2008, holding the role until for 6 years until 2014. Since 2009, van Nieuwerburgh has spent half of his time working as an academic in coaching psychology. From September 2009 to August 2015, van Nieuwerburgh held the position of Senior Lecturer in Coaching Psychology at the University of East London. He later took up the role of Associate Professor of Coaching at the Centre for Coaching and Behavioural Change within the Henley Business School. He returned to the University of East London Stratford Campus as Professor of Coaching and Positive Psychology in April 2017. The other half of van Nieuwerburgh's time has been spent developing his own business - he is the Chief Executive of ICCE Ltd. (International Centre for Coaching in Education), which he established to support \\"the development of coaching initiatives in educational settings globally.\\" He has been holding the roles of Director of Research at Growth Coaching International and Managing Director of Growth Coaching UK since June 2014. In the past, he worked as a Consultant for AQR International. = Beliefs on coaching = In many of his books, van Nieuwerburgh acknowledges the wide range of definitions of coaching. At the same time, based on experience and research of literature, he posits that coaching: * is a structured conversation that takes place between two people; * aims to support a sustainable change in behaviours or ways of thinking; * focuses on learning and development. Van Nieuwerburgh suggests that being a successful coach requires being well-versed in the conversational process and having the necessary skills, such as the ability to actively listen, ask thought- provoking questions, summarise the learning experience, and give and receive feedback. He also maintains that adopting coaching as a \\"way of being\\" is essential, and is developed when the coach is able to reflect on their own experience and practice coaching. = Coaching in education = Van Nieuwerburgh is renowned for his thought leadership in coaching in educational settings. Throughout his academic career, he has explored the purpose of coaching in education, its transformational effects on educational experiences, and how it can be applied in schools and in higher education. Van Nieuwerburgh has suggested that coaching supports the notion that learning should be personalised, and encourage both the student and the teacher to develop throughout the learning experience. For students, opportunities for coaching include collaborating with fellow students to improve grades and skills, both academic and social. For teachers and administrators, coaching can help with transitions into new roles. Coaching is also used to support improvement in teaching skills and enhance performance in education institutions. In 2010-2011, van Nieurwerburgh, together with colleagues from the University of Kent and University of East London, carried out a pilot project at the Sittingbourne Community College, where half of the 1,000 students were deemed to experience barriers to learning for various reasons. Van Nieuwerburgh et al. aimed to raise attainment by delivering coaching training to students over sixteen years old, supported their \\"interim reflective practice coaching sessions\\", and assisted in evaluating the project. In June 2017, van Nieuwerburgh and executive coach John Campbell are scheduled to publish their book titled \\"The Leader's Guide to Coaching in Schools\\", which will provide a step-by-step model for delivering relationship- driven coaching in education.  Personal life  Van Nieuwerburgh is married and has one son. He has noted that his hobbies include traveling and motorcycle riding. He has also expressed an interest in writing fiction and a goal to travel long distances on his motorcycle.  Bibliography  = Academic publications = * Van Nieuwerburgh, C. (2010).

The open source code is maintained by the Dragonchain Foundation. The commercial blockchain platform is maintained by the commercial entity named The Dragon Company. Dragonchain is a public/private hybrid blockchain platform that allows integration with other blockchain protocols, legacy systems, oracles, and API's. Developers can use existing smart contracts from the library or write their own smart contracts to build (decentralized) blockchain applications in known languages. In 2020, Medek Health launched Covid SafePass with the City of Apopka, using Dragonchain blockchain solutions in line with the FDA guidance on Digital Health Policies and Public Health Solutions for COVID-19.[https://orlando- politics.com/2020/05/07/medek-health-city-of-apopka-launching-covid-safepass/ Medek Health, City of Apopka Launching Covid SafePass Hybrid architecture There are various different types30-31 May 2018, Blockchain technology and market transparency, Pavel Ciaian, Joint Research Centre, European Commission, Seville, Spain of blockchain networks. Including but not limited to public, private and consortium blockchains. Both public and private blockchains have their own benefits and pain points. Dragonchain's hybrid architectureDragonchain Architecture documentation allows to keep sensitive business logic private, while also having control over what data can immutably be recorded on public blockchains. The Interchain patent allows for interoperability with other blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Instead of recording all sensitive information on public blockchains, it only takes the hash of the private transaction and Interchains with both Dragonchain community nodes and blockchains like Bitcoin. In the case of Bitcoin the biggest benefit for this use case is its global hash power, resistance against 51% attacks, the immutability and decentralization. Hybrid blockchains are used by entities that need the benefits of both the public and private approach, using Interchain interoperability solutions between legacy systems and other blockchains, both public, private, consortium and permissioned. Private, public, consortium and permissioned blockchains all have their own setbacks and benefits. Entities that do not want to expose sensitive business data to the internet are limited to private blockchains. And entities looking for no access restrictions at all can leverage the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain. The hybrid blockchain ensures sensitive business data stays private on business nodes. While also allowing to validate the hash of the private transactions through consensus algorithms. And even completely decentralized public checkpoints on networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Through Interchain the hash of a private transaction can be placed on the Bitcoin blockchain or any other public blockchain such as Ethereum. This allows to utilize the benefits of blockchains that are focused on specific use cases such as quantum resistant blockchains. This will protect against quantum attacks,Breaking Bitcoin With a Quantum ComputerBlockchain Is Especially at Risk for Quantum Attacks, Scientists Warn although such attack never was successful yet. =Dragon Net= Dragon Net is Dragonchain's scalable and hybrid approach to achieve consensus. It is using independent verification nodes provided by the Dragonchain community and external partners. Verification nodes serve the purpose of verifying blocks from business nodes that contains the hashes of the businesses private transactions, thus not exposing sensitive business logic. Unlike other blockchain platforms, there is no mainnet. Each application or node is its own blockchain, allowing more flexibility and scalability. =Consensus= Consensus is achieved through automated verification from a wide range of entities through Dragonchain's so called 5 Level Spectrum of Trust.Dragonchain Architecture Every Dragonchain that is spun up by a user is at each level is its own non-homogenous or heterogeneous blockchain. This means that all the blockchains and nodes do not all contain exactly the same information. This prevents network congestion as seen with Cryptokitties during the cryptocurrency bubble in 2017. This new approach allows for scalability that is limited to the clouds limit, which is theoretically unbounded as the cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud or other) can scale up infinitely by demand. =Private business Node= Contains all sensitive data and business logic. This is the enterprises or businesses own private blockchain and the location for placement and integration of \\"real world\\" value in the form of transactions and business logic. This information is configured by the business or blockchain user and executed by a blockchain node. =L2 Nodes: Validates the blocks, headers, and signatures= Level 2 nodes are the first check of validity for blocks and their individual transactions from the private business nodes. Which can be done without exposing the actual data or business logic. Rules such as minimum amount of validity verification through L2 Nodes can be defined by enterprises. =L3 Nodes: Network diversity for L2 validations= Level 3 nodes check the diversity of a transaction's Level 2 verification. This level of consensus will ensure that transactions are validated by a sufficient amount of distributed sources. This also provides control and measurement of network effect. And provides distributed security, as an attacker would be required to attack multiple organizations and data centers in order to tamper with these transactions. =L4 Nodes: Serves as a Notary function= A level 4 node provides a notary functionality to the consensus process. Level 4 nodes are hosted by external partners and cryptographically signs any verification record it receives from the Level 3 nodes. = L5 Nodes: Public checkpoint = Level 5 nodes are the final gateway between the Dragonchain platform and other blockchains. After a transaction has successfully passed Level 5 verification, it can finally be hosted on a public chain like ETH, ETC, NEO, or BTC using Interchain. General Data Protection Regulation By nature public blockchains are not compliant with EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union, known as GDPR. In many use cases however there is a need to decentralize blockchain transactions without exposing PII or sensitive business logic. Dragonchain's serverless hybrid blockchain architecture is a solution for various pain points both public and private blockchains have by nature. Not only can the entity choose what data can be private or public. They can also choose in which global region they store both public and private information. With multicloud capabilities, not limited to one cloud provider such as AWS, data that is required to be stored and validated in China only remains in China. And data that is required to be stored and validated within the European Union only remains in the European Union. This is in addition to only exposing the hash of transactions in a global decentralized manner, unless explicitly permitted otherwise. Proof of existence Hybrid blockchain platforms are able to use public blockchains for proof of existence. Dragonchain refers to this as public checkpoints. Ensuring ultimate, decentralized and immutable proof that certain events have occurred. Which can not be done by using private, permissioned or consortium blockchains without interoperability characteristics. Bitcoin is unmatched in terms of global hash power, making it very expensive and unlikely to perform a 51% attack. Thus using Bitcoin for strong transactional proof for the hash of their private business data transactions give it the immutable aspect, making it impossible to tamper with transactions that already occurred.  History  Earliest public documentation of the so-called Disney Private Blockchain Platform dates back to 2014. In June 2016 over 20 use casesDisney Dragonchain - Blockchain use cases that have been explored inside Disney were sharedBlockhain Use Case List/Disney with the World Wide Web Consortium, its blockchain community group. In October 2016 the platform is released as open- source software under the Apache 2.0 license and was mentioned as one of Disney's best open source releases.Disneys best releases may be its open source tools In January 2017 The Dragonchain Foundation was founded, which is a non-profit organization created to maintain the open source code. Joe Roets is the Founder and CEO and has build the commercial Dragonchain entity on top of the open source code, which is now known as the current blockchain company named Dragonchain. Roets was asked by DisneyJoe Roets, CEO of Dragonchain, with over 20 years of software experience through a phone call to develop the architecture from scratch and moved him and his family to Seattle, WA. In 2017 Dragonchain conducted a token saleDisney spinout Dragonchain pursues initial coin offering to build out new blockchain technology that raised as much as $13 million.Disney's Dragonchain announces ICO On February 23, 2018 the Nasdaq listed enterprise Fluent, formerly known as Cogint,Cogint, Inc. Announces Corporate Name Change to Fluent, Inc.The company rebrands following its successful emergence as a standalone company acquired a minority interest in Dragonchain.cogint Subsidiary Acquires Minority Interest in Dragonchain =Tokenized Micro-license= Dragonchain has their own utility token which is a tokenized micro-license (TML), known as Dragonchain, ticker DRGN or referred to as Dragons. They were distributed to token sale participants. The current circulating supply is 238.421.940 DRGN. While the total supply ever available is 433.494.437 DRGN, which is a prime number. The Tokenized Micro-licenses are used throughout the platform and ecosystem. It is a new form of software licensing that can be applied in different ways. Community holders of the Dragon tokens all have a Dragon Days of Slumber Score (DDSS). DDSS determines the user's access to specific features within the Dragonchain ecosystem. It takes into account both the Dragon balance and length of time each Dragon is held. The number of Dragons held, multiplied by the number of days held is how the Dragon Days of Slumber Score is calculated. It is a new form of a tokenized loyalty system based on blockchain. Some of the features include access to the blockchain platform and smart contract library, permission to run L2, L3 or L4 nodes to validate enterprise blocks or voting rights to startup ideas and projects. L2, L3 and L4 nodes are run by the Dragonchain community and selected partners, who are rewarded proportionally, based on the amount of DDSS they have applied to each specific node. An orders of magnitude increase in traffic can be handled by existing network nodes which will earn directly proportional to the increase. Charging for software licenses began in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The original software licensing models such as Microsoft Windows 3.1 or Adobe Photoshop 7.0 serve different purposes. They hold a key that gives access to the software. It comes at a one-time fixed price that includes minor updates, bug fixes and ownership. Yet does not allow to stay updated with new versions without buying it. In the 1990s and 2000s the subscription based licensing became more popular. This is where consumers started paying on a time-base for access to the software. Popular models like this in 2019 are Spotify and Netflix. This allows for access to the most updated versions of software and comes with updates in place, lowering maintenance costs for both the consumers and the vendor. One downside is that consumers end up paying even when they are not using it, unless they pause or cancel their subscription. Dragonchain's patentedTokenized Micro-License Tokenized Micro-License was created to allow a new model for software access. It allows local holding of licenses like early models, but also allows decentralized hosting of the service. And standardized many flexible forms of redemption via software access or execution. Some of the key principles are that the tokens license term interact at every use, execution or access with complimentary license terms embedded in to every service. This creates a flexible framing work for software licensing innovation. For vendors it allows flexible updates, including the terms on blockchain, and consumers do not pay for software that is not being used. Meaning the inevitable passing of time does not penalize existing customers.

The bomb killed two teenagers Geraldine O'Reilly (15) and Patrick Stanely (16). Nobody claimed responsibility for the bombing but security services believe the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) carried out the attack. The attack happened just a few weeks after two people were killed and 127 injured when two car bombs exploded in the centre of Dublin, Republic of Ireland on 1 December 1972. On the same day as the Belturbet bombing, two other bombs exploded in border counties, the first in Clones, County Monaghan which injured two people and the second in Pettigo in County Donegal which caused no deaths or injuries. The three bombs all exploded within 30 minutes of each other. Background The Troubles broke out in August 1969 after the Battle of the Bogside and the 1969 Northern Ireland riots. Republican paramilitaries such as the Provisional IRA and Official IRA waged military campaigns against the Northern Ireland state and British state forces and Loyalist paramilitaries such as the UVF and Ulster Defence Association (UDA) waged a campaign against the Irish nationalist community and IRA members. From early on in the conflict, violence spilled over into the Republic of Ireland with the UVF planting bombs to sabotage services. The first bomb attack by the UVF in the Republic of Ireland happened at Radio Telefis Éireann (RTÉ) headquarters in Donnybrook on 5 August 1969. On 19 October 1969, a loyalist bomb intended for the hydroelectric power station near Ballyshannon, County Donegal, exploded prematurely, injuring 45-year old UVF member Thomas McDowell, who died two days later. In December 1969 the UVF exploded another bomb outside the Garda central detective bureau in Dublin. The nearby telephone exchange headquarters was suspected to have been the bombers' target. In February 1971 the Wolfe Tone statue at St. Stephen’s Green was destroyed by a Loyalist bomb. Bombing On the night of Thursday 28 December at around 10.30 pm the second in a series of three co-ordinated bombs exploded in a red Ford Escort car at Butler Street, Belturbet, County Cavan; the bomb exploded outside the post office in the main street. Two teenagers, Gerladine O'Reilly who was a local girl, aged 15 and Paddy Stanley, aged 16 from Clara, County Offaly, were killed in the bombing. Eight others were seriously injured in the bomb attack. The bomb was estimated to have contained 100 lb of explosives. The cost of the damage from the bombing was estimated at £200,000; twenty-three houses and fourteen cars in Butler Street were damaged by the force of the blast. Pieces of the bomb car were recovered from a 100-yard radius of the bomb site. Patrick Stanley had been making a phone call in a nearby kiosk when the bomb went off. Geraldine O'Reilly, who was on her Christmas holidays from school, was across the road in Slowey's chip shop waiting to be served when the bomb exploded, where she suffered massive head injuries from flying shrapnel and died instantly. Geraldine's brother, Anthony, had been waiting for her outside in his car when the bomb went off; he was seriously injured in the blast. His car was parked just 10 feet from the site of the car bomb. Earlier that night a bomb exploded in a blue Morris 1100 car on Fermanagh Street, Clones, County Monaghan at 10.01 pm seriously injuring two men. A third bomb exploded outside the licensed premises of Hugh Britton at Mullnagoad, in Pettigo, County Donegal. No one was injured but the pub was extensively damaged from the bombing. The cars used in the attacks had been stolen earlier on that same day in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh and all three bombs were in a radius of 20 miles from Enniskillen. The car used in the Belturbet bombing had been driven across the border through the unapproved Aghalane crossing at around 9.00 pm to avoid possibly being confronted by Irish security services. Aftermath Loyalist paramilitary attacks in the Republic of Ireland continued throughout much of the 1970s. Just three weeks later on 20 January 1973 a UVF car bomb exploded in Dublin city, killing one man and injuring fifteen other people. This was the fourth bomb attack in the Republic and third in Dublin within the space of two months. On 17 May 1974, three car bombs exploded in Dublin and a fourth outside a pub in Monaghan in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. 34 people all of whom were civilians were killed in the attacks and around 300 people injured making it the most deadly day of the conflict. On 29 November 1975 two bombs exploded at Dublin airport, killing one person and injuring ten others. On 19 December 1975 a Loyalist car bomb exploded in the border town of Dundalk in County Louth killing two people and injuring 20. Later that same day another Loyalist gang killed three more people in a gun and bomb attack in an Armagh pub. Nobody was convicted for any of the Loyalist bombings in the Republic of Ireland. An award-winning documentary on the atrocity, The Forgotten bomb, was made by Fran McNulty; it featured interviews with the families and locals who remembered the bombing. The programme was broadcast on Shannonside Northern Sound Radio. The journalist won the best regional journalist award in the ESB media awards in 2004 for the programme. Both parents of Patrick Stanley featured in the documentary. The brother of Geraldine O'Reilly, Anthony, who was serious injured in the attack, also featured. A specially sculptured monument was erected in early 2007 on the site of the bomb, dedicated to these two victims.https://www.rte.ie/amp/1028097/ Cavan County Council have erected a monument to commemorate their deaths at the site of the bombing. Several memorial services have been held at the monument. The 30th anniversary of the tragedy heard the father of Patrick Stanley, Joe, make a speech at the site, weeks after the death of Patrick's mother.

It will make use of a SpaceX Starship on a private spaceflight flying a single circumlunar trajectory around the Moon. The passengers will be Maezawa, several artists, and one or two crew members. The project was unveiled in September 2018 and the flight is expected to occur no earlier than 2023. The project objective is to have six to eight accomplished artists travel with Maezawa for free around the Moon on a six-day tour. Maezawa expects the experience of space tourism will inspire the accompanying artists in the creation of new art. The art would be exhibited some time after returning to Earth to help promote peace across the world. Maezawa had previously contracted in 2017 with SpaceX for a lunar flyby in a much smaller Dragon 2 spacecraft launched by a Falcon Heavy launch vehicle which would have carried only two passengers. According to a SpaceX announcement in early 2018, the Falcon Heavy plan was shelved in light of the development of Starship. , Starship is in development. The crewed flight will not take place until after Starship is thoroughly tested and after an uncrewed circumlunar test flight.  History  On February 27, 2017, SpaceX announced that they were planning to fly two space tourists on a free-return trajectory around the Moon, now known to be billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, and one friend.How SpaceX's 1st Passenger Flight Around the Moon with Yusaku Maezawa Will Work. Tariq Malik, Space.com. 18 September 2018. This mission, which would have launched in late 2018, was planned to use the Crew Dragon 2 capsule already developed under contract for NASA's Commercial Crew Program and launched via a Falcon Heavy rocket. As well as being a source of income for the company, any mission would serve as technology development for SpaceX's further plans to colonize Mars. At the time of the 2017 announcement, the Crew Dragon 2 capsule was still under development and the Falcon Heavy had yet to fly. Industry analysts noted that the schedule proposed by SpaceX might be too ambitious, as the capsule was expected to need modifications to handle differences in flight profile between the proposed lunar flight and its main use for crew transfer to space stations orbiting Earth. In February 2018, SpaceX announced it no longer had plans to certify the Falcon Heavy for human spaceflight and that lunar missions would be carried out with the BFR system (now called Starship). Then, on September 14, 2018, SpaceX announced that the previously contracted passenger would be launched aboard the BFR/Starship to flyby the Moon in 2023. Starship will have a pressurized volume of , large common areas, central storage, a galley, and a solar storm shelter. On February 6 2019, the #dearMoon YouTube channel posted a video in which Maezawa discusses the movie First Man with director Damien Chazelle and lead actor Ryan Gosling. In the video, Maezawa officially invites Chazelle to come with him on his #dearMoon project, making Chazelle the first person to be publicly invited to go. However, Chazelle answered that he had to think about it and discuss it with his wife. Objective An artistic depiction of a violinist performing in zero gravity inside the Starship The #dearMoon project passengers will be Yusaku Maezawa and six to eight accomplished artists that Maezawa will invite to travel with him for free. One or two astronauts and an undetermined number of SpaceX pilots might also fly on board.Maezawa on Twitter: After a press conference, we talked a lot at Elon's home. He said that it would be reliable if 1-2 astronauts will be on board. Maezawa expects this flight will inspire the artists in their creation of new art, which will be presented some time after their return to Earth, he hopes this project will help promote peace across the world.First Private Passenger on Lunar BFR Mission.

It referred to the prohibition of dancing in all New York City spaces open to the public selling food and/or drink unless they had obtained a cabaret license. It prohibited \\"musical entertainment, singing, dancing or other form of amusement\\" without a license. Critics argued that the license was expensive and difficult to obtain and that enforcement was arbitrary and weaponized against marginalized groups, but proponents insisted that the law minimized noise complaints. According to the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, > A Cabaret License is required for any business that sells food and / or > beverages to the public and allows patron dancing in a room, place, or > space.  History  The New York City Cabaret Law was passed in 1926, during the Harlem Renaissance. An attorney and professor challenging the cabaret law wrote that the law originally targeted jazz clubs in Harlem and the social mixing of races, but a historian of the period rejects the view and said there is \\"little evidence\\" for that to be the case. In proposing the law, the Committee on Local Laws argued that \\"there has been altogether too much running 'wild' in some of these night clubs and, in the judgement of your Committee, the 'wild' stranger and the foolish native should have the check- rein applied a little bit.\\"Proceedings of Bd. of Aldermen Mun. Assembly of City of New York, Recommendation No. 10, Dec. 7, 1926, at 572 In referring to \\"running wild,\\" the 1926 Committee may have been alluding to the popular 1920s song \\"Runnin' Wild\\", which popularized the Charleston dance. From 1940 to 1967, the New York Police Department issued regulations requiring musicians and other employees in cabarets to obtain a New York City Cabaret Card, and musicians such as Chet Baker, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, and Billie Holiday had their right to perform suspended. In 1971, the Cabaret Law was modified to exempt musical performance \\"by not more than three persons playing piano, organ, accordion or guitar or any stringed instrument,\\" which disproportionately affected jazz since drums, reeds, and horns were not allowed, as was stated in the Chiasson I case and the Chevigny book. The so- called three-musician rule was not found in the original 1926 text of the bill. Throughout its history, the law was selectively enforced with its most notable enforcer, former mayor Rudy Giuliani, resurrecting the dormant rule as part of his implementation of broken windows policing to fine and shut down perceived nuisance bars in the late 1990s.  Cabaret licensing  All applicants for a cabaret license had to be fingerprinted; to provide extensive financial records; to meet specific zoning, surveillance, physical security, fire, building, electrical, health, and record keeping requirements; and to pay the fees associated with each compliance. In 2016, the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs claimed there were then 118 cabaret licenses in a city of 25,100 licensed food service establishments.  Criticism and challenges  The law was heavily criticized both by the general public and from within city government. The limits on types of instruments were ruled unconstitutional in Warren Chiasson v. New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, 132 Misc.2d 640 (N.Y. County Sup. Ct., 1986), and the three-musician limit was found to be unconstitutional in a later decision in the same case in Warren Chiasson v. New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, 138 Misc.2d 394 (N.Y. County Sup. Ct., 1988). Although the code was change to reflect the ruling as to types of instrument, the text to reflect the elimination of the three-musician limit was not corrected in the text of the Administrative Code. A broader challenge to the Cabaret Law and New York City's Zoning Resolution under the New York State Constitution was rejected in John Festa v. New York City Department of Consumer Affair, 12 Misc. 3d 466 (Sup. Ct. NY County 2006), but the court urged legislative review of the law and concluded, \\"Surely, the Big Apple is big enough to find a way to let people dance.\\" In 2015, Brooklyn attorney and bar owner Andrew Muchmore filed a still-ongoing case in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the law, claiming it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution. The Muchmore case challenged the Cabaret Law but not New York City's Zoning Resolution. Repeal In 2017, Dance Liberation Network was formed, co-founded by Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson of Discwoman. They began the 'Let NYC Dance' movement to campaign for the repeal of the law. In June, New York City Councilmember Rafael Espinal introduced a bill for the full repeal of the regulation. It was passed 44-1 by the City Council on October 31, 2017. However, a venue can still be fined or closed by the city, as the law still requires the venue to be located in a zone that allows dancing.

She was born on (23 February 1958) in Kolkata and studied in Lucknow before moving to Mumbai with her parents. She was cast in Sa-Re-Ga-Ma-Pa (1972) after meeting an assistant to director Satyen Bose at a party. She subsequently played in the hit movies Kora Kagaz (1974), Chalte Chalte (1976) and Dildaar (1977).

Nazneen was signed for two more films to be directed by Satyen Bose but they were never made. But working under the veteran director did help her a lot. Satyen Bose also wanted Nazneen to have a screen name. He had suggested Suparna, and then somebody suggested Sonali. However, she chose to be herself, Nazneen. In 1974 she acted in Kora Kagaz, which won her critical acclaim. In the film she played Jaya Bachchan's sister. After Kora Kaagaz she got several offers, but everyone said “there was a wonderful role of a sister”. “They all thought I was good only for goody-goody roles”, Nazneen said in an interview conducted in 1976. Nazneen declined all those offers. She was already playing the leading lady in a few \\"B\\" class films and the producers of these films told Nazneen if she accepted the sisters’ roles their films would suffer at the box office.

The Four Great Kings of the Saigon criminal underworld at the time referred to the four most powerful mobsters in the city, immortalized by the saying: 1st) Đại Cathay, 2nd) Huỳnh Tỳ, 3rd) Ngô Văn Cái, 4th) Ba Thế.  Early life  Dai Cathay was born in 1940 as the son of Lê Văn Cự, who was a gangster in the market area of Cầu Muối. After 1945, Dai's father became a revolutionary and joined the Bình Xuyên army to fight against the French, where his father served under his leader Ba Dương. In 1946, his father was captured and exiled to Côn Đảo prison, where he later died. After his father's death, Đại's mother eventually married a gambler who was also a drug addict. The family then moved to Đỗ Thành Nhân street, located within the fourth district, which at the time was flooded with people who had quit the countryside to the city, and was also known as the place where many of the mobsters in Saigon went to run their illegal operations, making the area a hotbed for the “black society” of Saigon. On top of that, Cathay was treated badly by his stepfather. Shortly thereafter, he dropped out of school and became a shoe shiner and sold newspapers at the Nguyễn Công Trứ and Công Lý crossroads (now Nam Kỳ Khởi Nghĩa) in order to survive. In the area where Đại was selling newspapers, there was also a cinema named Cathay, with the streets around it being a common fighting grounds for the local street boys. Đại fought many times on this street, and was rumored to have never lost a fight, gaining him his namesake “Đại Cathay of Nguyen Cong Tru street”. As a youth wandering around the markets of Saigon in the 4th ward, Đại was known for stealing melons and bananas from the local produce, which he would then share with the many local street kids that he had befriended. Eventually, Đại gained a following of street youths around him, but unlike many other gang leaders, Đại was well known for his generosity and looking out for his street brothers and sisters, always keeping as little to himself as possible while sharing the rest with his gang; he also never punished members who didn’t bring in enough money to the gang, a trait uncommon for gang leaders. It was through this that Đại earned the respect of his fellow peers as the size of his gathering grew. However, Đại and his gang were constantly involved in bloody fights with rival gang factions. On one occasion, while in the second district, because Đại refused to name members of his gang that had been involved in a fight, a group of uniformed police officers forced him to kneel on the ground and swallow a live cockroach in front of his crew, which Cathay vomited in disgust. Despite that, he still would not incriminate his fellow brothers and sisters. In face of such stubbornness, the police sent Đại to the Thủ Đức Juvenile Reformatory. These reformatory facilities’ sole purpose however was to house kids until they became old enough to be conscripted into the military, earning them a reputation as a \\"birthplace of thugs\\". It was in these halls that Cathay later befriended some of his later comrades that would assist him during his reign of Saigon. After leaving the reformatory, Cathay returned to his old haunt near the Cathay theatre and re-established his old order. Đại would proceed to later lead his gang through several clashes with the other gangs in the neighborhood that had taken control during his absence, particularly against Bé Bún's gang as Cathay later seized control over much of the 4th district, defeating all of his major rivals. By the early 1960s, at the age of 20, Đại Cathay was quickly becoming a notorious gangster in Saigon; Đại was in control of nearly all the illicit establishments, such as prostitution houses, drug dens and night clubs in the first and third districts of Saigon. He was also becoming a familiar face around these establishments and befriended engineers, doctors and artists such as Dzach Buu, Dzi Buu and Hoang Sayonara, who would later help craft Đại's business strategy by advising him to open casinos. At around the same time, Đại began to exploit the often corrupt officials of the Saigon government by means of bribery; he was allowed to open many casinos in district 1 of Saigon, and in return, the city officials received monthly payments, which allowed Đại to ever increase his profits and control over the illegal activities in the city.  Clash with Tín Mã Nàm  As Đại sought to increase and expand his criminal rackets, he eventually began to venture some of his activities into the seemingly impenetrable fifth district, Chợ Lớn, which was under the control of Tín Mã Nàm, an infamous mob leader at the time of ethnic Hoa descent who was the leader of the Chinese mafia in Chợ Lớn. Tín Mã Nàm had the physical appearance of a dharmapala, had years of training in Shaolin Kung Fu and Choy Li Fut, and his nickname ngựa điên literally meant the “Mad Horse”. He was known as Hồng Trượng within the Triad, second only to their leader, Hoàng Long (Yellow Dragon), who was the leader of all the Hoa gangs in Chợ Lớn. The clash between Đại Cathay's gang and Tín Mã Nàm's had been taking place over the course of many years. At the beginning of 1964, Đại, followed by Ba Thế and Lâm Đào Già brought two cars and a dozen motorbikes with the markings Goebel, Push, Brumi, Ishia carrying two people per motorbike. The gang then suddenly brought out knives, swords, sticks, bayonets and simultaneously attacked the roadside shops in the Great World district. After a moment of shock, Tín Mã Nàm's gang calmed down, began shouting and ran into the bars to arm themselves with knives, swords, and nunchakus in which afterwards they then hid and counterattacked. Đại Cathay's gang was severely beaten and bloodied, and thus was forced to flee from the scene. In addition, Lâm Đào Già, one of Đại's followers during the battle was wounded and lost one of his fingers, which later earned him the nickname “Nine Fingers”. However, because of the gang battle, many people began to avoid Tín Mã Nàm's establishments and casinos. With his business rapidly declining, Tín Mã Nàm was desperate and so he asked to meet Đại Cathay at Đồng Khánh restaurant in order to negotiate. As a result of the negotiation, Tín Mã Nàm and the Chinese gangs in Chợ Lớn ceded away the entire areas from between Nancy market and District 1, allowing Đại to open more casinos and run a monopoly on illicit activities within those regions.  Becoming “Number One” of the Four Great Kings  At that time, besides Đại, in Saigon, there were also three major mobsters or “kings”; Huỳnh Tỳ, Ngô Văn Cái and Ba Thế. The three mobsters were not pleased with Đại Cathay's rapid expansion in Saigon, so they decided to try to take down Đại in an ambush. Đại Cathay fell prey to their planned ambush where five swordsmen each pulled out their swords and rushed him. Đại miraculously managed to survive the attack. With his wounds still unhealed, and with a single knife in hand, Đại in turn sought after the five men that had attacked him in order to wash away his hatred. All five of the swordsmen were later hunted down and wounded by Đại. After these bloody payments, Đại became the number one of the “Four Great Kings” of the Saigon underworld, giving way to the famous saying: Đại - Tỳ - Cái - Thế, the names of the four mobsters or “kings” who ruled Saigon.  Disappearance/death  In November 1966, Đại Cathay was arrested and placed in Phú Quốc prison after being accused of having masterminded Trần Kim Chi's death when Trần Kim Chi, a subordinate general of Nguyễn Ngọc Loan, was killed when a truck that was loaded with wood drove straight into his car. As a result, Kim Chi's general, Nguyễn Ngọc Loan had Đại Cathay arrested on “special treaty” charges. On the 28th of that November, Đại was placed in a C47 aircraft for transportation to the prison in Phú Quốc island. In 1967, Đại hatched a plan where he had his wife bribe the guards so that he could escape from the prison. On January 7, Đại and his men escaped from the camp, but when he passed through the front gate, the alarmed sound, alerting the guards surrounding the prison. Discovered, Đại was chased to the North part of the island, but the guards never found him and he was never heard from again. As a result of his mysterious death or disappearance, two main theories emerged to explain how Đại could have met his end: * Theory 1: Đại Cathay and his men were shot dead on the night of January 7 after they were discovered by a platoon. * Theory 2: Đại Cathay and his men were captured by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, and when Đại and his men tried to escape, they were shot dead. Lieutenant Trần Tử Thanh later boasted to several reporters in several newspapers before 1975 that he was the one who shot and killed Đại Cathay.  Anecdotes and legacy  *When general Nguyễn Cao Kỳ asked for Đại to become his personal bodyguard, he responded that: -“Wherever I go I have escorts, if I were to escort you, sir, my bodyguards would be unemployed.” *With captain Trần Kim Chi, the chief of the Republic of Vietnam National Police, one evening, Đại Cathay had paid for the Paramouth restaurant's services and specially invited Trần Kim Chi to the banquet. Đại Cathay then said: -“If you, captain, pardon some of my brothers who were arrested, then we will be forever indebted to you.” Trần Kim Chi responded, “Eating is eating, working is working. If you invited me to this banquet to do bargain, then I decline.” -\\"Oh no no,\\" Đại Cathay softly replied, \\"if you do not accept then it is fine. Still, today you were invited here to let us enjoy ourselves. Please captain, this whole restaurant tonight is here just to serve us, so don't be worried about anything.\\" Author Duyên Anh, after hearing Đại Cathay speak about his life as a gangster, and about the bloody battles out on the streets, decided to write the novel titled “Điệu ru nước mắt”, translated to English as “Tale of One Teardrop” which became famous in Vietnam. The protagonist of the novel was Trần Đại, who is the character prototype of Đại Cathay. While reading the book, Đại Cathay pleasantly enjoyed the first part of the novel, with much of it being based on his own real life events. However, at the end of the novel, when the main character Trần Đại lies dying on the fence, Đại seethed with rage, shouting: -“That damn Duyên Anh, how dare he play with me. I loved a woman so much that I got killed and had my body dried up on a fence? (To his men) Go find and cut off his testicles and give them to me!” Upon hearing the news, Duyên Anh fled to Đà Lạt to hide until the end of 1966, when Đại Cathay was arrested by police and sent to Phú Quốc island, in which only then did Anh dare to return to Saigon.  Cinematography  Duyên Anh's novel “Điệu ru nước mắt\\" (Tale of One Teardrop) was based on the life of Đại Cathay, and the novel was later adapted into a film by the same name directed by Lê Hoàng Hoa and was acted by two famous Vietnamese actors at the time Trần Quang and Thanh Nga.

In 1973 this house was the scene of the massacre of 7 Hanafi Muslims by members of the Nation of Islam. It was the largest murder that had ever been committed in Washington, D.C. The brick home continued to be the headquarters of the Hanafi group, and during the 1977 Washington, D.C. attack and hostage taking spokesman Abdul Azziz (35), son-in-law of the group's leader Hanafi Hamaas Abdul Khaalis, stood on the lawn and told journalists that, \\"Heads will be chopped off, a killing room will be set up at B'nai B'rith and heads will be thrown out of windows,\\" unless all demands being made by armed hostage takers at a downtown office building were met. A plaque on the building in the 1970s read: Hanafi Madh-Hab Center. History of the house Until 1969, this \\"Tudor mansion\\" was the home of Thomas A. and Edith B. Cannon, founders of the Washington, D.C. \\"landmark\\" Cannon Steakhouse. The three-story \\"plush\\" residence was purchased in 1971 by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for $78,000,Center in a Storm, Sports Illustrated, 19 February, Peter Carry who donated it for use as the headquarters of the Hanafi Madh‐Hab in November 1972. Many years later, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar recalled that in the summer of 1970, when he was a rookie with the Milwaukee Bucks still known by his birth name, Lew Alcindor, and was new to Islam, Khaalis had expressed an interest in establishing a Hanafi community in Washington. Jabbar located the \\"three story\\" house \\"in an interracial section of Washington; its price was $80,000. I put up the down payment and opened the building to the community. It was a mosque, home, community center, and everybody used it.\\" The property was listed as the Hanafi American Mussulman's Rifle and Pistol Club. Jabbar and his wife Habiba were married by Khaalis at the Hanafi Center, and bought a handsome Tudor- style home a few blocks away where they lived; they continued to have close ties with the center in that period. During the period when it was Hanafi headquarters, 30 people lived in this single-family house. The 2015 Ward 4 Heritage guide states the group of homes of which this house forms part, were \\"impressive homes and subdivisions along 16th Street now inhabited by upper and middle income black professional families – doctors, judges, attorneys, educators, politicians – (that) became known as Washington’s 'Gold Coast.' Together with the “Platinum Coast”, the communities of North Portal Estates and Colonial Village, this area of the ward was characterized by some as the 'bastion of black bourgeoisie.'\\" Newsday described the Shepherd Park neighborhood where the house is located as \\"upper-middle class and largely black.\\" The Washington Post described the neighborhood at the time of the murders as an area where \\"houses sit back from the sidewalk, good-sized solid houses of brick and stone, with enough lawn for a lengthy bout with a mower. There are built-in greenhouses, curving stairways, columns....\\" an area where \\"Jews, white Christians and blacks\\" lived side by side in a neighborhood that \\"has made something of a career of preserving religious and racial calm.\\" The Hanafi Madh‐Hab house is situated next door to a large Orthodox synagogue, Ohev Sholom - The National Synagogue, and across 16th Street from Congregation Tiferet Israel.Landrac, Shira Destinie Jones. Stayed on Freedom's Call: Cooperation Between Jewish And African-American Communities In Washington, DC. LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, 2014. University of Maryland listed the residence in their Global Terrorism Database. 1973 killings The 1973 Hanafi Muslim massacre, an attack by the Nation of Islam on Hanafi Muslim community, took place in this house. Two adults and a child were shot to death, 4 other children were drowned whose ages ranged from 9 days to 10 years old. Two others were severely injured. Four men from the Nation of Islam Mosque No. 12 were accused of the crime. =Impact= After the 1973 murders, \\"The azaleas were cut down and cleared away. Hedges, shrubbery, anything that might hide an intruder - were leveled until a bare expanse of gravel had replaced the garden. The windows were barred; a spotlight shone on the front steps. And Hanafi guards, armed with machetes and long Japanese swords, began a night-and-day vigil outside the Khaalis house. Every time a neighbor passed the Hanafi house the guards were there, pacing, walking steadily down the gravel field and back again. In winter they put on overcoats and warm hats and kept pacing. It made many neighbors uneasy.\\" Newsday described the conversion of the \\"large brick and fieldstone Tudor house\\" into a \\"fortress;\\" basement windows had been bricked over and iron bars sealed other windows. Khaalis's son-in-law, Abdul Aziz, boasted about the explosives inside to a reporter, claiming that \\"If people want to storm this house, that's it for the house.\\" Aziz asserted that \\"This is a Holy War in the sense that Allah tells you through the Koran... it seeks vengeance.\\" 1977 hostage crisis Khaalis' goal in attacking and taking hostages at Washington, D.C.'s John A. Wilson City Hall, the national B'nai B'rith headquarters, and the Islamic Center of Washington was to force the federal government to turn custody of the five black Muslims convicted in the 1973 murders at 7700 16th St. over to him for purposes of exacting revenge. He had been \\"stockpiling\\" weapons in the house on 16th street as he planned the attack. During the 1977 Washington hostage taking, The Washington Post described the building as \\"an armed camp\\" and wrote that \\"around the clock, at least one sentry armed with what appeared from the street to be a rifle, paced back and forth in front of half a dozen tall flagpoles.\\" People also reported \\"machete practice sessions on the lawn.\\" Members of the sect gave interviews from this house during the hostage taking. Amina Khaalis, a survivor of the 1973 massacre and daughter of sect leader Khaalis, said in a telephone interview that, \\"We obey the laws of the country. As long as it doesn't contradict with our Muslim law. Muslim law comes first.\\" And, \\"we're ready to fight to the death also, in this house,\\" she said. \\"And if it means us fighting to the death also, so be it. Babies and all.\\" Her husband Abdul Aziz, who walked out onto the lawn to speak with the press, said, \\"Allah tells you that by the way of the Holy Koran, when you are persecuted, you retaliable . . . It's a war against . . . the enemies of Islam.\\" The militant Jewish Defense League threatened to hold a demonstration at the house during the hostage crisis. Khadyja Khaalis, wife of the sect leader, held a press conference on the steps of the house after the hostages were released, in which she declared that “We Hanafi Mussulmans throughout America say to the Zionist Jew‐controlled J.D.L. and all Zionist Jews and their allies that they will write their own epitaph in self‐destruction and the blood of their people, as we fear Allah, nothing else. We, the Hanafi Mussulmans, sincerely warn all Zionist Jews and their allies that we are not alone and not to be misguided by what they think they see.” =Impact= Neighbors in the upscale, politically liberal, racially mixed neighborhood, which had been protective of the sect living in the house on 16th Street in the wake of the 1973 murders, responded to the group's 1977 armed attack, murders and hostage taking by \\"discussing ways to rid the (neighborhood) of the group of conservative, Orthodox Moslems,\\" according to The New York Times .
