The Biltmore Hotel Tbilisi is the first Biltmore outside of the United States and first hotel in the newly presented upscale luxury Biltmore Collection of the Millennium & Copthorne Hotels. The Grand Opening ceremony took place on July 31, 2016. Located on Rustaveli Avenue, the city's main thoroughfare, the hotel occupies the historical Soviet-era building IMELI, constructed in the 1930s, and a 32-floor skyscraper, built in the 2010s. Remaking of the old building as well as erection of the new one was heavily criticized by preservationists. About $140 million was invested in the new hotel, mostly by the United Arab Emirates-based construction company Dhabi Group.  IMELI  IMELI building in 1938 The IMELI building, an example of the Stalin-era Socialist Classicism, was constructed in Tbilisi, the capital of then-Soviet Georgia, between 1934 and 1938 based on the design by Alexey Shchusev to house a Tbilisi-branch of the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute. IMELI (·Éò·Éõ·Éî·Éö·Éò) is a Georgian rendition of the Institute's Russian name acronymed as IMEL (), which remained colloquial in Tbilisi even after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Shchusev's design was eclectic, featuring elements of both Socialist Classicism and Constructivism. Both the exterior and interior are richly decorated with wooden and metal works, as well as with various Georgian marbles and natural stones. The facades were adorned by the leading Georgian sculptors of that time‚ÄîIakob Nikoladze and Tamar Abakelia. In 1986 the building was listed as architectural heritage. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the building was used for government purposes and some Communist-era symbols and decorations were removed from the facades. It housed the Parliament of Georgia from 1992 to 1995. It was where the Georgia's first post-Soviet constitution was adopted on 25 August 1995. Later, it served as the Constitutional Court of Georgia and the Central Election Commission office. In 2007, after briefly considering reconstruction of the IMELI building to house the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was delisted by the government of Georgia and sold to the Capital Vostok company with the intention to build a luxury five-star Kempinski hotel. The suggested architectural development was designed by Berlin-based architects Christoph Kohl and Rob Krier. In the process of renovation, the investor started to demolish the building without due permission and IMELI lost a number of its original elements, leading to a series of protests from preservationists. By 2008, the project had staggered and the building was sold to the Abu Dhabi United Group, which agreed to stop demolition and preserve the historical fa√ßade of the building. In 2011, Tbilisi City Hall gave permission to the new investor to construct, next to the Shchusev building, a 300-metre-high glass skyscraper, which now towers over the largely 19th and early 20th-century architecture of Rustaveli Avenue and is connected to the IMELI building via a glass walkway.

In compliance with the TEU, the UK gave formal notice to the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the EU to allow withdrawal negotiations to begin. The process of leaving the EU was initiated by a referendum held in June 2016 which favoured British withdrawal from the EU by a 4% margin (52% to 48%). In October 2016, the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, announced that Article 50 would be invoked by \\"the first quarter of 2017\\". On 24 January 2017 the Supreme Court ruled in the Miller case that the process could not be initiated without an authorising act of Parliament, and unanimously ruled against the Scottish Government's claim in respect of devolution. Consequently, the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 empowering the prime minister to invoke Article 50 was enacted in March 2017. Invocation of Article 50 occurred on 29 March 2017, when Sir Tim Barrow, the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the European Union, formally delivered by hand a letter signed by Prime Minister Theresa May to Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council in Brussels. The letter also contained the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom). This means that the UK was scheduled to cease being a member of the EU at the end of 29 March 2019 Brussels time (UTC+1), which would be 23:00 on 29 March British time. This was extended by two weeks to give the House of Commons time to reconsider its rejection of the agreement on withdrawal conditions. The UK was due to leave the EU at the end of 12 April 2019 (24:00 Central European summer time; 23:00 British summer time), however a further 'flexible' extension was granted until 31 October 2019 after talks at the European Council meeting on 10 April. After another extension in October 2019 and subsequent negotiations, a withdrawal agreement was negotiated in late October 2019 and ratified by both parties in January 2020: consequently the UK left the EU at 23:00 on 31 January 2020 and entered the transition period.  Background  The first ever invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union was by the United Kingdom, after the Leave vote in the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union. When David Cameron resigned in June 2016, he stated that the next Prime Minister should activate Article 50 and begin negotiations with the EU. At the time of the invocation of Article 50 the United Kingdom had been a full member state of the European Communities / European Union since its accession on 1 January 1973, some forty-four years earlier. Views on invocation = Necessity of invoking Article 50 = The UK government stated that they would expect a leave vote to be followed by withdrawal, not by a second vote. In a leaflet sent out before the referendum, the UK government stated \\"This is your decision. The Government will implement what you decide.\\" Although Cameron stated during the campaign that he would invoke Article 50 straight away in the event of a leave victory, he refused to allow the Civil Service to make any contingency plans, something the Foreign Affairs Select Committee later described as \\"an act of gross negligence\\". Unlike the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, which contained provisions for an \\"alternative vote\\" system which would have become operative only if approved by the voting result in the referendum held under the Act, the European Union Referendum Act 2015 did not state that the government could lawfully invoke Article 50 without a further authorising Act of Parliament. Following the referendum result, Cameron announced before the Conservative Party conference that he would resign by October, and that it would be for the incoming Prime Minister to invoke Article 50. He said that \\"A negotiation with the European Union will need to begin under a new Prime Minister, and I think it is right that this new Prime Minister takes the decision about when to trigger Article 50 and start the formal and legal process of leaving the EU.\\" After a court case, the government introduced a bill that was passed as the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017. =Article 50 process= Article 50 provides an invocation procedure whereby a member can notify the European Council and there is a negotiation period of up to two years, after which the treaties cease to apply with respect to that member‚Äîalthough a leaving agreement may be agreed by qualified majority voting.Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union. In this case, 20 remaining EU countries with a combined population of 65% must agree to the deal. Unless the Council of the European Union unanimously agrees to extensions, the timing for the UK leaving under the article is the mandatory period ending at the second anniversary of the country giving official notice to the EU. The assumption is that new agreements will be negotiated during the mandatory two-year period, but there is no legal requirement that agreements have to be made. Some aspects, such as new trade agreements, may be difficult to negotiate until after the UK has formally left the EU. = Renegotiation of membership terms = Negotiations after invoking Article 50 cannot be used to renegotiate the conditions of future membership as Article 50 does not provide the legal basis of withdrawing a decision to leave. On the other hand, the constitutional lawyer and retired German Supreme Court judge Udo Di Fabio has stated that *The Lisbon Treaty does not forbid an exiting country to withdraw its application for leaving, because the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties prescribes an initial notification procedure, a kind of period of notice. Before a contract under international law [such as the Lisbon Treaty], which had been agreed without specifying details of giving notice, can be effectively cancelled, it is required that the intention to do so is expressed 12 months in advance: in this matter there exists the principle of preserving existing agreements and international organisations. In this light, the declaration of the intention to leave would itself be, under EU law, not a notice of cancellation. *Separate negotiations of the EU institutions with pro-EU regions [London, Scotland or Northern Ireland] would constitute a violation of the Lisbon Treaty, according to which the integrity of a member country is explicitly put under protection. A February 2016 briefing note for the European Parliament stated that a withdrawal from the EU ends, from then on, the application of the EU Treaties in the withdrawing state, although any national acts previously adopted for implementing or transposing EU law would remain valid until amended or repealed, and a withdrawal agreement would need to deal with phasing-out EU financial programmes. The note mentions that a member withdrawing from the EU would need to enact its own new legislation in any field of exclusive EU competence, and that complete isolation of a withdrawing state would be impossible if there is to be a future relationship between the former member and the EU, but that a withdrawal agreement could have transitional provisions for rights deriving from EU citizenship and other rights deriving from EU law that the withdrawal would otherwise extinguish.Eva-Maria Poptcheva, Article 50 TEU: Withdrawal of a Member State from the EU, Briefing Note for European Parliament.(Note: \\"The content of this document is the sole responsibility of the author and any opinions expressed therein do not necessarily represent the official position of the European Parliament.\\") The Common Fisheries Policy is one of the exclusive competences reserved for the European Union; others concern customs union, competition rules, monetary policy and concluding international agreements. In oral evidence to a Select Committee of the House of Lords in March 2016, one of the legal experts (Sir David Edward) stated that the German text of Article 50 could be taken to mean that the structure of future relations between the UK and EU will already have been established at the point when withdrawal takes place, which could be taken as a difference from the English text \\"the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with the withdrawing state setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal and taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union\\". =Arguments for moving slowly = Nicolas J. Firzli of the World Pensions Council (WPC) argued in July 2016 that it could be in Britain's national interest to proceed slowly in the following months; Her Majesty's Government might want to push Brussels to accept the principles of a free trade deal before invoking Article 50, hopefully gaining support from some other member states whose economy is strongly tied to the UK, thus \\"allowing a more nimble union to focus on the free trade of goods and services without undue bureaucratic burdens, modern antitrust law and stronger external borders, leaving the rest to member states\\". Prime Minister Theresa May confirmed that discussions with the EU would not start in 2016. \\"I want to work with ... the European council in a constructive spirit to make this a sensible and orderly departure\\", she said. \\"All of us will need time to prepare for these negotiations and the United Kingdom will not invoke article 50 until our objectives are clear.\\" In a joint press conference with May on 20 July, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel supported the UK's position in this respect: \\"We all have an interest in this matter being carefully prepared, positions being clearly defined and delineated. I think it is absolutely necessary to have a certain time to prepare for that.\\" =Scottish Parliament = In February 2017, the Scottish Parliament voted with overwhelming majority against invoking Article 50.Scottish parliament rejects Brexit in non-binding vote, DW, 7 February 2017 After the UK Government had nevertheless chosen to invoke Article 50, the Scottish Government was formally authorised by the Parliament by a vote of 69 to 59 to seek to hold a second Scottish independence referendum.  Pre- notification negotiations  Prior to the UK Government's invocation of Article 50, the UK stayed a member of the EU, had to continue to fulfill all EU-related treaties including possible future agreements, and was legally treated as a member. The EU has no framework to exclude the UK‚Äîor any member‚Äîas long as Article 50 was not invoked, and the UK did not violate EU laws. However, if the UK had breached EU law significantly, there were legal venues to discharge the UK from the EU via Article 7, the so-called \\"nuclear option\\" which allows the EU to cancel membership of a state that breaches fundamental EU principles, a test that is hard to pass. Article 7 does not allow forced cancellation of membership, only denial of rights such as free trade, free movement and voting rights. At a meeting of the Heads of Government of the other states in June 2016, leaders decided that they would not start any negotiation before the UK formally invoked Article 50. Consequently, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, ordered all members of the EU Commission not to engage in any kind of contact with UK parties regarding Brexit. Media statements of various kinds still occurred. For example, on 29 June 2016, European Council president Donald Tusk told the UK that they would not be allowed access to the European Single Market unless they accept its four freedoms of goods, capital, services, and people. Angela Merkel said, \\"We'll ensure that negotiations don't take place according to the principle of cherry-picking ... It must and will make a noticeable difference whether a country wants to be a member of the family of the European Union or not\\". To strike and extend trade agreements between the UK and non-EU states, the Department for International Trade (DIT) was created by Prime Minister Theresa May, shortly after she took office on 13 July 2016. As of February 2017, the DIT employs about 200 trade negotiators and is overseen by Liam Fox, the Secretary of State for International Trade. Subjects of negotiation Since Article 50 has been invoked, the United Kingdom will negotiate with the European Union the status of the 1.2 million UK citizens living in the EU, the status of the 3.2 million EU nationals living in the UK. Issues relating to immigration, free trade, the freedom of movement, the Irish border, intelligence-sharing and financial services will also be discussed.  Process  = Initial speculation = During the referendum David Cameron stated that, \\"If the British people vote to leave, [they] would rightly expect [the invoking of Article 50] to start straight away\\", and there was speculation that he would do this on the morning with Eurosceptic MPs calling for caution to assess the negotiating position and Jeremy Corbyn calling for immediate invocation. During a 27 June 2016 meeting, the Cabinet decided to establish a unit of civil servants, headed by senior Conservative Oliver Letwin, who would proceed with \\"intensive work on the issues that will need to be worked through in order to present options and advice to a new Prime Minister and a new Cabinet\\". = Conservative Party Leadership election = Instead of invoking Article 50 Cameron resigned as Prime Minister, leaving the timing to a successor. There was speculation in the UK that it would be delayed, and the European Commission in July 2016 believed that Article 50 notification would not be made before September 2017. Following the referendum result, Cameron announced that he would resign before the Conservative party conference in October and that it would be for the incoming Prime Minister to invoke Article 50: Cameron made it clear that his successor as Prime Minister should activate Article 50 and begin negotiations with the EU. Among the candidates for the Conservative Party leadership election there were disagreements about when this should be: Theresa May said that the UK needed a clear negotiating position before triggering Article 50, and that she would not do so in 2016, while Andrea Leadsom said that she would trigger it as soon as possible. = EU views = According to EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, Britain had to proceed promptly. In June 2016 he said: \\"There needs to be a notification by the country concerned of its intention to leave (the EU), hence the request (to British Prime Minister David Cameron) to act quickly.\\" In addition, the remaining EU leaders issued a joint statement on 26 June 2016 regretting but respecting Britain's decision and asking them to proceed quickly in accordance with Article 50. The statement also added: \\"We stand ready to launch negotiations swiftly with the United Kingdom regarding the terms and conditions of its withdrawal from the European Union. Until this process of negotiations is over, the United Kingdom remains a member of the European Union, with all the rights and obligations that derive from this. According to the Treaties which the United Kingdom has ratified, EU law continues to apply to the full to and in the United Kingdom until it is no longer a Member.\\" An EU Parliament motion passed on 28 June 2016 called for the UK immediately to trigger Article 50 and start the exit process. There is no mechanism allowing the EU to invoke the article. As long as the UK Government has not invoked Article 50, the UK stays a member of the EU; must continue to fulfil all EU-related treaties, including possible future agreements; and should legally be treated as a member. The EU has no framework to exclude the UK as long as Article 50 is not invoked, and the UK does not violate EU laws. However, if the UK were to breach EU law significantly, there are legal provisions to allow the EU to cancel membership of a state that breaches fundamental EU principles, a test that is hard to pass. These do not allow forced cancellation of membership, only denial of rights such as free trade, free movement and voting rights. Prime Minister Theresa May made it clear that discussions with the EU would not start in 2016. \\"I want to work with ... the European Council in a constructive spirit to make this a sensible and orderly departure.\\" she said. \\"All of us will need time to prepare for these negotiations and the United Kingdom will not invoke article 50 until our objectives are clear.\\" In a joint press conference with May on 20 July 2016, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel supported the UK's position in this respect: \\"We all have an interest in this matter being carefully prepared, positions being clearly defined and delineated. I think it is absolutely necessary to have a certain time to prepare for that.\\" = The Miller Case = The Supreme Court ruled in the Miller case that an explicit Act of Parliament is necessary to authorise the invocation of Article 50. The Constitution of the United Kingdom is unwritten and it operates on convention and legal precedent: this question is without precedent and so the legal position was thought to be unclear. The Government argued that the use of prerogative powers to enact the referendum result was constitutionally proper and consistent with domestic law whereas the opposing view was that prerogative powers could not be used to set aside rights previously established by Parliament. Three distinct groups of citizens ‚Äì one supported by crowd funding ‚Äì brought a case before the High Court of England and Wales to challenge the government's interpretation of the law. On 13 October 2016, the High Court commenced hearing opening arguments. The Government argued that it would be constitutionally impermissible for the court to make a declaration that it [Her Majesty's Government] could not lawfully issue such a notification. The government stated that such a declaration [by the Court] would trespass on proceedings in Parliament, as the Court had ruled previously when rejecting a challenge to the validity of the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty after the passing of the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 but without a referendum. Opening the case for the Plaintiffs, Lord Pannick QC told the Court that the case \\"raises an issue of fundamental constitutional importance concerning the limits of the power of the Executive\\". He argued Mrs May could not use royal prerogative powers to remove rights established by the European Communities Act 1972, which made EU law part of UK law, as it was for Parliament to decide whether or not to maintain those statutory rights. On 3 November 2016, the High Court ruled in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union that only Parliament could make the decision on when or indeed whether to invoke Article 50. The Government's appeal to the Supreme Court took place from 5 to 8 December 2016. On 24 January 2017, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the lower court by a majority of eight to three, declaring that the invocation of Article 50 could only come by an Act of Parliament. The case was seen as having constitutional significance in deciding the scope of the royal prerogative in foreign affairs. The Supreme Court also ruled that devolved legislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have no legal right to veto the act. = Other court cases = In February 2017, the High Court rejected a claim of several people against the Secretary of State centred on the UK's links with the European Economic Area. However, a challenge to the notice of withdrawal continues in the courts of Scotland and in the European Court of Justice (below, \\"Reversibility\\"). = UK Parliament = On 2 October 2016, the Prime Minister, Theresa May, announced that she intended to invoke Article 50 by the end of March 2017, meaning that the UK would be on a course to leave the EU by the end of March 2019. On 7 December 2016, the House of Commons approved a non-legally-binding motion supporting Article 50's invocation by 31 March 2017. As a direct consequence of the Supreme Court ruling the House of Commons voted by a majority of 384 votes (498 to 114) to approve the second reading of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 to allow the Prime Minister to invoke Article 50 unconditionally. On 7 March 2017 the bill passed the House of Lords, though with two amendments. Following further votes in the Commons and the Lords on 13 March 2017, these two amendments did not become part of the bill, so the bill passed its final reading unamended and it received royal assent on 16 March 2017. Invocation of Article 50 has been challenged in the UK courts on the basis that the UK Parliament never voted to leave the EU despite the clear decision of the Supreme Court ruling. Campaigners argue the referendum result was not ratified by an act of Parliament, which they claim means the triggering of Article 50 is invalid. According to David Davis MP when presenting the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017: \\"It is not a Bill about whether the UK should leave the European Union or, indeed, about how it should do so; it is simply about Parliament empowering the Government to implement a decision already made ‚Äì a point of no return already passed\\", further saying that the Bill was \\"the beginning of a process to ensure that the decision made by the people last June is honoured\\".House of Commons Hansard \\"European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill debate\\" = Formal notification = In October 2016, the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, announced that the government would trigger Article 50 by \\"the first quarter of 2017\\". She announced on Monday 20 March 2017 that the UK would formally invoke Article 50 on Wednesday 29 March 2017, meeting her self-imposed deadline. The letter invoking Article 50 was signed by May on 28 March 2017, and was hand-delivered on 29 March by Tim Barrow, the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the European Union, to Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council in Brussels. The letter also contained the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom). On 31 March, Tusk sent draft negotiation guidelines to the leaders of the EU to prepare for the upcoming Brexit negotiations. Reversibility Differing views have been expressed on whether the UK's invocation of Article 50 can be revoked. In December 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that a country that had given notice under Article 50 to leave the EU could exercise its sovereign right to revoke its notice. British government lawyers had argued that the Article 50 process could not be stopped. An Irish court case challenging this view was later abandoned. Lord Kerr has asserted that the Article 50 notification can be revoked unilaterally. UK barrister Hugh Mercer QC noted before Article 50 was invoked that: \\"Though Art. 50 includes no express provision for revocation of the UK notice, it is clearly arguable for example on the grounds of the duties of sincere cooperation between member states (Art. 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union) that, were the UK to feel on mature reflection that leaving the EU and/or the European Economic Area (EEA) is not in the national interest, the notice under Art. 50 could be revoked.\\" US law professor Jens Dammann argues: \\"there are strong policy reasons for allowing a Member State to rescind its declaration of withdrawal until the moment that the State‚Äôs membership in the European Union actually ends\\" and \\"there are persuasive doctrinal arguments justifying the recognition of such a right as a matter of black letter law\\". Preview. EU politicians have said that if the UK changes its mind, they are sure a political formula will be found to reverse article 50, regardless of the technical specifics of the law. According to the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble, \\"The British Government has said we will stay with the Brexit. We take the decision as a matter of respect. But if they wanted to change their decision, of course, they would find open doors.\\" On 29 March 2017, the EU Commission stated \\"It is up to the United Kingdom to trigger Article 50. But once triggered, it cannot be unilaterally reversed. Notification is a point of no return. Article 50 does not provide for the unilateral withdrawal of notification.\\" Similarly, the European Parliament Brexit committee headed by Guy Verhofstadt has stated that \\"a revocation of notification [by Article 50] needs to be subject to conditions set by all EU27, so that it cannot be used as a procedural device or abused in an attempt to improve on the current terms of the United Kingdom‚Äôs membership\\". The European Union Policy Department for Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs has stated that a hypothetical right of revocation can only be examined and confirmed or infirmed by the EU institution competent to this purpose, namely the CJEU. However, in July 2016 former German Supreme Court judge Udo Di Fabio had argued, on the basis of international law, that a triggering of Article 50 can be revoked: \\"in EU law, the declaration of intention to leave is not itself a notification of withdrawal; rather, at any time and at least until the Treaty becomes inapplicable, it can be retracted or declared to have become redundant\\". Original: \\"die Erkl√§rung √ºber die Absicht eines Austritts im Unionsrecht noch selbst gar keine K√ºndigung w√§re, sondern jederzeit bis l√§ngstens zur Unanwendbarkeit der Vertr√§ge widerrufen oder f√ºr gegenstandslos erkl√§rt werden kann\\". In October 2017, barrister Jessica Simor QC of the leading London law firm Matrix Chambers lodged a freedom of information request to the UK Prime Minister for disclosure of legal advice which, she claims, states that the UK government can withdraw the Article 50 application at any time before 29 March 2019; she notes that Article 50 provides only for notification of an intention to withdraw and contends that such intention can be changed at any time before actual withdrawal. In February 2018, a crowd-funded petition by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians for judicial review of the notice was rejected by Scotland's Court of Session, but in March the Court overturned that decision. On 20 November 2018, an attempt by the British government to prevent the European Court of Justice (ECJ) hearing the case failed and on 27 November 2018 the ECJ examined the legal arguments. On 4 December 2018, the responsible Advocate General to the ECJ published his preliminary opinion that a country could unilaterally cancel its withdrawal from the EU should it wish to do so, by simple notice, prior to actual departure.Article 50: Law officer says UK can cancel Brexit BBC News While not being a formal ECJ judgement, it was seen as a good indication of the court's eventual decision. On 10 December the ECJ decided that a notice of withdrawal can be revoked unilaterally, i.e. without approval by the other EU members, provided that the decision to revoke is made according to the country's constitutionally established procedures. The case now returns to the Court of Session, to apply this ruling. The British Government immediately affirmed that it did not intend to propose revocation.  Extension  Article 50 allows the maximum negotiation period of two years to be extended by a unanimous decision by the European Council and the state in question. For Brexit this has been done three times. *The first time, on 22 March 2019, Brexit was postponed until 12 April if no deal was agreed by UK, and 22 May 2019 if the UK accepted the negotiated deal before 12 April. *The second time, on 10 April 2019, Brexit was postponed until 31 October 2019, before which UK has to accept the negotiated deal, or before that as decided by the UK. The UK had to hold the 2019 European Parliament election (23 May) to be allowed to remain after 1 June, which it has. One of the conditions attached to the extension being granted was that it could not be used to reopen or renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement.Special meeting of the European Council (Art. 50) (10 April 2019) ‚Äì Conclusions *The third extension, occurred in late October 2019 after a revised Withdrawal Agreement was negotiated, postponed Brexit until 23:00 UTC on 31 January 2020. The UK finally left the EU in accordance with the time agreed in the third extension.

The band consists of lead vocalist Loeden Learn, guitarists Adam Clarke and Corbin Giroux, bass guitarist Cole Gardner, and drummer Evan Woods. They signed with Rise Records and released their debut EP, Alive In Your Eyes in 2015. The band released their debut studio album, I Couldn't Be Weaker, in April 2016. The group has toured with multiple musical groups such as Silverstein, Vanna, Being As An Ocean, Emarosa, Coldrain, Seaway and State Champs. Career Before the formation of Rarity, Learn, Pasquale, Woods, and Stojsavljevic formed the easycore band Safe and Sound. After the band was displeased with its musical direction, they disbanded and formed the pop punk group Face Value, which garnered attention from Good Fight and Rise Records. They changed their name to Rarity due to legal issues and signed with the label in 2015. Rarity formed in 2014 with lead vocalist Loeden Learn, guitarists Adam Clarke and Zachary Pasquale, drummer Evan Woods, and bass guitarist Alex Stojsavljevic and began touring after graduating high school. The band announced that they signed to Rise Records on February 18, 2015 and released their debut EP, Alive In Your Eyes, for free streaming and download. The EP was produced by Sam Guaiana. On the same day, the band released the music video for their single \\"Anne Hathaway\\". Stojsavljevic left the band in 2016, and was replaced by Cole Gardner in 2017. They performed at So What?! Music Festival on March 20, 2016. The group released the single \\"Orchid\\", featuring A Sight For Sewn Eyes vocalist Joshua Hanusiak on March 30, 2016. The band recorded their debut studio album, I Couldn't Be Weaker, over the course of a year throughout 2015 with producer Seth Henderson in Indiana. The album was released on April 15, 2016 to critical acclaim. The album was made available to stream in its entirety online on April 13. Silverstein announced their headlining U.S. winter tour with special guests Rarity, Being As An Ocean, Emarosa, and Coldrain, which took place from February 29 to March 31, 2016. Rarity also embarked on a string of North American tour dates with Silverstein from May 16 to May 23. Rarity toured as a supporting act on Ontario pop punk band Seaway's 2016 Canadian Tour! alongside Coldfront from July 2 to July 29, 2016. The band announced their second studio album The Longest Lonesome will be released August 30, 2019. Three singles came with the announcement: \\"I'll Come Around\\", \\"Shawinigan\\" and \\"Drown Me Out\\". All three singles were also accompanied by music videos. Musical style Rarity has drawn comparisons to The Story So Far, The Wonder Years, and Alexisonfire. The band's sound has been labeled as post-hardcore, pop punk, and punk rock. On their debut studio album, I Couldn't Be Weaker, the band collaborated with pop punk band State Champs lead vocalist Derek DiScanio and A Sight for Sewn Eyes vocalist Joshua Hanusiak. The album was produced by Seth Henderson, who has produced records by other pop punk bands such as Real Friends and Knuckle Puck. Learn described Rarity was only a pop punk band throughout the recording process of the Alive In Your Eyes EP in 2015, and that the band has evolved into a punk and post-hardcore group. In an interview with Alternative Press, Woods revealed that the band was heavily influenced by pop punk and Counterparts.

The fourth named storm of the annual typhoon season, Nida formed on July 28, 2016 as a tropical depression in the Philippine Sea. Tracking generally north-northwestward, it intensified into a severe tropical storm and skirted northern Luzon before turning to the west-northwest, entering the South China Sea and intensifying further. Nida made landfall over Dapeng Peninsula in Shenzhen late on August 1 and dissipated on August 3. Meteorological history During July 28, the Japan Meteorological Agency started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed about to the east-southeast of Manila in the Philippines. The system had a broad low level circulation center which was consolidating, with atmospheric convection developing to the north and south of the depression. The system was also located within a favorable environment for further development with low vertical wind shear and very warm sea surface temperatures. Over the next day as the system moved north-northwestwards under the influence of a subtropical ridge of high pressure, deep atmospheric convection started wrapping into the system's low level circulation center. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center subsequently issued a tropical cyclone formation alert during July 29, as the system rapidly consolidated further, while the global models indicated that tropical cyclogenesis would take place during the next 24 hours. During that day as the system consolidated further, both PAGASA and the JTWC initiated advisories on the system, with the former naming it Carina, while the latter classified it as 06W. On July 31, Nida made landfall over the area between Baggao and Gattaran of the Cagayan province in the Philippines at 13:20 PST (05:20 UTC) as a severe tropical storm. At 03:35 CST on August 2 (19:35 UTC on August 1), Nida made landfall over Dapeng Peninsula of Shenzhen, Guangdong, China as a severe tropical storm. Preparations and impact =Philippines= Severe Tropical Storm Nida over Luzon, Philippines on July 31 Before tropical storm Nida (known as Carina in the Philippines) made its landfall through Cagayan province, PAGASA raised a public signal warning number 2 throughout the Cordillera Administrative Region. While it lashes the Northeastern part of the Philippines, the provinces of Isabela, Cagayan, Quirino Province, Abra, Mt. Province, Benguet, Kalinga Province, and Ifugao Province reported that some of their major roads was not passable due to landslides. Despite the local governments of the said areas reported that there are no casualties, they still reported that some of them are injured during the typhoon. Damages in Ilocos Norte were estimated at ‚Ç±19.38 million (US$411,000). =Mainland China= The typhoon impacted five provinces across southern China (Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, and Yunnan), affecting 495,000 people. Of those affected, 37,000 required evacuation and 2,100 needed emergency assistance. Approximately 300 homes and of crops were destroyed while another 2,400 homes and of crops were damaged. 2 people were killed in Mainland China, and total economic losses were counted to be ¬•1.14 billion (US$172 million). =Hong Kong= The typhoon led to the cancellation of over 180 flights at the Hong Kong International Airport. Gale to storm force winds of up to 100 kilometres per hour downed numerous trees during the passage of the eyewall. Although the city was hit directly by the typhoon, the highest tropical cyclone warning signals were not necessary as the wind strength did not justify the issuing of higher signals, due to Nida weakening after landfall. However, the No. 8 tropical cyclone signal was kept in force for 16 hours. =Vietnam= A suspension bridge in B√°t X√°t district was washed away, leaving 16 households isolated. The storm also destroyed 17 homes in the country and damaged substantial areas of crops. Internet services in Vietnam were also slowed down after a submarine cable was cut during the storm. Nida killed 4 people in Northern Vietnam and left 7 others missing. Total economic losses in Vietnam were counted to be US$144 million.

It is sometimes referred to simply as \\"ECMA-94\\" in documentation, although it is for the most part a superset of ISO 8859-1 / ECMA-94 in terms of printable characters, and it differs from ISO-8859-1 by using displayable characters rather than control characters in the 0x80 to 0x9F range of code points. Overview In 1986, the original series of RPL calculators (HP-28 series) as well as the HP 82240A thermal printer used a modified variant of the HP Roman-8 character set, of which characters above 147 could not be displayed on the calculator, only be printed. This changed with the introduction of the HP 82240B printer in 1989 and the HP 48 series in 1990, which came with a new character set now based on ECMA 94 / ISO 8859-1 instead of HP Roman-8, but with the control codes in the range 128 to 159 (0x80 to 0x9F) being replaced by additional displayable characters. Compared to ISO 8859-1, code point 127 (0x7F) showed a medium shaded gray box like in the former HP Roman-8 based character set. Code points 131 (0x83) to 142 (0x8E) were also taken over from the former HP Roman-8 based character set. In addition to this, code point 31 (0x1F) was used for ellipsis (‚Ä¶) and code points 169 (0xA9) and 174 (0xAE) showed ambiguous glyphs which could be viewed as inverse circled number ‚ù∏ or copyright symbol (¬©) and as ‚ù∑ or registered trademark symbol (¬Æ), respectively. This first version of the character set also had a non-breaking space at position 160 (0xA0). Translation from HP-48 to HP-28 character set: {- ! ||0xA0 ||0x7F ||0x7F ||0x83 ||0x84 ||0x85 ||0x86 ||0x87 ||0x88 ||0x89 ||0x8A ||0x8B ||0x8C ||0x8D ||0x8E ||0x76 |- ! ||0x5E ||0x7F ||0x7F ||0x7F ||0x7F ||0x7F ||0x7F ||0x7F ||0x7F ||0x7F ||0x7F ||0x7F ||0x7F ||0x7F ||0xFC ||0x7F |- ! ||0x20 ||0xB8 ||0xBF ||0xAF ||0xBA ||0xBC ||0x7C ||0xBD ||0xAB ||0x63 ||0xF9 ||0x92 ||0x7E ||0x2D ||0x52 ||0xB0 |- ! ||0xB3 ||0xFE ||0x97 ||0x98 ||0xA8 ||0x8F ||0xF4 ||0xF2 ||0x2C ||0x31 ||0xFA ||0x93 ||0xF7 ||0xF8 ||0xF5 ||0xB9 |- ! ||0xA1 ||0xE0 ||0xA2 ||0xE1 ||0xD8 ||0xD0 ||0xD3 ||0xB4 ||0xA3 ||0xDC ||0xA4 ||0xA5 ||0xE6 ||0xE5 ||0xA6 ||0xA7 |- ! ||0xE3 ||0xB6 ||0xE8 ||0xE7 ||0xDF ||0xE9 ||0xDA ||0x82 ||0xD2 ||0xAD ||0xED ||0xAE ||0xDB ||0xB1 ||0xF0 ||0xDE |- ! ||0xC8 ||0xC4 ||0xC0 ||0xE2 ||0xCC ||0xD4 ||0xD7 ||0xB5 ||0xC9 ||0xC5 ||0xC1 ||0xCD ||0xD9 ||0xD5 ||0xD1 ||0xDD |- ! ||0xE4 ||0xB7 ||0xCA ||0xC6 ||0xC2 ||0xEA ||0xCE ||0x81 ||0xD6 ||0xCB ||0xC7 ||0xC3 ||0xCF ||0xB2 ||0xF1 ||0xEF |} In a revision of this character set in 1999, code point 160 (0xA0) was redefined to hold the euro sign (‚Ç¨) in the HP 49/50 series (including the HP 48gII), now deviating from ISO 8859-1. Code points 169 (0xA9) and 174 (0xAE) were now clearly defined as holding the copyright (¬©) and registered trademark (¬Æ) symbols in compliance with ISO 8859-1, whereas the corresponding glyphs still resembled the inverse circled numbers more. The last calculator supporting this variant of the character set was the HP 50g introduced in 2006 and discontinued in 2015. In a parallel development, the HP 38G also used the HP 48 series' character set internally. Starting with the HP 39G in 2000, the superscript 3 (¬≥) at code point 179 (0xB3) was replaced by a superscript -1 (‚àí1) in the HP 39/40 series (except for the HP 39gII, which started to use Unicode). Code point 160 (0xA0) was also changed to the euro sign (‚Ç¨) in this third variant of the character set. The last calculator supporting this variant of the character set was the HP 40gs introduced in 2006 and discontinued around 2011. Hewlett-Packard never defined an official Unicode translation, hence several variants evolved in the community, differing in code points 31 (0x1F), 127 (0x7F), 128 (0x80), 129 (0x81), 133 (0x85), 134 (0x86), 158 (0x9E), 160 (0xA0), 169 (0xA9), 174 (0xAE), 178 (0xB3), 181 (0xB5) and 223 (0xDF). The fact that the Unicode equivalent for x-bar at code point 129 (0x81) is a combination of two characters (xÃÖ) could cause problems in translations, therefore it was suggested to use U+0101 (ƒÅ) instead. Characters which cannot be reasonably transcoded should be mapped to code point 127 (0x7F), similar to what the calculators do when communicating with older printers like the HP 82240A. Since the calculators allow fonts to be redefined (using \`FONT‚Üí\`, \`‚ÜíFONT\`, \`MINIFONT‚Üí\`, \`‚ÜíMINIFONT\`) other codepages can be emulated for as long as symbols which are available on the keyboard or are otherwise associated with specific functionality by the calculator aren't replaced by unrelated symbols.

Despite the fact that Almutairi held the Paralympic world record for his classification in the 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m events, major world titles alluded him due to the fact that his classification was under-represented and he was forced to compete against less severely disabled athletes in the T44 class. He eventually won a gold medal at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. Personal history Almutairi was born in Kuwait in 1994. At birth he was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, which has resulted in Almutairi having very limited movement below the waist. Due to his cerebral palsy, Almutairi was educated at a school for special needs children. Athletics career Amutairi was introduced to sport while at school, playing wheelchair basketball. One of his PE teachers saw potential in Amutairi and suggested that he join the Kuwaiti Sports Club for the Disabled. Initially he joined the basketball team, but after five months one of the trainers advised him to diversify into other sports to reach his full potential. Amutairi tried out wheelchair racing and found that he excelled at the sport. He became classified as a T33 classification athlete and in 2009 he entered his first track and field competition, held in the United Arab Emirates. Amutairi's results at the meet saw him qualify for the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships in Christchurch. At the World Championship Amutairi entered four events, the 100m, 200m, 400m and the javelin throw. All three sprint events were for T34 athletes, with no T33 competitions available. Despite setting a championship record in all three races, Almutairi failed to finish on the podium, being beaten in each event by the less disadvantaged T34 competitors. This situation repeated itself throughout Almutairi's early career, and it was not until 2015 that he was able to compete on a level playing field at a major international event. Almutairi, first wheelchair behind the flag bearer, at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Paralympics. In 2012 Almutairi was selected for the Kuwait team at the Summer Paralympics in London. In the 100m (T34) he set a new T33 world record of 17.67, but this was not good enough to see him through the heats. This same situation occurred in the 200m, where he set another world record (31.02), but failed to finish fast enough to reach the finals. He also competed in the T33/34 javelin, but his only legal throw of 17.34 saw him drop out in the first round. The next year Almutairi travelled to Lyon to compete in the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships. He was again forced to compete in the T34 events and failed to get out of the heats in the 100m, 200m and 400m races. His first major medal success came the following year at the 2014 Asian Para Games in Incheon where, with a weaker field than in the Paralympics or the World Championships, he was able to win two silver medals in the 100m and 200m T34 races. Throughout 2015 Almutairi continued to improve his times, and set a new world record for the 200m at an IPC Grand Prix in Nottwil, Switzerland. Later that year he represented Kuwait at his third World Championship, this time in Doha, Qatar. This time enough T33 athletes were available for Almutairi to race in his actual classification in a single race, the 100m. In the final he set a championship record of 17.53 to beat his nearest rival, Britain's Dan Bramall, by over a second and a half. Almutairi also competed in the 800m T34, but he finished a distant 8th.

Beginnings  Comrex was founded in 1961 by John Cheney, a broadcast engineer. His mission, as outlined in Comrex's inaugural press release, is \\"to apply advanced state of the art knowledge and techniques to the production of high quality, practical equipment which can be operated by non-technical personnel.‚Äù Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Comrex developed audio products for the television market: * 1968 ‚Äì Cheney develops Models 7035 and 7040, receivers for wireless microphone systems. * 1973 ‚Äì The 450 RA/TA wireless microphone system, designed for TV news, is the first to enable reporters to move more than 1000 feet from the camera. * 1975 ‚Äì The Comrex wireless cue system, composed of the CTA cue transmitter and the CRA (now LPQRA) receiver, enables field reporters and producers to hear production audio and instructions, without a wired connection to a news van.  POTS Technology  From the late 1970s onward, Comrex began building products for remote radio broadcasters: * 1978 ‚Äì The Frequency Extender, including the PLX and TLX transmitters, and RLX receivers, and 2F transmitter-receiver, allow broadcasters to send audio with bass over one plain old telephone (POTS) line by frequency-shifting program audio 250 Hz. Frequency Extenders become popular with remote broadcasters and news reporters. * 1983 ‚Äì The two-line Frequency Extender (PTLX and RTLX) is introduced. These units transmit 5 kHz over two lines and utilize a five-band compounding system for noise reduction. * 1985 ‚Äì The STLX Sports Console incorporates additional features into the two-line Frequency Extender, specifically for sportscasters. * 1987 ‚Äì The PLXMicro repackages the Frequency Extender into a portable case, compatible with cellphones. * 1989 ‚Äì The 2XP and 2XR two-line Frequency Extenders are introduced. * 1990 ‚Äì The 3XP and 3XR are introduced ‚Äì these carry 8 kHz audio, split into three parts and shifted onto three lines. * 1997 ‚Äì The Hotline POTS codec is developed. Capable of sending bidirectional 10 kHz audio on one phone line, it becomes a standard for POTS broadcasting. * 1998 ‚Äì The Vector is backward compatible with the Comrex Hotline, and has a frequency response of 15 kHz.  ISDN Codecs  From 1991 to 2000, Comrex released a series of ISDN codecs. * 1991 ‚Äì Comrex introduces its first digital codec, the DXP and DXR. Each is used with a terminal adapter to send and receive bidirectional 7.5 kHz audio with virtually no delay. * 1996 ‚Äì The Nexus is introduced. An ISDN codec with a terminal adapter housed in a case smaller than a shoebox, combined with easy menus, make this unit popular with non-technical users. * 2000 ‚Äì The Matrix is developed. An ISDN codec, the Matrix also includes optional modules which enable it to function on a variety of circuits, including future networks which will be implemented years later.

ACCESS and BRIC-Link Technology  In 2006, Cheney's technical successor Tom Hartnett, in partnership with company co-director Kristine Bobo Specht, developed BRIC (Broadcast Reliable Internet Codec) technology. A full-featured suite of tools, BRIC incorporated sophisticated jitter buffers and proprietary algorithms to provide better quality audio over inherently unstable networks, like the public internet. With BRIC in place, Comrex released the ACCESS codec in 2006. ACCESS was distinguished from its competitors by the hand-held design of the portable unit. Due to this form factor, and to the variety of networks on which it could function, ACCESS did not require the stationary set-up of the codecs that preceded it. BRIC technology was also used to develop the BRIC-Link. An IP codec, BRIC-Link was intended for use as an STL or in other point-to-point applications. Since its introduction in 2009, it has been used widely in both radio and television by many organizations, including the NBA. In 2015, the BRIC-Link II, an updated version of the BRIC-Link, was introduced.  LiveShot  In 2012, Comrex adapted BRIC technology to transport video as well as audio. The resulting product, named LiveShot, could send video and audio bidirectionally over IP networks (including Wi-Fi and 3G/4G), with less than 500 milliseconds of delay. Weighing only 3 pounds, LiveShot was designed for news crews and ENG reporters who needed lightweight equipment. In the years that followed, LiveShot was updated with CrossLock technology, a method of network bonding in which a VPN is established between the transmitting and receiving units. CrossLock greatly improved LiveShot's broadcasting reliability, especially over unstable IP networks. LiveShot's price-point, along with its versatility, have made it popular with small stations, educational organizations, and government facilities.

It describes the colours black-red- gold and the usage of a general German imperial flag and a war ensign for the Imperial Fleet.  History  Sea of flags at the arrive of the Imperial Regent in Frankfurt, July 1848 During the German Revolution of 1848 the colours black-red-gold found general acceptance. The Bundestag adopted them, and even Prussian King Frederick William IV. wore such an armband on March 22, when he promised that Prussia will become a part of Germany. On July 31 the National Assembly in Frankfurt decided on a law, but only on November 12 the Imperial Regent signed it. Regent Archduke John of Austria had postponed the law because the great powers had not recognized the Empire. Great Britain threatened to consider the German flag as a pirate flag. Still, constitutional historian Ernst Rudolf Huber explains, the flag law was absolutely valid legally. Because of the general popularity of the colours the imperial constitution of March 1849 lacked a paragraph on the flag.Ernst Rudolf Huber: Dokumente zur deutschen Verfassungsgeschichte. Volume  Conten  According to the imperial law (article 4) German commercial ships had to travel under the 'national flag'; but they were allowed to use additionally the flag of their state or city. The law distinguished between the national flag, also called 'general German imperial flag', and the war ensign: the latter contained the imperial coat of arms in the upper quarter. While articles 1 and 3 describe the third colour as yellow, article 2 describes a 'golden (yellow) ground.'  Ships sailing under black-red-gold  German war ensign The Central Power (German government) was still not universally recognized; that is the reason for the permission to sail also under a state flag.Walther Hubatsch: Die deutsche Reichsflotte 1848 und der Deutsche Bund. In May 1849 an incident occurred, when a British ship entered the harbour of Kiel but did not salute the German flag. With a warning shot one reminded the ship of this duty under international law. Negotiations led to a formal apology from London.Ernst Rudolf Huber: Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789.

After June 21, 1849 it struggled to receive this recognition. When the Central Power ended its activities in December 1849, the Bundeszentralkommission took over. In May 1850 the US, the Netherlands (as a member of the German Confederation), Belgien, Sardinia, Turkey, Portugal, Naples, Spain, Greece and conditionally France had accepted the flag.

They originated in Inman Park, Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The group's name came to founder member, Mark Johnson, whilst on a pilgrimage to Muddy Waters' cabin near Clarksdale, Mississippi. In 2003, Delta Moon won the International Blues Challenge. They have released a number of albums on various record labels, including Low Down, which Down Beat magazine named in their \\"best albums of 2015\\". Referring to the band's twin guitar-led sound, Chicago Sun- Times stated \\"Gray and Johnson's double-slide style works to perfection.\\" Career One of the band's founders, Tom Gray, was born in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Arlington County, Virginia and Georgia. His family home is located in the North Carolina mountains. He is the former songwriter, vocalist and keyboard player of the 1980s new wave band, The Brains. Gray wrote their most notable song \\"Money Changes Everything\\" (1978), which was successfully covered by Cyndi Lauper in 1984. By the late 1980s, he started playing the lap steel guitar. He is the band's main songwriter, and his songs have been recorded by Cyndi Lauper, Manfred Mann, Carlene Carter, and Bonnie Bramlett, amongst others. In 2008, the Roots Music Association named him the 'Blues Songwriter of the Year'. The other founding band member, Mark Johnson, was born Ravenna, Ohio. He played guitar in high school bands before relocating in the early 1990s to Atlanta, Georgia, forming the Rude Northerners, and then worked with another Atlanta band, The Crawdads. He graduated from standard tuning and began playing bottleneck slide guitar. A chance meeting in an Atlanta music store brought Gray and Johnson into contact and they began playing together in local clubs. The duo were later joined by the female singer Gina Leigh and expanded their performing range. Delta Moon's self- titled debut album, which was released on their own label in 2002, contained a cover version of Son House's \\"Preachin' the Blues\\". In 2003, Delta Moon won the International Blues Challenge. The same year they performed at the Sarasota Blues Fest. They also appeared at the Bull Durham Blues Festival. In June 2003, Delta Moon released Live, recorded at Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta, which was followed in 2004 by Goin' Down South. The album included a cover of the David Bowie and Iggy Pop penned \\"Nightclubbing,\\" whilst \\"Shake Something Loose\\" was co-written by Gray with Randall Bramblett. Later that year Leigh left the band, and was replaced by Kristin Markiton. Howlin' was their fourth album in as many years and included tracks written by Frank Edwards (\\"Put Your Arms Around Me\\") and Jessie Mae Hemphill (\\"Lovin' in the Moonlight\\"). In 2007, further personnel changes saw Darren Stanley, originally from Stone Mountain, Georgia, join on drums alongside bassist Franher Joseph. Clear Blue Flame (2007) saw Delta Moon without a female singer since their early days, following the departure of Markiton. One of the album's tracks was \\"Jessie Mae\\", which was dedicated to and about the blues singer Jessie Mae Hemphill. In addition, Gray reworked \\"Money Changes Everything\\" to incorporate a fiddle section quite unlike either the Brains' or Lauper's arrangements. The title track stated that \\"good moonshine burns with a clear, blue flame\\". Hell Bound Train (2010) was the band's fifth studio album. In 2012, Black Cat Oil, followed a Delta Moon tradition by closing the set of tracks with a cover; this time with Mississippi Fred McDowell's \\"Write Me a Few of Your Lines\\". Two live albums were self released in 2013; Life's A Song - Live Volume One and Turn Around When Possible - Live Volume 2. Blues411 named Turn Around When Possible one of the \\"best live blues albums of that year\\". In 2015, the addition of Vic Stafford completed the current line-up. Delta Moon's album, Low Down, was released in May 2015, and included nine original songs penned by Gray, and covers of tracks written by Bob Dylan, Tom Waits and Skip James. In January 2016, Down Beat magazine named Low Down in the \\"best albums of 2015\\". Vintage Guitar noted that \\"Delta Moon is deep blues with a fury...

Description The adult's thorax is covered in dark scales with flecks of lighter yellowish scales. The abdomen is mostly dark- scaled dorsally, and yellowish ventrally. These yellowish scales form apicolateral triangular patches. The dorsum reflects a purple color. The legs are largely dark with white scales on the last two tarsal segments. The female's wings range from around 3.7-4.0 mm. The proboscis is long and dark. Range Ps. ferox occurs throughout the eastern United States and southeastern Canada, south through Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Medical Significance Ps. ferox carries a number of diseases, although it is not considered a major vector. It is known to carry Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE). It was found to be a minor vector of West Nile virus (WNV) in New York. Several viruses have been found in this mosquito in the Amazon, such as Una virus and Ilheus virus. In Central and South America, the mosquito carries the larvae of Dermatobia hominis, the human bot fly, a parasite whose larvae develop inside the flesh of a mammal host.

From 1909 to 1911, he continued to specialize in biostratigraphy at laboratories in Paris, Grenoble and Lausanne, and on the steppes between the Ural Mountains and the Caspian Sea in 1913. During World War I, he undertook geological studies in the Moldavia region, seeking to provide mineral raw materials for the economy and the populace. In 1919, he was named professor of geology and paleontology at the mines and metallurgy faculty of the Polytechnic School of Bucharest. While there, he taught courses on general geology, stratigraphy, paleontology and petroleum geology; his research focused on these fields, as well as tectonics and coal. After studying Miocene layers, he shifted toward the Cretaceous, first in Dobruja and then in the eastern Carpathian Mountains. These studies were synthesized in a large 1934 monograph about the Cretaceous in Romania. In 1938, he published a groundbreaking study about the formation of petroleum reserves in Romania; Macovei firmly believed that petroleum was organic in origin. He was director of the geological institute from 1931 to 1960. As such, he discovered and suggested uses for several deposits of minerals useful to the national economy.

The episode was written by Alan DiFiore, and was directed by Norberto Barba. Plot Opening quote: \\"Now we've got eyes ‚Äî eyes ‚Äî a beautiful pair of children's eyes,\\" he whispered. A man named Andre (Kieren Hutchison) arrives at a support group meeting where he talks with a girl named Molly (Megan Henning) and takes her to her house. He then woges into a fly-like Wesen named Jinnamuru Xunte and releases a red powder on her, blinding her. He then consumes her tears and leaves. As she can't see, she accidentally brings down a shelf on herself and is killed. Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) are sent to investigate while discovering that Molly left with Andre, who is possibly of South African origin. In Vienna, Adalind (Claire Coffee) meets with a woman, Frau Pech (Mary McDonald-Lewis), a Hexenbiest who agrees to help her with the baby. At night, Renard (Sasha Roiz) wakes up to find Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) in his bed, who then woges into a creature, seemingly into a dream or a message from Frau Pech. Andre goes after another victim, Kelly (Suzanne Tufan) but escapes when her sister, Casey (Jenny Wade) arrives. In the trailer, Nick, Hank and Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) find that the Jinnamuru Xunte feed from the tears of their victims. Kelly wakes up in the hospital with worms now spreading into her eyes. Andre is sighted at a high school and the police are sent there to apprehend him. Nick catches Andre, but Andre spreads the red powder on Nick, blinding him as well and fleeing. Hank takes Nick to the spice shop where Rosalee (Bree Turner) and Monroe find that there's a cure for a vaccine but it requires them to extract the Jinnamuru Xunte's eye while alive and woged. Seemingly, Nick has now developed a sense where he manages to hear everything happening around him even if it's whispering. Casey returns home and is attacked by Andre. Hank is called and decides to go, bringing Nick, Monroe and Rosalee. They manage to knock out Andre and cut out his eye to make the antidote. Andre wakes up in his normal form and tries to escape but is stabbed by Casey. Rosalee manages to mix the ingredients and restores Nick's sight. Juliette, who has been tormented by ghost visions, sees a ghost in his house that resembles Nick before disappearing. The episode ends as Nick discovers he now has more acute hearing and practices, with Monroe, hitting fruit while blindfolded, succeeding.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B‚àí\\" grade and wrote, \\"Unfortunately, Grimms tendency to cherry- pick folktale elements doesn't work as well with Hofmman's story. Strip-mining for a few scary features, instead of using the story as a strong foundation, or as the launching point for a departure in narrative style, yields a basic case of the week plot with some scary elements, but with a disappointing lack of ambition. That's par for the course with Grimm, but when using such ripe source material, it makes the unremarkable goals of the show much more underwhelming.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"'Mr. Sandman' didn't bring any dreams or cute things to Portland. This is Grimm, after all. Why bring dreams when you can bring death and blindness? The case of the week proved to be one of the greater investigations of Grimm Season 2. The idea of a man stealing the sight of people who are in periods of grief and, literally, having them lose their way all so he can find his own is pretty compelling.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"Grossest episode of Grimm yet? I don‚Äôt mind a little gore, but the eye scooping and what happened to Kelly in the hospital were both disturbing.\\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \\"The short scenes with Adalind and Renard weren't enough to satisfy, especially since I care way more about the Royal machinations and inner workings of the Wesen world than I do about a lone monster criminal. The complex mythology is the best thing about this show, yet the writers seem to think we tune in for the boring, formulaic crime aspect.

The four satellites of the series (GOES-16, -17, -T, and -U) will extend the availability of the GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system) until 2036 for weather forecast and meteorology research. The satellite was built by Lockheed Martin, was based on the A2100A platform, and will have an expected useful life of 15 years (10 years operational after five years of standby as an on-orbit replacement). GOES-17 is intended to deliver high-resolution visible and infrared imagery and lightning observations of more than half the globe. The satellite was launched on 1 March 2018 and reached geostationary orbit on 12 March 2018. In May 2018, during the satellite's testing phase after launch, a problem was discovered with its primary instrument, the Advanced Baseline Imager. GOES-17 became operational as GOES-West on 12 February 2019.  Operations  Launch of GOES-S aboard an Atlas V The satellite was launched into space on 1 March 2018 by an Atlas V (541) vehicle from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. It had a launch mass of . On 12 March, GOES-17 joined GOES-16 (launched in 2016) in geosynchronous orbit at above Earth. On 24 October 2018, GOES-17 began a 20-day, 2.5¬∞/day westward drift maneuver from its checkout position of 89.5¬∞ west longitude to its operational position of 137.2¬∞ west. During the drift maneuver, all instruments except for the magnetometer were disabled. Meanwhile, GOES-15 began an eastward drift maneuver on 29 October 2018 to 128¬∞ west, with all of its sensors still functioning. It reached its new location on 7 November 2018. GOES-17 began transmitting its first images on 13 November 2018. The first high-definition images transmitted where of Alaska, Hawaii, and the Pacific Ocean. GOES-15's drift was intended to provide additional separation from GOES-17 to prevent communication interference. GOES-17 reached its assigned longitude 13 November 2018 and began additional testing. GOES-17 was declared operational on 12 February 2019. Both GOES-17 and GOES-15 operated in tandem through early 2020 to allow assessment of GOES-17's performance as GOES-West. On March 2, 2020, GOES-15 was deactivated and moved to a storage orbit, with plans to re-activate it in August 2020 supplement GOES-17 operations due to the known flaws with the Advanced Baseline Imager. = Malfunctions = The GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager before satellite integration On 23 May 2018 NOAA announced that there were problems with the cooling system of the Advanced Baseline Imager. Due to the cooling failure, infrared and near-infrared imaging was only possible 12 hours per day. The issue affects 13 of the infrared and near-infrared channels on the instrument. No other sensors of the satellite are affected. During a media conference call on 24 July 2018, the problem component was identified as the loop heat pipe, which transports heat from the cryocooler and ABI to radiators. The degraded performance of this component means the ABI gets hotter than intended, which lowers the sensitivity of the infrared sensors. In order to work properly, the sensors need to be cooled to varying degrees depending on what wavelength they observe; the sensors operating in the longest wavelengths need to be kept as low as in order to reduce thermal noise. The GOES-R System Program Director, Pam Sullivan, said on the conference call that preliminary projections suggested that via thermal mitigation measures such as changing the spacecraft alignment, ABI performance could be significantly improved, depending on the season. The orbit of the spacecraft brings the ABI into full sunlight more often around the equinoxes, resulting in more solar radiation being absorbed by the ABI and degrading the performance of the infrared channels, with projections indicating that 10 of the 16 channels will be available 24 hours a day, with the other six channels available for \\"most of the day, to varying degrees, depending on their wavelength.\\" Around the solstices, the orbit alignment is such that the ABI receives less direct sunlight, and it is projected that 13 of the 16 channels will be available 24 hours a day with the other three channels available 20 or more hours per day. The loop heat pipe was manufactured by Orbital ATK (now owned by Northrop Grumman). On 2 October 2018, NOAA and NASA appointed a five-member Mishap Investigation Board to further examine the issue. NOAA worked with Northrop Grumman to identify exactly what caused the loop heat pipe to fail, using engineering-grade copies of the spacecraft components for testing. Possible causes mentioned in the conference call included debris or foreign objects inside the heat pipe, or an improper amount of propylene coolant. The final conclusion of the independent failure review team's investigation, released on 3 October 2018, was that \\"the most likely cause of the thermal performance issue is foreign object debris (FOD) blocking the flow of the coolant in the loop heat pipes. A series of ground-based tests introducing FOD into test pipes support FOD as the most likely cause. A second potential cause, mechanical failure, was investigated and deemed unlikely. The failure review team recommended changes to the ABI radiators on the subsequent GOES-R series satellites, including a simpler hardware configuration and the use of ammonia as the coolant rather than propylene. Redesign efforts are underway, and a Critical Design Review was originally scheduled for December 2018, but was delayed as a result of a government shutdown. It was eventually held on 7‚Äì8 February 2019. Various software workarounds have been introduced in order to minimize the impact of the LHP problem. In October 2018, Lockheed Martin finished assembling the next unit of the GOES-R series, GOES-T, and was preparing to begin environmental testing of the completed satellite, when NOAA ordered the removal of the ABI to return to the manufacturer, Harris Corporation, for remanufacturing. As a result, the scheduled May 2020 launch of GOES-T has been delayed. As of May 2019, its launch date is set for December 2021. The 2024 launch of GOES-U will probably not be delayed as a result of the redesign. On 20 November 2018, a memory error occurred in the ABI which resulted from a software update for its cryocooler subsystem. This resulted in automated onboard safety checks shutting down the cryocooler. It was restored to operation on 25 November, and engineers began working on a permanent software fix for deployment in January 2019. On 15 August 2019, GOES-17 experienced a brief \\"spacecraft anomaly\\" from about 1345Z to 1700Z. This anomaly prevented delivery of all bands and scenes.  Objectives  NOAA's GOES-R series of satellites is designed to improve the forecasts of weather, ocean, and environment by providing faster and more detailed data, real-time images of lightning, and advanced monitoring of solar activities and space weather. GOES-17 can collect three times more data at four times image resolution, and scan the planet five times faster than previous probes. GOES-17 has the same instruments and capabilities as GOES-16 (currently serving as GOES-East), and will complement its work by scanning a different area of the world. GOES-17 will become GOES-West when it moves to 137.2¬∞ west longitude and cover the west coast of the continental US, Alaska, Hawaii, and much of the Pacific Ocean. These two satellites are expected to monitor most of the Western Hemisphere and detect natural phenomena and hazards in almost real-time. Its capabilities will allow better: * fire track and intensity estimation * detection of low cloud/fog * tropical cyclone track and intensity forecasts * monitoring of smoke and dust * air quality warnings and alerts * transportation safety and aviation route planning * advanced monitoring of atmospheric river events that can cause flooding and mudslides Along with GOES-16, these newly advanced satellites can give near-real-time updates on what is happening in the atmosphere across the United States.  Instruments  The instrument suite of GOES-17 is identical to that of GOES-16. It includes: = Earth sensing = Earth as seen from GOES-17 on 20 May 2018  Advanced Baseline Imager  The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) was built by Harris Corporation Space and Intelligence Systems (formerly ITT/Exelis) for the GOES-R line of satellites for imaging Earth's weather, climate and environment. Key subcontractors for the ABI instrument included BAE Systems, Babcock Incorporated, BEI Technologies, DRS Technologies, L-3 Communications SSG-Tinsley and Northrop Grumman Space Technology, and Orbital ATK. The imaging capabilities of the ABI are superior to previous imagers in several ways. = Spectral resolution = ABI images of North America across the 16 spectral bands This instrument has 16 bands (11 more than the last GOES imager): 2 Visible Bands: * Band 1: (\\"Blue\\") * Band 2: (\\"Red\\") 4 Near IR Bands: * Band 3: (\\"Veggie\\") * Band 4: (\\"Cirrus\\") * Band 5: (\\"Snow/Ice\\") * Band 6: (\\"Cloud Particle Size\\") 10 other Infrared Bands: * Band 7: (\\"Shortwave Window\\") * Band 8: (\\"Upper-Level Tropospheric Water Vapor\\") * Band 9: (\\"Mid-Level Tropospheric Water Vapor\\") * Band 10: (\\"Lower-Level Tropospheric Water Vapor\\") * Band 11: (\\"Cloud-Top Phase\\") * Band 12: (\\"Ozone\\") * Band 13: (\\"Clean IR Longwave Window\\") * Band 14: (\\"IR Longwave Window\\") * Band 15: (\\"Dirty IR Longwave Window\\") * Band 16: (\\" Longwave Infrared\\") = Temporal resolution = The temporal resolution of ABI products changes depending on the type of image. * Imaging of entire western hemisphere occurs every 5 to 15 minutes, while previously this was a scheduled event, with at most three photos per hour. * Imaging of the continental United States once every 5 minutes, compared to one every 15 minutes in previous satellites * One detailed image over some box every thirty seconds, a capability previous imagers did not have = Spatial resolution = Spatial resolution will be dependent on what band is being used - band 2 is the highest resolution out of all channels, with a resolution of . Channels 1, 3, and 5 will have a resolution of , while all other bands in NIR/IR will have a resolution of .  Geostationary Lightning Mapper  The Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) is used for measuring lightning (in-cloud and cloud-to-ground) activity. To do this, it considers a single channel in the NIR (777.4 nm) constantly, even during the day, to catch flashes from lightning. The sensor has a 1372√ó1300 pixel CCD, with an spatial resolution (with the resolution decreasing near the edges of the FOV). The GLM has a frame interval of 2 milliseconds, meaning it considers the entire study area 500 times every second. Development of the GLM was contracted to the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto, California. = Solar imaging = * Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) for observing coronal holes, solar flares and coronal mass ejection source regions * Extreme Ultraviolet and X-ray Irradiance Sensors (EXIS) for monitoring solar irradiance in the upper atmosphere. It was built at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at Boulder, Colorado. It has three separate sensors: one for X-ray, one for extreme ultraviolet and a third one which is a combination of X-ray and extreme ultraviolet. * The sensors aboard EXIS, XRS and EUVS, monitor solar flares in order to give warning of events strong enough to cause radio blackouts and both are used to make space weather predictions. More specifically, XRS monitors the X-ray variability from the Sun, and EUVS looks for short and long time scale variability in extreme-ultraviolet output from the Sun; both instruments intend to give a more clear picture of the Sun's varying influence on Earth's upper atmosphere. = Space environment measuring = * Space Environment In-Situ Suite (SEISS) for monitoring proton, electron and heavy ion fluxes at geosynchronous orbit * Magnetometer (MAG) for the space environment magnetic field that controls charged particle dynamics in the outer region of the magnetosphere = Transponders = * The Geostationary Search and Rescue (GEOS&R;) for relaying distress signals from users in difficulty to search and rescue centers * Data Collection and Interrogation Service (DCIS) for data collection from in-situ Data Collection Platforms  Notes   References   External links   GOES-R Series by NOAA/NESDIS Synchronous Meteorological Satellites National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Satellites using the A2100 bus Weather satellites of the United States Artificial satellites in geosynchronous orbit Spacecraft launched in 2018 Spacecraft launched by Atlas rockets ","title":"GOES-17"},{"id":"51222273","text":"John Donald MacIntyre Gass (2 August 1928, Montague, Prince Edward Island ‚Äì 26 February 2005, Nashville, Tennessee) was a Canadian-American ophthalmologist, one of the world's leading specialists on diseases of the retina.The 10 most influential ophthalmologists in the 20th century, squintmaster.com He was the first to describe many macular diseases.

In 566, Lombard king Alboin concluded a treaty with the Pannonian Avars, to whom he promised the Gepids' land in case they won over them. The Gepids were destroyed by the Avars and Lombards in 567. Gepid king Cunimund was killed by Alboin himself. The Avars now occupied \\"Gepidia\\", forming the Avar Khaganate. The Byzantine Emperor intervened and took control of Sirmium (now Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia), also giving refuge to Gepid leader Usdibad, but the rest of Gepidia was taken by the Avars. According to Istv√°n B√≥na, Usdibad was probably a secret rival of Cunimund, and crossed the Sava to the Byzantines after the defeat.

Leeser had a cancer- related surgery in 2016, but stated that his decision was not because of his health. Instead, it was because he \\"ran to do things I thought were really important for our community and I did that.\\" The election was non-partisan; therefore there was no primary election. However, if no candidate won a majority there will be a run-off election. The mayor and council members elected in 2017 will serve through December 2020. The term is shortened because of a charter amendment to move city elections from May in odd-numbered years to November in even-numbered years.

NYU graduation controversy During a speech at a convocation ceremony for NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Thrasher sparked controversy by advocating for a boycott of Israel. According to NYU president Andrew Hamilton, Thrasher had omitted his contentious comments from the version of the speech submitted for review, and stated that \\"NYU rejects academic boycotts of Israel, rejects calls to close its Tel Aviv campus, and denounces efforts to ostracize or exclude those in the University community based on their location in Israel, their Israeli origin, or their political feelings for Israel.\\" Upon learning that Thrasher had a history of posting antisemitic statements on Twitter, President Hamilton said, \\"We were shocked when we were made aware of these undoubtedly vile and anti-Semitic tweets.

She was unwell as a child. Following a visit to her uncle‚Äôs gymnasium he was shocked by her pale appearance and began to train her to improve her health, which she later claimed saved her from an early death. He taught her to punch the bag and later, ‚Äúfor his amusement‚Äù, to spar. From the age of 10, she appeared in stage shows and fairground tents sparring with men, raising money for various charities. She reportedly boxed every day for fourteen years. After losing two husbands in the First World War, she was left to raise her daughter Daisy alone as a widow. In order to financially support her family she gave boxing lessons to men in her uncle's London gymnasium. She was eager to teach women, but found very few were willing to take up the sport. During the 1920s, Professor Andrew Newton formed a Women's Boxing Club in London, of which Annie Newton was the most famous member. In June 1925, she took part in a boxing tournament at the Alcazar, Edmonton. She was in the ring for over a half and hour sparring with three men, giving them two rounds each. She could bunch a bag 900 times without missing. 'Women Boxers' Scandal On Monday 8 February 1926, an exhibition match of six rounds was arranged at the Hoxton Baths between Newton and Madge Baker. Baker was the other woman boxer in England and a student of Digger Stanley. The promoter, Harry Abrahams, later stated that it was not billed as a contest but was meant to be a novelty. News of the event caused outrage and protest. Plans were made to summon a 'town's indignation meeting' of local representatives with the aim of preventing the match. The campaign to stop the match was led by the Mayor of Hackney, Rev. W. Evans, who wrote to the Daily News \\"I regard this proposed exhibition of women boxers as a gratification of the sensual ideals of a crowd of vulgar men.\\" Evans appealed to the Home Secretary Sir William Joynson-Hicks. The Home Secretary replied \\"I should have no power to interfere, mainly, I think, because the Legislature never imagined that such a disgraceful exhibition would have been staged in this country...I hope and trust that the influence of decent public opinion will prevent such an outrage taking place.\\" The event was banned by the Shoreditch Borough Council. The only vote in favour of the bout going ahead came from a women member who stated ‚Äúthat if the girls wanted to maul each other, she thought it was perfectly all right‚Äù. Attempts were made to hold the match on 14 February at Manor Hall, Hackney. Rev. W. Evans wrote to the management to prevent this event from taking place. On hearing the match was again postponed, Newton stated ‚ÄúI‚Äôm terribly upset about it. I have been looking forward to the match for a long time and got myself in first-rate condition.‚Äù She offered to instead meet three male boxers in two-round bouts, but this too was cancelled, and Newton was only allowed to give an exhibition of her skill with the punchball. In a short speech from the ring, Newton expressed her disappointment. Newton, who had been publicly sparring all her life without objection, was surprised by and couldn‚Äôt understand the public outcry. She countered concerns about women boxing, telling a reporter ‚ÄúAll this talk about boxing being ‚Äòdegrading‚Äô and ‚Äòrisky‚Äô and ‚Äòtoo hard work‚Äô strikes me as very comic. Is it any more degrading, or half as hard work as scrubbing floors? Is it any more risky than working in a munitions factory[?]‚Äù The story was reported internationally, sometimes as a source of amusement. Reports suggest the original match went ahead surreptitiously. Despite the scandal, Newton remained defiant ‚ÄúIn a way, of course, the decision will make no difference, because I shall go on with my sparring partners and enjoy myself no end. I could not give it up for anything in the world.‚Äù She predicted ‚Äúwhile I may not see it, or you either, the day will come, like it or not, when the world will see women in the ring.‚Äù External links *Getty Images.

Biographys Born in ≈†ibenik in Dalmatia (now in Croatia), Nikodim was the son of Dragosav and Todora. He had a brother, ƒêurƒëe, who was baptized in the Orthodox church in ≈†ibenik in 1663. Nikodim was mentioned as a monk at the Krka Monastery already in 1676. He was chirotonized on 24 June 1693 as the bishop of Dalmatia by the Venetian Dalmatian bishop Melentije Tipaldi and a Greek archiereus from Corfu, thus, he was under the jurisdiction of the Philadelphian archbishopric seated in Venice. The Serbian Orthodox leadership criticized him for accepting foreign chirotony, however, in 1696 Arsenije III ƒåarnojeviƒá recognized the chirotony due to Nikodim's resolute defense of Serbian Orthodoxy from Uniatism despite pressure, and improved church life, renovation of the Dragoviƒá Monastery (in 1694, deserted in 1614), and other efforts. He was titled the bishop \\"of all Orthodox Serbs on the Dalmatian continent\\", and also titled himself as \\"bishop of Krka\\". With the arrival of the new provvedittore of Dalmatia, Justinio Riva, pressure increased on Nikodim and Orthodox Serbs to subjugate to the Catholic bishop in Split. The pressure led to a Serb rebellion in Dalmatia. Because of this, Nikodim was banished from Dalmatia in early 1705 and forced to take refuge at Mount Athos. In his place, the Venetian government appointed Savatije Ljubibratiƒá, on the demand of the monasteries of Krka and Krupa. When the situation cooled down after a period of time, he returned to Dalmatia and died at the Krka Monastery.

ISAS is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) Commission on Accreditation.  History  In 1952, ‚ÄúThe Association of Texas Preparatory Schools,‚Äù a football and basketball league among five private Texas schools (The Kinkaid School, Lutheran, St. John‚Äôs School, St. Mark's School of Texas, and St. Stephen's Episcopal School), was founded. This association was to serve as a predecessor for ISAS: in 1955, largely under the influence of St. John's headmaster Alan Chidsey, four of the same institutions (Kinkaid, St. John's, St. Stephen's, and St. Mark's) joined together with three additional Texas schools (The Hockaday School, Saint Mary‚Äôs Hall, and the Texas Military Institute) and one Oklahoma school (Casady School) to found the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest. The original \\"statement of purpose\\" of the association was to \\"encourage, support, and develop highest standards of attainment in the independent schools of the area and to recognize those schools in which they are maintained.‚Äù In 1966, the stated purpose was amended to include the phrase \\"to recognize by formal accreditation,‚Äù and an additional accreditation requirement was imposed: at least 75% of the graduates of each member school must complete their first year of college. By ISAS's quinquagenary anniversary in 2005, the association had grown to include 84 schools spanning six states; in the same year, the Southwest Preparatory Conference (SPC) split from ISAS to form an independent athletic conference. By 2012, ISAS had expanded to include all of its current 89 member schools.  Arts festival  Since 1967, the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest has held its annual ISAS Arts Festival, hosted at a different member schools' campus each year. The popular event typically lasts three days, during which time students from the various art programs of upwards of thirty ISAS member schools congregate in a noncompetitive atmosphere to perform and create art in \\"a celebration of sharing and learning with critiques by professional artists and performers.\\" Recent years' ISAS Arts Festivals, such as the 2016 Festival hosted at Saint Mary's Hall in San Antonio, Texas, have seen attendances of more than 3,000 student artists.

Early life Pa-bat-or-kok-or-sis was born in a settlement along the banks of the Netley Creek about down river from future site of the St. Peter's church and settlement (approx. 1837), to Chief Peguis and Victoria, one of his wives. He attended school at a one-room schoolhouse operated out of the St. Peter's Church, and was baptized Henry Prince in 1837. In 1840 he married Sarah Badger, with whom he had at least 6 children. In 1864, after the death of his father, he became Chief of the St. Peter's Indian Band (later called the Peguis First Nation.) As Chief On November 6, 1869, shortly after Louis Riel took control of Upper Fort Garry as part of the Red River Rebellion, he issued an invitation to the parishes of the English speaking settlers north of the Forks to a meeting, in an attempt to gain their support. Chief Henry Prince represented the parish of St. Peter's in these meetings, wherein he indicated his disapproval of the M√©tis actions, and refused to join Riel. On rumours of M√©tis action against Lower Fort Garry, he offered support against the rebellion to the Canadian Government surveyors billeted there. In 1870, after the rebellion was ended, a large delegation led by Chief Henry Prince met with Adams George Archibald Lieutenant-Governor newly formed Province of Manitoba, indicating a desire for a Treaty, and compensation for lands surrendered to Lord Selkirk. Negotiations between Wemyss Mackenzie Simpson and several Indian bands at Lower Fort Gary began in July, 1871, and Treaty 1 was signed on August 3. In 1877, the local Indian Agent was required to deal with a petition by several members of the band against Chief Henry Price, asking for his removal. Their charges included that the chief had been jailed for drunkenness, and that he had used treaty funds belonging to the band for his own purposes. On investigation, the agent concluded that the charges were almost certainly true, but that it would be inconvenient to have the chief removed. The charges were dismissed, and a reprimand was issued. In November 1877, Chief Henry Prince complained to Interior Minister David Mills about the treatment of Indians, and the lack of support by Acting Indian Commissioner Joseph Provencher. In December, 1877, After an investigation into allegations of fraud in the office of the Indian Affairs involving sale of Indian lands, Provencher was removed from office. However, Henry Prince was also implicated in the lot sales. Henry Prince continued to serve as Chief of the Peguis First Nation until 1882, when William Prince (likely his older brother) was elected. After this, Henry Prince served two further terms as chief, 1888-1890 and 1887-1889. He died on June 7, 1899 and was buried the next day in an unmarked grave in St. Peter‚Äôs cemetery.

The hypothesized process would have transformed four diploid nuclei into eight haploid ones. The current scientific consensus is that brachymeiosis does not occur in any fungi. According to the current understanding, ascomycetes reproduce by forming male and female organs (antheridia/spermatia and ascogonia), transferring haploid nuclei from the antheridium to the ascogonium, and growing a dikaryotic ascus containing both nuclei. Karyogamy then occurs in the ascus to form a diploid nucleus, followed by meiosis and mitosis to form eight haploid nuclei in the ascospores. In 1895, the botanist R.A. Harper reported the observation of a second karyogamy event in the ascogonium prior to ascogeny. This would imply the creation of a tetraploid nucleus in the ascus, rather than a diploid one; in order to produce the observed haploid ascospores, a second meiotic reduction in chromosome count would then be necessary. The second reduction was hypothesized to occur during the second or third mitotic division in the ascus, even though chromosome reduction does not typically occur during mitosis. This supposed form of meiosis was termed ‚Äúbrachymeiosis‚Äù in 1908 by H. C. I. Fraser. The existence of brachymeiosis was controversial throughout the first half of the twentieth century, with many conflicting results published. Then, research with improved staining techniques established clearly that only one reductive division occurs in the asci of all examined species, including some which had been believed to undergo brachymeiosis. As a result of these studies, the theories of double fusion and subsequent brachymeiosis were discarded around 1950.

He is the fifth Marvel character to use the name Ghost Rider, after Carter Slade (the Western comics hero later known as the Phantom Rider), Johnny Blaze, Danny Ketch and Alejandra Jones. The character was portrayed by Gabriel Luna in the televisions series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the fourth season, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Publication history  Robbie Reyes first appeared in All-New Ghost Rider #1 (March 2014), created by writer Felipe Smith and artist Tradd Moore. When Marvel Comics was getting retooled as All-New, All-Different Marvel, editor Mark Paniccia approached writer Felipe Smith on creating a newer and younger Ghost Rider. Among Paniccia's suggestions were that this new Ghost Rider drive a car instead of a motorcycle, an idea that excited Smith. Another big difference between this Ghost Rider and its predecessors is that Reyes doesn't have a floating head, or a human skull, Smith says. \\"He's an amalgam of a flaming car and a human being. He's not wearing a helmet, and his head isn't a skull: this Ghost Rider is designed so his look simulates the lines of the classic muscle car he was racing the night he died.\\" Tradd Moore was brought in to sketch ideas based on Smith's concept. He also, more recently, appears on Ghost Rider (2016), Marvel Legacy and Avengers (2018) #1.  Fictional character biography  upright Robbie Reyes is a high-school student working as a mechanic at an auto body shop who lives with his developmentally disabled brother Gabe and seeks to get away from the dangerous, gang-riddled streets of East Los Angeles. To that end, he enters a street race, hoping to use the prize money to move themselves away. He is gunned down by mercenaries trying to retrieve pills that caused the transformation of Calvin Zabo into the supervillain Mr. Hyde, which had been left in the trunk of the 1969 Dodge Charger he \\"borrowed\\" from the auto body shop for the race. He is revived as a demonic being with a flaming, helmet-like head. He drives off in the car, now similarly ablaze.All New Ghost Rider #1 Later, the spirit bound to the car introduces itself to Robbie as the ghost of a man named Eli Morrow, who says he had been killed by gang members. Eli offers to help Robbie clean up his neighborhood in exchange for Robbie helping him avenge his death.All-New Ghost Rider #2 Robbie becomes a local hero whose fame catches the attention of Johnny Blaze, who travels to Los Angeles to confront the new Rider. Eli is later revealed as Robbie's estranged uncle, a Satanic serial killer who kidnapped and murdered at least thirty- seven people in rituals before being fatally shot by police in 1999. A possessed Robbie later encounters Johnny Blaze, who uses the Penance Stare on Eli's spirit. Eli was also the one who pushed Robbie's mother down the stairs while she was pregnant with Gabe, causing Gabe's disabilities.All-New Ghost Rider #11 In addition to confronting Mr. Hyde and his criminal underworld, Robbie and Eli fight for dominance over Robbie's body. Robbie eventually permanently bonds with Eli and agrees to sate Eli's thirst for murder, but only by killing people with evil souls. He appears in The Unbelievable Gwenpool along with Hawkeye, both working to stop a ceremony being held by dwarves using a mystical space rock. Gwenpool appeared in his trunk's portal via her friend Sarah \\"The Terrible Eye\\" and the police arrived, prompting them all to flee. He had claimed the gem with Gwen's ghost friend Cecil inside and left it in his car, where his possessing spirit was apparently attempting to turn Cecil on Gwen. When that fails he shrugs it off and decides to just go back to corrupting Robbie.The Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol. 1 #14‚Äì15 Following a vivid nightmare involving an ancient gathering of heroes that include a previous Ghost Rider, Robbie awakens in South Africa with no memory of how he got there. He is attacked by Star Brand, who seeks to keep him from finding a buried Celestial. Robbie defeats Star Brand by using the Penance Stare, an ability he previously had no idea he possessed, but somehow accidentally kills Star Brand as well.Marvel Legacy #1 Robbie then joins a new team of Avengers formed by Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America to fight off the Celestial Final Host. Some time later, word of Star Brand's death somehow reaches Odin. The long-time ally of the original pre-historic Star Brand thought that Robbie killed the current Star Brand purposely. Robbie explains to the All-Father of Norse Gods about his accidental murder of the latter Star Brand when his Penance Stare first awakened, thus easily winning forgiveness and making friends.Avengers (2018) #700  Powers and abilities  Robbie differs from previous Ghost Riders, mainly because he is not possessed by a Spirit of Vengeance or any similar demonic entity. Rather, he is possessed by the spirit of Eli Morrow, a deceased serial killing Satanist who worked for the Russian mob as a hit-man. Despite this, he has abilities similar to his predecessors; he possesses superhuman strength, speed, agility, stamina, and durability potent enough to challenge Thor or Captain Marvel,Avengers Vol. 8 #16 as well as the natural Rider's capability of conjuring natural and hellish flames.All- New Ghost Rider #5 He wields a supernaturally strong chain weapon, and can banish people to Hell or outright consume their souls.All-New Ghost Rider #5All-New Ghost Rider #12Ghost Racers #4 Unlike previous Ghost Riders who rode on motorcycles, Robbie drives a 1969 Dodge Charger R/T which he refers to as the Hell Charger. The Hell Charger is linked to the Ghost Rider, allowing Robbie in his Ghost Rider form to instantly teleport to and/or merge with the car. It also acts as a warp hub which he can shadowmeld with in order to warp things (himself or others) over varying distances using shadows.All-New Ghost Rider #5 The Charger can also be driven remotely, and Robbie's Ghost Rider form can pass harmlessly through it, allowing it to drive into foes. The car's trunk, when opened, acts as a portal through Hell, allowing the Ghost Rider to transport anything, including people, to any location.Avengers Vol. 8 #14 Robbie, through his Hellcharger, can create portals out of hellfire in order to take himself anywhere he can think of while Eli can change the shape and appearance of their ride.Ghost Racers #2-3Ghost Rider Vol. 8 #1 Eli is shown to able to take control of Robbie's body whenever he feels that he isn't up to the task or when Robbie gives into negative emotion, which is signified in his human form by a pallid skin tone and both of his eyes turning orange.All-New Ghost Rider #8 During his battle with Star Brand, Robbie discovers that he possesses the Penance Stare, which allows him to force anyone who makes eye contact with him to experience all of the pain and suffering they have ever inflicted on others.Marvel Legacy #1 His Ghost Rider form can also evolve into a stronger, more demonic form when Robbie is sufficiently angered, though this transformation is harder to control and more destructive.Robbie Reyes: Ghost Rider #5 Recently while battling corrupted Celestial's Robbie later realized he'd entrenched a simple tractor with his rider properties. Similarly to Daniel Ketch; Robbie's rider transformation changes everything within reach alongside him as well.Avengers Vol. 8 #5 The vehicle can also contact the spirits of the deceased as it was able to enlist the aid of Tony's dead father Howard Stark to ask for information.Avengers Vol. 8 #5  Other versions  = Secret Wars = During the 2015 \\"Secret Wars\\" storyline, a variation of Robbie and his brother Gabe live south of Doomstadt on Battleworld.

Reyes drives with his younger brother Gabe when they are gunned down by a street gang called Fifth Street Locos, who mistook Reyes for his uncle Eli Morrow. Gabe is rendered a paraplegic by the event, while Reyes' injuries are fatal. A \\"Good Samaritan\\", Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider, rescues Gabe and brings Robbie back from the dead by giving him the powers of the spirit of vengeance. As Robbie only saw Johnny in his Ghost Rider form, he believes that he sold his soul to \\"The Devil\\", so Robbie hunts down members of the gang to exact vengeance upon them, then later other people who \\"deserve it\\". He later comes into conflict with rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Daisy Johnson / Quake, but eventually allies himself with her and S.H.I.E.L.D. against the supernatural problem of Lucy Bauer and her fellow ghosts, as it is revealed that he is able to exorcise the ghosts. During the season 4 episode \\"Deals with Our Demons\\", Reyes is knocked into a parallel dimension, and the Ghost Rider spirit moves to Agent Al \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie to continue its quest for vengeance, but returns to Robbie after he makes a new deal with the Rider. Robbie later confronts his uncle over his own crimes. As Ghost Rider, Robbie drags him into the Darkhold dimension. Reyes returns from the Darkhold dimension, to help the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. defeat AIDA / Aida Ophelia / Madame Hydra and her Life Model Decoys (LMDs).

It is based on the 1958 play The Marriage-Go-Round, also penned by Stevens. The film stars Susan Hayward, James Mason, Julie Newmar, Robert Paige and June Clayworth. It was released on January 6, 1961 by 20th Century Fox. It was filmed on location at Florida Southern College in Lakeland, Florida and at Stage 4 on the Twentieth Century-Fox lot. Plot At a Florida college, professor Paul Delville (James Mason) and wife Content (Susan Hayward), who is the school's dean of women, anticipate visitors from Sweden. The people they expect are a former colleague, Professor Sveg (Everett Glass), and his daughter Katrin (Julie Newmar). Katrin arrives alone. The Delvilles are astounded that Katrin, whom they remember as a gangly teenager, has grown into a statuesque, blonde bombshell. Their astonishment is just the beginning because Katrin brashly announces that she wants Paul to sire a baby with her, assuring offspring with both brains and beauty. Paul is flustered by Katrin's unwillingness to take no for an answer. She gives him a nude statue of herself, suns herself at his house in nothing but a skimpy towel, then shows up at a swim team practice in a provocative bathing suit. Katrin's come-ons become a greater temptation, causing Content to seek the advice of a friend on campus, Dr. Ross Barnett (Robert Paige), a married professor. Ross dares her to \\"call his bluff\\", which is his way of trying to seduce Content herself. She returns home and finds her husband and Katrin in a passionate kiss, but when he swears his allegiance and that nothing has happened, Content believes him. Katrin finally gives up and decides to try someone else.

The cap set problem is the problem of finding the size of the largest possible cap set, as a function of n.. The first few cap set sizes are 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, 112, ... . Cap sets may be defined more generally as subsets of finite affine or projective spaces with no three in line, where these objects are simply called caps. The \\"cap set\\" terminology should be distinguished from other unrelated mathematical objects with the same name, and in particular from sets with the compact absorption property in function spacesSee, e.g., . as well as from compact convex co-convex subsets of a convex set.See, e.g., . Example An example of cap sets comes from the card game Set, a card game in which each card has four features (its number, symbol, shading, and color), each of which can take one of three values. The cards of this game can be interpreted as representing points of the four- dimensional affine space \\\\mathbb{Z}_3^4, where each coordinate of a point specifies the value of one of the features. A line, in this space, is a triple of cards that, in each feature, are either all the same as each other or all different from each other. The game play consists of finding and collecting lines among the cards that are currently face up, and a cap set describes an array of face-up cards in which no lines may be collected. One way to construct a large cap set in the game Set would be to choose two out of the three values for each feature, and place face up each of the cards that uses only one of those two values in each of its features. The result would be a cap set of 16 cards. More generally, the same strategy would lead to cap sets in \\\\mathbb{Z}_3^n of size 2^n. However, in 1971, Giuseppe Pellegrino proved that four-dimensional cap sets have maximum size 20. In terms of Set, this result means that some layouts of 20 cards have no line to be collected, but that every layout of 21 cards has at least one line. Maximum size Since the work of Pellegrino in 1971, and of Tom Brown and Joe Buhler, who in 1984 proved that cap-sets cannot constitute any constant proportion of the whole space, there has been a significant line of research on how large they may be. =Lower bounds= Pellegrino's solution for the four-dimensional cap-set problem also leads to larger lower bounds than 2^n for any higher dimension, which were further improved by to approximately 2.2174^n.. =Upper bounds= In 1984, Tom Brown and Joe Buhler proved that the largest possible size of a cap set in \\\\mathbb{Z}_3^n is o(3^n) as n grows; loosely speaking, this means that cap sets have zero density. P√©ter Frankl, Ronald Graham, and Vojtƒõch R√∂dl have shown in 1987 that the result of Brown and Buhler follows easily from the Ruzsa - Szemer√©di triangle removal lemma, and asked whether there exists a constant c<3 such that, indeed, for all sufficiently large values of n, any cap set in \\\\mathbb{Z}_3^n has size at most c^n; that is, whether any set in \\\\mathbb{Z}_3^n of size exceeding c^n contains an affine line. This question also appeared in a paper published by Noga Alon and Moshe Dubiner in 1995. In the same year, Roy Meshulam proved that the size of a cap set does not exceed 2\\\\cdot3^n/n. Determining whether Meshulam's bound can be improved to c^n with c<3 was considered one of the most intriguing open problems in additive combinatorics and Ramsey theory for over 20 years, highlighted, for instance, by blog posts on this problem from Fields medalists Timothy Gowers and Terence Tao. In his blog post, Tao refers to it as \\"perhaps, my favorite open problem\\" and gives a simplified proof of the exponential bound on cap sets, namely that for any prime power p, a subset S \\\\subset F_p^n that contains no arithmetic progression of length 3 has size at most c_p^n for some c_p. In 2011, Michael Bateman and Nets Katz improved the bound to O(3^n/n^{1+\\\\varepsilon}) with a positive constant \\\\varepsilon. The cap set conjecture was solved in 2016, when Ernie Croot, Vsevolod Lev, and P√©ter P√°l Pach posted a preprint on a tightly related problem, that was quickly used by Jordan Ellenberg and Dion Gijswijt to prove an upper bound of 2.756^n on the cap set problem... In 2019, Sander Dahmen, Johannes H√∂lzl and Rob Lewis formalised the proof of this upper bound in the Lean theorem prover.. Applications =Sunflower conjecture= The solution to the cap set problem can also be used to prove a partial form of the sunflower conjecture, namely that if a family of subsets of an n-element set has no three subsets whose pairwise intersections are all equal, then the number of subsets in the family is at most c^n for a constant c<2.. =Matrix multiplication algorithms= The upper bounds on cap sets imply lower bounds on certain types of algorithms for matrix multiplication.. =Strongly regular graphs= The Games graph is a strongly regular graph with 729 vertices. Every edge belongs to a unique triangle, so it is a locally linear graph, the largest known locally linear strongly regular graph. Its construction is based on the unique 56-point cap set in the five-dimensional ternary projective space (rather than the affine space that cap-sets are commonly defined in)..

Reviews of the eight-track release from music critics were generally favorable, some reviewers praising its uplifting and emotional style of trap music uncommon in the internet music scene. Background and composition Prudhomme began working on Remembrance in Florida in mid-2014. This was shortly before one night when moving from the state to his home territory that his house burned down, which was \\"one of the longest, most emotionally trying nights of his life\\" as Impose magazine described.Song, Sandra (September 23, 2014). \\"Suicideyear is the Daniel Johnston of southern rap\\".

As he recalled, \\"It really propelled me to do a lot of shit that I wasn‚Äôt ready to do, like I had to look for a place to live real quick. I had to get a job immediately. Like I had to do a bunch of shit.‚Äù He had \\"felt a lot of feelings\\" and wanted to migrate back to where he started recording Remembrance, which he described as a \\"really beautiful place\\". The staccato-note percussion and fast-paced click tracks on Remembrance represent Prudhomme's bitterness during this period. However, he also had hope that his life would get back together and that he could learn how to improve the music he was producing, a calm feeling that was also a heavy contributor to the album's sound. Loud and Quiet described Remembrance's overall instrumentation as consisting of \\"shimmering synth-pad soundscapes, soaring arpeggios and razor sharp, syncopated hip-hop beats\\". Categorizing it as an experimental album, Resident Advisor noted the album's sounds, such as the ghost-like vocal snippets on \\"Daniel\\" and \\"Savior\\", to have the same feel as the 1980s Fairlight CMI-programmed textures that were present in music by The Art of Noise. Both Tiny Mix Tapes and Pitchfork Media honored the extended play for being a different take on trap music, the latter writing that \\"Prudhomme takes very specific elements of this production, zooms in, and amplifies them until they become something else, something he can call his own.\\" Pitchfork also compared the melodic structure of the tracks to that of intelligent dance music released in the late 1990s, and noted the record to have the \\"slow-burn anxiety\\" of the works of producer and DJ Zaytoven.

Some reviewers, including Tiny Mix Tapes critic Gage Taylor and Mark Richardson of Pitchfork Media praised the album for making a different type of trap music from what was common by acts associted with the internet music scene, the rare type being trap music that creates its own emotion and is optimistic. Taylor and Richardson especially praised the last track, which was a cover of \\"When You Sleep\\" by My Bloody Valentine; Richardson wrote, \\"MBV covers can go wrong so easily, but Prudhomme finds something new in the song, an iciness and feeling of isolation that move in opposition to the warmth found on the most oceanic of albums\\".

Cheney. Retrieved August 1, 2016 The congregation was founded in 1943 through the union of the Congregation of Pious Workers (founded by Charles Carafa in Naples in 1600 using the post-nominal initials C.P.O.) with the Congregation of Rural Catechists (founded by Gaetano Mauro in Montalto Uffugo in 1928). History =Congregation of Pious Workers= Charles Carafa Charles Carafa was born in 1561 and joined the Society of Jesus at the age of sixteen. After five years in the Society, constant ill-health forced him to leave. Eventually he decided to enter the army. One day while passing the Palazzo Reale di Napoli, he happened to hear the nuns chanting at the Monastery of Regina Caeli and stopped to listen. Carafa decided to make a change and at the age of thirty-four, took up the study of philosophy and theology. Five years later he was ordained. After this his life became a constant exercise of charity and zeal. Cardinal Giesualdo, seeing his good work, assigned him to the church of Santa Maria di Tutti i Beni. Several ecclesiastics who were under his spiritual guidance left their homes to live with him and aid him in his apostolic labors, which the archbishop allowed.Currier, Charles Warren. History of Religious Orders, 1894 In 1601 Caraffa opened his church, and, with eight priests, he began to work. He faced many trials: he was misrepresented at Rome; he had to leave the church which had been given to him, and most of his disciples abandoned him. But he kept up his courage, rented a house and continued his work with three companions, who had remained faithful. Some time after, his perseverance was rewarded by new accessions to his community. This enabled him to establish several houses of his congregation. He obtained for it the approbation of Pope Gregory XV by a Brief of 1621. It received the title of Congregation of the Pious Workers. After a life of great merit, spent in works of charity, he died on 8 September 1633. \\"Pious Workers\\" The congregation, originally known as \\"the Christian doctrine\\", was founded near Naples around 1600 by Carlo Carafa (1561-1633) for the service of the poor and the teaching of catechism in rural areas. The institute received pontifical recognition in 1606.Vizzari, D., Dizionario degli Istituti di Perfezione, Edizioni paoline, Milano vol. VI (1980), col. 1718 In 1617 the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore in Naples was offered to the fathers as its headquarters. The congregation was approved on 1 April 1621 by Pope Gregory XV, who changed its title to \\"Pious Workers\\" (the religious, in addition to catechesis, dedicated themselves to works of charity and had added to their purposes the preaching of the popular missions in the countryside). The Pious Workers risked extinction during the plague epidemic of 1656, during which they worked hard to assist the infected and many caught the disease in turn; the congregation revived thanks to Pietro Gisolfo. In 1687 they had a seat in Rome, first at the Church of Santa Balbina, then at the parish of San Lorenzo ai Monti, and in 1732 in San Giuseppe alla Lungara. Although their apostolate was limited to the areas surrounding Rome and Naples and their number was limited (the institute almost never exceeded one hundred members), the Pious Workers had great prestige in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and their houses (especially St. Nicholas of Charity in Naples) were renowned centers of spirituality. With the constitution Inter Multiplices of December 14, 1792, Pope Pius VI extended to the Pious Workers all the privileges of the regular orders. The Pious Workers exercised a considerable influence on the nascent congregations of the Pious Teachers of Lucia Filippini and the Most Holy Redeemer (the Pious Workers were the bishops Emilio Giacomo Cavalieri, maternal uncle of Alfonso Maria de' Liguori, and Tommaso Falcoia, who contributed to the birth of the Redemptorist nuns). Alphonsus appears to have held the memory of Father Caraffa in great esteem, and appears to have copied the institute of the Pious Workers in several points when preparing the rules of his own congregation. With the Napoleonic suppressions and the Savoy subversive laws, the congregation saw a considerable reduction in the number of its members, so much so that in 1943 only one Pio Operaio, Pasquale Ossorio, residing in San Nicola alla Carit√†, remained alive. =Congregation of Rural Catechists= In 1925 Gaetano Mauro (1888-1969) founded in Calabria the Religious Association of Rural Orators (A.R.D.O.R.), a company of priests and lay people for the teaching of catechism to farmers and to those who lived in remote areas. Some members of the association (called \\"ardorini\\") in 1928 began to lead a common life at the convent of San Francesco di Paola in Montalto Uffugo. On December 8, 1928 the ardorini of common life were constituted into a religious congregation, taking the name of \\"Rural Catechists\\", and on June 27, 1930 the institute obtained the approval of the Archbishop of Cosenza. =Union of the two congregations= To prevent the old congregation of the Pious Workers from becoming extinct, by decree of 28 June 1943 the Holy See united the Rural Catechists, who had the same aims; the Roman community of Rural Catechists moved to the church of San Giuseppe alla Lungara, while some Calabrian religious settled, together with the last Worker Pius, at the church of San Nicola della Carit√†. With the decree of union the Holy See appointed superior general of the new congregation Pasquale Ossorio; the ancient constitutions of the Pious Workers were abolished and replaced with those elaborated by Mauro in 1931. Activity The Ardorini Missionaries are dedicated to the social and religious assistance of rural populations and youth. They are present in Italy, Canada and Colombia. The headquarters is in Montalto Uffugo (Cosenza); in Rome, Procurator General of the Congregation resides at the Church of San Giuseppe alla Lungara in Rome. As of December 31, 2008, the congregation had 7 houses with 39 religious, 33 of whom were priests.

He joined the department in 1954 and served as its head from 1977 to 1985. He served as the Dean of Science at MIT from 1985 to 1991. He is notable for his interest in and commitment to undergraduate education, and taught the department's biochemistry course for over 50 years. Early life and education Brown was born in Pioneer, Missouri and raised in nearby Cassville until around age nine, when his family moved to Idaho. He was the first member of his family to attend high school and the only member of his graduating high school class to attend college. After a year as a college student in Idaho, he joined the Army Air Corps, where he was assigned to work in chemical warfare operations. His tasks included teaching safety lessons, which he later described as \\"whetting [his] teaching interest\\" for his later activities as an educator. Brown used the GI Bill to attend Colorado A&M; to finish his undergraduate degree in chemistry. He was encouraged by a biochemistry professor there to attend graduate school. Brown received his PhD from the University of Wisconsin in 1953 under the supervision of Esmond Snell, although Snell moved to the University of Texas partway through Brown's education. After defending his thesis in Wisconsin, Brown worked briefly as a postdoctoral fellow with Snell in Texas. Academic career Brown was offered a faculty position at MIT by Jack Buchanan, who at the time was interested in recruiting biochemists. Brown began at MIT in 1954 as an instructor and later advanced through the ranks to full professor. He served as the associate head of the department from 1967 to 1977 and as the head from 1977 to 1985, succeeding Boris Magasanik. Under his leadership, funding was obtained and plans were made for the launch of MIT's Whitehead Institute. In 1985 Brown became the Dean of Science at MIT. During his tenure as dean, he worked on curricular issues, including the development of a communication requirement to be incorporated into the undergraduate program and the planning stages of a new building for biology research. He was also involved in investigating what became known as the \\"Baltimore affair\\", a high- profile allegation of research misconduct against then-MIT faculty members David Baltimore and Thereza Imanishi-Kari. (They were eventually cleared of misconduct.) Brown closed his research laboratory during his service as dean, citing time pressure; after he resigned in 1991, he moved to spending his time on teaching and administrative work in the department. Brown became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999. =Teaching= Brown is notable for his longevity as an educator, having started teaching the department's undergraduate biochemistry class when he arrived in 1954. In 2004 he was honored for teaching it continuously for 50 years. Brown also taught other undergraduate courses and served as the department's coordinator for undergraduate research. In 1994 Brown was one of four MIT professors named that year as MacVicar Fellows, which provided support for faculty interested in developing improvements to undergraduate education. MIT gives two teaching awards named after Brown: the Gene Brown Prize, which recognizes academic and teaching excellence among undergraduates, and the Gene Brown-Merck Teaching Award, which recognizes excellence in teaching among graduate students. =Research= Brown's research interests focused on metabolic biochemistry, particularly in prokaryotes. His PhD work involved isolating and identifying a compound needed for the growth of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which proved to be pantethine, an intermediate in the synthesis of coenzyme A. He based his research as a faculty member on broadening this work to identifying additional coenzymes and studying their biosynthesis. He was particularly instrumental in understanding the biosynthesis of folic acid and related pteridine compounds, and later described this work as the research he was most proud of.

She had a brief career, notable only for the circumstances surrounding her wrecking on 11 November 1816 in the Gulf of Mexico off the Yucat√°n coast. Career On her launch Tay went into Ordinary at Portsmouth. Then in October to November 1814 she underwent fitting for sea. Captain William Robilliard commissioned her in August 1814. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1815 Tay underwent modification at Portsmouth. Captain Robert Boyle assumed command in February. On 26 June, Panther, Gezoline, master, arrived at Plymouth as a prize to , , , Tay, and . Panther had been sailing from Martinique to Dunkirk when the British captured her.Lloyd's List, no.4984, - accessed 16 May 2014. Commander Samuel Roberts was promoted to post captain on 13 June 1815 and replaced Boyle in command of Tay on 24 January 1816. Roberts then sailed Tay to the Jamaica Station. Loss Tay was sailing from Havana to Campeche, Mexico, when at 1 a.m. 11 November lookouts spotted breakers ahead, even though a sounding a few minutes earlier had found no ground at 20 fathoms. Although the helmsman was able to turn her, Tay slammed broadside into a coral reef; she slammed twice more before heeling over and filling with water. The crew fired distress guns, cut away her masts, launched boats, and manned the pumps. Daylight showed a rocky reef nearby. However, in trying to reach it the boats swamped, causing one passenger, a Spaniard, to drown. Eventually the crew were able to use a raft to reach the rocks while hauling a hawser that the rest of the crew then used to escape the wreck. The next day the crew used the boats to salvage provisions and stores from the wreck and establish a camp on a nearby island. Lieutenant Henry Smithwick then sailed Tays yawl to the mainland in search of help. On 18 November the Spanish guarda costa Valencey, Captain Varines, arrived, together with the schooner Zaragozana. After the Spaniards had verified that all the crew were safely on the island, they proceeded to demand, at gunpoint, that Captain Roberts and his crew surrender and deliver over their arms and any specie on board Tay. Roberts surrendered, declaring he and his men \\"prisoners of war\\", a status the Spaniards acknowledged. They then proceeded to loot Tay of her stores and provisions. The Spaniards also recovered about $350,000 in specie. (An early report of her loss stated that Tay had $2 million in specie on board.Lloyd's List n¬∞ 5147, 28 January 1817. - Accessed 31 July 2016.) Zaragozana then took off Tays complement. Tay had struck on the east side of Scorpion Reef (Spanish: Arrecife Alacranes; ), which surrounds a small group of islands. The reef and islands sit in the Gulf of Mexico off the northern coast of the state of Yucat√°n, Mexico, and are part of the Campeche Bank archipelago. Court martial The Navy held a court martial for Roberts and his crew on at Port Royal, Jamaica, on 21 February 1817. The trial lasted 18 days, not including Sundays, and covered three issues: the loss of Tay, the propriety of Roberts's surrender, and the behaviour of some of Tays crew.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 37, pp.504-5. The court martial acquitted Roberts, his officers, and crew of any blame for the loss of Tay. It attributed the loss to a strong westerly current and stated that Roberts had taken every possible precaution. Furthermore, the board commend the officer of the watch, acting Lieutenant William Henry Gearey, for his prompt and officer-like conduct when the breakers were first discovered. With respect to the surrender, the court martial again exonerated Roberts and his crew, saying: > that in consequence of the peculiar situation of the ship, her guns being > entirely useless, her magazine drowned, the greater part of her crew on > shore unarmed, on the island, eleven miles from the wreck, and the > treacherous conduct of the Spaniards, in inveigling on board and taking > possession of the boats and their crews, all and every means of defence was > rendered impracticable; that in this distressed and helpless situation the > conduct of the Spaniards became so decidedly hostile and insulting, that no > other alternative was left for preserving the dignity of his Majesty's flag, > but that of striking it, which was accordingly done, with the concurrence of > every officer present; and the Court doth fully approve of Captain Roberts's > conduct, and doth, therefore, acquit him, the officers, and crew, of all > blame; and they are hereby acquitted accordingly.\\" During the stay on the island there had been a notable breakdown in discipline among the crew. The court martial sentenced 14 sailors and marines to receive from 50 to 200 lashes for offenses ranging from drunkenness to looting of the wreck. Midshipman Hilkitch Head was found guilty of breaking into cabins and rifling them for papers and money. His sentence comprised two parts. First, he was taken to the quarterdeck of a naval vessel, stripped of his coat (and of his marks of rank), and discharged from the Navy. Second, he then was sentenced to six months in solitary confinement in the Marshalsea. Aftermath When Roberts departed for Britain, the merchants of Kingston, Jamaica, presented \\"an Address to him, expressive of the high respect they entertain of his character, their indignation at the dastardly conduct of the officer commanding the Spanish vessel sent to his assistance, their admiration of the judgment Captain R. displayed on that trying occasion, and their deep regret that the station had been deprived of his valuable services.\\" Roberts left for England on 17 March as captain of the transport Lady Hamilton. After his return to England, Roberts went on to Waterford, where he had been born. There some local notables gave him a testimonial dinner. On 31 January 1823 Roberts commissioned the sloop .Gentleman's Magazine, (April 1849), p.427. In her he cruised to the West Indies and Havana, returning to England in July 1825. Reportedly, in October 1818 the Spanish returned the specie that they had looted from Tay.

He was the son of Brian O'Rourke and Mary Burke of Clanricarde. Raised by his mother in County Galway, he lived most of his life in exile from his kingdom, looking for allies to support his claim as king of West Breifne in opposition to his half-brother Brian Oge O'Rourke. Having initially supported the Irish alliance during the Nine Years' War, he switched allegiance to England following the Battle of Kinsale in 1602. With the support of English forces he invaded West Breifne in 1603, ousting his half- brother and ruling as king until his unexpected death in late 1605 at the age of 28. Early life and career O'Rourke was born in 1576. Shortly after this he was separated from his father and was raised in Galway by his mother and her family, the Burkes of Clanricarde. Under English law, O'Rourke was the legitimate heir to the kingship of West Breifne and, as a son of a wealthy pro-English family, was favoured by the crown government in Dublin from the outset to inherit his father's title.Gallogy, pp. 50‚Äì53 However, his father's chosen successor was his \\"illegitimate\\" half-brother Brian Oge O'Rourke, who was nine years his elder and lived with Sir Brian in Leitrim. Teigue's inheritance was thrown into further doubt when Lord President Richard Bingham, who effectively wanted to end the O'Rourke dynasty, occupied West Breifne in 1590 and ousted Sir Brian, who was executed for treason at Tyburn the following year. By 1593 Bingham had been pushed back out of West Breifne by Brian Oge. Teigue moved to Tyrconnell at the outbreak of the Nine Years' War in 1594 and, despite his brother fighting alongside Hugh Roe O'Donnell and Hugh O'Neill as an ally, Teigue continued to petition them to support his claim as king. Although there is no evidence to suggest they ever seriously considered his proposals, he was useful to the Ulster lords as a threat with which to keep Brian Oge in line. Teigue's claim was such a concern to Brian Oge that he briefly switched allegiance to England from February to June 1598 when he received written English support for his claim from Governor Conyers Clifford.Gallogy, pp. 185‚Äì186 However, as Teigue's hugely influential family continued to push his claim, gaining backers like Lord Treasurer Thomas Butler, Brian Oge switched back to the Irish alliance believing the English assurances to be disingenuous. In 1599 Teigue married Hugh Roe O'Donnell's sister Mary and they had their first son, Brian.Gallogy, pp. 194‚Äì195 By 1600 the Irish alliance was on the ascendancy and Brian Oge had proven himself a capable and indispensable military leader, whereas Teigue had been less successful on the field. Strength and valour were of utmost importance for a leader's credibility in Gaelic Ireland and the likelihood of Teigue becoming king dwindled. According to English officials Teigue \\"could not bring one man\\" under his command within the kingdom he claimed as his own. During his exile Teigue continued to make frequent contact with the English through mail: Following a disastrous campaign in Munster in January 1601, where Teigue lost 500 of the 800 men O'Donnell had provided him, he returned to Tyrconnell and reconciled with his brother. By late 1601 the Irish alliance had suffered a string of defeats and Brian Oge and O'Donnell travelled south to assist the Spanish at Kinsale. When it became clear that the English forces were to be victorious at Kinsale (Teigue's cousin Richard was in Munster leading the English cavalry), Teigue moved swiftly with the support of the Clanricarde Burkes to seize control of West Breifne. Despite suffering defeat at Kinsale, Brian Oge returned to West Breifne in early 1602 and promptly ousted Teigue, who fled to Dublin. King of West Breifne Teigue spent the remainder of the war in Dublin where he was welcomed by crown officials as heir. By March 1603 the Treaty of Mellifont had been signed by O'Neill and the war was effectively over. However, Brian Oge's West Breifne continued to hold out. Teigue was given command of 3,000 English soldiers by the government and was sent along with Rory O'Donnell and Henry Folliott to retake West Breifne at the end of March 1603. As a final obstacle to his kingship, Teigue's army was met with fierce resistance by Brian Oge's expertly entrenched forces, who prevented Teigue and his allies from crossing the Shannon and entering West Breifne for twelve days. When the defences were finally broken, Teigue's forces ravaged the countryside of the kingdom as Brian Oge and other chieftains loyal to him were holed up in their keeps. On 25 April 1603 Brian Oge fled and Teigue became king, although this was not formally recognised until September 1603 when King James I officially granted Teigue \\"the country or lordship of Breny Ui Ruairc and Muinter Eoluis\\".Gallogy, pp. 200‚Äì203 The defeat of the Irish in the Nine Years' War heralded the end of the Gaelic Political order and the powers of the native kings were severely reduced. Due to extraordinary circumstances, Teigue was to be the last king of West Breifne. He died after falling terminally ill in late 1605.Casway, pp. 562‚Äì564 Family Teigue was Mary O'Donnell's third husband. They had two sons, Brian, who was born in 1599 and Aedh (Hugh), who was born a year later. Upon Teigue's death, wardship of his two young sons was passed to his cousin Richard Burke. The heir, Brian, was sent to live with Burke. Mary O'Donnell remarried and settled in County Mayo, where Aedh continued to live with her. Brian eventually went to Oxford University and had a son named Brian before or during being locked in the Tower of London in 1619. =Family tree= Bibliography * Gallogy, Dan.

His voice is rich, arresting, and filled with subtle nuances. He also excels at his portrayal of the wealthy American Lou Malloy, giving him a lace-curtain Irish accent--brash and with a lilt. Daly is equally adroit with Malloy's Greek friend and the aristocratic Italian accents of the Farnese family members. This is an audio experience to savor, like a good glass of wine. A great story and a great performance, rare and wonderful.\\" He was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor for the Maverick Movie Awards in 2009 for Don Percy's short feature \\"Inanimate Objects\\".

She is the current world record holder for the S4 50m Freestyle. Watson represented Australia at the 2016 Rio Paralympics where she became the first S4 to win a gold medal in the 50m Freestyle at any Paralympic games. Personal Watson was born on 30 January 1992 in Brisbane, Queensland. She is a triplet and has mild cerebral palsy due to a premature birth. At the age of 21, she acquired Guillain Barre Syndrome that led to rapid full body muscle weakness and peripheral nervous system damage resulting in the loss of ability to walk and low level quadriplegia. The cause remains unknown. Before acquiring Guillain Barre Syndrome, she was employed as a learn-to-swim instructor whilst studying at university and had also earned honours in AMEB piano and music theory exams. In 2009, as a Year 12 student, Watson was the sole recipient of the \\"Leanne Crawl Goodwill Award\\", an award which the recipient demonstrates exceptional goodwill and kindness towards fellow students. Watson held a leadership position whilst attending high school and was also awarded the \\"Community Spirit\\" award. In 2011, she was awarded the \\"Queensland Young Volunteer of the Year\\". Watson holds a voluntary role as the official ambassador for the Guillain Barre Syndrome Foundation of Australia where she provides education to medical staff and direct support to patients and their families. She currently volunteers at the Queensland Children's Hospital in the Operating Theatre Support role. She is a member of the Queensland Health Disability Advisory Committee. Watson holds a university degree in Early Childhood Education. Swimming Watson took up swimming as part of her rehabilitation. In 2015 she was classified as an S4 swimmer as a result of Guillain Barre Syndrome. She has broken 16-year-old Australian records (set in 1999) in the 50m, 100m, 200m Freestyle and 50m Butterfly. S4 classified swimmers have some weakness in their hands and arms and no use of their core or legs. The majority of competitions are held in a multi class (MC) format where each athlete swims against the world record for their classification and the swimmer with the highest point score wins the race. 1000 points equals a world record. At the 2016 Australian Swimming Championships, despite coming 8th in the multi class 50m Freestyle, she achieved an A qualifying time for the Rio Paralympics and at her first nationals, which also doubled as selection trials, she made her first Paralympic team. At the 2016 Rio Paralympics, she won the gold medal in the Women's 50m Freestyle S4 in a Paralympic record time of 40.13. Watson became the first swimmer classed S5 or below, to win gold for Australia this millennium. In preparation for Rio, Watson shared \\"If I was to win a medal, it won‚Äôt just me who has won, it‚Äôs them as well. They have done so much for me. My mum has taught me so much about how to be a young woman and my dad has taught me how to deal with the punches that life throws at you.\\" After the win, during her post race interview she was asked ‚ÄúWhat would your message be to other young women?‚Äù She replied tearfully, ‚ÄúI guess, just be kind to yourself, because you‚Äôre going to set goals and you‚Äôre going to want it to happen straight away and it‚Äôs not and it‚Äôs going to kick you in the guts a million times but, you know, this could happen if you work hard.‚Äù At the 2017 Australian Swimming Championships, she swam 37.87 in the Women's 50m Freestyle multi class final to break the previous S4 world record of 39.52. She broke the record in the heat as well in a time of 38.66. She won her first Australian national title and the world-record-breaking swim earned her a place on her first World Championships team. Watson received a standing ovation from the crowd and a hug from Dawn Fraser, which she describes as one of the most memorable moments of her life. The 2017 World Para Swimming Championships were postponed due to a series of strong earthquakes in Mexico. The championships were meant to take place 30 September - 6 October in Mexico City. Her current time would have seen her win gold. In 2018, Watson was chosen to volunteer at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games. She could not compete in the swimming at the games as her classification wasn't included in this competition. At the 2019 World Para Swimming Championships in London, she won a silver medal in the Women's 50m Freestyle S4, narrowly missing the gold medal, and a bronze medal in the Women's 100m Freestyle S4. She trains at the Chandler Swimming Club in Brisbane. Watson has been appointed Club Captain for the 2017/2018 season, the 2018/2019 season and the 2019/2020 season. =Major Results= *2016 - IDM Berlin Open - 50m Freestyle multi class - 1st (39.97) *2016 - Rio Paralympic Games - 50m Freestyle S4 - 1st (40.13) *2017 - Australian Swimming Championships (LC) - 50m Freestyle multi class - 1st (37.87) - WORLD RECORD *2017 - Canadian Open - 50m Freestyle multi class - 1st (39.02) *2017 - Canadian Open - 100m Freestyle multi class - 1st (1:27.62) *2018 - Australian Swimming Championships (LC) - 50m Freestyle multi class - 2nd (40.05) *2018 - Para Pan Pacific Championships - 50m Freestyle S4 - 1st (40.00) *2018 - Australian Swimming Championships (SC) - 50m Freestyle multi class - 1st (40.41) *2019 - Australian Swimming Championships (LC) - 50m Freestyle multi class - 1st (39.12) *2019 - Melbourne WPS World Series - 50m Freestyle multi class - 3rd (39.77) *2019 - Singapore WPS World Series - 50m Freestyle multi class - 2nd (39.20) *2019 - Singapore WPS World Series - 100m Freestyle multi class - 2nd (1:30.51) *2019 - London World Championships - 50m Freestyle S4 - 2nd (40.62) *2019 - London World Championships - 100m Freestyle S4 - 3rd (1:33.90) *2020 - Melbourne WPS World Series - 50m Freestyle multi class - 1st (39.75) Recognition 2016 - AIS Discovery of the Year (Swimming Australia Annual Awards) 2016 - Most Improved Athlete (Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association Annual Awards) 2016 - Swimming Australia Paralympic Swimmer of the Year nominee 2017 - Shannon Rollason Excellence Award: Open Female Swimmer 2016/2017 (Chandler Swim Club Annual Awards) 2017 - Order of Australia Medal 2017 - Swimming Australia's #1 Best Moment of 2017 2018 - QLD Sprint Championships \\"SWD Swimmer of the Meet\\" 2018 - Swimming Australia Paralympic Swimmer of the Year nominee 2019 - Shannon Rollason Excellence Award: Open Female Swimmer 2018/2019 (Chandler Swim Club Annual Awards) References External links  * (archive) Female Paralympic swimmers of Australia Swimmers at the 2016 Summer Paralympics Paralympic gold medalists for Australia Medalists at the 2016 Summer Paralympics Living people 1992 births S4-classified Paralympic swimmers Recipients of the Medal of the Order of Australia Medalists at the World Para Swimming Championships Paralympic medalists in swimming ","title":"Rachael Watson"},{"id":"51224085","text":"Ajamu Sibeko Baraka ( ; born October 25, 1953) is an American political activist and former Green Party nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 2016 election.  Early life  Baraka was born in 1953 and grew up on the South Side of Chicago. He served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War. Upon discharge, he moved to the southern United States, where he became involved in anti-segregation activism. Baraka received his BA in international studies and political science from the University of South Florida, Tampa in 1982 and his MA and PhD in political science from Clark Atlanta University in 1987.Alaska Division of Elections ‚Äì Green Primary Candidates Baraka has said the work of W.E.B. Du Bois was important in the formation of his black internationalist worldview, and he attended Clark Atlanta, where Du Bois had taught. Baraka became involved in the Central America solidarity movement, organizing delegations to Nicaragua in support of the Nicaraguan Revolution. He then became an Amnesty International volunteer, eventually moving up to the board of the organization.  Career  From 2004 to 2011, Baraka served as the founding executive director of the US Human Rights Network, a national network that grew to over 300 U.S.-based organizations and 1500 individual members. He is currently an associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C. Baraka has served on the boards of several human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and Africa Action.  Activism  Vicki Sexual Freedom Award, 2011 In 2008, Baraka worked with the US Human Rights Network and over 400 organizations to develop a CERD Shadow Report, which concerned US compliance with the terms of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. They felt the US government's reports did not adequately address racial profiling, displacement from Hurricane Katrina, and land rights for the Western Shoshone, among other issues. A large delegation presented their findings. In September 2016, a Morton County, North Dakota judge issued an arrest warrant against Baraka and Jill Stein, after the two were charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing and criminal mischief in connection with their protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Baraka had spray-painted the word \\"decolonization\\" on a bulldozer during the protest. In an interview shortly afterward, Baraka said that he and Stein were \\"in discussions with our legal team about how we're going to deal with this\\" and described his action as an act of resistance against \\"corporate America and the colonial state.\\" Views and writings  Writings by Baraka have appeared in Black Agenda Report, Common Dreams, Dissident Voice, Pambazuka News, CounterPunch, and other media outlets. Christopher Hooks wrote in Politico Magazine that Baraka \\"has a long history of fringe statements and beliefs.\\" = Foreign policy = Ajamu Baraka  Israel  Baraka has been a vehement critic of Israel. In October 2014, Baraka traveled to the Palestinian territories as part of an 18-member \\"African Heritage delegation\\" organized by the Interfaith Peace-Builders group. The delegation issued six \\"findings and demands\\" and urged the Congressional Black Caucus to place pressure on Israel. The group specifically called the expansion of Israeli settlements \\"ethnic cleansing and 21st century colonialism\\"; called for an end to U.S. aid to Israel; accused Israel of apartheid; and praised the \\"Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions\\" (B.D.S.) movement as \\"an essential tool in the struggle for Palestinian liberation.\\" After the visit, Baraka wrote that \\"a negotiated, relatively 'peaceful' resolution of the conflict is impossible\\" because \\"the Israeli state has no interest in a negotiated settlement with Palestinians.\\" He accused Israel of carrying out what he termed a \\"brutal occupation and illegal theft of Palestinian land,\\" adding: Baraka also questioned news stories about the June 2014 kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers, which Israel blamed on Hamas members and which led to Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip against Hamas. One month after the kidnappings, which he called a \\"false flag operation,\\" Baraka indicated in an interview his belief that \\"the kids were supposed to be kidnapped but they weren't supposed to be murdered. That was an accident. But nevertheless it gave Israel the pretext that they were setting up for, and that was the opportunity to basically attack Hamas in order to destroy the unity government.\\" Two suspects, both members of Hamas, were killed in a shootout with Israeli forces in September 2014, while a third Hamas member was convicted of the murders in January 2015. In March 2015, Baraka condemned Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comments on the day of the 2015 Israeli elections. Netanyahu had warned supporters in a video posted to his Facebook page that his government was in danger because \\"Arab voters are coming out in droves to the polls.\\" Baraka called Netanyahu's words a \\"racist rant\\" that exposed \\"the brutal and immoral reality of the Israeli colonial project\\" and the \\"illusion\\" of a two-state solution.  Syria and Iraq  Speaking in 2014 on U.S. involvement in Iraq, Baraka characterized U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East over the previous 20 years as \\"disastrous\\" and said that \\"what has occurred in Iraq was predictable.\\" In a 2014 interview, Baraka stated his belief that the U.S. had a part in creating the \\"boogeyman\\" of ISIS \\"to basically garner significant public support for an argument that says that this monster, these evil forces‚Äîthat, by the way, we helped to create‚Äîwe are the only ones that can go in and slay this monster.\\" Baraka has also asserted that the atrocities of the Syrian Civil War are being \\"fomented by a demented and dying U.S. empire, with the assistance of the royalist monarchies of the Middle East and the gangster states of NATO.\\" In an interview, he suggested that control of natural resources, such as the proposed Qatar-Turkey and Iran-Iraq-Syria natural gas pipelines, is one of the underlying reasons for U.S. and Turkish interests in the region: Baraka rejected the U.S. position that Syrian president Bashar al- Assad and the 2014 Syrian presidential election are illegitimate. In an article, he wrote that the idea of Assad's illegitimacy had been \\"carefully cultivated by Western state propagandists and dutifully disseminated by their auxiliaries in the corporate media.\\" He further argued that the election was proof that Syrians have \\"not surrendered their national sovereignty to the geostrategic interests of the U.S. and its colonial allies in Europe and Israel,\\" and accused the U.S. of hypocrisy for supporting elections in Ukraine but not Syria. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon criticized Syria's holding of an election during an ongoing civil war for undermining a political solution to the conflict, and the lack of independent election monitoring was widely reported.  Ukraine  Baraka characterized the 2014 overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych as a \\"U.S.-supported coup\\" that contained \\"racist neo-Nazi elements.\\" After the 2014 Odessa massacre, which resulted in the deaths of 42 pro-Russian and six pro-Ukrainian protestors, Baraka wrote that he was \\"outraged by the murder of people defending their rights to self-determination at the hands of U.S.-supported thugs in Odessa.\\" He has also suggested that the victory of Petro Poroshenko in the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election was illegitimate, questioning \\"what makes the election in Ukraine legitimate when half of the country boycotts the vote and the national army violently attacks its own citizens in Eastern Ukraine who refused to recognize the legitimacy of the coup-makers in Kiev\\". Two days after the event, Baraka expressed his suspicions that the shootdown of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine was a \\"false flag\\" operation, saying: \\"Someone wrote about three weeks ago that we should expect a major false flag operation in eastern Ukraine that's going to be then blamed on the Russians. And that's exactly what has happened. They're trying to say in the Western press that the Ukrainian government does not have access to that kind of weaponry, when it's clear that they do.\\" He criticized Western media coverage of the event for \\"undermining anything coming from Russia Today. That's where you see the story being advanced that there is a possibility that this story is a little more complicated than people realize.\\" Baraka also claimed that observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe were \\"sent in basically as spies who showed up on the scene to quote-unquote 'monitor'.\\"  Nigeria  Baraka has criticized calls for Western military action against the jihadist rebel group Boko Haram, arguing that \\"a purely military response will only exacerbate an insurgency whose roots lie in the complex socio-historical conditions and internal contradictions of Northeast Nigeria.\\" In May 2014, a month after Boko Haram kidnapped 276 schoolgirls from the northern Nigerian town of Chibok, he expressed skepticism about the official version of events and the number of victims, saying that \\"even if there was a kidnapping, there's some people who are suggesting that the numbers are in fact inflated.\\" Baraka also stated that while he was \\"outraged\\" by the kidnapping, he was also suspicious of U.S. humanitarian concerns in the region: \\"U.S. policymakers don't give a damn about the schoolgirls in Nigeria because their real objective is to use the threat of Boko Haram in the northern part of the country to justify the real goal of occupying the oil fields in the south and to block the Chinese in Nigeria.\\"  China  Baraka characterized 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests as protests of \\"little middle-class Pro-USA reactionaries\\" and condemned bipartisan support of protest movement in relation to Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in October 2019. = Terrorism =  Views on Je suis Charlie movement In a January 2015 essay, Baraka described the Republican march in Paris in reaction to the Charlie Hebdo shooting as a \\"white power march,\\" and the Je suis Charlie movement in general as an \\"arrogant rallying cry for white supremacy\\". Baraka condemned what he perceived as the disproportionate interest in the Charlie Hebdo attacks, and the relative lack of interest in the Baga massacre in Nigeria by Boko Haram, which took place days before the Charlie Hebdo shooting and resulted in many more deaths. Baraka also criticized the \\"degrading ritual\\" of assimilation that Arabs and Muslims undergo in France, the \\"arrogant lack of respect for the ideas and culture of non-European peoples\\" that led to the French ban on face covering in public spaces, and the \\"racist\\" and \\"Islamophobic\\" character of Charlie Hebdos recent publications. Baraka's \\"Je suis Charlie\\" article was republished in January 2016 in an anthology about the November 2015 Paris attacks. The book, titled ANOTHER French False Flag? Bloody Tracks from Paris to San Bernardino, was edited by Kevin Barrett, who called himself a Holocaust denier on 1 April 2011 and who is called a 9/11 conspiracy theorist. Yair Rosenberg of Tablet magazine described the work as a \\"veritable who's who of bigots and conspiracy theorists.\\"Yair Rosenberg, Friends Don't Let Friends Vote for Jill Stein, Tablet (August 10, 2016). Brendan O'Connor reported Baraka's reply to the accusations of associating with holocaust deniers: \\"There has never been any question in mind about the genocidal madness of the Nazi Holocaust throughout Europe during the second world war. I abhor and reject any individual or group that fails to understand the tremendous suffering of Jewish people during that dark period.\\"  Charleston massacre  In an article titled \\"No 'Je Suis Charleston'?\\" Baraka contended that a collective response similar to \\"Je suis Charlie\\" was absent after the Charleston church shooting at the Emanuel AME Church, and criticized Obama for not calling suspect Dylann Roof a terrorist. As a longtime opponent of the death penalty, Baraka has also criticized the Department of Justice's decision to seek the death penalty for Roof, saying that it \\"should be seen as no more than another tactical move by the state as part of the last phase of the counterinsurgency launched against the black liberation movement. ... By appealing to African Americans, the group in the country most consistently opposed to the death penalty, state propagandists saw this as a perfect opportunity to undermine opposition to capital punishment and facilitate the process of psychological incorporation.\\" = Politicians and activists =  Barack Obama  Baraka referred to President Barack Obama as an \\"Uncle Tom president\\" because Obama condemned the 2014 riots and violence in Ferguson, Missouri that occurred after the death of Michael Brown. Defending his use of the term, Baraka later said that he was speaking to a \\"specialized audience\\" and was attempting to \\"shock people into a more critical look at this individual.\\" Baraka has also argued that Obama has shown \\"obsequious deference to white power,\\" and that Obama and Loretta Lynch are members of the \\"black petit-bourgeoisie who have become the living embodiments of the partial success of the state's attempt to colonize the consciousness of Africans/black people.\\" Baraka was critical of the Obama administration's decision to not attend the 2009 UN World Conference Against Racism in Geneva. In 2013, Baraka stated that inviting Obama to the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington \\"should be taken as an insult by everyone who has struggled and continues to struggle for human rights, peace and social justice.\\" More recently, he has argued that \\"the Obama Administration collaborated with suppressing the 2009 report from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which identified violent white supremacist groups as a threat to national security more lethal than the threat from Islamic 'fundamentalists'.\\" In an October 2016 interview with The Detroit News, Baraka described Obama as a \\"moral disaster\\" and one of \\"the worst things that has happened to African- American people\\".  Bernie Sanders  Baraka referred to the presidential campaign of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders as \\"media-driven pseudo-opposition\\" and \\"an ideological prop‚Ä¶ of the logic and interests of the capitalist- imperialist settler state.\\" In a September 2015 article, Baraka condemned Sanders' foreign policy and his support for continuing Obama's program of drone strikes in Yemen, claiming that \\"the world that a President Sanders promises\\" would be one with \\"continued war crimes from the sky with drone strikes and Saudi-led terror in support of the Western imperial project.\\" Baraka argued that support for Sanders represents \\"a tacit commitment to Eurocentrism and the assumptions of normalized white supremacy\\" due to what he perceived as \\"indifference\\" to the lives lost during the drone campaign in Yemen.  Bill Clinton  In June 2016, Baraka criticized the family of Muhammad Ali for inviting Bill Clinton to deliver the boxer's eulogy. Baraka described Clinton as a \\"rapist\\" and \\"petty opportunist politician.\\"  Cornel West  In September 2015, Baraka criticized Cornel West for supporting Bernie Sanders, saying that West was \\"sheep-dogging for the Democrats\\" by \\"drawing voters into the corrupt Democratic party\\". West later endorsed Jill Stein after Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton.  Beyonc√©  In February 2016, Baraka criticized Beyonc√©'s performance of her song \\"Formation\\" at the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, which featured backup dancers dressed as Black Panthers, claiming that it was a \\"commodified caricature of black opposition.\\" Baraka derided the performance as \\"mindless entertainment\\" and \\"a depoliticized spectacle by gyrating, light-skinned booty-short-clad sisters.\\" Baraka claimed that the \\"white male capitalist patriarchy\\" was responsible for selecting Beyonc√© to perform and would not have allowed \\"anything subversive or even remotely oppositional to the interests of the capitalist oligarchy\\" on stage.  2016 U.S. vice presidential campaign  Baraka and Stein, August 2016 On August 1, 2016, Green Party presumptive presidential nominee Jill Stein announced that Baraka would be her running mate. Stein and Baraka were formally nominated by delegates at the 2016 Green National Convention on August 6, 2016. In his acceptance speech, Baraka said that he joined the Green Party effort to \\"build a multinational movement here in this country based on the needs and the aspirations of working people\\".  Awards and recognition  In 1998, Baraka was one of 300 human rights workers honored by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. In 2001, Baraka was named \\"abolitionist of the year\\" by the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty for his efforts to end the death penalty in the United States. In 2019, the US Peace Memorial Foundation awarded Baraka with the US Peace Prize for his \\"bold antiwar actions, writings, speeches, and leadership that provide an inspiring voice against militarism.\\"  Publications     References   External links   Stein/Baraka 2016 campaign website * 1953 births Living people 21st-century American male writers 21st-century American non-fiction writers 2016 United States vice-presidential candidates Activists for African- American civil rights Activists from Illinois African- American activists African-American candidates for Vice President of the United States American anti‚Äìdeath penalty activists American army personnel of the Vietnam War American columnists American human rights activists American male non-fiction writers American political writers American socialists Amnesty International people Anti-capitalists Anti-Zionism in the United States Clark Atlanta University alumni Drug policy reform activists Green Party of the United States vice presidential nominees Illinois Greens Illinois socialists Non-interventionism People from Chicago United States Army soldiers Writers from Chicago ","title":"Ajamu Baraka"},{"id":"51224087","text":"Bust of Vladimir Kudashov Vladimir Petrovich Kudashov ()(1918 ‚Äì 1976) was a Russian soldier of World War II (called, in the Soviet Union, the Great Patriotic War) and a Hero of the Soviet Union. Biography Kudashov was born in the village of Upper Beloz—ërki in Stavropol Region of Samara province. Kudashov joined in the Red Army in 1940. From the very beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 he was involved in battle, and he was slightly wounded. He was assigned to the 7th Independent Motorized Pontoon Bridge Battalion. In May 1942, when this battalion was part of Southwestern Front, during the Kharkov Offensive, Kudashov participated in various actions, including covering river crossings under enemy mortar and machine-gun fire, for which he was awarded a \\"For Service in Battle\\" medal. In 1943, his unit was part of the Steppe Front. On 27 September 1943 Kudashov, then a corporal, was involved in the assembly of a 30-ton ferry for the crossing of tanks onto the right bank of the Dnieper. Kudashov showed leadership and coolness under enemy artillery and mortar fire, helping to ensure that the tanks were safely delivered across the river, for which he was awarded a second \\"For Service in Battle\\" medal and was promoted to sergeant and squad leader. In 1944 the 7th Independent Motorized Pontoon Bridge Battalion was part of the 1st Pontoon Bridge Brigade of the 46th Army, part of the 2nd Ukrainian Front (the successor to the Steppe Front). Kudashov particularly distinguished himself in December 1944. Before 46th Army's crossing of the Danube Kudashov, together with Corporal Suslov and Private Yakushev, made a reconnaissance sortie behind enemy lines. They attacked a German headquarters, destroying a staff car and seizing documents from the corpses of the German occupants. During the Danube crossing, one of the assault pontoons was damaged. Kudashov, under enemy fire, was able to seal the holes and save the landing, and returned enemy fire. That night Kudashov made five crossings of the Danube, bringing soldiers, weapons, and ammunition. Kudashov and Zhilin at Upper Beloz—ërki After the war Kudashov returned to his native village, where he was a farm foreman. For distinguished service to labor he received a second Order of Lenin. He died in Upper Beloz—ërki on 20 October 1976. He is memorialized in Upper Beloz—ërki with a bust next to that of his fellow villager and Hero of the Soviet Union Vasily Zhilin but ‚Äì unusually, given the number of monuments in Tolyatti, and in contrast to Zhilin ‚Äì he is not memorialized in the city of Tolyatti.

It was the only non-subsidiary title at the rank of Marquess in the English Jacobite Peerage, before becoming a subsidiary of the Duke of Tyrconnell. It was awarded to James Paynter (1666 - ?), a leading Jacobite, who played a prominent role in the Jacobite uprising in Cornwall. In 1715 he was active in proclaiming James Francis Edward Stuart (the Old Pretender) on the death of Queen Anne. For this, he was tried at Launceston, but acquitted, and welcomed by \\"bonfire and by ball\\" from there to Land's End. For his commitment, he was created Marquess of Trelissick (also called Marquis of Trelessick) in the Jacobite Peerage of England, on 20 June 1715. It was well documented that James Paynter died without issue, and it was believed that the title was extinct; but, as no mention can be found of restriction of the title to \\"heirs-male of his body\\", the title was (and is) inheritable by other lines of the family, and through the female line, as \\"heirs-general\\". The title would therefore pass to his brother, William (born about 1661), though William's line did not assume the title. The title was reassumed by William Paynter's heir-general and 8th great-grandson, Edward Bourke.

Berkeley House is based on a drawing Small's wife made in 1831. Charles Coxwell Small (b 1801) was a wealthy farmer and public official in Upper Canada. Like his father, John Small, Small was the Chief Clerk of Upper Canada's Privy Council. In 1831 Small inherited extensive property from his father. This property included a parcel between Front and King, and Ontario and what is now Berkeley, but was then known as Parliament Street, on the original townsite of York, Upper Canada (later Toronto), with a large house, called Berkeley House. (The Ontario Genealogical Society reports John Small left this York property, jointly, to Charles Coxwell Small, and his older brother James Edward Small.) Charles Coxwell Small added to the house, transforming it into what Beaches Living called a \\"mansion\\". When new Parliament buildings were built, elsewhere, the original Parliament Street was renamed Berkeley after the Small grand home. He also inherited a parcel bounded by what is now Queen, Coxwell, Danforth and Kingston Road, then outside of the city limits. Coxwell Avenue is named after Charles Coxwell Small. Small dammed the creek on his rural property, to harness the waterpower for a sawmill. The large pond this created was named Small's Pond. The largest of the creeks he dammed was renamed Small's Creek. Charles Coxwell Small had a son born in 1831, the year his father died, who he also named John Small, served in Parliaments of the Province of Canada and Canada.

Reyes served as Lieutenant Governor of Guam from 1983 to 1987 under Governor Ricardo Bordallo, having been elected in 1982 as Bordallo's running mate.  Early life  He was born on January 24, 1930 to his parents Juan Reyes and Ana Guevara. Political career =1978 Borallo-Reyes Campaign= In 1978, incumbent Guam Governor Ricardo Bordallo, a Democrat, lost re-election to Republican Paul McDonald Calvo. Four years later, Bordallo, who planned a political comeback, once again announced his candidacy for Governor. Bordallo chose U.S. Air Force Colonel Edward Diego Reyes, a political unknown with no previous experience in elected office as his running mate. Reyes, a Vietnam War veteran with several awards and honors, retired from the U.S. Air Force following a 28-year career in order to enter the race with Bordallo. =1982 Borallo-Reyes Campaign= Bordallo and Reyes were challenged in the 1982 Democratic gubernatorial primary by Bordallo's former Lt. Governor Rudy Sablan and his running mate, Joe Leon Guerrero. However, Bordallo-Reyes easily defeated Sablan in the primary election by 35 percent. Bordallo and Reyes' campaign utilized the \\"People First\\" slogan in the general election campaign against Governor Paul McDonald Calvo. The Bordallo-Reyes defeated incumbent Governor Calvo and his running mate, Peter F. Perez Jr., in the 1982 general election. Bordallo won the race 1,402 votes (approximately 5%) out 28,996 votes cast. Bordallo and Reyes were sworn in as Governor and Lt. Governor on January 3, 1983. =1986 Borallo-Reyes Campaign= Bordallo and Reyes sought re-election to a second term in 1986. However, Governor Bordallo was indicted in September 1986 on eleven counts of corruption. Lt. Governor Reyes, who continued to support Bordallo as his running mate, was not implicated in the scandal and emerged from it with his reputation unscathed. However, the chances that Bordallo- Reyes ticket would be re-elected were severely diminished by Bordallo's indictment. Bordallo-Reyes lost re-election to Republican Joseph Franklin Ada and his running mate, Frank Blas, in the general election on November 4, 1986. Ada defeated Governor Bordallo by 2,581 votes (7.6%). =Guam Legislature= Reyes served in the 20th and the 22nd Guam Legislatures. =1994 Reyes-Nelson Campaign= In 1994, Reyes unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Guam, choosing Gloria Nelson as his running mate for Lt.

Had he won, Kasich would have been the first president since James A. Garfield to be elected from the House of Representatives, as well as the first Pennsylvania native since James Buchanan to hold the office. Kasich suspended his campaign on July 14, 1999. Background John Kasich in 1997 In 1996, while he was House Budget Committee chairman, John Kasich created the Pioneer Political Action Committee. Pioneer PAC was to help fund Kasich's travel costs so he could campaign for fellow Republicans across the country. In April 1997, Kasich began traveling to Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two contests in the primaries. Campaign On February 15, 1999, Kasich kicked off his campaign by announcing the formation of an exploratory committee. That same day, Kasich began a campaign swing through the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire. At 46 years of age, John Kasich was one of the youngest candidates in the 2000 Republican primaries. Kasich played up this fact, portraying himself as a fresh face and comparing himself to \\"Jolt Cola in a market dominated by Pepsi and Coca-Cola\\", in reference to the early favorites in the race, George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole. Kasich also chose to portray himself as a candidate who is not afraid to work with Democrats. He frequently brought up his prominent role in helping to pass four balanced budgets with President Bill Clinton. In March, Kasich was involved in an incident with a reporter. When a reporter from WNDS-TV asked when he would decide to run for president and drop the exploratory committee, Kasich responded in an angry tone, \\"I have no idea. That's a mechanical, political question and I don't do politics. You'll have to ask my press secretary.\\" The clip of the exchange was aired on television. Kasich's campaign responded, saying that he was unaware that he was being filmed. Kasich missed dozens of votes in order to spend time on the campaign trail, leading to upset voters in his home district. Kasich was also struggling to raise money, and by June, he had yet to break $2 million. On July 14, Kasich announced that he was dropping out of the race. Aftermath Kasich dropped out of the race and endorsed Bush Kasich went on to become the Governor of Ohio in 2011. In 2016, Kasich again ran for president, earning 154 delegates in the Republican primaries and winning his home state of Ohio, but suspended his campaign May 4th, 2016.

Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza recognized \\"And he paid back more than the things I could do for him\\". An editorial proposed to Plinio to write a book about his best friend, Plinio discussed the idea with Garc√≠a M√°rquez, who found it interesting. The Nobel Laureate commented: \\"It is a great idea, as this way I won't have to repeat everything in each interview\\". left In an interview Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza confessed the book was not based on a single interview with the Nobel Laureate: \\"I had conversed with him for 40 years, I wrote everything he had already told me, and I sent him the manuscript for being complemented\\".

He was a close friend and loyal supporter of Hans Christian Andersen who often visited the house. History Heinrich Hansen:The Collin family's house at Store Strandstr√¶de 3 (1850) Jonas Collin lived in Store Strandstr√¶de from 1802. At that time there was an old and somewhat ramshackle house at the site which, back in the mid 17th century, had served as the residence of Bernardino de Rebolledo, the Spanish ambassador to Denmark at that time.

On 3 October, Collin arranged a housewarming which was attended by some of the leading Danish artists of the time, including Bertel Thorvaldsen og Hermann Ernst Freund, Johan Ludvig, Hans Christian Andersen and Johanne Luise Heiberg. Jonas Collin and his wife lived on the ground floor and first floor while their daughter Ingeborg lived with her husband on the second floor. The building was later home to the company M.J. Gr√∏nbech & S√∏nner whose old headquarters at Bag B√∏rsen 76 was demolished in connection with an expansion of Slotsholmen. The company relocated to Kristianiagade 9 in 1947. Architecture Rear side of the building The building to the rear of the main building The house consists of three floors and is seven bays wide. It is pulled back from the street and thus breaks fundamentally with Nicolai Eigtved's strict guidelines for the architecture of Amaliegade and Frederiksstaden. The authorities long hoped to see a new building at the site that filled out the hole in the house row and they therefore rejected an application from the owner to build a fence on the street in 1768. The fence seen today was built in connection with a renovation of the house where the three-bay wall dormer seen today replaced a triangular pediment dating from when the house was built. An arched gateway opens to a narrow, cobbled yard. A small building at the far end of the courtyard is also listed. Today The building fronting the street contains an apartment on each floor. NoriDane Foods, a Nortura-owned meat trading company, is based in the rear wing (No. 9B).

The Democratic Alliance (, AD) was a Chilean political coalition existing between 1983 and 1988 that was composed of political parties and organisations that opposed the military regime led by Augusto Pinochet. History =Origins and foundation= The origins of the Democratic Alliance date back to March 14, 1983, when a \\"Democratic Manifesto\\" was signed by Hugo Zepeda Barrios, Julio Subercaseaux (representing liberal and conservative sectors); Luis Bossay, Duberildo Jaque, Enrique Silva Cimma, Luis Fernando Luengo (representing radicals and social democrats); Gabriel Vald√©s, Patricio Aylwin (representing the Christian Democrats); Ram√≥n Silva Ulloa, and Julio Hern√°n Vodanovic Stuardo (representing socialist groups). On August 6, 1983, in a ceremony held in the C√≠rculo Espa√±ol de Santiago, it announced the creation of the alliance between the Christian Democratic Party, Social Democracy, Radical, Popular Socialist Union and Republican Right (Republican Party since October 1984) plus other groups that did not sign at the time the Democratic Manifesto, such as the \\"renovated\\" sector of the Socialist Party of Chile led by Carlos Briones (\\"PS N√∫√±ez\\" from 1986) on behalf of the Socialist Bloc and the Liberal Party. In 1987 the Republican and Liberal parties merged to form the Liberal-Republican Union. The left-wing parties and groups not represented in the AD, created the People's Democratic Movement (, MDP) in September 1983. On August 22, 1983, the Democratic Alliance was created officially by signing a document called \\"Bases of the Dialogue for a Grand National Agreement\\", which contained three basic elements: * A national agreement to create a constituent assembly and a new constitution. * Augusto Pinochet's resignation to the Presidency of the Republic. * The establishment of a provisional government for a brief transition. =Political activity= It was the first time since the coup of 1973, which was publicly formalized an opposition coalition to the military dictatorship of Pinochet. It held on November 18 in O'Higgins Park the first public event since the coup. A crowd of 500,000 people was estimated. Taking support in the national protests and in collaboration with the Catholic Church sought a dialogue to end the dictatorship. The Minister of the Interior, Sergio Onofre Jarpa, began a round of talks with the Democratic Alliance and other political groups, however, in a public speech Pinochet evicted and removed his minister from office in November 1984. With this ended any possibility dialog and began a stage of tightening censorship of the press, that had been relaxed in 1983. In October 1983, the Popular Unitary Action Movement (MAPU) joined the Democratic Alliance, Jorge Molina being its representative in the coalition. In August 1985, the Democratic Alliance participated with other groups in the signing of the National Agreement, sponsored by the Catholic Church. This document stated commitment to a democratic and peaceful transition to democracy. The government ignored the document and closed any possibility of dialogue that was not to ensure the continuity. =Dissolution= In 1986, with the removal of PS N√∫√±ez (after the Party Congress held on 20 and 21 December of that year) and the Socialist Bloc, the Democratic Alliance entered a phase of low profile because of the inability to fulfill their initial objectives and unwillingness to dialogue Pinochet government. The member parties of the Democratic Alliance and other political groups formed the February 2, 1988 the National Command for the No to direct the voting campaign against the nomination of Pinochet as president for a period of 8 years in the 1988 plebiscite. This is why the Democratic Alliance is considered one of the forerunners of the Concertaci√≥n.

It discusses the development of two \\"garden suburbs\\" in Texas, the River Oaks neighborhood in Houston and the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth municipality of Highland Park, during the 1920s. Background The author, an independent scholar,Henderson, p. 43. is a resident of Austin, Texas.

Primary sources used as references include advertisements, archives, clip files, correspondence between the developers, drawings and plans, historical society collections, magazine articles, neighborhood newsletters, newspaper articles, pamphlets, photographs, records from city governments.Sies, p. 1012. Contents The book begins with a discussion of preceding developments in Texas. Three chapters of the book discuss River Oaks and Highland Park, including the original section and Highland Park West; this makes up over 50% of the book.Henderson, p. 44. The book ends by discussing subsequent developments. In regards to River Oaks and Highland Park the book discusses how the developers priced the lots, targeted buyers, and opened suburbs in phases. Some of that information originated from the Conference of Developers of High-Class Residential Property records. The book also discusses the infrastructure costs of the developments. The book notes include biographies of key individuals related to Highland Park and River Oaks. In the final chapter the author stated that the developments historically prevented African-Americans and Hispanics and Latinos from living there and therefore had a higher social status.Sies, p. 1013. She also stated that both Highland Park and River Oaks had become very wealthy areas even though in the 1920s they may have been considered middle class. Ferguson sometimes discusses other similar developments in the United States; Mary Corbin Sies of the University of Maryland stated that this was a \\"good feature\\" of Highland Park and River Oaks although at times at times they \\"are sometimes described without indicating how they help us contextualize\\" the two developments that are the main topic of the book. The communities that preceded Highland Park and River Oaks that are discussed include six communities in Houston: Broadacres, Courtlandt Place, Forest Hill, Houston Heights, and Westmoreland; as well as five communities in Dallas: East Dallas, Munger Place, Oak Cliff, Oak Lawn, and Philadelphia Place. According to the book some elements of the city planning used in Highland Park and River Oaks had an influence on subsequent developments while others did not.Krause, p. 216. The book specifically documented these areas in the section \\"Texas influence and permanence\\". It discusses two communities in Amarillo, Wolflin Estates and Wolflin Place; the Mills Place community in Corsicana; two places in Fort Worth: River Crest and Ryan Place, as well as nearby Westover Hills; Olmos Park in the San Antonio metropolitan area; and two places in Wichita Falls: Country Club Estates and Morningside Park Additions. Ferguson uses primary sources including advertisements, architectural drawings, deed restrictions, and planning documents to demonstrate the national trends. The book includes color, sepiatone and black and white photographs, along with maps and planning illustrations. In some cases the author had to use reproductions of images since she was unable to obtain the originals; as a consequence, according to Sies, some images of floor plans and maps are difficult to read and some images are small in size. Reception Harold Henderson of Planning wrote that the illustrations and maps were \\"superb\\". Robert E. Krause of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission praised the text for balancing the prose on individual houses within the developments and the prose on the overall development of the neighborhoods, and the illustrations for being \\"lovely\\"; Krause praised the author \\"for not only her research, but for creating a work widely applicable to subject experts, students, and the general public.\\" Krause argued that the book should have included a discussion on the controversy behind the demolitions of certain houses and contemporary maps. Sies wrote that the author \\"contributes substantially to scholars' understanding of the planning processes of affluent suburbs.\\" Sies argued that the book should have included a picture of a typical streetscape of Highland Park and River Oaks instead of primarily illustrating the most \\"grand\\" houses; that there is too much emphasis on Spanish architecture even though the book itself stated that architects were not very concerned with the specific housing styles chosen and instead, in Sies's words, \\"focused on crafting livable houses\\"; and that there are \\"idiosyncratic and hard-to-follow\\" descriptions of architecture.

The Morzin palace in Doln√≠ Lukavice  History  It was the hereditary estate of Count Morzin, an aristocrat of the Austrian Empire during the 18th century. Morzin is remembered today as the first person to employ the composer Joseph Haydn as his Kapellmeister, or music director.Lesser known is the Count Wenzel von Morzin, (Czech: V√°clav z Morzinu), who was Vivaldi's patron, and dedicatee of The Four Seasons; see Kapsa 2012. The location of the Count's estate has been more precisely specified by Robbins Landon as (), usually referred to as Lukavec. The chateau was bought by Czechoslovak diplomat Ferdinand Veverka. In 1945 Veverka was accused of colaboration with the Nazis and his estate was confiscated by the state. In the 1990s the roof was partially repaired. In 2000 the estate was returned to the Veverka family. As of 2009 Veverka's great grandson Zoltan Duphenieux lives in the chateau and he's trying to get finances for more repairs.

John Small bought a one acre parcel of land with a large log cabin on it in 1795, which he covered in stucco, and expanded.

It straddles the Murray River and in quite recent prehistoric times has impacted its course, as well as the courses of the Edward River, Wakool River, Goulburn River and Campaspe River. The Cadell Fault is notable due to this impact and has been described as one of the most significant examples of seismic activity changing the course of rivers. The fault is visible as a continuous earthen ridge along the Cobb Highway between Deniliquin and Echuca, and extending further south into Victoria. The fault is likely named after Francis Cadell, an early pioneer of the Murray River and river trader.The Cadell Fault in southern New South Wales Geology The Australian Continental Plate is generally considered to be one tectonic plate, and is classified as a Stable Continental Region.Johnston AC, Coppersmith KJ, Kanter LR & Cornell CA, 1994. The earthquakes of stable continental regions. Electric Power Research Institute Report TR102261V1. Within the plate, however, there are a number of fault lines. These lines are relatively stable compared to the external plate boundaries, but do have the potential to generate significant earthquakes. The Cadell fault is an example of this. The uplifted Cadell fault forms a bifurcated scarp, the northern part of which extends for 55 kilometres from Deniliquin to Echuca with a height of 12‚Äì15 metres, and the southern part which extends for 13 kilometres south of Echuca with a height of about 3‚Äì4 metres. The split between the two elements has been formed by the erosion caused by historic Lake Kanyapella (refer to the Goulburn section below). The fault deforms a 200- to 250-metre-thick section of sedimentary rock, which overlies a granitic base rock. To the west, the Cadell Tilt Block was formed subsequent to the uplift Rise and impact on river courses The Cadell fault showing the possible former courses of the Murray (yellow), Goulburn (purple) and Campaspe (brown) rivers. The fault itself is the red dashed line The lifting of the Cadell fault has had a significant impact on the courses of four major rivers of the Murray river system. The impact of the Cadell fault may be described as creating an inland delta on the Murray River in the region between Barmah and Kyalite. =Murray= The uplift of the Cadell fault significantly impacted the course of the Murray River. Prior to the uplift, the Murray travelled from its current position just to the south of Mathoura, through a channel now known as Green Gully. This then traversed the plains west of Mathoura to join the course of the current Murray further west. Green Gully appears to have been abandoned due to the uplift approximately 45,000 years ago. Uplift of the fault line is thought to have commenced up to 20,000 years before this (i.e. 65,000 years ago) but at 45,000 years ago it reached a sufficient level to disrupt the flow of the river. Prior to this, the river had been able to maintain its course within the Green Gully, albeit with significant modification to the channel. The uplift effectively dammed the river and formed a large expanse of water, continuously fed by glacial and snow melt further up in the Snowy Mountains. After a period, the flows found their present course into the Edward River and began to make its way westward via the Deniliquin region. An earlier stream formed by this northward flow is the Gulpa Creek. During this period, the main flow of the Murray may have also followed the course of the current Bullatale CreekStone T, 2006. The late- Holocene origin of the modern Murray River course, southeastern Australia, The Holocene 16(5) p.771-778 The Northern lake continued to exist at this time, with evidence of silt jetties being formed towards present day Barmah eventually draining to become a series of wetlands and swamps. Present day Moira Lake and Barmah Lake are remnants of the Northern Lake. Recent research indicates that the current course of the Murray River through the Narrows (also known as the Barmah Choke) may have originated in recent history, in fact as recently as approximately 550 years ago (approximately 1450 CE).Stone T, 2006. Late Quaternary tiers and lake of the Cadell Tilt Block region, Murray Basin, southeastern Australia. PhD thesis, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne (unpublished), 158pp Indeed, local Aboriginal legend is that the Aboriginal population of the region at the time was instrumental in the formation of the current path of the Murray. Folklore has it that the local Aborigines carved a channel through the sandbank holding the waters of the Northern Lake back, which then allowed the water to flow into the Goulburn River and form the current course of the Murray. The Narrows were noted by early squatters to the area to be somewhat unusual given their straight sidedness, compared to the more sloping bank formation of mature rivers The damming of the Murray in this way directly led to the creation of the Barmah Red Gum Forests, protected by the Barmah National Park in Victoria and Murray Valley National Park in NSW. This damming caused the creation of the river alluvial fan (through aggradation) on which the red gum forests established, and the ongoing flooding and draining of the area has led to the arboreal ecosystem present today. =Edward= The Edward River owes a significant part of its origin to the rise of the Cadell fault. Whilst not studied in as much detail as the course of the Murray, water flowing out of the Northern Lake may have found a previous tributary of the Murray and made its course across to the present day confluence with the Wakool River and eventually the Murray at Kyalite. Today, the majority of the flow from the Murray river flows northward through the Edward, with a lower amount travelling southward into the Murray itself. =Goulburn= Similar to the Murray, the Goulburn River formerly followed a path to the north of its current path, flowing through the Broken Creek and meeting with the former Murray (now Green Gully) somewhere southwest of Mathoura where it continued westward. With the uplift of the Cadell, a large lake was also formed south of the Northern Lake, that was the predecessor of present-day Lake Kanyapella, the remnant of the larger prehistoric lake. Wind-blown, or Aeolian, movement of surface soils created the Barmah Sandhills on the northeastern edge of this lake. Over time, water flowed from this lake into the Campaspe River, and the Goulburn River changed its course to follow this path. Erosive water flows eventually drained the prehistoric Lake Kanyapella along the course of the current Murray River. =Campaspe= The path of the Campaspe River was less impacted by the Cadell fault, however the routing of both the Goulburn and the Murray down through the course of the ancient Campaspe (instead of both rivers continuing westwards towards Kyalite had the effect of making the Campaspe upstream of Echuca a tributary of the new Murray and making its reaches from Kaarimba to Kanyapella a part of the Goulburn River. Ongoing management As the location of a significant tectonic event, and due to the population and production importance of the region to Australia, Geoscience Australia has studied the likelihood of further earthquake activity in the region. Based on their modelling of the maximum credible earthquake (of Mw 7.2), the damage incurred would be catastrophic, with over 1,000 square kilometres of land suffering 50% loss of structures. A potentially more frequent earthquake (of Mw 6.8) would do less damage in itself, but due to the increased frequency of occurrence, may be more of a risk. These are estimates only on the information presently at hand, and Geoscience Australia has not specified its confidence in its estimates. Future movement of the Cadell fault may also impact river courses, as it has done in the past.

The Act provides for the constitution of the Medical Council of India (MCI). The MCI regulates standards of medical education, permission to start colleges, courses or increase the number of seats, registration of doctors, standards of professional conduct of medical practitioners. Amendments Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2016 was passed by Rajya Sabha on 1 August 2016 approving the applicability of NEET. Repeal The National Medical Commission (NMC) came into force from September 25,2020 repealing the nearly 64-year-old Indian Medical Council Act 1956 and also dissolving all its bodies such as Medical Council of India and Board of Governors in Supersession of the MCI. As a result, the much-awaited NMC will start to function effectively to bring reforms in the Indian medical education sector. Last year, the National Medical Commission Act 2019 was passed by both houses of Parliament. Dr Suresh Chandra Sharma, retired HoD, ENT, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi has been appointed as the Chairman of the NMC for a period of three years, said the gazette notification, while Dr Rakesh Kumar Vats, ex-Secretary General, Board of Governors - MCI has been appointed as the Secretary of the NMC for a period of three years. Apart from the Chairman, the NMC will consist of 10 ex-officio members and 22 part-time members appointed by the Central government. To ensure transparency, the members will have to declare their assets at the time of joining and demitting the office along with declaring their professional and commercial engagement or involvement. It has been further provided that chairperson/member on ceasing to hold office will not accept for a period of two years any employment in any capacity in a private medical institution whose matter has been dealt with them either directly or indirectly. The NMC will frame policies and co-ordinate the activities of four autonomous boards, which includes - (i) Under-Graduate Medical Education Board (UGMEB),(ii) Post-Graduate Medical Education Board (PGMEB), (iii) Medical Assessment and Rating Board, (iv) Ethics and Medical Registration Board. According to the Central government, the NMC Act is a progressive legislation which will reduce the burden on students, ensure probity in medical education, bring down costs of medical education, simplify procedures, help to enhance the number of medical seats in India, ensure quality education, and provide wider access to people for quality healthcare. According to the government, the MCI had failed in almost all spheres and became highly ineffective. As one of the mandates of the NMC is to look at the cost of medical education, it will also provide for a common entrance examination for MBBS (NEET) along with common counselling for all medical institutions in the country. According to the health ministry, this provision will prevent seat blocking in parallel counselling processes and will eliminate the need for students to approach multiple colleges and take part in multiple counselling processes for admission. This will save students and their families from unnecessary physical and financial trauma. Under the NMC Act, the final year examination has been converted into a nationwide exit test called NEXT. This single examination will grant - i) a license to practice medicine, ii) an MBBS degree, and iii) entrance to postgraduate courses. There is a provision for common counselling for entrance to PG courses also. Students will be able to get admission to seats in all medical colleges and to institutes of national importance like AIIMS, PGI Chandigarh and JIPMER through a single counselling process. The Act does not impose any restriction on the number of attempts at NEXT examination. A singularly outstanding feature of the NMC Act is that it provides for the regulation of fees and all other charges in 50 per cent seats in private colleges as well as deemed to be universities as there was no provision to regulate fees in the Indian Medical Council Act 1956. According to the government, nearly 50 per cent of the total MBBS seats in the country are in government colleges, which have nominal fees. Of the remaining seats, 50 per cent would be regulated by NMC. This means that almost 75 per cent of total seats in the country would be available at reasonable fees. The government also informed that a provision has been made in the NMC Act to register some Community Health Providers (CHPs) who shall be modern medicine professionals with limited powers, however, they shall not be dealing with any alternative system of medicine.

It was released on March 14, 2015 in Japan and legally screened in English dub by the Philippine cinema chain SM Cinema. The film will also be released on January 8, 2017 in the United States along with Ultraman X The Movie as a double feature. Actors of the English dub were announced on December 10, 2016 by SciFi Japan. Synopsis After brainwashing Arina to his side, the Space Time Demon Etelgar went on a quest to seal all Heisei Ultra Warriors in existence, with the recent being Cosmos on Planet Juran, who had separated Musashi to save his host while Ultraman Zero chased them within various dimensions. On Earth, UPG members celebrated Hikaru's return from a year-long trip as he is introduced to two new members Sakuya and the rebuilt Mana. The party was interrupted by Arina and Etelgar's arrival as Victory and Ginga fought the giant demon but to no avail. Musashi joined the UPG and managed to warn the Ultras to cancel their transformations before Arina seal them on time. During the team's recuperation and Musashi's introduction, Etelgar attacked the vicinity of Live Base as Arina fought the UPG members and Sho's attack brought her to her senses. However, the golden being had fabricated her memory into a trauma centered around Ginga and put her under her control once more. Zero fought Etelgar but even his strongest attack was easily shrugged off and only forced the latter to escape out of annoyance while Arina placed the captured Ultras on a hostage situation towards Hikaru. While the UPG members went to infiltrate the Space Time Castle, Hikaru and Sho were placed under Zero's tutelage. The success of their training taught them to cooperate and this allowed the UPG members to escape from Arina's fear-inducing influences and break the Ultras free from their imprisonment. Musashi rejoined with Cosmos and the rest of the Heisei Ultras empower the Ultra Fusion Brace. As things went beyond his expectations, Etelgar manipulated the citizens' fears and created a gigantic copy of Dark Lugiel. Hikaru and Sho perform the Ultra Touch and bring forth an Ultra Warrior resulted from their alter-ego's combination: Ultraman Ginga Victory. The new figure easily phased through Dark Lugiel's attack and destroyed it via Ginga Victory Breaker. Joined by the rest of the Heisei Ultra Warriors, the group marched towards the tower, but Etelgar created multiple copies of their past enemies, leaving Cosmos and Ginga Victory to reach the upper level. Etelgar and Arina attacked them with their full strength until Cosmos assumed Eclipse Mode, purifying Arina from Etelgar's influence. Through Hikaru's persuasion, Arina manages to regain her memories and finally brought by Cosmos from safety, as Ginga Victory resumes battle. The other Ultra Warriors emerge victorious from their battles and Ginga Victory chased Etelgar to space, now finally realised his true motives behind the captures of the Ultra Warriors, which is due to their bonds with humanity before finishing him for good with Ultra Fusion Shoot. The rest of the Ultra Warriors soon destroyed the Space Time Castle with Crossover Formation. With the rest of the Heisei Ultras return, Musashi/Cosmos volunteer to deliver Arina to her home after entrusting the safety of the Earth to UPG, Hikaru and Sho. Sho was later recruited into the ranks of UPG and the rest of the crew saluted to the viewers after the ending credits roll. Production This movie is first announced in November 2014. Takuya Negishi, actor of Hikaru Raid≈ç stated that his favorite Ultraman as a child is Ultraman Cosmos and is delighted to work alongside Musashi's actor, Taiyo Sugiura.

The property is separated from Kongens Nytorv by a small building that now houses Copenhagen Amber Museum. It was built in 1854 by the architect Christian Tybjerg for pastry chef Christian Bredo Grandjean. It replaced an older building, which was known as the Collin House after Hans Christian Andersen patron Jonas Collin, but this name is now associated with another building in Amaliegade. The Gtandjean House was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1959, History =Early history= A house built at the site in the 17th century was for a while the residence of Bernardino de Rebolledo, the Spanish ambassador to Denmark at that time. The building was in 1733 acquired by T√∏nnes Becker, a wealthy timber merchant and one of the City's 32 Men. =The Collin family= The Collin House in Bredgade painted by Fritz Petzholdt The building facing Store Strandstr√¶de seen on a painting from 1835 Jonas Collin lived at the address from 1802-38\\\\. He was a prominent citizen and leading patron of the arts during the Danish Golden Age as well as a close friend and loyal supporter of Hans Christian Andersen. Allegedly, Jonas Collin decided to move when it rained through the ceiling and onto the table in the presence of Bertel Thorvaldsen. In 1839 the Collins moved to Amaliegade (No. 9). =Current building= The new building facing Store Strandstr√¶de Grandjean Jonas Collin sold the property at Store Strandstr√¶de to the pastry chef Christian Frederik Bredo Grandjean who was already operating a conditori from a pavilion in the courtyard behind the mainhouse. Grandjean built the current house in 1854 with the assistance of the architect Christian Tyberg. Grandjean took up residence in the house and operated a restaurant and a conditori from the lower floors. It was frequented by many actors and artists, most notably Hans Christian Andersen who was a private friend of the Grandjean's. Architecture The property consists of two individual buildings: A large, 11-bay building towards Bredgade 4 (No. 4) and a five-bay building towards Store Strandstr√¶de. The complex was constructed with four floors towards Bredgade but only three flors towards Store Strandstr√¶de to allow for better air circulation in the courtyard. The large, arched windows in the ground floor, a typical feature of commercial properties from the Late Neoclassical period (1830-1855), were a novelty in Denmark at the time. Next to it is a narrow three-bay building over four floors on Store Strandstr√¶de. The architect originally made a design proposal which comprised the corner on Kongens Nytorv but Grandjean failed to acquire the small Kanneworff House which now houses Copenhagen Amber Museum. The former conditori contains six murals by Christian Hetsch. Today The Grandjean House3 The complex is owned by fifth generation of the Grandjean family. Restaurant Els is located at Store Strandstr√¶de 3. It serves a seasonal cuisine and the d√©cor includes tables that were specially manufactures for the place by Royal Copenhagen.

Born in Berlin, she was evacuated to Mandatory Palestine with other German-Jewish children in 1933. She became a member of Kibbutz Beit Alfa, where she lived until 1970. She began writing novels in 1956 and achieved fame with her trilogy Shaul ve-Yohannah (Saul and Joanna), a three-generational tale of an assimilated German-Jewish family in prewar Germany. She wrote four other novels for adults as well as several books for children. In the 1980s Frankel abandoned her leftist convictions and adopted right-wing ideology, settling in the West Bank, where she died in 2009, aged 91. Early life and education Naomi Frankel was born into an affluent, assimilated Jewish family in Berlin on 20 November 1918. Her mother died when she was two. Her father worked in textile manufacturing. In her youth, she joined the Socialist-Zionist Hashomer Hatzair movement. Her father died in 1932 and she was taken under the care of a guardian, who helped her escape Nazi Germany with other Jewish children who were evacuated by the community and sent to British-administered Mandatory Palestine in 1933. Frankel initially lived in a girls' orphanage in Jerusalem. Then she moved to Beit Alfa, a leftist kibbutz in Northern Israel. She attended an agricultural school for girls and went on to study Jewish history and Kabbalah at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, she fought in the Palmach brigade. Literary career Kibbutz Beit Alfa, circa 1948‚Äì1951 After the 1948 war, Frankel divided her time between working on Kibbutz Beit Alfa and writing. She achieved fame with the publication of her first novel, Shaul ve-Yohannah (Saul and Joanna), the first part of a trilogy published between 1956 and 1967. The trilogy is a fictionalized account of three generations of an assimilated German-Jewish family whose granddaughter joins a Zionist youth movement. In depicting the rise and fall of prewar German-Jewish culture, Frankel concludes that only Zionism and a strong Jewish state can protect the Jewish people from persecution. One of the first books published in Israel that dealt with Jewish life in prewar Germany, Shaul ve-Yohannah aroused strong feelings among German-Jewish immigrants to Israel, and also met with critical success. Having returned to Berlin to do research for the first volume in the 1950s, in 1960 Frankel received a scholarship from the Anne Frank Foundation that enabled her to undertake an additional 18 months of research in Berlin for the second and third volumes. Frankel turned to other subjects in subsequent novels, including Israeli military heroes, Spanish marranos‚ÄîChristians of Jewish descent who practiced Judaism in secret‚Äîand the Jewish settlement of Hebron in the West Bank. She also published several novels for children. Many of her books were translated into German and English, and some were adapted for radio and television. =Literary awards= Frankel received the in 1956 for Shaul ve-Yohannah. She received the in 1962, the Prime Minister's Prize for Hebrew Literary Works in 1970, the Walter Schwimmer Award for Journalism in 1972, and the in 2005. Other activities Frankel left Kibbutz Beit Alfa in 1970 after being wrongly accused of accepting German reparations for World War II. From 1970 to 1978 she worked for the Israeli Navy, editing classified army and navy protocols from the period before and after the Yom Kippur War, and attained the rank of rav-seren (lieutenant commander). Political views In the 1980s Frankel abandoned her leftist convictions of many decades and adopted right-wing ideology. She began observing the Jewish Sabbath and kosher dietary laws, and in 1982 moved with her second husband to the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba. She later lived in Hebron until her death. She frequently wrote and spoke out in support of the concept of a Greater Israel. Her break with left-wing ideology caused the left-leaning arts community to shun her. Personal life Frankel's first husband was Yisrael Rosenzweig, a teacher, with whom she had one daughter. After Rosenzweig's death in 1970 she remarried to Meir Ben-Gur, a journalist. She died on 20 November 2009, her 91st birthday. Per her request, she was buried on Kibbutz Beit Alfa beside her first husband.

It is the easternmost example of Siberian taiga. The region has unusual ecological conditions, a \\"snow forest\\" that combines low temperatures, high humidity and boreal forest with heavy snowfall. The local ecology is also affected by volcanic activity. The region is about 300 km long (north-south), and averages about 100 km west-east. It is in the Palearctic realm, and mostly in the Boreal forests/taiga ecoregion with a humid continental climate, cool summer climate. It covers .  Location and description  The ecoregion is situated in the central valley of the Kamchatka Peninsula, between the Sredinny Mountains to the west (these form the main ridge down the middle of the peninsula), and the Eastern Mountains to the east. The parallel mountain ranges average about 3,500 feet in height, and drop abruptly to the valley floor of the Kamchatka River that flows between them. The river plain is wet and alluvial, the soils are andosols (black volcanic) and gleysols (soils of saturated groundwater). The ecoregion is surrounded by the Kamchatka Mountain tundra and forest tundra and Kamchatka-Kurile meadows and sparse forests ecoregions. The ecoregion is at relatively high latitudes (55 to 57 degrees N).  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Humid continental climate, cool summer ((Dfc)). The climate is slightly more continental than the coastal and mountain areas, and is capable of supporting very marginal agriculture, mostly pastoral. The area is overcast much of the time - Kamchatka has one of the highest levels of cloud cover in the world, with precipitation averaging over 15 days per month. The peninsula is affected by the cool current in the Sea of Okhotsk to the west, and the East Kamchatka Current that flows SW down the east coast in the Pacific Ocean. The growing period is 90 to 119 days. There is no permafrost in the ecoregion, due to the warmer summers and snow cover in the winter.  Flora  At the lowest elevations are forests of Daurian larch (L. cajanderi), Yezo spruce (Picea jezoensis) and Japanese white birch (Betula platyphylla). Stone birch (Betula ermanii) is also found in the area.  Fauna  The region is well known for large populations of Kamchatka brown bear, the largest bear in Eurasia. Other distinctive species include the snow ram, the northern deer, the Black-capped marmot (Marmota kamtschatica), and a subspecies of sable (Martes zibellina) specific to Kamchatka. The rivers of the region are important spawning grounds for migratory fish - all species of salmon are found on the island.  Protections  There are no federal- level protected areas in the ecoregion. Threats The central valley forests have been under logging pressure for centuries. It is estimated that only 2.1% of the forest is in its original state, but increased conservation activity is bringing more of the area under protection.  Urban areas and settlements  There are no cities in region, and only a handful of settlements. There is a road that runs along the Kamchatka River, and a small airport at the town of Kozyrevsk; otherwise the area is very sparsely populated.

He worked as a professor at Harvard University and Radcliffe College, and in the British Foreign Office during World War II.  Early life and education  Whitehead was the son of the prominent English philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, and was known as \\"North\\" to his family. He read economics at Trinity College, Cambridge, earning a B.A. in 1913. He then did graduate studies in mechanical engineering at University College London.  Government service  Whitehead served as an army officer in France and East Africa during World War I, taking a leave from his graduate studies to do so. On the completion of his studies in 1920 after the war, he began working for the Admiralty, and remained there until his 1931 move to Harvard. During World War II, he again took a leave, this time from his professorship at Harvard, to work as an expert on American relations in the British Foreign Office. In 1940, before America entered the war, he advised Winston Churchill that American isolationism would not be a permanent obstacle, and after the Pearl Harbor attacks he communicated a message of solidarity to Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was also Whitehead's suggestion that Churchill compare America's proposed Lend-Lease policy to Magna Carta, and that one of the original copies of Magna Carta then on display in America be made into a more permanent gift to seal the deal. However, this proposal fell through because the British government did not own any of the four surviving copies of Magna Carta.  Academia  Whitehead joined the Harvard Business School in 1931, following his father who had moved to Harvard in 1924. He stayed at Harvard for the rest of his career except for a leave of absence during World War II. After the war, Whitehead ran the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration, a business program for women at Radcliffe College, keeping also his appointment at Harvard. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1952. When Harvard's business school began admitting women in 1955, he returned to a full-time position at Harvard. He remained at Harvard until his retirement.The Harvard Crimson gives his retirement date as 1963, while the Encyclopedia of History of American Management dates it to 1958.  Contributions  Whitehead's work The design and use of instruments, published in 1934, was primarily written while he was still at the Admiralty. It prefigures the care in accurate measurement that Whitehead put into his work on the Hawthorne experiments. In this, Whitehead's \\"golden rule\\" was to \\"never measure more than is absolutely necessary\\". The Hawthorne experiments studied worker productivity at a Western Electric factory. They were originally intended to study the effects of lighting on productivity, but instead determined that workers reacted positively to the changing conditions of the experiment, and that their productivity decreased again when the experiment ended. Whitehead, following the lead of Jean Piaget, took the approach of carefully documenting the behavior of a small sample of workers over a long period of time. His analysis of the Hawthorne experiments used rigorous statistics to argue \\"that personal and social relationships had been the dominant factors\\" in these effects. His work has been criticized as \\"complex and poorly presented\\", with unoriginal ideas \\"expressed in infuriatingly vague prose\\". Nevertheless, his work is important as the only original mathematical analysis of the experimental data and the only complete record of the entire run of the experiments. Besides his work on the Hawthorne experiments, Whitehead is known for pioneering the development of the fields of human relations, organizational behavior, and human resource management, and for his 1936 book Leadership in a Free Society on the structure and organization of human activity.

Biography  First an engraver, at 20, he joined the service. He left the army with the rank of sergeant and entered as an employee in a branch of the Mont-de-pi√©t√©, precisely in the house where he was born, rue Saint-S√©verin. He was a passionate collector of songs. Patient as a Benedictine to copy songs and other unpublished poems, he wrote countless couplets of his own. It was by copying that he began to compose for his own account. Introduced to the Caveau by Jules Lagarde, an honorary member of this lyrical Society, he sang there couplets entitled L'Amateur de Chansons, which attracted on him the attention of the listeners, and were greeted with unanimous applause. Some months later, in July 1873 he was received an associate member of the Caveau, and from that moment regularly participated in its monthly banquets where he had his songs heard. The magazine ', which appeared from 1878 to 1881, reported about these banquets, and published a certain nomber of these songs. After he became office manager, F√©n√©e retired in 1881. He lived at the time in Paris at 13 rue Mayet in the 6th arrondissement. That same year, he published a large collection of his songs: Loisirs lyriques d'un amateur de chansons, highlighting this quote from Nicolas Brazier, another member of the Caveau : The foreword by Eug√®ne Grang√© gives the biography of F√©n√©e. Also in 1881, a songbook of goguettier Charles Vincent mentioned him among the regulars of the goguette Pot-au-Feu.Charles Vincent Chansons, Mois et Toasts, E. Dentu Libraire-√âditeur, Paris 1882, (p. 335). His name and his work are now forgotten by the general public.  F√©n√©e's work as seen by Eug√®ne Grang√©  The genre of which F√©n√©e was fond was the light and gaudriolesque one.

The party, which describes itself as \\"peacefully revolutionary\\", was founded by supporters of Ralph Nader in 2008 (under Florida elections law, political parties are recognized upon filing a statement of existence with the Florida Secretary of State naming a chair and a treasurer). The party was formed to give Nader easy access to the Florida ballot line in that year's election; Florida elections law allows any registered political party to place a candidate for president of the United States on the election ballot, but requires unaffiliated candidates (which Ralph Nader was in 2008) to submit a petition signed by 119,316 registered voters. The party nominated Nader for president of the United States in 2008. Nader accepted the nomination and appeared on the ballot in Florida as a candidate of the Ecology Party of Florida, while running in most other states as independent or unaffiliated. Later activities In 2009 the party registered as a co-intervener in an attempt to stop administrative licensing of two proposed nuclear reactors in Levy County, Florida. Contributions from an anonymous donor allowed the party to retain legal representation in support of its efforts. The party did not nominate a candidate in the 2012 presidential election. In 2015 the party joined with a number of other groups, including Greenpeace, the Tea Party Network, Sierra Club, and Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, in pushing a ballot initiative in Florida that, if passed, would permit businesses to produce \\"up to two megawatts of power a day\\" and sell it directly to businesses and residences on adjacent property.

A specialist sprinter, he excelled over six furlongs and won four of his fourteen races between 1986 and 1988. After failing to win in two starts as juvenile, Dowsing showed improved form is 1987 when he won three races including a valuable handicap at Doncaster Racecourse and the Diadem Stakes on his final appearance. In the following year he took time to reach his best form but again ended his season triumphantly as he recorded his biggest win in the Group One Vernons Sprint Cup. Background Dowsing was a \\"tall, close-coupled, attractive\\" brown horse with a small white star bred in Kentucky by Edward A Seltzer. He was sired by Riverman an American-bred, French-trained who won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains and the Prix Jean Prat in 1972. Riverman went on to become a highly successful stallion, whose offspring included Triptych, Irish River, Gold River and Bahri. Dowsing's dam Prospector's Fire failed to win in two races but became a successful broodmare who also produced the Beverly D. Stakes winner Fire the Groom who was in turn the dam of Stravinsky. Prospector's Fire was a daughter of the Kentucky Oaks winner Native Street. In July 1985 the yearling was entered in the Keeneland July Select Yearling Sale and was bought for $400,000 by the bloodstock agent James Delahooke on behalf of the Saudi prince Khalid Abdullah. He was sent to Europe and was trained throughout his racing career by Jeremy Tree at Beckhampton. Racing career =1986: two-year-old season= Dowsing made his racecourse debut in the Houghton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in October when he finished tenth of the twelve runners after struggling against his jockey's attempts to restrain him. In November he started second favourite for a maiden race over six furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse but finished sixth of the twenty-two runners. =1987: three-year- old season= Dowsing began his second season by winning a minor race over six furlongs at Warwick Racecourse and finished second when moved up to seven furlongs on his next appearance. At York Racecourse he recorded his first important success when he won the William Hill Golden Spurs Trophy Handicap. In late July he was assigned top weight of 136 pounds for the Stewards' Cup and finished fourth behind the lightly-weighted outsider Madraco. The colt ran poorly in a Listed race at Newmarket and then finished fourth to Guest Performer in the Park Stakes over seven furlongs at Doncaster in September, appearing to run out of stamina in the closing stages. In the Group Three Diadem Stakes at Ascot Racecourse Dowsing started the 8/1 third favourite behind Hallgate (winner of the race in 1986) and Print PHopeful Stakes. Ridden as in most of his previous races by Pat Eddery, he tracked the leaders before moving up to challenge the pace-setter Governor General a furlong out. After a protracted struggle, Dowsing got the better of Governor General and won by a length despite flashing his tail in the closing stages. =1988: four-year-old season= Dowsing began his third season in the Duke of York Stakes at York on 12 May and finished fifth of the thirteen runners behind Handsome Sailor. At Royal Ascot in June he started the 9/2 second favourite for the Cork and Orrery Stakes and finished fifth behind Posada. On 26 July Dowsing ran for the second time in the Stewards' Cup and carried top weight of 140 pounds. He finished third of the twenty-eight runners behind Rotherfield Greys and Glencroft. In August Dowsing was sent to France to contest the Prix de Meautry at Deauville Racecourse and finished fourth behind Cricket Ball. On 12 September, Dowsing was one of ten horses to contest the Group One Vernons Sprint Cup over six furlongs at Haydock Park. The Irish colt Big Shuffle started favourite ahead of Handsome Sailor, Caerwent (National Stakes) and Silver Fling with Dowsing next in betting at odds of 15/2. The other five runners were Ghariba (Nell Gwyn Stakes), Print, Umbelata, Sharp Romance and Polykratis. After being \\"driven along\\" by Eddery in the last quarter mile, Dowsing gained the advantage in the final strides and won by a head from Silver Fling with a gap of four lengths back to Caerwent in third place. Stud record Dowsing was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. The best off his offspring was probably Tedburrow, who won twenty-one races including the Flying Five and the Chipchase Stakes. Dowsing died in Japan on 1 January 1993.  Pedigree  *Through his dam, Dowsing was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Native Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

The resolution extended the mandate of the Panel of Experts, which supports activities of the ‚Äò1718 Sanctions Committee‚Äô, for one year to April 5, 2016. Overview The Panel supports the Committee in information collection and investigates and analyzes activities of North Korea and UN member states to find any violations of North Korea sanctions and trade embargoes imposed by the Security Council. Based on the results, the Panel presents annual reports to the Security Council and recommends how to improve the implementation of sanctions. Back on October 9, 2006, North Korea conducted its first nuclear test. On the following October 14, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1718 on North Korea and established the 1718 Sanctions Committee mandated to support and monitor UN member states for efficient implementation of the resolution and designate sanctions targets. The Panel has been supporting the 1718 Sanctions Committee, although it was established pursuant to Resolution 1874 of 2009. Through Resolution 2207, the Security Council extended the mandate of the Panel for one year to April 5, 2016, and requested the Panel to submit a comprehensive final report, containing the findings and recommendations as the results of its investigation over the year, to the Committee by February 5, 2016, and also to the Security Council by March 7, 2016. Background The UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2207 with the primary aims of monitoring North Korea and enhancing the sanctions implementation by UN members states, as North Korea continued military provocations and illicit transactions while tactfully avoiding existing sanctions. According to the U.S. multimedia Voice of America (VOA), the 1718 Sanctions Committee, also known as the North Korea Sanctions Committee, stated in its annual report, ‚ÄúThere are 29 reported cases of North Korea having allegedly violated UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea in 2014‚Äù. It was said that most of the cases were related to North Korea‚Äôs consistent launching of short-range ballistic missiles. When North Korea fired missiles over February-March and June-July 2016, the incidents were reported as suspected violations by six countries and seven countries, respectively. In March 2014, a letter was received claiming that North Korea attempted to sell sanctions target items. Additional information on the claim was received by the Committee in September 2014 According to the Panel of Experts report on February 26, 2015, Ocean Maritime Management (OMM), a North Korean shipping company listed in the sanctions targets on charges of including illicit weapons transfer, was avoiding sanctions by changing its vessel names. In addition, North Korea launched two short-range ballistic missiles, presumed to be Scud missiles, into the Sea of Japan(East Sea) on March 2, 2015, when Key Resolve exercise took place. In short, as North Korea repeated military provocations and illegal transactions while evading sanctions, the Security Council passed Resolution 2207 extending the mandate of the Panel to monitor UN member states‚Äô sanctions implementation status and impose more practical sanctions against North Korea. Significance The extension of the mandate of the Panel of Experts that supports activities of the 1718 Sanctions Committee, which was stated in Resolution 2207 passed by the Security Council, has exerted a considerable impact on North Korea sanctions of the international community. The Panel submitted its seventh final report to the Security Council on February 3, 2016, in which the Panel recommended the Committee to add to the list of sanctions target entities ‚ÄòThe Military Supplies Industry Department (Munitions Industry Department) of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe National Aerospace Development Administration‚Äô involved in ‚Äúroles and support activities regarding the DPRK's nuclear and missile programs‚Äù. The Panel also recommended to add to the list of sanctions target individuals Bak Do-Chun (former munitions secretary of the Workers‚Äô Party), Ri Man-Gon (Minister of the Munitions Industry Department), and Ri Byong-Chul (first deputy of the Munitions Industry Department). Such activities of the Panel have made a substantial contribution to the inclusion of comprehensive sanctions and additional sanctions on individuals and entities in Resolution 2270 which was adopted by the Security Council on March 2, 2016, after North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test on January 6 and a long-range missile launch, or a satellite launch as it claimed, on February 7, 2016. Meanwhile, four members of the Panel visited South Korea from July 11 to 15, 2016, where they held a discussion with the South Korean government about, including, measures to enhance the implementation of North Korea sanctions. It was reported that the two parties exchanged opinions about North Korea‚Äôs violations of the Security Council sanctions and measures being taken by the international community. The parties, in particular, were known to have discussed the issue in depth, as North Korea fired a submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM) on July 9, 2016, in violation of the sanctions.

The son of (1802-1865), General Director of forests, and Marthe Vicaire Blais, Georges Vicaire was the father of Jean Vicaire and (1893‚Äì1976), an orientalist painter.  Biography  Georges Vicaire was responsible for special work on the preparation of the printed catalogs of the Biblioth√®que de l'Arsenal, then was attached to the Biblioth√®que Mazarine. In 1909, the Institut de France appointed curator of the , created by and located in Chantilly, next to the Mus√©e Cond√©, which houses the very large Library of Henri d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Aumale. He was also correspondent to the Vatican Library. He had hence access to funds from both institutions. Vicaire is the author of bibliographies of Honor√© de Balzac, Jos√©-Maria de Heredia, George Sand, Stendhal, Victor Hugo and gastronomic literature and a very important work in 8 volumes on the literature of the nineteenth century, Le Manuel de l'amateur de livres du XIX¬∞si√®cle ; 8 volumes available online. \\"This work, which will remain one of the monuments of the bibliography, has among other merits that of fending for the first time the issue long overlooked by first editions of the great romantic\\" and earned its author in 1906, the Botta prize of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and twice, in 1900 and 1912, the Brunet prize awarded by the Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles- lettres. From 1896 until his death, Georges Vicaire was director of the Bulletin du bibliophile with which he worked since 1890. From 1898 to 1902, he was secretary of the \\"Amis de l'eau forte\\" and in 1900, a member of the organizing committee of the retrospective section of book at the Exposition Universelle (1900) and a committee member of the International Congress of libraries. On 27 February 1901, he was elected a member of the \\"Soci√©t√© des bibliophiles fran√ßois\\", established in 1820. At seat XII, he succeeded Jean H√©ly d'Oissel, F√©lix-S√©bastien Feuillet de Conches, Count Charpin-Feugerolles, Mme Standish-Noailles. In 1890, he had published to her attention, \\"R√¥ti- cochon\\" (\\"roast-pig\\") and was preparing for her an important and erudite study which was published in 1901 in the Almanach du bibliophile with which he collaborated since 1898. In 1903, appeared Jeunesse de Balzac by Gabriel Hanotaux and Georges Vicaire. A new edition, augmented of the correspondence between Balzac and Madame de Berny, published shortly after the death of Georges Vicaire, of which Gabriel Hanotaux could write, in the afterword dated November 8, 1921: \\"He did not have the satisfaction to see this book published and, after twenty-five years of cordial collaboration, I have the pain of losing at the time of realization, this incomparable friend. This book comes from him, it is him. I send it back to his memory. It will include on each page, the marks of his conscience, his flawless erudition and worship he professed for beautiful literature\\". Knowledgeable about food and culinary arts, his copious annotations have generated exceptional interest for both the culinary art and bibliophily. His work Bibliographie gastronomique \\"should be considered as the most important bibliographic contribution in this area\\" (Andr√©-Louis Simon).

Unfortunately for the ParaRoos, ranked tenth in the world, in July 2014, the Australian Sports Commission cut funding for the 7-a-side soccer program on the grounds that the team was unlikely to make the 2016 Summer Paralympics.

Despite his education he spent his adolescence as a wild and dissolute man and during one such revel he received a leg wound in a duel with a man with whom he had quarreled. His subsequent convalescence provided him with adequate time to reflect on what had happened as well as the course his life had taken. This made him realize that he was heading in the wrong direction and needed urgent changes. His healing over time renewed his links to his faith; he approached the Order of Preachers in 1452 in Catania and begged to be admitted into their ranks. Scammacca became known for his range of charitable works and for his life of repentance for the life he had led, as well as for his strict adherence to the rule of Saint Dominic. He fostered a particular devotion to the Passion of Christ, which sometimes led him into ecstasies. He founded a hospital for the poor, which still exists. He also liked to spend time in the confessional and work as a spiritual director. He had the gift of being a prophet and used that gift to warn others to change their lives. He also prophesied the date of his own death. Scammacca was named the prior of the convent of Saint Dominic in Catania and later named as the prior of the convent in Palermo. He was also made the vicar general of the reformed Sicilian convents. It was often said that when he walked in his convent's garden the birds would come and sing to him, but would stop at once when he stopped to reflect. On one occasion a porter was sent to his room to fetch him, and the man saw a bright light under a door. He peeked in to see a child shining with light holding a book that Scammacca was reading from. Scammacca died in 1487 in Catania. In 1502 it was said that he appeared in a vision to the prior of his convent and asked that his incorrupt remains be relocated the house's chapel. During the translation a man was cured of his paralysis after he touched Scammacca's relics. Beatification Scammacca was beatified on 8 March 1825 after Pope Leo XII confirmed his 'cultus' (or popular devotion).

Not to be confused with the Lighthouse of Ponta de Sagres, which is the located further to the edge of the extreme southwest cape of the civil parish, southwest of the Fortress of Sagres. History The cliffs off the Cape of St. Vincent showing the position of the lighthouse/convent A profile view of the lighthouse and convent structure from the southwestern cliff A rudimentary lighthouse existed on the cape since 1520, in a special tower constructed on the site of the convent. Between 1521 and 1557 a tower was ordered constructed by King D. John III to defend the coast from attacks from marauding soldiers. Yet, in 1587, the tower was destroyed by the English privateer Francis Drake, and only returned to operation in 1606, following its restoration by order of King Phillip II. The lighthouse of Cape St. Vincente, or the Lighthouse of D. Fernando, was ordered constructed by Queen D. Maria II, and began operating in October 1846, in the 16th century Franciscan convent. It was originally illuminated by olive oil lamp consisting of two clarions that rotated every two seconds, and a range of . Following an initial period of operation, the lighthouse was abandoned and almost fell into ruin; a survey of the site indicated its deplorable state by 1865. Due to its state and poor performance of its light, work began on remodelling the structure began in 1897. The tower was increased , and its optic was substituted with a new mechanism. Work on the site lasted 11 years, and in 1908 the lighthouse began operating with a Fresnel lens, making it one of the largest optics used in Portuguese lighthouses and one of the 10 largest in the world. It consisted of three panels with of mercury. The original beacon installed had a constant five rotations, but was replaced by an incandescent gas lamp. Its rotation was maintained with a clockwork system, allowing it to have a periodicity of 15 seconds, and range of . In 1914, a signal horn was installed. In 1926, a generator was installed, permitting an easy transition from petrol to electricity. Due to the necessities of the Second World War, in 1947 deflector panels were installed, allowing the lighthouse to function both for terrestrial and maritime navigation. The following year, it was finally connected to the public electrical grid. In 1982 the lighthouse was automated and, at the same time, it began to control the neighbouring lighthouse in the adjacent cape, supporting a small staff on duty. Following the remodeling in 1990, the optic's rotation was automated 2001. Architecture The lighthouse is situated on the tip of the Cape of St. Vincent, located from the western edge of the civil parish of Sagres, guarding one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. The traditional land's end of Europe, the extreme southwesternmost point on the continent, it was an essential landfall for sailors returning from Africa and the Americas. One of the most powerful lighthouses in Europe (the most powerful being Phare du Creach on the French island of Ushant, off the coast of Brittany); its two 1,000 W lamps can be seen as far as away. The round cylindrical stone tower, with lantern and gallery, rises from a 2-/3-story keeper's complex. The beacon itself has operated with a hyper-radiant Fresnel lens (larger than 1st order) since 1908, with a focal plane of and demonstrating one quick white flash every 5 seconds. The unpainted lighthouse tower includes red-painted lantern and the keeper's white-painted house with red roof. A fog horn has given two 5-second blasts every 30 seconds. Its position at land's end attracts visitors annually, and the Portuguese navy constructed a visitor center and museum on the site. The lighthouse and museum open are open to the public on Wednesday afternoons.

He was one of the most important French art collectors of his time.  Biography  J√©r√¥me Pichon was the second son of Alexandrine √âmilie Brongniart (1780‚Äì1847), whose father was the architect Alexandre-Th√©odore Brongniart, and of Baron Louis-Andr√© Pichon. After a brief stay at the √âcole de Saint-Cyr, he studied law and was then appointed an auditor at the Conseil d‚Äô√âtat before withdrawing completely from public life in 1846. He was also Consul General to Smyrna. He began his collection of old books in 1831 and soon became indebted to booksellers for 6,000 francs, a sum that his father reimbursed without difficulty: the young man's love of books had turned into a devouring passion, which was to remain with him. He also collected numerous antique objects of various natures (archaeology, numismatics, prints, silversmiths, etc.), including a rare collection of horse bits from Galiot de Genouillac, the king's great equerry, donated by his daughter to his successor in 1546 Claude Goufffier, lord of Oiron (Deux-S√®vres) and artefacts belonging to him. For more than 50 years, Pichon acquired one of the rarest books and manuscripts of his time, soon becoming president of the Soci√©t√© des bibliophiles fran√ßais (SBF) in 1844, a society which he arbitrated efficiently, composing a number of bibliographic records intended for reissues, catalogues or publications and to the Bulletin des Bibliophiles. He used to reside 17 in the former h√¥tel de Charles Gru√øn des Bordes, better known as H√¥tel de Lauzun which he restored from collector's period items; moreover, he rented certain rooms to creators such as Baudelaire and Th√©ophile Gautier and it was there that the famous meetings of the Club des Hashischins took place. The SBF had its headquarters there. He maintained a long correspondence with Charles Nodier and Paul Lacroix. Among other things, he is responsible for the publication of the M√©nagier de Paris in 1846. Married to Rosalie Clarmont, daughter of banker Jean-Charles Clarmont and Rosalie Favrin, he was the father of √âtienne Pichon, who was sub-prefect of Vervins and who died in 1876. His rich library was the subject of two public auctions, one during his lifetime on 19 April 1869, and the other after his death in 1897.

It is located in the Kankan Prefecture of the Kankan Region, in the east of the country. It lies on the left bank of the Sankarani River.  Geography  The village is situated in extreme eastern Guinea, on the west bank of the Sankarani River. The river is accessible all year round and the village is surrounded by rocky peaks. The village is also on the edge of the forest, which is a source of gold, kola nuts, palm oil and ivory. History Niani is often considered one of the ancient capitals of the Mali Empire and the birthplace of emperor Sundiata Keita. Some scholars believe that the village became the capital in the early 12th century after the former capital of Dioliba became abandoned. Niani is mentioned by the 16th-century traveler Leo Africanus. While some scholars believe that Kangaba served as one of the capitals of the empire, others believe that Niani remained continuously the capital through the 14th to 16th centuries. 14th century Arab historian Shihab al-Umari reported the village as Nyeni (Niani), saying it is \\"the official name of Mali ... because it is the capital of the regions of this kingdom.\\" Griots still exist in Niani today, preserving the history of the Mali Empire. Couriers left imperial Niani daily on horseback, and those who arrived from the provinces reported to the griot. Many Berber Arabs settled in Niani as a result of trans-Saharan trade. The city had at least 100,000 inhabitants in the 14th century. The emperor (mansa) and his courtiers lived in Niani, which was a centre of trade and commerce. The town developed as an outlet for two main trade routes, one northward, called the 'Mande route' (Manding-sila), and one southward, called the 'Sarakolle route' (Sarakolle-sila). Niani, along with other principal cities, housed a garrison for the imperial army. The Mansa had great forges in Niani. The emperor Musa I of Mali employed the Andalusian architect Ishak al- Tuedjin to build an audience chamber at Niani. It was \\"square, surmounted by a cupola, which he covered with plaster and decorated with arabesques in dazzling colours.\\" 14th-century North African historian Ibn Khaldun described it as an \\"admirable monument\\". After the Mali Empire declined during the 1600s, Niani lost its importance and became a small town again. In the 1920s, archaeological excavations were carried out at Niani by Vidal and Gaillard which first identified the site. In 1965 and 1968, Guinean-Polish archaeological missions were carried out. These excavations revealed that the area around Niani was once densely populated. Archaeologists have discovered that these dwellings were widely dispersed; around the royal town, there was a host of hamlets or villages for various trade clans: smiths, fishermen and so on. As a result of archaeological studies, the Arab quarter and royal town in Niani have been identified, specifically the foundations of stone houses, the mihrab of a mosque and the walls around the royal town. Al-Umari wrote that the buildings were made of bricks of beaten earth and that the \\"ceilings are made of beams and reeds. They are mostly in the shape of a cupola [conical] or a camel's hump, like vaulted arches. The floors of the houses are of earth mixed with sand ... The king has a group of palaces surrounded by a circular wall.\\" Due to Niani's latitude, such buildings required constant repair and restoration.

Barnett in monetary economics, argues that internal inconsistency between the aggregation theory used to produce monetary aggregates and the economic theory used to produce the models within which the aggregates are used are responsible for the appearance of unstable demand and supply for money. The Barnett critique has produced a long and growing literature on monetary aggregation and index number theory and the use of the resulting aggregates in econometric modeling and monetary policy. The critique runs counter to another large literature arguing that money does not matter in macroeconomic policy and advocating monetary policy disconnected from monetary measurement. That alternative view was first advocated by John Maynard Keynes and challenged by Milton Friedman. More recently the counter view has been advocated by Michael Woodford based on theory originated by Knut Wicksell. Although separate from the Lucas critique, the Barnett and Lucas critiques share the view that models based on internally inconsistent economic theory can produce misleading inferences and misguided policy.  History  The term ‚ÄúBarnett critique‚Äù was first coined by the British economists, Chrystal and MacDonald (1994), in a paper presented at a St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank conference and subsequently published by that bank. A more recent representation and analysis of that critique was published by Belongia and Ireland (2014). The relationship between the critique and monetary policy during a period of over four decades was the subject of Barnett‚Äôs book, Getting It Wrong: How Faulty Monetary Statistics Undermine the Fed, the Financial System, and the Economy, published by MIT Press in 2012. In that book (page 217), he explains the critique as follows: > ‚ÄúData construction and measurement procedures imply the theory that can > rationalize those procedures. Unless that implied theory is internally > consistent with the theory used in applications of those data in modeling > and policy, the data and their applications are incoherent. Such internal > inconsistencies can produce the appearance of structural change, when there > has been none.‚Äù The book emphasizes the cause and consequences of the many paradoxes in the econometric literature about historical monetary policy and the economy since 1970. For example, he represents (in page 18) the association with the recent Great Recession as follows: > ‚ÄúThe paradoxes fed into the misperceptions that distorted expectations and > thereby eventually damaged the economy. Internal inconsistencies exist > between the way the data were produced and the way they were used. These > internal inconsistencies have become known as the Barnett critique.‚Äù That book won the Association of American Publishers Award for Professional and Scholarly Excellence (the PROSE Awards) for the best book published in the field of economics during 2012.  Literature  Much of the literature produced by the Barnett critique uses the Divisia monetary aggregates index, rather than central banks‚Äô usual simple sum monetary aggregates. The Divisia monetary aggregates were originated by Barnett (1980), while employed on the staff of the Federal Reserve Board, and now are maintained and provided to the public by the Center for Financial Stability in New York City and by Bloomberg LP through its Bloomberg Terminal. Divisia monetary aggregates are provided officially by the Bank of England along with the National Bank of Poland and the Bank of Israel. Divisia monetary aggregates are maintained for internal use by the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the International Monetary Fund. Those aggregates are provided to the European Central Bank‚Äôs Governing Council at its meetings. Divisia monetary aggregates are available from public or private sources for over 40 countries, as indexed in the international economics library maintained online by the Center for Financial Stability. A conference in honor of the Barnett critique will be held at the Bank of England in London on May 23‚Äì24, 2017. The Barnett critique was a primary motivation for the creation of the international Society for Economic Measurement. While controversial as potential targets of monetary policy, the Divisia monetary aggregates have been the subject of increasing research on monthly indicators of the state of the economy, as emphasized by the Center for Financial Stability. An example of the potential indicator role is its relevancy to nominal income target proposals, since nominal GDP is measured only quarterly.

He was a politically active socialist and professional barrelmaker. Barthas extensively documented his wartime experiences. After the war, he set out to compile these into a series of notebooks, forming a single comprehensive manuscript. He did not think to have them published, and the notebooks were kept in the back of a drawer for the next couple of decades. His grandson, a teacher at a secondary school in Carcassonne, consigned the notebooks to a colleague history teacher who used them in his curriculum. Word of mouth brought renewed attention to Barthas' manuscript, and in 1978, sixty years after the war, it was published as Poilu: the World War I notebooks of Corporal Louis Barthas, barrelmaker, 1914‚Äì1918.  Early life  Louis Barthas was born on 14 July 1879‚ÄîBastille Day‚Äîin the town of Homps, Aude. His father, Jean, was a barrelmaker and his mother, Louise, was a seamstress. At the outbreak of the First World War, Barthas was a barrelmaker in Peyriac- Minervois, a job he returned to after the Armistice of 11 November 1918. As a socialist activist, he participated in the creation of the union of agricultural workers and shared the peaceful ideas of Jean Jaur√®s.  World War I  Barthas was mobilized to the 280th Infantry Regiment of Narbonne in August 1914, with the rank of corporal ‚Äì a rank he held for the duration of the conflict. In December 1915, he joined the 296th Infantry Regiment. In November 1917, he joined the 248th Infantry Regiment. For four years he fought in the most dangerous sectors of the front: Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, Verdun, the Somme, and the Chemin des Dames. He took part in the French Army mutinies of 1917. His wartime memoir seems to have begun as a diary, which over the years came to fill many volumes.  Later life  Barthas' grave in Peyriac- Minervois Barthas was decommissioned in February 1919, and soon set out to assemble a comprehensive narrative of his wartime years. He transcribed his diaries and letters into 19 notebooks, pasting in picture postcards, illustrations, and maps clipped from newspapers and magazines. He did not think to have them published, therefore the notebooks remained unpublished in the family armoire for more than sixty years.

The local ruler, Palakkad Achchan, was originally a tributary of the Zamorin, but had become independent before the beginning of the eighteenth century.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 19, p. 358. http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V19_364.gif In 1757 he sent a deputation to Haider Ali seeking help against an invasion threatened by the Zamorin. Haider Ali seized upon the opportunity to gain possession of a strategically important location such as Palghat, and from that time until 1790 the fort was continually in the hands of the Mysore Sultans or the British. It was first taken by the latter in 1768 when Colonel Wood captured it during his raid on Hyder Ali's fortresses, but it was retaken by Haider a few months later. It was recaptured by Colonel Fullarton in 1783, after a siege that lasted eleven days but was abandoned the following year. It later fell into the hands of the Zamorin‚Äôs troops. In 1790 it was finally captured by the British under Colonel Stuart. It was renovated and was used as a base for operations that ended with the storming of Srirangapatnam. The fort continued to be garrisoned until the middle of 19th century. In the early 1900s it was converted into a taluk office.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 19, p. 359. The fort is also known as Tipu's Fort (after Tipu Sultan, the son of Hyder Ali).

In 1933, elections were held for the Mayor of Wellington plus other local government positions including the fifteen city councillors, also elected biannually. Thomas Hislop, the incumbent Mayor sought re-election and retained office unopposed with no other candidates emerging. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method. Background The Labour Party chose not to stand a candidate for the mayoralty and decided to put all its resources in to winning a majority on the council, thinking this was the best way to achieve their goals. Labour actually polled more votes than the conservative Citizens' Association, but won fewer seats by virtue of most Labour votes being won by several popular candidates with the rest of the ticket trailing well behind them, whilst the Citizens' vote was far more evenly spread among its candidates. This was to be the first of five local elections where Labour won a majority of votes but did not gain control of the council. However Labour did manage to carry on momentum to win a by-election later in the year and thereby increase their representation.

Brazil has an embassy in Bogot√° and Colombia has an embassy in Brasilia. The Brazilian ambassador to Colombia is Maria Elisa Berenguer. The Colombian ambassador to Brazil is Alejandro Borda. Brazil and Colombia share a land border. Relations between both countries have not been the best throughout their history. They have been up and down in the past but recently they have decided to change that and improve them. They have strengthened relations with one another tremendously. A motive that is driving the forces between these two countries are that they are neighboring countries that could benefit tremendously in all aspects if they improve relations with one another. They are working towards this in many ways. They have started strengthening relations by signing agreements, laws, and treaties into action.  Timeline of agreements and relations  Relations between these two countries have not always been the best and mainly include Amazon-basis considerations and emphasize efforts to prevent the Andean Pact from becoming an instrument for containment of Brazilian influence. These two countries have not interacted with one another very much over the past. Recently in the last decade they have started collaborate and work together more for the bettering of both countries. The first instance of an agreement signed between them was in 1907, when they signed the Treaty of Boundaries. This was just a treaty defining the boundaries of both countries and where the line between them would end up being. Both governments decided that they would use the Tabatinga‚ÄìApap√≥ris line as the actual boundary line between them. However, this would not be the last time the boundary conflict would be visited and debated. In 1925, Brazil, Colombia and Peru would meet again to sign another treaty including boundaries again. This treaty would just assure that the countries would use the Tabatinga‚ÄìApap√≥ris line as the boundary line between all three countries. The next relation would be when the President of Brazil, Figueiredo, would visit Colombia in 1981. This was the first visit from a head of state from Brazil. In 1981 also, a Visit from the President of Colombia, Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala, to Brazil happened as well. Another agreement was signed into action on November 7, 1994. It was called the Basic Technical Cooperation Agreement between Brazil and Colombia. This agreement impeded the illegal use of precursors and chemical substances essential to the processing of narcotics and psychotropic substances. Basically, making any narcotic and psychotropic illegal in either country. This was mainly done because the boundary between Brazil and Colombia was being used as a highway for cocaine and more powerful narcotics. The boundary was a major door way for smugglers to use into getting illegal narcotics and psychotropics into the countries. In 1997, another agreement was signed in Cartagena between the two countries. It was an agreement in judicial cooperation and mutual assistance on penal matters between the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Federative Republic of Colombia. This was signed in hopes of ensuring the help of one another in matters that dealt with issues relating to punishment involving crime or offenses. The next decade was only full of meetings from parliaments and heads of government from Brazil and Colombia. The next agreement came in 2008. It was labeled as the protocol on Economic and Commercial Cooperation between Brazil and Colombia. It was a memorandum of Understanding for cooperation in combating the illicit manufacture of and traffic in firearms, ammunition, accessories, explosives, and other related materials. This agreement outlawed the illegal assembling of any of the fore mentioned product. This also was aimed to help on cooperation in defense matters. This meant that both countries would try to collaborate and work together on matter that required both militaries of the countries. The next two years were entirely visits to one another countries by the heads of governments again to discuss ways to improve relations. In 2011, the president of Colombia opened up the first Colombia-Brazil Investment Forum organized by the Intreamerican Development Bank (IDB) in Bogota, Colombia. This was in hopes to boost trade between the two countries and improve their economies as well. In 2015, Brazil and Colombia signed an agreement with its purpose to increase trade in the automotive sector of both countries. Also by signing this agreement, they hope to increases exports and create more jobs. More recently, both countries have signed two memorandums that hoped to boost bilateral trade even more. These expanded trade between them inside of the automotive sector and outside as well. These memorandums solidify the 2015 automotive agreement.  Trade and investment between Brazil and Colombia  Trade between these countries have not been high until about the past decade which has seen a huge spike in it. From 2005 to 2014, trade flows between Brazil and Colombia increased significantly, going from 1.5 billion US dollars to 4.1 billion US dollars. This is a huge increase in trade growth for both countries. The list of exports between both countries are widely varied. The main resources Brazil exported to Colombia were propene, automobiles, tires, AC generators, combustion engines and parts of turbojet engines. These do not include all of Brazil's exports just what they exported to Colombia. Colombia exports to Brazil include: crude petroleum, coal briquettes, coffee, refined petroleum and cut flowers. Colombia exports an estimated value of 2.23 billion US dollars to Brazil. Even with all of this growth happening there is still much more potential between the countries. Brazil and Colombia are wanting to explore to find out the full potential of bilateral trade relations. One bank sees trade almost doubling in the future if the path the countries are on continues. Another thing that helps bolster trade between Brazil and Colombia are trade agreements. One signed recently helped improve trade even more. It improved trade in the automotive sector and helped assure an earlier agreement from October 2015 that sought to boost bilateral trade in vehicles as well. Another aspect that is helping relations is investment. Colombia having one of the largest economies in South America is a reason why it is such an investment destination for countries including Brazil. Brazilian companies have invested in many sectors including: the iron and steel industry, oil and mining, finance, and even information technology. This list contains only a few sectors that Brazil invests in in Colombia. Brazil actually has an oil company working in Colombia. Braspetro currently operates in ten countries including Colombia. Brazil also created a trading company subsidiary Interbras. This company is expected to do business with multiple countries including Colombia and is expected to make millions of dollars as well.  Future relations  Relations between Brazil and Colombia are in good standing today. The relations are mainly helped by all of the agreements are mentioned above. The countries are going to continue to work together in the future and hope to continue to boost trade between them. The future looks bright between the countries for now. If they continue to work on agreements and together, their relations with one another will only continue to prosper.

The band formed in 1994 and takes its name after the Nepalese word for \\"a gorge or a cave in the middle of remote hills or mountains\\". Kandara is best known for helping to establish the folk-pop genre within the Nepalese music industry. With its distinctive melodies, simple, folk-based lyrics, and soulful vocal performance, the band has produced several songs such as: \\"Leka ki hey Maya,\\" \\"Hongkong Pokhara,\\" \\"Tagaroma rumal Rakhi,\\" \\"Timi pari tyo Gauma,\\" \\"Bideshiyera gaien Uni,\\" and \\"Chanchale kanchhiko joban.\\" The band is known for creating new lyrics for existing popular songs, emphasizing themes of nationalism, human misery, love, and nature. Kandara was among the first in the industry to collaborate with famous Nepalese poets and lyricists such as Sarubhakta Shrestha, Binod Gauchan and Ramesh Shrestha to write lyrics - a practice which has now become popular within the Nepalese music industry. In 2016, Kandara made a comeback with the release of a new album featuring the popular song, \\"Bhedi Gothaima\\". Impact and Style In the past 26 years, Kandara has performed both nationally and internationally. Kandara's first album, Chanchale Kanchhi, was released in 1994. The title song of the album, Chanchale Kanchhi was a critical success, and can now be seen as a milestone for the band. Songs released in 1996 such as \\"Lekaki hey maya\\", \\"Timi pari\\", and \\"Bideshiyera gaeen uni\\", from the album, Dandapari, further established the band among fans as one known for its compositions with themes of love and tragedy. \\"Hong Kong-Pokhara\\", the title song of the Hong Kong-Pokhara album, found its fame beyond Pokhara and Nepal and became popular among migrant Nepalese around the globe. After 8-years break, Kandara was rejuvenated in 2006 by another hit, \\"Tagaroma Rumal Raakhi\\". The album Barshaun Pachhi, has earned numerous awards and still has an influential impact on the band's fan base. Comeback The band marked their comeback with Bhedi Gothaiima. The album features a total of eight songs, along with an older hit, \\"Timi Pari.\\" After the release of the album, the band toured Nepal. Kandara collaborated with senior writer, singer, actor and musician Surbhakta. Recent Success On April 14, 2015, Kandara released a practice-session video of their new single \\"Bhedi Gothaima\\" on the video sharing site YouTube. The song, penned by veteran Nepali writer Sarubhakta, is one of the songs from the band's upcoming album, which is scheduled for a summer release. The band released their debut album Chanchale Kanchi in 1994. Since then, they have gone on to release six more records. After an eight-year hiatus, the forthcoming album will be the band's eighth. Music company Stereo Records will be producing the album. The album will feature a total of eight songs, along with an older hit \\"Timi Pari\\". After the release of the album, the band plans to tour the country. According to Stereo Records manager Ashish Parajuli, the band intends to perform with a full-fledged orchestra before Dashain. The name of the new album has not yet been disclosed. When Kandara started out twenty-one years ago, the band was a five-piece outfit, but after several line-up changes, it now consists of Sunil Thapa, Buddharaj Bajracharya and Bivek Shrestha. The band is known for blending Nepali folk styles with pop music. Through time, Kandara have established themselves as one of the most popular folk-pop acts in Nepal. \\"Lekaki Hey Maya\\", \\"Hong Kong Pokhara\\", \\"Danda Pari\\", \\"Tagaroma Rumal Rakhi\\" and \\"Chanchale Kanchi\\" are some of the band's most popular songs.

Background The MRV-P programme originated from the Operational Utility Vehicle System. This plan would: > provide a robust, easily supported system, comprising operational utility > vehicles that are able to carry light cargo (up to six tonnes) or small > groups of personnel, integrate as many special-to-role systems as possible > and which can operate in diverse climatic and topographical conditions > worldwide, in order to support and contribute to land (including land air) > and littoral manoeuvre operations‚Äô. However, as reported by the National Audit Office in its 2011 Major Reports, the Operational Utility Vehicle System was cancelled in 2011 and the requirement was re-scoped to form the MRV-P programme. The concept phase supposedly was completed by early spring 2015. Characteristics of the MRV-P A Public Sector Tenders tenders report stated that: > '[The] Multi Role Vehicle Protected (MRV-P) is a Cat A project intended to > meet the requirement for a protected deployable platform employed by all > Force Elements, at all scales of effort, in a wide range of environments, > and on all parts of the battlefield except for the direct fire zone. The > MRV-P should bring commonality to the fleet and reduce the logistic > footprint for utility vehicles by 2020. The requirement was further explained in a presentation by then Brigadier PS Rafferty. The presentation explained that MRV-P vehicles would deploy in the Divisional Support Area in future British Army divisions. MRV-P would have four variants: command and liaison with a four-person seating, a command and control variant that could expand and deploy statically and fit up to six personnel, a logistics transport variant for two personnel and a troop carrier variant with a driver, commander and six dismounts. The presentation further stated that the MRV-P variants would replace the following vehicles in the British Army once they reached their out-of-service dates, although this has yet to be confirmed: *Foxhound (to be replaced by the troop carrier variant) *Husky (to be replaced by the logistics transport variant) *Panther (to be replaced by the command & liaison/command & control variant) *WMIK *Vector In February 2016, a Europa Supplies contract indicated that the Ministry of Defence requested for two variants: a Troop Carrying Vehicle (TCV) and a Future Protected Battlefield Ambulance (FPBFA). The TCV would sit: 1 x Driver; 1 x Commander; and 6 x Seated Passengers. The FPBFA would sit: 1 x Driver; 1 x Commander; 6 x Personnel or a combination of permanent seating for 2 x Medical Attendants seated at the head of the stretcher and ability to transport 2 stretchered casualties or 1 stretchered casualty and 3 Seated Casualties and combinations thereof. The dimensions would be of max width 2 500 mm; a max Height 2 650 mm (in transit mode). It \\"must be capable of being transported by land, sea and air (including but not limited to A400M and C17) with minimal preparation. There is [however] no requirement to transport under slung by rotary wing aircraft.\\" The two variants must have more than a medium Mobility load carrying classification and they must protect the occupants from ballistic threat at more than Stanag Level 2 and blast threat at more than Stanag Level 2. Bidders In September 2015, IHS Janes reported that General Dynamics offered two different variants for the MRV-P programme. One was the General Dynamics European Land Systems Mowag Eagle Vs in the 4x4 and 6x6 configurations. Another option was the General Dynamics Land Systems UK (previously Force Protection) Ocelot 4x4 which was already in British Army service. In June 2016, Defense News reported that the British MOD was in talks with the US Defense Department about purchasing the Oshkosh L-ATV or the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle for Package 1 of the MRV-P programme. With respect to Package 2, the report also noted that the RMMV Survivor R is also one of the five downselected for this requirement, the remaining other contenders being BAE SYSTEMS, General Dynamics UK, Mercedes Benz, Thales UK.

Prior to his death he donated the house and gardens to the National Trust. Hoare's parents were Henry Arthur Hoare and his wife Julia Lucy (n√©e Lane); he was thus the grandson of Sir Henry Hugh Hoare, 3rd Baronet. He was educated at Harrow School, and later served in the 3rd Battalion, Bedfordshire Regiment. In 1887, Henry Hoare married Alda Weston, whom he had known since childhood. Their only child, Henry Colt Arthur Hoare, known as Harry, was born in 1888. Harry joined the Dorset Yeomanry at the start of the First World War and died of wounds received while fighting in Egypt, in December 1917, leaving his father without an heir. Sir Henry inherited the baronetcy and the house from a cousin in 1894, by which time Stourhead had lain empty for several years as his predecessor could not afford its upkeep. The family moved into the house in February 1895. In 1910, Lady Alda made the acquaintance of the writer Thomas Hardy, who lived in Dorchester, in the neighbouring county of Dorset. She began a correspondence with both Hardy and his wife Emma, and the friendship continued after Emma died and he married Florence Dugdale; many of their letters are preserved in the archive at Stourhead. In 1915, Sir Henry served as High Sheriff of Wiltshire. Sir Henry and his wife died on the same day, within six hours of one another. He was aged 81.

Gameplay Player controls a multi-colored robot able to move to right and left, jump and shoot enemies such as small humanoids, rats, ghosts and snakes that come from holes above on the screen, vertically far away from the player, who stands always at the bottom of the stage and has to eliminate them all before they reach the bottom or simply avoid them to complete each level. Enemies are able to attack the player with bombs, making him unable to jump, move and shoot for a short time. The player can also become defenseless getting hit by incoming rocks from vulcans. A life is lost when enemies touch the player and take away the robot's lower half, which can be avoided by jumping over them without touching them. The game has three stages. In the first two, each time the robot is damaged by rocks and bombs, a friendly, short, old man appears to help fix it. At the last part of the third one, the player faces off the game's boss: a grotesque giant monster with a ball-shaped body and an enormous mouth with pointed teeth. The goal is to shoot and destroy all of its teeth before it can reaches the player's position, otherwise the monster will devour the robot. If the player manages to win the boss, he is returned to the first stage.

The airfield was east of Stafford and bounded at the west and north by railways. After opening in 1942, it served as a base for No. 30 Operational Training Unit and, after the OTU left up until its closure in 1957, it served as a satellite site for No. 16 Maintenance Unit based at RAF Stafford. History Permission was granted to build a base at Hixon in August 1941 with opening coming on 13 May 1942. The base was to be used for operational flying, but instead it was used as a training environment for Bomber aircrews flying Vickers Wellington aircraft on No. 30 OTU, Curtiss Tomahawks and Hawker Hurricanes on 1686 Bomber (Defence) Training Flight (BDTF) and Bristol Blenheims flown by No. 12 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit ((P)AFU). It was originally intended to be a No. 7 Group asset, but when it was handed over to the Royal Air Force from the contractors in June 1942, No.92 Group became its owner. Even then there was another change; it became a No.93 Group asset six weeks later. As a night bomber training unit, crews from Hixon were often sent on missions to France and sometimes even Germany to drop propaganda leaflets (PsyOps). These missions were often called after their codename, 'Nickel Raids'. These night-time raids were just as dangerous as actual bombing runs as the enemy had no way of determining that they were only dropping leaflets. In early 1943, No. 25 OTU based at RAF Finningley was disbanded and the Wellington aircraft and groundcrews were sent to Hixon. The personnel and assets were shared out with RAF Seighford. In June of the same year, No. 1686 Bomber (Defence) Training Flight (BDTF) was formed at Hixon for 'Bullseye' training. No.1686 was equipped with P-40 Tomahawk aircraft which were formally used by No. 112 Squadron in North Africa and still retained their distinctive Sharks Teeth markings under the nose of the aircraft. The Tomahawks (and later, Hurricanes) were used so that the turret operators could practice against fighter attack whilst airborne. Bomber Command gave No. 30 OTU more responsibility in January 1944 when the unit was tasked for Air Sea Rescue in addition to its training programme. The flights were piloted and commanded by instructors on the OTU, but aircrews under training would make up the rest of the complement. RAF Seighford was opened up as a satellite and Relief Landing Ground for RAF Hixon and No.30 OTU when RAF Wheaton Aston became busier and ceased being RAF Hixon's stand-by airfield. Quite often, aircrews would have to get their aircraft across to RAF Seighford before missions could begin as the runway at RAF Hixon was not long enough for bombers laden with bombs. Seighford was also able to operate when Hixon had to cease operations due to the weather closing in despite there being only a difference between the two. The aircraft were experiencing mechanical failure due to age and daily use; the attrition rate of this was very high. Coupled to the fact that it was a training unit, accidents were rife. After several crashes where the airframes came to rest just beside or even on the railway tracks on at least two occasions, special phone lines were installed between the tower and the signalling staff controlling the railways in the event of an airframe fouling the railway lines. As Hixon was close to the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) base at Stone, the airfield was visited by a myriad of American aircraft as well as General Patton who alighted at RAF Hixon to go to one of the Prisoner of War camps located close to Rugeley. The airfield was host to No. 30 Operational Training Unit from its inception in June 1942 up until February 1945 when the OTU left for RAF Gamston in Nottinghamshire. At the same time that the OTU was moving out, thirty-seven Beauforts of No.12 (P)AFU from RAF Spitalgate moved in. No. 12 (P)AFU did not last long though, it was disbanded in June 1945 and the site was given over to 16 Maintenance Unit from RAF Stafford as a sub-site. 16 MU needed access to storage sites for the recently returned and surplus military items at the war's end. 16 MU stayed on until November 1957 when the base was put under the care and maintenance programme. The site was disposed of by sale in August 1962. Post RAF In 1968, a transformer built by English Electric en route to Hixon airfield was involved in a crash with a train on a level crossing on the Manchester branch of the West Coast Main Line. English Electric were using the former airfield hangars to store the transformers with at least six others having been successfully transported and stored there. Two of the runways still exist and although they are heavily overgrown, Staffordshire Police use them for driver training. The former technical site is now occupied by an industrial estate which lets out space for companies as well as permanent occupancy buildings. The Control Tower is still extant and has been converted for office and private use.

The Museum was opened by the society in 1991 and has displays relating to products of the foundry, local history and the lives of local inhabitants. The museum's name 'Blast furnace Brunou' comes from building's original use and from the name of one of the founders of the foundry, Brynolf Brunou. The main entry hall contains displays about the development from peasant to iron worker as well as the development of the factory from an ironworks to a cardboard mill. The second floor contains products from the foundry. In other floors there is changing displays with different themes. The museum contains mainly products of the ironworks from the 1900s. The museum is open in the summer from June to August. History In the year 1746 commissioner Brynolf Brunou received permission from the authorities in Stockholm to create a foundry in the shore of Juckaisjoki river near Kuopio. The foundry specialized in using lake and swamp ore. For the first hundred years the pastoral family Argillander and the noble family Tigerstedt tried to get Str√∂msdalsbruk to operate profitably. However it wasn't until the Russian Ponomarev family took over in the late 1800s that the factory became truly profitable and developed into one of the best maintained industrial centres in Finland. In the early 1900s the foundry was purchased by Baron Anton von Alftan. During this period iron smelting was discontinued with a groundwood plant being built on the opposite side of the river, followed a few years later by the beginning of cardboard production. This production was continued by Kymi concern in 1915. In the 1970s Juantehdas developed as a cardboard factory which was bought by Stromsdal Oy in 1988.2\\\\.

The complex includes five buildings, as well as a power canal and dam that first went into operation in 1866. Four of the five buildings are of brick construction, between three and five stories in height, with later additions of various sizes and materials. These buildings were built using slow-burning construction methods typically used for mill construction of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The mill office building is a single-story brick structure located near Main Street.Corbett, Matthew (2014). NRHP nomination for Winthrop Mills Company; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission.

It covers an area of the pantanal rich in watercourses. Location The Encontro das √Åguas State Park is divided between the municipalities of Pocon√© (56.71%) and Bar√£o de Melga√ßo (43.29%) in the state of Mato Grosso. It has an area of . The MT-060 highway cuts across the northwest tip of the park, and a road leads from MT-060 along the northeast border of the park. The park covers an area rich in watercourses that support rich biodiversity of pantanal flora and fauna. Rivers The Ca√ßanje River defines part of the northern border of the park, flowing northeast to join the Cuiab√° River. Further south the Alegre River flows northeast across the park parallel to the Ca√ßanje, forms part of the eastern border, then continues east to join the Ca√ßanje just before that river enters the Cuiab√°. The Cuiab√° flows southwest and forms part of the eastern border of the park. On some maps it is now called the Canabu River. The Cuiab√° / Canabu cuts across the park, where it joins the S√£o Louren√ßo River, or Pingara River, which also cuts across the park from the east. The S√£o Louren√ßo continues southwest across the park, then defines the west border of the southern part of the park. The park is bounded to the south by the Piquir√≠ River, which defines the border with the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. The Piquiri flows west to join the S√£o Louren√ßo at the southwest boundary of the park. History The Encontro das √Åguas State Park was created by decree 4.881 of 22 December 2004 by the governor of Mato Grosso. On 17 October 2014 SEMA gave a last call to landowners or leaseholders to provide documentation supporting their claims. The consultative council was created on 18 December 2014. Fishing is banned within of the state park, although this only applies within Mato Grosso and not across the Piquiri River in Mato Grosso do Sul. This has caused some hardship to about 40 riverine families in Mato Grosso who depend on fishing for a living. Eco-tourism The park has a large number of jaguars, who live on the capybaras and alligators that are common in the pantanal. A small local tourism industry has developed since this became known to the outside world, arranging guides, boats and camping expeditions, often run by untrained people and without basic safety equipment. As of 2012 the park had no management plan, and technically should be closed to tourism. However, it is visited by tourists, guides and scientists who hope to observe the jaguars. The big cats are shy, and the tourists may drive them away. There are reports that the number of sightings is falling and, when seen, jaguars move away from boats faster than before. An eco-tourist lodge in the park was closed by court order in 2009. The American owner then built a camp on the other side of the Piquiri River in Mato Grosso do Sul. In 2011 it was reported that the environment police of that state had found problems with the new lodge, which had been built without authorization from the responsible environmental agency. The company was planning to build nine buildings from which to observe jaguars passing through the region, and was already receiving German and American tourists. The owners were accused of using bait animals such as pigs, sheep and alligators to attract the leopards. Notes Sources    .

It was the center of public, administrative, commercial and religious life in the ancient city. Meetings, discussions, celebrations and state events were held there. The forum covers an area of 20 ha (11 ha revealed) which makes it the largest of its kind in Bulgaria. Ancient Roman Forum in Plovdiv The ancient city center was built in the 1st century AD during the reign of Emperor Vespasian when ancient Philippopolis obtained a new city planning scheme and a center (forum) according to a Roman model. The main streets of the city (cardo maximus and decumanus maximus) intersect outside the eastern entrance of the complex. A complex of public buildings was built to the North, including the Odeon, the city library, the building of the treasury. The forum of the ancient city and its main street (cardo maximus) are located at the very heart of Plovdiv's modern city center and main pedestrian area.  Location  The Roman forum of Plovdiv is located near General Gurko str. and the main pedestrian street of the city (Knyaz Alexander of Battenberg str.). The building of the central post office lies above the western part of the forum. The construction of Maria Luiza blvd. in the 1980s split the northern part of the forum from the rest. The Forum Plan of the ancient forum. Discovered parts are marked in red Drawing of the colonnade The forum has rectangular shape, close to the shape of a square, with dimensions: 143 m in north- southern direction and 136 m in east-western direction. A complex of public buildings was built to the North, dominating over the rest of the buildings at the square. Three entrances, situated along the axes of the eastern, southern and western edge, provide access to the streets, located at the sides of the Forum. The main streets cardo maximus and decumanus maximus intersect outside the eastern entrance of the complex. It was used as a market thoroughfare where merchants and people from the city and the region gathered to exchange Thracian grain, wood and honey for fine pottery and bronze vessels brought as far as Italy. Forum and Odeon Stores and shops occupied the eastern, the southern and the western side of the forum and patrons entered them through narrow porticoes. Four main construction phases can be distinguished in the historical layers of the Forum. They are different in terms of their level, architectural design and use of building materials. Four construction phases of the Forum The first construction phase marks the beginning of the complex development and bears the plan shape of the urban square. During the second construction phase the levels of the shops, the ambulation and the area were raised. Powerful crepido brings the stylobate of columns in Doric order, made of sandstone. The stone drainage leading rainwater away from the roof of the portico kept its original place. The ambulation was 11 m wide. The eastern, southern and western sides were formed by four-column Ionic propylaea. During the third construction phase the plastic decoration of the complex was replaced. The portico around the area is made of marble. The largest number of well-preserved original remains date back to the fourth and final construction phase. Over the existing crepido a new stylobate of syenite blocks was placed. It bore a marble arcade of free-standing columns in the Roman Corinthian order. The public buildings for the needs of urban governance and other manifestations of urban life were situated in the northern part of the forum complex. Epigraphic documents recall for the existing of a Treasury. In the northeast corner an Odeon (Bouleuterion) is revealed and to the West of it - the city Library. At the northern side of the complex some inscriptions, related to the religious and administrative life of the town were found, along with a piece of an invitation card for a performance of gladiator fights. In the area were found pedestals for statues, an exedra ‚Äì a platform for speeches, and remains of an altar with inscriptions, dedicated to the goddesses Demeter and Kore (Persephone). It went silent in the middle of the 5th Century when waves of Barbarians forced the people of Philippopolis to abandon the quarters in the plain and move to the acropolis.  Conservation and Restoration  The Forum of Philippopolis was discovered in 1971 during the construction of the central post office building in Plovdiv. The Eastern, the Northern and part of the Southern part of the ancient central square were revealed. In 2012, excavation works began in the North-western part, revealing an area of 400 sq.m between the post office building and Tsar Siemon gardens.

The 16th century descriptions by the Spanish of the rafts used by Native Americans along the seacoasts of Peru and Ecuador has incited speculation about the seamanship of the Indians, the seaworthiness of their rafts, and the possibility that they undertook long ocean-going voyages. None of the prehistoric rafts have survived and the exact characteristics of their construction and the geographical extent of their voyages are uncertain. It is likely that traders using rafts, constructed of balsa wood logs, voyaged as far as Mexico and introduced metallurgy to the civilizations of that country. Some scholars and adventurers of the 20th and 21st century have asserted that the rafts and their crews journeyed thousands of miles across the Pacific to Polynesia, most notably Thor Heyerdahl who reached Polynesia on the Kon-Tiki raft. Several other people and groups have also built rafts based on prehistoric models and undertaken trans-Pacific voyages. Balsa is the Spanish word for raft. The use of rafts for commerce on the coasts of Peru and Ecuador, from northern Chile to southern Colombia, continued until the late 19th century, long after the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire (1532 to 1572), although the fidelity of these rafts to their prehistoric ancestors is uncertain. Background A drawing of a raft (balsa) near Guayaquil, Ecuador in 1748. The drawing resembles the description given by 16th century Spanish explorers of the rafts used by Indians. In 1526, a Spanish ship captained by Bartolom√© Ruiz, Francisco Pizarro's chief navigator, ventured southward down the west coast of South America, the first Old World ship known to have explored this coastline. Off the coast of Ecuador, Ruiz encountered a Native American raft, being the first encounter between Spanish and Inca's vassals. A contemporary account of the encounter is: :: The chronicler, Francisco de Xerez, said that the raft carried a cargo of \\"silver objects, tiaras, crowns, bands, tweezers and bells, all of this they brought to exchange for some [sea] shells.\\"Dewan, Leslie and Hosler, Dorothy (2008), \\"Ancient Maritime Trade on Balsa Rafts: An Engineering Analysis,\\" Journal of Archaeological Research, Vol. 64, p. 20 Other contemporary chroniclers gave additional details about the rafts. \\"They set a mast in the largest log in the middle, hoist and sail, and navigate all along this coast. They are very safe vessels because they cannot sink or capsize, since the water washes through them.\\"de Estete, Noticias del Peru (1535) and other accounts from Dewan, Leslie, \\"Ecuadorian Balsa Raft Construction and Design Analysis,\\" http://web.mit.edu/ldewan/Public/raft/3094_presentation.pdf, accessed 29 July 2016 Construction and navigation A Peruvian raft in 1841. The square sail and straight mast may reflect Spanish influence. Balsa logs. Logs from the balsa tree (Ochroma lagopus) are distinguished by their light weight and large size (up to in diameter). A tree of the tropical forest, the balsa tree did not naturally occur on the arid coasts of Peru and southern Ecuador. The source of balsa logs for rafts was the valley of the Guayas River, north of the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador. This area is still the principal source of balsa wood for international trade. The long term buoyancy of balsa logs has been called into question. Prior to the voyage across the Pacific Ocean of the Kon-Tiki in 1947, scholars often argued that balsa logs absorb water so quickly that long voyages were infeasible. Heyerdahl, however, used green balsa wood logs for a voyage of 101 days on the Kon-Tiki. Other studies have also indicated that dry balsa logs can remain afloat for extended periods of time.Emanuel, Jeff (2012), \\"Crown Jewel of the Fleet: Design, Construction, and Use of the Seagoing Balsas of the Pre-Columbian Andean Coast,\\" in Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Boats and Ship Archaeology (ISBSA 13), Amsterdam, Netherlands, October 8‚Äì12, 2012, pp. 6-7, http://scholar.harvard.edu/emanuel/mbian-Balsa_ISBSA-13, accessed 2 Aug 2016 Rafts were always constructed of an odd number of balsa logs, usually numbering 3 to 11, with the center log being the longest and the others tapering down in length. The Spanish said the rafts were in the shape of the extended fingers of a hand. The large balsa logs, lashed together with henequen fiber, formed the main deck of a raft. Seawater passed freely between and over the logs making it very difficult for rafts to be swamped by heavy seas.Emanuel, pp. 7-8 Atop the large balsa logs was a platform or multiple platforms, constructed of cane or bamboo which kept the cargo and passengers dry. During historic (and probably pre-historic) times the platform might include a hut to shelter the passengers and crew and a fire pit for cooking.Emanuel, p. 9 Sails and masts The use of sails on pre-Columbian rafts has been disputed by a few scholars who have speculated that the Spaniards introduced the use of sails or that the technology for using sails derived from the Spanish but was adopted by the Indians before the physical arrival of the Spanish on the Ecuadorian coast. However, the chronicler of Ruiz's voyage in 1526 is clear that the raft he saw used sails and this voyage was only 13 years after the first known Spanish sighting of the Pacific Ocean in Panama, more than north. Another contemporary author said that sails had been used on rafts \\"since time immemorial.\\"Emanuel, pp. 10-13 There is also controversy whether the sails used were square or lateen (triangular). Although square sails were later used, the earliest accounts describe triangular sails, probably two in number, fore and aft rigged with two masts.Smith, Cameron M. and Haslett, John F. (1999), \\"Construction and Sailing Characteristics of a Pre-Columbian Raft Replica,\\" Bulletin of Primitive Technology p. 17; Emanuel, pp. 11-12 Engineering and stress studies indicate that the masts were curved and no longer than and about in diameter. They may have been composed of two pieces of wood joined together. The wood used is unknown although modern reproductions have used mangrove wood, the mangrove being common along the Ecuadorian coast and the northern Peruvian coast of Piura and Tumbes.Dewan and Hosler, pp. 23-31 Navigation. Pre-Columbian rafts were steered by a combination of adjusting the sails and the use of centerboards, called \\"guaras.\\" These were boards typically about wide inserted vertically into the sea between the balsa logs. On larger rafts there were three sets of the guaras at the front, back, and the middle of the raft. Raising, lowering, or removing some of the guaras or moving them toward the bow or stern reduced or increased sub-surface tension and made it possible to steer the raft. Working in tandem with the sails, the guaras, according to an 1820 report, permitted the crew to undertake \\"all the maneuvers of a regularly built and well-rigged [sailing] vessel.\\"Emanuel, pp. 9-10 The rafts could achieve a speed of 4 to 5 knots.\\"Thor Heyerdahl: Balsas Raft in Aboriginal Navigation of Peru and Ecuador,\\" http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/thor/balsa-raft.php, accessed 2 Aug 2016 Size and cargo capacity. An engineering study concluded that ocean going rafts ranged in size from to long and had a cargo capacity of 10 to 30 tons. The cargo capacity of the rafts declined as the balsa logs absorbed sea water. After 4 months in the water the capacity of the largest rafts declined to 10 tons and after 8 months to 5 tons. Thus, a little more than 8 months in the water was the useful life of the rafts.Dewan and Hosler, p. 36 Trade with Mexico The antiquity of the use of sea-going rafts by the people of the Ecuadorian and Peruvian coasts has not been established as ancient balsa wood rafts have left few archaeological traces, but it appears that a maritime trading system from southern Colombia to northern Chile was established by about 100 BCE.Dewan and Hosler, pp 19-20 The maritime trade had two centers: the northern coast of Ecuador and Chincha about south of present-day Lima, Peru. The sudden adoption of metallurgy in the civilizations of Mexico about 800 CE has led archaeologists to conclude that the technology was introduced, most likely by sea-going rafts, from the Ecuadorian coast of South America where metallurgy had been practiced for hundreds of years. Later advances in metallurgy in Mexico after 1200 CE resembled the metallurgy of the Chincha in Peru.Hosler, Dorothy (1988), \\"West Mexican Metallurgy: South and Central American Origins and West Mexican Transformations,\\" American Anthropologist, Vol. 90, No. 4, pp. 832-843 Scholars have calculated that a one-way trip from Ecuador to Mexico would have taken six to eight weeks, sailing at an average of 4 knots for 12 hours each day. To enjoy the best weather, traders would most likely leave Ecuador in early December and arrive in Mexico in late January. They would set off on the return in early March and arrive in Ecuador in early May. A raft could make two round trips before becoming waterlogged. Some sailors would remain longer in Mexico. One account from Spanish sources dated 1525 says that \\"Indians from certain islands in the south...brought exquisite products which they would trade for local products and ...stay for five or six months until good weather occurred.\\" It was during these trade voyages that South American sailors may have introduced metallurgy to Mexico.Dewan and Hosler, p. 36 The purported trade between Ecuador and Mexico consisted of luxury items, including Spondylus (spiny oyster) and Strombus (conch) shells, which were prominently traded from their origins in the warm ocean waters of Ecuador throughout the Andes and up and down the coasts of South America.Shimada, Izumi. ‚ÄúEvolution of Andean Diversity: Regional Formations (500 B.C.E-C.E. 600)\\" (1999), The Cambridge History of the Native People of the Americas, Vol. III, pt. 1.

Modern day re- creations Since the voyage of the Kon-Tiki in 1947, there have been numerous crossings of the Pacific Ocean by raft from South America to Polynesia. In the 1990s, four attempts to sail a raft from Ecuador to Mexico failed, although one attempt reached Costa Rica.Smith and Haslett, p. 14 The various voyages have demonstrated the seaworthiness of prehistoric rafts and, in the words of an early Spaniard, that the Indians who sailed them were \\"great mariners.\\" The Spanish colonists in Peru and Ecuador from the 16th to the 19th centuries relied on the Indians of the Peruvian and Ecuadorian coasts and their rafts for coastal trade.Emanuel, pp. 13-14 See also *Chincha culture *Dalca *John F.

Between 1890 and 1925 Dubosq decorated 446 theatrical entertainments of virtually every possible kind: ballet, circus, (melo)drama, opera, operetta, pantomime, revue, and vaudeville. Dubosq is furthermore one of the few scenic painters of his generation to have left a substantial sample of his art, namely twenty-one (near-)complete sets. Comprising Europe's largest holding of historical decors, the hundreds of flats and drops of the ‚ÄòDubosq‚Äô collection have survived at the Schouwburg of Kortrijk since 1920.  Career  = Childhood and education in Paris = Dubosq was born into a family of gilders that had moved from the provinces to Paris around the middle of the nineteenth century. His father, Henri Dubosq, was a native of Le Havre while his mother, Ad√®le Briet, originatined from Quivi√®res. Apparently showing signs of artistry already in his childhood, Dubosq began to master the secrets of illusionistic set design at the age of thirteen. He apprenticed with four Parisian decorators that were acclaimed in their day: Pierre Zarra, Eug√®ne Carpezat, Jean Daran, and Enrico Robecchi. In keeping with his teachers, all four of whom produced extensive portfolios for several theaters in and outside Paris, Dubosq fostered the ambition to become an independent artist. However, since fin-de-si√®cle Paris was already saturated with ateliers de d√©cors, Dubosq emigrated to Belgium in June 1887 to establish his own workshop in the country's flourishing capital, Brussels. = A rising star of fin-de-si√®cle Brussels = Dubosq first enlarged his experience at the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie under the supervision of Pierre Devis and Armand Lynen, who had offered him a job. On 3 January 1890, he debuted as a self-employed stage designer at the Th√©√¢tre de l‚ÄôAlcazar, furnishing scenery for Luc Malpertuis and George Garnir's Ex-Clarmonde, a vaudevillian spoof of Massenet's opera Esclarmonde (1889). 5 February 1890 saw the premiere of Bruxelles √† cheval, an ‚Äòequestrian revue‚Äô (revue √©questre) by Malpertuis staged at the Cirque Royal. Bruxelles √† cheval was to be the first of Dubosq's many contributions to the revue, a satirical genre involving spoken dialogues, sung couplets, ballets, and parades. Most frequently performed around the end of the year, the revue enjoyed such a vogue in fin-de-si√®cle Brussels that many productions ran for more than a hundred performances: Bruxelles fin de si√®cle (Alcazar, 1891), for instance, was performed 145 times, while Bruxelles Haut-Congo (Alcazar, 1890) toured Belgium.Bruxelles Haut-Congo was performed in Ghent, Mons, La Louvi√®re, Li√®ge and Antwerp. Dubosq gave his imagination free rein in a string of works coupling the locus of the Belgian capital‚Äîoften invoked in the title‚Äîwith recent events in politics, culture and technology: Bruxelles √©lectrique (referring to the electrification of the Alcazar, 1892), Bruxelles port de mer (alluding to the capital's increasing harbor activity, 1893), Bruxelles sans g√™ne (a parody of Victorien Sardou‚Äôs hit Madame Sans-G√™ne, Alcazar, 1894), and so on. With a fresh palette and a photographic sense of realism, Dubosq‚Äôs revue sets conjured up the new hotspots of Brussels, next to featuring comic fantasies and even Jules Vernian science-fiction. 500x500px Dubosq began to be called upon for other types of spectacle as well. At the Alhambra and Th√©√¢tre Royal du Parc in Brussels, the artist provided spoken plays of melodramatic allure with historicist and exotic sets that received praise from the press and audience alike. His scenery fir Judith Gautier's japonaiserie La marchande de sourires (Th√©√¢tre Moli√®re, 25 November 1897) was thus extolled: > Le deuxi√®me acte nous transporte dans un paysage fantastique, dont Dubosq a > fait une merveille d‚Äôimpression poignante : les rives du Sonnuda-Gara, la > nuit. La berge descend rapidement vers la rivi√®re que longe une palissade √† > demi bris√©e. Sur l‚Äôautre rive, on aper√ßoit des cahutes de p√™cheurs, dans les > bambous, et les toitures des tours sacr√©es. Une grosse lanterne rouge > √©claire, seule, ce coin d√©sol√© ‚Ä¶ Au troisi√®me acte, un d√©cor superbe, un > d√©cor de r√™ve, de Dubosq encore, et qui fera sensation sans aucun doute ; > deux jardins contigus s√©par√©s par un mur qui dispara√Æt sous l‚Äôadmirable > v√©g√©tation du pays; une rivi√®re serpente parmi les lotus, les buissons aux > mille fleurs du printemps.Le petit bleu, 21 November 1897. At the Th√©√¢tre des Galeries Saint-Hubert, operettas old and new received a luxurious treatment from Dubosq that often rivaled earlier and contemporary Parisian stagings. Complete interiors, among which the auditoriums of the P√¥le Nord (1893), Palais d‚Äô√âte (1894 and 1897), Alcazar (1897) and Tr√©teaux (1897), were decorated by Dubosq. More substantial chores began to fill his order book in the guise of stock sets for the new Stadsschouwburg of Amsterdam (1894), the Casino of Nieuwpoort (1896) and Nieuw Circus of Ghent (1897), next to materials for circus companies traveling to Budapest, London, and Vienna. In 1898, Dubosq created the five sets for the itinerant production of Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, which visited sixteen different countries after its premiere at the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo (29 March 1898). Actively supported by the Belgian press, Dubosq grew into a public figure by the late 1890s. Newspapers published interviews and caricatures, or followed his presence among the high society. ‚ÄòOfficial‚Äô institutions such as the Belgian State invited him to fulfill prestigious commissions and to represent Belgium at the Brussels International Exposition (1897) and the Exposition Universelle (1900). = The opera scenographer = Immediately upon their accession to the directorshop of the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie, on 1 June 1900, Maurice Kufferath and Guillaume Guid√© appointed Dubosq the Monnaie's second peintre-d√©corateur attitr√©, next to Devis and Lynen. Dubosq's first contribution to the Monnaie was the ‚ÄúQuartier Latin‚Äù set for Giacomo Puccini‚Äôs La (vie de) boh√®me, Act II. Premiered on 25 October 1900 under the supervision of the composer and publisher Tito Ricordi, this production enjoyed thirty performances in its first run alone and would keep the stage until 1949. Significantly, Puccini and Riccordi were so enthralled by Dubosq‚Äôs effort that they had it photographed and incorporated in Riccardo Salvadori‚Äôs new design for Act II of Puccini‚Äôs masterpiece.Octave Maus in L‚ÄôArt moderne, 28 October 1900: \\"M. Puccini a, nous dit-on, fait photographier les d√©cors et les costumes de la Boh√®me √† Bruxelles afin que le th√©√¢tre de Milan, o√π sera repr√©sent√©e l‚Äô≈ìuvre prochainement, donne exactement √† sa com√©die musicale le m√™me cadre.\\" Letter of Casa Ricordi to Riccardo Salvadori, 17 April 1901: \\"Siamo a pregarLa di favorire domattina, alle ore 10 ¬Ω, ai n[o]s[tri] Uffici ‚Äì Via Omenoni, 1 ‚Äì ove si trover√† anche l‚Äôegr[egio] Sig[nor] M[aestr]¬∞ Puccini, per combinare relativamente alle scene Boh√®me e Tosca. _ Sar√† bene che per quell‚Äô ora Ella ci faccia avere le due fotografie Boh√®me di Parigi e Bruxelles.\\" (Milan, Biblioteca Braidense, Archivio Ricordi, Copialettere, 1900‚Äì1901, vol. 19, f. 305). Gustav Mahler may have been the first to incorporate Salvadori's illustration (redesigned by Anton Brioschi) in his 1903 production at the Viennese Hofoper. 500x500pxAfter La Boh√®me, Dubosq received a string of commissions from the Monnaie: * the world premieres of Vincent d‚ÄôIndy‚Äôs L‚Äô√âtranger (7 January 1903), Albert Dupuis‚Äô Jean Michel (3 March 1903), Ernest Chausson‚Äôs Le roi Arthus (30 November 1903), and Dupuis‚Äô Martille (3 March 1905) * the Belgian premieres of Charpentier‚Äôs Louise (8 February 1901), Wagner‚Äôs Le cr√©puscule des dieux (G√∂tterd√§mmerung, 24 December 1901, featuring the earliest use of the cyclorama in Belgium and closing the first complete Ring cycle outside Germany), Puccini‚Äôs Tosca (2 April 1904), Massenet‚Äôs Le jongleur de Notre-Dame (25 November 1904) and Ariane (12 November 1907), Messager‚Äôs Madame Chrysanth√®me (9 November 1906), and Gailhard‚Äôs Amaryllis (8 February 1907) * complete make-overs of Bizet‚Äôs Carmen (19 November 1902), Gounod‚Äôs Faust (3 November 1904; attended by King Leopold II), Gluck‚Äôs Alceste (14 December 1904) and Armide (7 November 1905), and Berlioz‚Äô La damnation de Faust (adaptation by Raoul Gunsbourg, 21 February 1906) and Les Troyens (26 December 1906) Several of this stagings were created by Dubosq in close collaboration with the stage director Charles De Beer and costume designer (and symbolist painter) Fernand Khnopff. Dubosq's activity at la Monnaie paved the way to new commissions from other opera houses, such as the Th√©√¢tre Royal of Li√®ge (Louise, 1902), the Grand-Th√©√¢tre of Lyon (Salammb√¥, 1903; Le cr√©puscule des dieux, 1904), the Th√©√¢tre Royal (Fran√ßais) of Antwerp (thirty- six productions, starting with Le jongleur de Notre-Dame in 1905 and ending with Aida in 1924), the Th√©√¢tre Royal of Ostend (a.o. Lakm√©, 1905), the Vlaamse Opera of Antwerp (starting with the theater's inaugural production of Blockx‚Äô De herbergprinses, 1907), and the Grand Th√©√¢tre of Ghent (a.o. Carmen, 1912). The highlight of Dubosq's career was no doubt the staging of G√∂tterd√§mmerung at the Parisian Acad√©mie Nationale de Musique (Palais Garnier, 23 October 1908), to which the artist contributed three magnificent sets‚Äîwith resident set designers Eug√®ne Carpezat and Marcel Jambon furnishing (only) one each. none 500x500px 500x500px  Venues  Following is a list of venues at which Dubosq's activity is supported by historical evidence: = Belgium = Antwerp * Royal (Fran√ßais) * Vari√©t√©s * Vlaamse Opera Brussels * Alcazar / Nouveaut√©s / Nouvelle Com√©die * Alhambra / Empire-Palace * Bruxelles-Kermesse * Cercle Artistique * Cercle ‚ÄòLe Crotin‚Äô * Cirque Kiralfy * Cirque Royal * Concert Noble * Diable-au-Corps * Exposition Universelle (1897) * Foire commerciale * Folies-Berg√®re * Ga√Æt√© * Galeries Saint-Hubert * Moli√®re * Monnaie * Olympia * Palais des Sports * Parc * Passage du Nord / Vari√©t√©s * P√¥le Nord / Palais d‚Äô√ât√© * Scala * Tr√©teaux * Vaudeville Charleroi * √âden * Renaissance * Th√©√¢tre * Vari√©t√©s Ghent * Feestpaleis * Grand Th√©√¢tre * Koninklijke Nederlandse Schouwburg * Nieuw Circus Kortrijk * Liberale Kring ‚ÄòOns Huis‚Äô * Stadsschouwburg Laken * Ch√¢teau Leuven * Stadsschouwburg Li√®ge * Gymnase / √âden * Pavillon de la Flore * Royal Nieuwpoort * Casino Ostend * Casino-Kursaal * Eldorado * Ons Huis * Royal / Schouwburg * Scala Tournai * Communal * Halle aux Draps = Abroad = Amsterdam * Circus Schumann * Stadsschouwburg Budapest * 'Th√©√¢tre des F√™tes du Mill√©naire' Granville * Casino London * Crystal Palace * Earl's Court * Globe * Olympia Lyon * Grand Th√©√¢tre Monte Carlo * Op√©ra Paris * Acad√©mie Nationale de Musique * Apollo * Exposition des Arts D√©coratifs (1925) * Exposition Universelle (1900) * Gymnase * Moulin Rouge Vienna * Zirkus Renz  Bibliography  Historical * Anonymous, ‚ÄòUn Bruxellois par jour : Albert Dubosq‚Äô, Le petit bleu du matin, 4 May 1896. * Anonymous, ‚ÄòAlbert Dubosq‚Äô, Le carnet mondain, 14‚Äì20 August 1902.

The film stars Yvonne Strahovski, Anna Pniowsky, Abigail Pniowsky, Ryan McDonald, and Justin Bruening. It was released on September 14, 2018, by Vertical Entertainment.  Plot  With her husband Shawn planning to arrive later, Laura takes her two young daughters, Kayla and Maddie, to a remote lake house for their annual family getaway. When they arrive, area resident Owen mentions that the family who previously lived in the house had a son named John who went missing. Meanwhile, at a gas station, Shawn buys the girls a music box. While playing outside, Kayla and Maddie follow a long red string, which leads to a tea party set up in the middle of the forest, where there are two cupcakes on the table. Maddie eats one, but Kayla saves hers to give to Shawn. In the night, Maddie gets sick and vomits up a small piece of ribbon with the word \\"hello\\" written on it. Kayla tells Laura about the cupcakes and, in the cupcake Kayla saved, Laura finds another ribbon inside with the word \\"goodbye\\" on it. Laura tries to call 911 but the landline is down. After hearing unsettling noises from upstairs, Laura goes out to her car to search for her cellphone, and finds a strange doll in the backseat. Laura leaves the house with the girls but as she drives away, two wheels fall off the car and crashes. Back in the house, Laura finds a family photo with everyone's faces scratched out, except for hers. They also see a masked man, revealed to be John, standing outside, just as Shawn arrives. He calls Laura's cellphone and hears John breathing heavily on the other end. Shawn then follows a red string into the forest where mannequins are positioned like a family in effigy around the tea party. John appears and kills Shawn with an axe. More strange noises are heard inside the house. John uses a recording of Shawn's voice to lure Laura outside. Shawn's dead body suddenly drops from the roof with his eyes gouged out. When the lights in the house go out, Laura hides the girls in a closet upstairs while she recovers Shawn's car keys from his body. Owen arrives at the house to investigate the commotion, but John kills him. Downstairs, Laura finds the doll in the kitchen, along with a storybook altered with handmade pages depicting John's plan to kill everyone. As they prepare to leave again, John unexpectedly breaks through the front door and captures Laura. He then plays a children's song to lure Kayla and Maddie outside to Shawn's car. They find their mother bound and gagged in the trunk. John swings his axe into Laura's side before chasing the girls back to the house. John finds Kayla and Maddie hiding under a bed. He explains to them that he grew up in the house and has been stalking Laura's family during each of their annual trips. John speaks cryptically about the storybook's significance before flipping the bed and capturing both girls. By morning, John brings the unconscious sisters to his effigy collection in the forest where he plans to rebuild the mannequins from their body parts. Having recovered, Laura distracts John with the music box then attacks him with his axe, and he collapses to the ground. Kayla and Maddie reunite with their mother. She gets the girls in Shawn's car and she drives away. The engine stalls, but Laura manages to re-start it. As they look back and see, John's body has disappeared.

During his first year with RCBC he steered the bank to a 56% growth in its net income at Php 3.21 billion, the steepest profit growth among the Philippines' top 10 banks. In 2009 RCBC recorded a 54% increase in its net income at Php3.33 billion. This was followed by net incomes of Php4.28 billion in 2010, Php5.9 billion in 2011, and peaking at Php5.94 billion in 2012.

Bangladesh Bank Heist Controversy In February 2016, RCBC became involved in the Bangladesh bank heist when one of the bank's branches was used by still unidentified hackers to transfer US$81 million, of the total US$951million that was initially stolen from the Bangladesh Central Bank. In the wake of the incident, Tan went on voluntary leave in order to give the bank a free hand in its investigation. But even after being cleared by the bank's independent investigation, Tan still chose to resign as head of RCBC on May 6, 2016 to take \\"full moral responsibility\\" for the incident. He was also subsequently cleared by all other investigating government agencies. Tan filed civil and criminal cases against the former RCBC bank manager at the center of the controversy for libel and perjury after she dragged his name into the case. The manager admitted to lying in her statements given to the committee conducting an investigation in the Philippine Senate. On January 10, 2019, Deguito was found guilty of money laundering in connection with the $81-million cyber heist on Bangladesh's central bank. She was sentenced to 4 to 7 years in prison for each of the 8 counts of money laundering by the Makati Regional Trial Court. She was also fined a total of $109 million. Subsequent investigations into the hacking, which are being conducted by the Federal prosecutors in the United States, have revealed that the government of North Korea may have possibly had a role in the theft of the US$81 Million. Some or all of the stolen funds may have found its way to North Korea. The FBI is examining the totalitarian state‚Äôs link to the hack, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the investigation. US National Security Agency Deputy Director Rick Ledgett was also quoted as saying that, ‚ÄúIf that linkage from the Sony actors to the Bangladeshi bank actors is accurate ‚Äî that means that a nation state is robbing banks.\\" The U.S. has charged a North Korean computer programmer with the 2016 cyber-heist of Bangladesh's central bank, among other celebrated global hacking attacks, alleging they were carried out on behalf of the regime in Pyongyang. The hacks also included the WannaCry 2.0 virus, the 2014 Sony Pictures attack. The hack of the central bank of Bangladesh saw at least $81 million stolen and transferred between a number of accounts in the Philippines and elsewhere, rendering most of it unrecoverable. On March 23, 2020, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York has finally dismissed the case filed by Bangladesh Bank to RCBC and its officers. Due to its failure to state a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Conspiracy act claim, the US Court has granted the defendant‚Äôs joint motion for dismissal. The controversy that dragged his reputation finally comes to a conclusion. The situation was seen as Bangladesh Bank‚Äôs neglect and inefficiency has caused the situation to happen. =Sun Life of Canada (Philippines)= From 2005 to 2007, Tan was responsible for the business growth and leadership of Sun Life Financial in the Philippines. This consisted of three businesses: insurance, pre-need and mutual funds. The insurance company was the second largest in the Philippines in 2005 with total assets in excess of Php60 billion, with a more than 2,300 strong agency force, and 53 branches and sales offices nationwide. By year-end 2006, Sun Life pre-need leapt to the number one position (from 6th), its mutual funds business overtook its main competitor, and its life insurance unit remained a strong second. That same year he was awarded the Insurance CEO (CEO EXCEL Awards) of the year by IABC/Phils. =Philippine National Bank= At 40 years old, Tan became the youngest president in the bank's history. While serving as President and CEO of the Philippine National Bank, Tan was responsible for managing the fourth largest private bank in the Philippines with 324 domestic branches and 99 overseas offices with total assets in excess of Php 200 billion. Tan joined the PNB on April 10, 2002 upon the invitation of its two major shareholders, namely, the government-owned Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC) and the Lucio Tan Group. At that time, the PDIC had just infused P7.8 billion in equity, in the form of preferred shares in the bank, in line with its five-year rehabilitation program. Tan was given the \\"principal mandate to lead the five-year rehabilitation efforts and turn around the financial performance from losses to profits.\\" He is credited with the adoption of the \\"good bank-bad bank\\" strategy, which resulted in the early recovery of government funds, including premium in just the third year of the five-year rehabilitation program. During his term as president of PNB, Tan was able to steer the bank to its first profitability in 6 years with Php 168 million net income in 2003 versus P2 billion projected loss, reversing Php 33 billion losses in 5 years. =Yuchengco Group of Companies= Following his extended stint as RCBC's top executive, Tan is currently the head of the Yuchengco Group of Companies' House of Investments (HI).

Mr. Turnaround Lorenzo Tan is known in the banking industry as \\"Mr. Turnaround\\" for his knack of improving the economic performances of the various corporations he has headed. When he was appointed president and chief executive officer of Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) on February 1, 2007, the institution was under capitalized and its asset quality was poor. Just one year later, following some structural, operational and capital changes, RCBC was able to report a 56% jump in unaudited net income to P3.21 billion (US$77.2 million); the steepest profit growth among the country's top 10 banks for that year. Before taking charge at RCBC, Tan was at the helm of Sun Life of Canada (Philippines) for 18 months, during which time he took the company to higher levels in insurance, the pre-need industry and mutual funds. Prior to that, he was able to reverse the fortunes of the formerly state-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB). One year under Tan's watch, PNB was able to go from five straight years of losses to enter the black in 2003. It then doubled net income in 2004 and was ready for privatization the following year, two years ahead of schedule. Awards and recognitions Lorenzo V.

The provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the British National Health Service to prevent HIV infection has been the subject of much controversy. AIDS campaigners have lobbied for the NHS to approve the treatment to prevent the spread of HIV among members of high-risk groups such as gay men. NHS management considered PrEP to be a preventive treatment that they were not legally able to provide funding for, but should instead be funded by local councils. The issue was taken by the National AIDS Trust to a judicial review by the High Court. In 2016, the High Court determined that NHS England had the power to provide PrEP treatment to these groups. Following the defeat at trial, NHS England announced a plan to appeal the judgment in the Court of Appeal, while also making plans to prepare to implement the wider use of PrEP. To ensure it had sufficient funding to cover the ¬£10m‚Äì20m annual cost of PrEP if it was prioritised, NHS England announced that it could no longer guarantee it would be able to commission nine other treatments and services which it had provisionally earmarked for funding. NHS England lost the appeal,[2016 EWCA (Civ) 1100] with Lady Justice Eleanor King and Lord Justices Andrew Longmore and Nicholas Underhill finding in favour of the National AIDS Trust on 10 November 2016, with Public Health England announcing a 3-year large-scale trial seeking to enroll over 10,000 people a few weeks later. Subsequent freedom of information requests showed that NHS England spent over ¬£100,000 fighting the case, not including NAT's legal fees, estimated at a further ¬£8,000.

Dar Bech Hamba  History  Dar Bach Hamba has witnessed many modifications in its architecture through the decades that made it one of the richest palaces in the medina. Yet, these modifications made it very difficult for historians to get precise information about the date of its foundation that is estimated to be in the 17th century. The palace was founded by the Rassa family (coming from Tlemcen since the Hafsid dynasty). Later, during the 18th century, the Naccache family bought it. In 1789, Haj Ahmed Bach Hamba bought it in the reign of Hammuda ibn Ali and gave it its name. The palace later became a property of French sisters who used it as a school during the French protectorate of Tunisia.  Architecture  From the 17th to the 18th century, the palace was a house for craftsmen. It has been considered to be a first class residence (like those belonging to the bourgeois and the nobles of the medina). The palace has its own turba at Sidi Tijani Street and another house (Dar Bakir) is annexed to it. It has a classical architectural plan as have most of the palaces in the medina in Tunis (Dar Lasram, Dar Ben Abdallah, Dar Ben Hassine, etc.) with a patio surrounded by four richly decorated rooms on each side. Yet, unlike other palaces where the porticoes are built face to face, Dar Bach Hamba has a portico on the northern side and another one on the eastern one. One of the four rooms was converted into a chapel in 1932.  Activities  Until 2015, Dar Bach Hamba was the office of the Orestiadi Foundation and the venue for a permanent exhibition of costumes, stuccos and terracottas from all Mediterranean countries. The idea of this exposition was inspired from the model at the Museo delle Trame Mediterranee, and its goal was to show the commonality in Mediterranean cultures and communities. Since July 2015, the palace hosts the L'Art Rue association that develops artistic projects promoting local heritage. Dar Bach Hamba is also the venue of many artistic workshops for children, for oncerts and artistic residences.

Its oldest portions date to 1789, but it is regarded as one of Vermont's finest examples of late Greek Revival architecture, the result of a major transformation in 1843. The house and accompanying farmland, also significant in the development of Morgan horse breeding in the state, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The Wilcox-Cutts House stands in a rural area of central-southern Orwell, on the east side of Vermont Route 22A just south of Sanford Brook. The house is set on a farm property in excess of which the road roughly bisects. The house is set back about from the road on a terraced rise with woods behind. It is an L-shaped 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The main portion of the house has a Greek temple front, with five Ionic columns supporting a pedimented gable. Greek Revival detailing extends to single-story flanking wings, with the northern one acting as a connector to the rear ell, which is the original 18th-century farmhouse. The interior of the main block has high quality Greek Revival woodwork and plaster detailing. with The house now forming the rear of the house was built in 1789 by William Holenbeck, one of Orwell's first permanent settlers. The house was purchased in 1800 by Ebenezer Wilcox, who enlarged it slightly (with an ell to the east) in 1819. Wilcox's son Lucius had the large Greek Revival front section added in 1843, retaining the services of the James Lamb, a regionally known master builder from Shoreham. The building is a remarkably sophisticated and high-style example of the Greek Revival for a rural setting, and has been twice copied: once for a house in Castleton, and again for a reduced-scale replica at the Shelburne Museum. Linus Wilcox was one of the first breeders of merino sheep in the state. In 1872, the property was acquired by Henry Cutts, who was one of the nation's leading breeders of the Morgan horse.

It was the most visited Slovak film of 2013. Plot The film is about the Slovak presidential election. It is narrated by Blonƒè√°ƒçik, who is, along with his Czech partner Jazva, tasked to watch a rich businessman and lobbyist Adam Lambert. Lambert owns an advertising agency and is asked by an influential bishop Josef to manage presidential campaign of an unknown candidate Peter Poto≈à who can take some votes from opposition candidates. He reluctantly agrees but when he finds out that his rival Ivan M√ºller is a campaign manager of minister ƒåernohorsk√Ω who is the front runner in the election, he makes a bet with M√ºller that Poto≈à will win in the first round. If he wins he will get M√ºller's business property but if he loses the bet M√ºller will get his property. The campaign doesn't start well and Poto≈à fares weakly in the polls. This changes when Lambert's people find out that Poto≈à is related to ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r and Lambert uses it in the campaign. Poto≈à gets a boost in polls but still isn't popular enough to win in the first round. Lambert decides to organise a false flag atentate on Poto≈à to increase his popularity enough. A day before voting the atentate occurs but Poto≈à is, in a shocking twist, shot by real bullets. He is taken to the hospital where he dies but not before the result of the election is announced; he wins in a landslide victory. Lambert wins the bet and gains M√ºller's property.

The site is a species-rich hay meadow of a sort now rare in Northumberland. Location and natural features Barrow Burn Meadows are two fields in area situated in the north-east of England in the county of Northumberland, some south of the Anglo-Scottish border and north-west of the village of Alwinton. The meadows are on the south-west facing slope of a hill on the north bank of the upper River Coquet, rising from to above sea level. The surrounding terrain is hilly moorland. The meadows are judged to be species-rich in comparison with fields managed using contemporary farming methods involving the use of artificial fertilisers and reseeding. Aules Hill Meadows in the south-west and Barrow Meadow in the north of the county are similarly protected hay meadows. Vegetation Barrow Burn Meadows is a northern hay meadow characterised by the presence of a rich diversity of grasses, and an abundance of herbs. Species found at the site include sweet vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), crested dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), red fescue (Festuca rubra) with tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa), creeping bent (Agrostis stolonifera), Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), yellow oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) and wood crane's-bill (Geranium sylvaticum). Herb species include pignut (Conopodium majus), bitter vetch (Lathyrus montanus), meadow vetchling (L. pratensis), rough and autumn hawkbit (Leontodon hispidus) and (L. autumnalis), cat's-ear (Hypochoeris radicata), selfheal (Prunella vulgaris), common bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor), changing forget-me-not (Myosotis discolor), common knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare). The southern of the two fields provides a habitat for smooth, hairy and intermediate lady's mantle (Alchemilla glabra, A. filicaulis and A. xanthochlora), whilst the northern field supports eyebright (Euphrasia agg.), quaking grass (Briza media) and melancholy thistle (Cirsium helenioides). A poorly drained section of the northern field supports compact rush (Juncus conglomeratus) and several sedges including glaucous sedge (Carex flacca), common sedge (C. nigra), oval sedge (C. ovalis) and pale sedge (C. pallescens), with marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi), meadowsweet, greater bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus uliginosus) and common spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii). The condition of the one of the units of Barrow Burn Meadows was judged to be favourable in 2012; a second was judged in 2014 to be unfavourable-recovering, with concerns expressed about the observed herb to grass ratio.

Wink, Labs Inc., which develops and markets Wink, was founded in 2014 as a spin-off from invention incubator Quirky. After Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink to Flex in 2015. As of 2016, the Wink software is connected to 1.3 million devices. In July 2017, Flex sold Wink to i.am+ for $59M. Corporate history Wink, Labs Inc. was founded at Quirky, an incubator program for inventions that relies on crowd-sourced product ideas. Wink, Labs was originally created as part of a collaboration with General Electric to control co-branded smart home products like air-conditioners. It was founded by current CTO Nathan Smith and received about $20 million in funding. The company spent twelve months working with fifteen electronics manufacturing companies to offer about 60 Wink-compatible products by July 2014. Wink was spun-off from Quirky in June 2014. According to Quirky, Wink products were in 300,000 homes by 2015. In April 2015 Wink experienced a security problem that made many of its hubs go offline or break, forcing the company to issue a recall. The recall caused a several-month inventory backlog and subsequent shortage of the Wink hub. Due to financial difficulties, due in part to the recall, Quirky began looking for buyers to sell Wink to in 2015. That November, after Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink for $15 million to Flextronics (now called Flex), to whom Quirky owed $18.7 million. Flex was Wink's primary supplier of firmware and hardware. As of 2016, 1.3 million devices were connected to Wink. On 27 July 2017, in its First Quarter Report, Flex announced that it had sold its interest in Wink for $59 million, representing a $38.7 million gain on the balance sheet. Although the Report described the purchaser as \\"an unrelated third-party venture backed company\\", stories circulated in the technology press identifying the purchaser as i.am+, the technology firm founded by the performer Will.i.am. On May 6th, 2020, Wink announced that they would be updating their platform from being free from monthly fees to charging a monthly service fee in order to continue using the Wink app, hub and devices. Wink Labs will be updating the hub software to shut down the service unless users opt in to the monthly subscription services. Users who already have the Wink hub and purchased with the expectation of having the hardware with no monthly fee were notified that they had until May 13, 2020, after which Wink devices would be inaccessible from the app, and all voice control, API and automations would be disabled. On May 12, 2020, Wink notified users that the deadline for terminating non- subscriber access had been postponed to May 20, 2020 in response to user feedback. On May 20, 2020, Wink notified its users that they were delaying the requirement to sign up for a subscription. For those customers who have signed up, we want to assure you that the first month's payment has not yet been processed, and we will notify subscribers before we move forward with Wink Subscription.https://blog.wink.com/ Products Homescreen of the Wink app for iPhone.Wink connects with third-party smart home devices associated with the Internet of Things, such as thermostats, door locks, ceiling fans, and Wi- Fi-enabled lights, to provide a single user interface on a mobile app or via a wall-mounted screen, called Relay. This allows the user to remotely control those devices. The mobile app is free, while consumers pay for a Wink Hub, or Wink Relay, which connects with smart devices in the home. The hubs integrate with competing software standards used by different manufacturers. Wink integrates with software from automated home device brands, such as Canary, which markets an app-controlled home system. In February 2016, new features were introduced to allow Wink to operate on the local network, in case a user's internet connection is down. In June 2016, compatibility with Uber, Fitbit, and IFTTT, was added to the Relay product. A second generation version of the Wink Hub was released in November 2016. The second generation Wink Hub supports most smart home devices with Zigbee, ZWave, Lutron Clear Connect, and Kidde protocols. Wink 2 also added Bluetooth Low Energy, 5 GHz Wi-Fi radio, an Ethernet port, and 512MB of memory. In October 2017, the Wink Lookout home security system was announced, consisting of open/close sensors, motion sensors, a siren, and the Wink hub. The Wink Lookout, released on October 31, 2017, was the last major product released by the company as of May 2020. Reception In a 2014 competitive review comparing Wink to SmartThings, CNET said Wink was cheaper and supported more wireless standards, but had fewer and less reliable sensors to support automation. The article recommended SmartThings for tech-savvy users and Wink for general consumers. In an August 2014 review, CNET gave Wink a 7.7 score out of 10. It complimented the product for being close to the \\"ideal\\" whole-home security and automation service, but lamented that it wasn't \\"a perfect replacement for some of the more sophisticated standalone smart home device apps.\\" A January 2015 review of Wink by Tom's Guide rated the product a 7/10, \\"very good\\". The reviewer criticized the application for not giving as much control over individual smart home electronics as their own apps, but praised Wink for providing \\"an easy way for people to dip their toes into smart home systems.\\" A review in PCMAG of the Wink Hub 2 said it was easy to use and compatible with many devices, but had no battery backup or USB ports. Under \\"Bottom Line\\" the review said, \\"Works with virtually every wireless protocol out there and supports dual-band Wi-Fi. Installation and device pairing is quick and easy.\\" It gave the Hub 2 4.5 out of 5 stars and named it its new Editors' Choice for home automation hubs. In contrast, CNET gave the device three stars. The reviewer said the device is easy to set up and compatible with many devices, but gave the reviewer error messages. The reviewer was never able to successfully set it up the way she wanted. Tom's Guide gave the Wink Hub 2 7 out of 10. It also said the device was easy to use and compatible with many devices, but missing some advanced features. Tom's Guide said it was good for \\"basic\\" smart homes.
