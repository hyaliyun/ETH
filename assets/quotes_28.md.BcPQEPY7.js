On March 1, 2010, they attacked the Japanese website 2ch. It coincided with the 100th anniversary of the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910. Since 2004, DC Inside and 2ch have had numerous conflicts, both large and small.  Summary  On February 23, 2010, users on 2chan (2channers) made offensive comments about a Korean international student that was beaten to death in Russia in the winter of 2009. ‚ÄúDog died, why is it on the news?‚Äù, ‚ÄúKill more!‚Äù, and other remarks were made. A few days prior, the Korean figure skater Yuna Kim won the gold medal in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, and 2channers asserted that officials must have been bribed. These expressions from 2chan flowed into DC Inside's Humor Program Gallery. DC Inside and HumorUniversity (Korean web communities) agreed that the date of the attack should be March 1, 2010, and began recruiting from other online communities such as Today's Humor, Ruliweb, Daum.net. They formed the Terror Action Association, amassing more than 102,000 participants in a day.Ìïú¬∑Ïùº ÎàÑÎ¶¨Íæº, '3.1Ï†à ÏÇ¨Ïù¥Î≤Ñ Ï†ÑÏüÅ', YTN On 1 PM of March 1 (GMT+9), the TAA vandalized 2chan's galleries and executed a massive DDoS attack by paralyzing 2chan's servers. According to Pacific Internet Exchange, who were hosting 2chan's servers, Japanese servers were already experiencing increased volume of requests from Korea facilitated by bots since 11:40 AM. Other websites affiliated with 2chan were also affected by the attack. On the evening of March 1, 2chan servers were suspended and IP addresses from all sources of attacks were blocked. On March 2, damages were estimated to be above $2.5 million. Mainly 2chan's ‚ÄúKorea Slander Gallery\\", \\"VIP Gallery\\", \\"Breaking News Gallery\\" were targeted.  Timeline and the aftermath  On February 24, Korean online communities noticed a series of posts on the Japanese website 2chan regarding Yuna Kim, a Korean figure skater, and the Korean international student that was murdered in Russia. Korean online communities claimed that 2chan members were accusing Yuna Kim of bribery and finding delight in the murder of the Korean student in Russia. An internet community, Terror Action Association was formed with the objective of carrying out a cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010. Although the TAA prohibited the distribution or the use of illegal software, members continuously distributed illegal software leading up to the day of the attack. On February 25, around midnight, Japanese posts appeared on DC Inside's comedy gallery and its users claimed that the servers had slowed down, and interpreted these as signs of a preemptive attack from 2chan. Korean appeared on 2chan's Korean threads as well, however Japanese did not appear on 2chan's Korean galleries. In a few minutes, the DC Inside servers returned to their usual speeds. On February 26, attacks were carried out on 2chan's Yaoi forum. During the Figure Skating Short Program of the Vancouver Olympics that took place a few days before the attack, Yuna Kim took the lead over Mao Asada by meagre 5 points and won the gold medal. 2channers suggested that Yuna Kim won the gold medal through bribery. However, whether this attack really originated from Korean users is unclear because the vandalism that appeared on 2chan's website did not contain any Korean but only English phrases such as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Korean.‚Äù On February 28, a committee of 2channers scheduled two rounds of attacks on DC Inside at 8 PM and 9 PM within 30 minute windows. These attacks proved to be ineffective. The upcoming cyber war began attracting attention from the press. 1 PM on March 1, the TAA began the attack in two teams ‚Äì one team vandalized the website, the other team carried out a DDoS attack. 1:03 PM, only three minutes after the initiation of the attack, 2chan's VIP gallery was paralyzed. 1:13 PM, five servers were paralyzed. 1:16 PM, the main channel's login requests started to get effected. 1:22 PM, all but two of the thirty-three 2chan servers were all paralyzed. 1:44 PM, the entire server was down. 2:13 PM, 2chan's main page was hacked and replaced with a page containing the Korean flag. 2:43 PM, naver.com blocked Japanese IPs. 3:35 PM, 2chan blocked Korean IPs, however the servers were not yet restored. A Korean student in Japan spied on the Japanese plans for retribution. At 6 PM, it was discovered that a website had plans for attacking the Blue House website. However, some Koreans who disliked Lee Myung Bak (Korean President at the time of the attack) participated in this attack. The Blue House shortly blocked Japanese IPs. 6:11 PM, VANK homepage started receiving attacks and was paralyzed for about 1 hour but was soon restored. It has been rumored that some of VANK's routers exploded from the attack. 6:38 PM, attacks on Comedy Program Gallery began, but the attacks were deflected in four minutes. 8:43 PM, organizers from 2chan declared the end of the attacks. 9:35 PM, 2chan had been effectively downed for 8 hours, and MBC reported on the outcome. Around 6 PM of the following day, the servers began to restore (At 8 PM, most of the servers were running normally). At 7 PM, another attack on VANK was made without success, and prompted a retribution attack from TAA, downing the control server of 2chan. Around 8 PM, attacks were again initiated by 2ch, but failed. 10 PM, VANK blocked all Japanese IPs. On March 5, 2ch provisionally suspended attacks and promised to strike on August 15. On August 15, the attacks were announced but the day passed by without offense from either side. A Korean gaming portal was downed this day but it was confirmed this was not an attack from Japan. A lot of fingers were pointed, including at China, at business establishments, and some speculated that it was an inside job by DC Inside. The Japanese Wiki article on this topic claims that VANK had a main role in this attack.  Outcome  Connecting to 2chan was impossible in the morning of March 1 until the evening of March 2nd when the attacks shrank and a portion of the servers partially recovered. The next day, about a third of the servers were restored, and by the evening all but the Dubai server were completely restored. The Dubai server was never completely restored due to damage, and according to 2chan administrators, the recovery of data on the Dubai server was difficult and it was stated that the gallery would be opening on a different server. The webpages of VANK and the Blue House were slowed down due to the attacks. There were reports that routers at VANK exploded, however, VANK had merely blocked Japanese IPs.  Reactions and Responses  * Pacific Internet Exchange, the managing company of 2chan's servers, declared on March 2 that they were preparing to investigate this event as a cyber-terrorism attack in collaboration with USA's Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), by collecting and analyzing data related to this attack. However, the investigation was not actually carried out. This cyberwarfare collaterally impacted some US agencies. Management of Big- server.com stated that a German who enforced cyberattacks was arrested in the US and sentenced to two years. However, it was later confirmed that this scenario was fantasized by 2chan users, and a US journalist had picked up on this and published an article without checking the details. Because the FBI investigates activity that occurs within the United States, it is unlikely that they have actually investigated this cyberwar. CIA, on the other hand, may investigate this cyberwar in collaboration with South Korean or Japanese intelligence agencies, police forces, etc., with the approval of ministries on both ends (Japan has no official collective intelligence agency, instead there are intelligence clusters such as the Chief Cabinet Secretary's intelligence investigators, the Ministry of Justice's Public Inspection Agency, National Police Agency Security Bureau, and the Defense Agency).2„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„Å≠„ÇãÊîªÊíÉ„ÅßÁ±≥‰ºÅÊ•≠„ÅåFBI„Å®Ê≥ïÁöÑÊé™ÁΩÆÊ§úË®é ÊêçÂÆ≥2ÂÑÑ2ÂçÉ‰∏áÂÜÜ Áî£ÁµåÊñ∞ËÅû 2010.3.2Èñ≤Ë¶ß * The head of Voluntary Agency Network of Korea (VANK) stated, ‚ÄúJapan has hurt their own reputation in the eyes of the international society‚Äù, ‚ÄúInflicting F5 attacks is no different than what Japan did.

It was adapted by Margaret Turnbull from the 1912 play of the same name by David Belasco and Edward Locke. The film stars Blanche Sweet, Theodore Roberts, James Neill, Carlyle Blackwell, Jane Wolfe, and Gertrude Kellar. The film was released on September 13, 1915, by Paramount Pictures. The film was later remade in 1921 under the same title. Plot Dorothy, victim of the influence that the hypnotist Balzamo has on her, the man who raised her, develops a second personality with a malevolent character named Becky. When Balzamo tries to win the girl, she runs away. Meanwhile, Dr. Emerson, a specialist in nerve diseases, encourages Dr. John Arnold to use his hypnotic powers to heal the sick and tells him that those powers are dangerous because his wife had been the victim of a hypnotist years earlier, who l 'had kidnapped. After the woman's death, all traces of her little girl had been lost. Dorothy, after her escape, looks for jobs to live on. But when she finds them, Becky's personality re-emerges and makes her lose them. When Dorothy becomes friends with Dr. Emerson's sister, she transforms into Becky and the doctor diagnoses her with a case of split personality. Arnold, who has fallen in love with Dorothy, is ready to \\"kill\\" Becky, but suddenly Balzamo reappears trying to regain control of the young woman. A mental struggle arises between Balzamo and Arnold which has the doctor as its winner: Balzamo is forced to confess that Dorothy is Emerson's daughter. Having lost his powers, Balzamo goes away. Dorothy is now free to love Arnold.

The foundation line of breeding stock was first imported from Italy into Canada in 1979, and into the United States in the early 1980s. Piedmontese cattle are distinguished by a unique, naturally occurring gene identified as the myostatin allele mutation, or inactive myostatin gene. Myostatin prohibits muscle growth whereas an inactive gene has the opposite effect. Purebred Piedmontese are homozygous, (2 copy), which means they have two identical alleles present for this unique gene. Research indicates the presence of the myostatin allele mutation produces morphological characteristics unique to the breed, such as double- muscling, beef tenderness, reduced fat content and high yield. According to the North American Piedmontese Association (NAPA), they are the first breed registry to base animal registration requirements on the presence of this specific gene which can be easily verified by DNA testing. Evolution and history North American Piedmontese cattle originated from a line of Italian purebred Piedmontese cattle, (Italian: Piemontese or razza bovina Piemontese), in the region of Piedmont in northwest Italy. They continue to be cultivated in Italy as a \\"dual-purpose animal...having very rich milk used for specialty cheese production and beef marketed as a premium product.\\" There is much speculation on the breed's evolution, but Italian professor Silvano Maletto theorizes based on evidence obtained from fossil records and cave writings that the breed descends from ancient Aurochs cattle and the Pakistan Zebu cattle. Reports of the first historical evidence for breeding Piedmontese cattle dates back only to the late 1800s, and credits the work of another Italian professor, Domenico Vallada. In 1979, the Piedmontese Breeding Co- operative, Ltd. of Saskatchewan, Canada (PBL Co-op of Canada) began preparations to import the first Piedmontese cattle into North America. There had been prior attempts at importation of the breed by the PBL Co-op of Canada and other cattle breeders, but the Italian Association was reluctant to sell any of their purebred breeding stock. Health protocols also created substantial levels of difficulty. The first successful importation occurred in the fall of 1979 with the arrival of five animals into Canada. Obtaining authorization and transfers to import the first five animals was the culmination of a half decade of effort, the cost of which is estimated at $100,000 per animal based on 2014 values. The following year, Canada received more Italian imports of Piedmontese cattle, including five more bulls. The next year, Italian imports arrived in the US, including three additional sire lines and two cows. It was from that genetic base that the North American breed of Piedmontese cattle began. In 1983, the Canadian Piedmontese Association (CPA) was formed, followed by the Piedmontese Association of the United States (PAUS) in 1984. By the 1990s, imports of semen and embryos were more substantial. Today there are several bloodlines available to cattle raisers in North America. Dakota 27P, Fullblood North American Piedmontese bull Genetics and crossbreeding Like the original Italian Piedmontese, North American Piedmontese cattle are distinguished genetically by the presence of the myostatin allele mutation which causes the breed's hypertrophic muscle growth, or \\"double muscling\\". According to an evaluation program at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, the birthing and survival rates of half-blood Piedmontese cattle were similar to Hereford x Angus cross calves, producing an average birth weight of 80.2 lbs. with 92.5% unassisted calving. The survival rate to weaning was 91.1%. Compared with normal breeds of beef cattle, North American Piedmontese cattle are more proficient in converting feed into lean muscle. They also produce a higher percentage of the most desirable cuts of meat. They average 20% more muscle with less bone and fat. Research indicates that there is less connective tissue within the muscle of \\"double-muscled\\" cattle; this would imply less background toughness and therefore more tender meat. Naturalean bull calf already showing desired double muscling Prevalence among United States cattle There are an estimated 28‚Äì30 million head of cattle currently in the United States. Of that total, nearly 70% of all beef cattle are derived from Angus cattle. Less than one-half of one percent are Piedmontese, or bred to Piedmontese cattle. As of 2014, the number of registered Piedmontese pure-blood breeding stock in the United States is estimated to be around 2,900 head. In the United States Piedmontese beef is regulated by the USDA, which requires that organisations involved in the sale of Piedmontese beef meet labeling and nutritional verification requirements. Characteristics The color of fullblood Piedmontese males is gray-white with a considerable amount of black hairs on the head, most notable around the eyes, neck, shoulders, and on the distal regions of the legs. They occasionally have dark stains or spots on their hind legs or lateral faces of the trunk. The cows are primarily white with varying shades of gray or light red. Calves are born a pale fawn color which changes to gray-white as they mature. Fullbloods are naturally horned, and have black pigmentation on the muzzle, eyelids, ears, tongue, tassel of the tail, anal opening, and on the outer skin of the sexual organs. The color of Naturalean composites or crossbred cattle can be solid black or solid red with black or reddish pigmentation in the same areas as the pigmentation on fullbloods. They may be horned or polled, and homozygous (2 copy), or heterozygous (1 copy). Fullbloods and Naturalean bulls are often crossed with traditional beef breeds like Black Angus or Hereford cattle because of substantial benefits in the crossbred results, including a higher protein meat that is lower in saturated fat, improved tenderness, and an approximate 7% yield increase in salable carcass. Calving problems are also reduced in the crossbreds. North American Piedmontese Association (NAPA) The North American Piedmontese Association (NAPA) was organized in September 2000, and is the official breed registry for North American Piedmontese cattle. It is a member-based, nonprofit breed registry headquartered in Washington, U.S., and the first cattle breed registry with mandatory registration requirements based on the presence of the Piedmontese-specific myostatin allele mutation. There are different categories of registration and recordation within the registry. Only homozygous animals (2 copy) can be registered, therefore breed true, and are eligible for registration in either the Fullblood (based on pedigree record), or Naturalean divisions. The Naturalean division is for Piedmontese cattle that are either crossbred or could have qualified for Fullblood registration but failed to meet the pedigree requirements, perhaps because of unregistered or unverified parentage. Prior to registration or recording, DNA testing is required to confirm the animal carries at least 1 copy of the Piedmontese-specific myostatin gene. Naturalean animals that are DNA tested heterozygous (1-copy) are not registered, rather they are issued a registration number with the prefix \\"recorded\\". The 0-copy (non-carriers) cattle are ineligible for registration in any category. According to the North American Piedmontese Cattle Association, in the last decade of the 20th century, there was a noticeable upsurge in the importation of genetic material (i.e., embryos and semen). Thus, it is said that \\"there are now a wealth of blood lines\\" available from which to choose.

His mother, Louisa Amelia, was the daughter of Henry Edward Fox and the granddaughter of Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland. Bunbury's brothers, Sir Charles and Sir Edward, had prominent careers of their own. At the age of 18, Bunbury was commissioned as an ensign in the 43rd Regiment of Foot. He was promoted lieutenant in 1833 and transferred to the 21st Regiment of Foot. Bunbury was then sent out to Australia, stationed in New South Wales from 1834 to 1835, Van Diemen's Land from 1835 to 1836, and Western Australia from 1836 to 1837. In New South Wales, he served as aide-de-camp to Sir Richard Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales. Colony of Western Australia Bunbury arrived in the Colony of Western Australia in March 1836, and was sent by Governor James Stirling to explore the districts around Williams and Busselton and establish outposts. He kept a detailed diary, which provides valuable information about pre-settlement Aboriginal customs. One of the townships that Stirling had him establish was named Bunbury in his honour, and is now Western Australia's third-largest city.\\"Chronology of Western Australian Aboriginal History\\" (1993, Gaia Foundation of Western Australia)John Connor, The Australian Frontier Wars, 1788‚Äì1838, UNSW Press, 2002 p.83:'Lieutenant Henry Bunbury was sent from Perth with orders 'to make war upon the natives'. South Africa and India Leaving Western Australia in November 1837, Bunbury went to South Africa, where he was aide-de-camp to the Governor of the Cape Colony, Sir George Napier. He married Napier's daughter Cecilia in November 1852, and they had four children together. Bunbury served on the North-West Frontier of India and in the Crimean War before retiring in 1862.

Manuscript format  Even with desktop publishing making it possible for writers to prepare text that appears professionally typeset, many publishers still require authors to submit manuscripts formatted according to their respective guidelines. Manuscript formatting varies greatly depending on the type of work, as well as the particular publisher, editor or producer. Writers who intend to submit a manuscript should determine what the relevant writing standards are, and follow them. Although publishers‚Äô guidelines for formatting are the most critical resource for authors, style guides are also key references since \\"virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication.\\" Nonetheless, individual publishers' standards always take precedence over style guides.

The palace, also known as Castello di Merate was built initially by Archbishop Ariberto d'Intimiano as a moated castle, but destroyed in 1275 during the civil wars involving Visconti and Della Torre. The castle was inherited by the Monastery of San Dionigi of Milan.Ville e castelli d'Italia: Lombardia e laghi, second edition, by Luca Beltrami, Editors of Tecnografica, Milan, (1907), page 321-324. In the 1700s, the present palace was built by the abbot Ercole Visconti. A sober urban facade (1740) and walls of brick were intended to be flanked by four towers, but only one was built. The imposing tower was later topped with Neo- renaissance style loggia. By 1810, the palace was bought by the Prinetti family. Giulio Prinetti, twice Minister of the Kingdom of Italy, modified the structure adding painted wooden ceilings. The site contains an 18th-century chapel-church dedicated to St Dionigi. In 1946, the palace was acquired by the parish, and is now mostly used for meetings and concerts.Pro Loco Merate website, information on palace.

Serling novel of the same name. It aired on the ABC Movie of the Week. Plot With diplomatic tensions building and the United States facing a possible military confrontation with China, Air Force One mysteriously crashes in the desert while heading to California, with President Jeremy Haines on board. While the crash is being investigated and with the president's fate yet uncertain, Vice President Kermit Madigan becomes acting president. Unfortunately, Haines had left him uninformed of current foreign policies. Madigan must now rely on Haines' Cabinet and aides to fill him in on information he lacks, while the aides attempt to further their own agendas. National Security Advisor George Oldenburg claims that Haines was preparing to go to war if the Chinese did not back down, while career diplomat Secretary of state Freeman Sharkey asserts that Haines was pursuing a peaceful solution to the problem with China. Madigan's wife, Hester, sees this as an opportunity to advance his career, but the Washington political community doubts his competence. In dealing with growing tensions and conflicting advice, Madigan struggles to avoid a nuclear war with China. Meanwhile, it turns out that President Haines was not aboard the crashed plane after all.

His contributions to autogenic training, and collaboration over several decades with JH Schultz, its founder, sometimes result in Luthe being credited as one of the originators of the method. Luthe's writing and training courses championed the method as a therapeutic modality in several diseases. Early career Luthe was born in 1922 in Lubeck. He received his M.D. degree in Hamburg in 1947. As a junior trainee, he met JH Schultz, who was the founder of autogenic training (AT), a system of self-hypnosis, which was confined to Germany and Austria before and during World War Two. Luthe was impressed by the effects of AT in asthma and became Schultz's prot√©g√©. Their collaboration continued throughout Schultz's lifetime, despite Luthe emigrating to Canada in the late 1940s. He was in clinical practice in Montreal. As a member of the International Institute of Stress, founded by Hans Selye, he demonstrated the stress-reduction effects of autogenic exercises. He taught at both l¬¥Universit√© de Montreal and McGill University, including the psychology and the psychiatry postgraduate training programs. Writing His first book, Autogenic Training: A Psychophysiologic Approach in Psychotherapy, jointly authored with Schultz, appeared in 1959. This was based on Schulz's 1932 book, and its subsequent updates, available only in German. It was the first book- length presentation of autogenic training in English. A six-volume series, Autogenic Therapy followed; the first three volumes were coauthored with Schultz; the last three were written independently following Schultz's death. His numerous publications included journal articles and a training manual. Other In Luthe's view, social conditioning interferes with what the body and mind do naturally when in distress; off-loading exercises enhance the autogenic process by using body and mind awareness to acknowledge and accept, and then to manage emotional release safely and constructively. Accordingly, natural homeostatic mechanisms regulate not only physiological processes, for example fluid and electrolyte balance and temperature, but functional disorders of a cognitive or emotional nature. He considered autogenic techniques a means of stimulating and better applying the natural homeostatic mechanisms of the brain. He contributed a number of innovations of his own to autogenic therapy, such as techniques of autogenic neutralization, autogenic abreaction, autogenic verbalization, and intentional off-loading exercises. He encouraged autogenic training as a therapeutic modality in several diseases. In 1961, he described the therapeutic significance of ‚Äúautogenic discharges‚Äù, which had been considered to be mere ‚Äútraining symptoms‚Äù or side effects of basic autogenic training. He assisted in the formation of the International Committee for Autogenic Training and Therapy (ICAT). His training center at Lac du Deux Montagnes, near Montreal, attracted international students like Malcolm Carruthers, founder of the British Autogenic Society, and Jos√© Luis Gonz√°lez de Rivera, founder of the Asociacion Espa√±ola de Psicoterapia. He frequently visited Japan, where he was scientific director of the Oskar Vogt Institute and visiting professor at the Kyushu University School of Medicine and Hospital. Late career In the 1970s, he worked on methods to mobilize individual creativity, as described in his 1976 book, Creativity Mobilization Technique. In 1979, Luthe moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. He continued clinical work and writing, and was associated with Simon Fraser University. He was involved in the application of autogenic methods to competitive athletics. At the time of his death, he was preparing a German edition of Autogenic Therapy, as well as writing a biography of Oskar Vogt, the Berlin neurologist and brain researcher, who, around the turn of the 20th century, had made observations on autohypnosis that were pivotal in Schultz's formulation of the autogenic standard exercises.

Agnew was born at Trenton, New Jersey on January 5, 1809, and was of Irish/Welsh heritage. His father was a Princeton-educated doctor; his mother was part of the Howell family that was prominent in New Jersey affairs of that era. The family moved to Pittsburgh, when Agnew was about four years old. Agnew grew up there, attended the University of Pittsburgh (then known as the Western University of Pennsylvania), and then studied law with two experienced attorneys. He was admitted to the bar in 1829, at age 20 and began practicing law.The Beaver Times, March 10, 1902, pg. 1 He soon relocated his legal practice about 35 miles north, to the town of Beaver, Pennsylvania, the county seat of Beaver County. He became an expert on land titles, an important topic in western Pennsylvania at that time. In his retirement he used this expertise to write a book on the subject, published in 1887 and entitled: A History of the Region of Pennsylvania North of the Ohio and West of the Allegheny River, of the Indian Purchases, and the Running of the Southern, Northern and Western Boundaries.Fishman, Historical Sketch In 1831, he married Elizabeth Moore, daughter of Robert Moore, a prominent citizen and politician in Beaver.Firestone, The Saints At Rest In 1836, he was chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of Pennsylvania. In 1851, he was appointed to fill a vacancy as President Judge of a four-county district. Within a few months, he was elected to a full ten-year term for that position; in 1861, he was elected to a second ten-year term. In 1863, he attracted statewide attention for a speech that he gave with the title Our National Constitution: Its Adaptation to a State of War or Insurrection. Subsequently, he was nominated in 1864 to run for a seat as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Running on a Republican ticket that also included the popular Republican governor Andrew Curtin, Agnew defeated the incumbent, then-Chief Justice Walter H. Lowrie. In 1873, he became the Chief Justice. His service on the Court included writing the opinion in the case of Commonwealth v. Drum, which is often cited as the foundation authority on the legal definition of murder in Pennsylvania.Commonwealth v. Bolish At the conclusion of his term in 1879, Agnew retired to his home in Beaver and from that point handled only a very few select legal matters. He occupied his time by writing a number of pamphlets devoted to the history of the Beaver area.A Brief History of Early Beaver County His health began to decline around 1899 and he died on March 9, 1902. He was survived by two sons and two daughters.

The light will win anyhow\\". In December 1996, ƒÄdamsons left his loaded firearm hidden under a stack of paper during a meeting in the Latvian Parliament. This led to a permanent ban on handguns in the building. Prior to his political career, ƒÄdamsons was chief of the Latvian Navy Headquarters, then a sea captain in the Latvian Border Guard Brigade. He was released from active duty on 25 November 1994. He was then appointed as Interior Minister in early 1995 after a large number of prisoners escaped, and Girts Kristovskis resigned. Latvian Way In June 1995, ƒÄdamsons' name was submitted by the Latvian Way party as a potential deputy in the general elections. During the campaign, it was suggested that he was not legally discharged from military service, and as such was ineligible to stand as a party candidate. As ƒÄdamsons had submitted his nomination to the Central Election Committee himself, there was no party oversight to ensure no mistakes had been made. The allegations were dismissed by then Prime Minister MƒÅris Gailis as being made in bad-faith by those affected by ƒÄdamsons' work fighting crime. The Latvian Central Electoral Committee also dismissed the allegations saying that there was no reason to investigate, as they had no evidence ƒÄdamsons was still in the military. The claims were originally published by the Baltic News Service, and no other evidence was offered. In October 1995, the Latvian Way party won 14.6% of the votes in the general election, giving them 17 mandates in the Saeima, of which ƒÄdamsons was one. He was removed as Interior Minister, and instead became an acting member of parliament. Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party On 25 September 1996 ƒÄdamsons resigned from the Latvian Way party, and a month later joined the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party. Party insiders acknowledged that he had wanted to leave for some time, ƒÄdamsons cited his opposition to Andris ≈†ƒ∑ƒìle as the main reason for leaving. He voted against ≈†ƒ∑ƒìle in December 1995, which had put him at odds with his former party. His joining the party meant that it officially had representation in parliament, and his new position gave him automatic membership of the LSDSP Central Committee. In 1997 ƒÄdamsons served as the head of the communications committee at the Baltic Assembly. In October of the same year he was elected to be Chairman of the LSDW. Accusations against Andris ≈†ƒ∑ƒìle Throughout late 1995 to early 1996, ƒÄdamsons accused then Prime Minister Andris ≈†ƒ∑ƒìle of provoking unrest with border and custom officials by deliberately and illegally sending through fake smugglers. He also accused Andris of embezzling 'foreign credits', and of deliberately bankrupting state-run industries in the interest of privatizing the personally profiting from them. ƒÄdamsons was himself investigated to see whether or not this constituted slander. The Prosecutor General's office declined to prosecute either, finding no illegalities in their past behaviour. On 15 July 1996, ƒÄdamsons went on television once again to accuse ≈†ƒ∑ƒìle of corruption, but also inferred that masons were partially responsible for the internal unrest in the government. By February 1997 ƒÄdamsons was calling for an early election and characterized ≈†ƒ∑ƒìle's government as an authoritarian regime from which Latvia should be saved. In 2000 ƒÄdamsons,. who was assisting with a 12 year long investigation into the matter, publicly named ≈†ƒ∑ƒìle as a member of a ring of pedophiles selling young boys for sex. He defended naming ≈†ƒ∑ƒìle as a necessary action stating that he was \\"at the end of [his] rope...it was the only way to break the circle.\\" Removal from Parliament and appeal In 2000, ƒÄdamsons was removed from Parliament after evidence surfaced that he had previously worked in collaboration with the KGB. An investigation ruled that as a member of the coast guard during soviet rule, he was subservient to the agency. In October 2006 the European Court of Human Rights reviewed a petition by ƒÄdamsons to overturn his removal on the grounds that over 40,000 men worked for the border guards but he, specifically, was targeted for removal, when men like Janis Zascirinskis were allowed to stay in politics.

It represented shipwrights and boatbuilders in the shipbuilding and ship repair industries, as well as sea-going shipwrights aboard vessels in the merchant navy. History Shipwrights were one of the first craft groups to be organised after the settlement of Australia, with the Shipwrights United Friends Society formed in 1829 to represent shipwrights in Sydney (then part of the Colony of New South Wales). Other unions were soon formed in the other colonies, including the Port Phillip Shipwrights Society, the Port Adelaide Shipwrights Society and the Brisbane Shipwrights Provident Union, while the Sydney union was renamed the Shipwrights Provident Union of New South Wales. After federation these small, local unions amalgamated to form a national organisation, which was registered federally in January 1916 as the Federated Shipwrights of Australia. Just a few months later, in September 1916, it changed to the Federated Shipwrights' Ship Constructors' & Boat Builders' Association of Australia. By the end of 1917, in what was a tumultuous period, the union had changed again, this time to the Federated Shipwrights Ship Constructors Naval Architects Ships Draughtsmen and Boat Builders of Australia. The union operated under this name until 1933 when it succumbed to a further name change: the Federated Shipwrights‚Äô & Ship Constructors‚Äô Association of Australia. The union published a journal titled Slipway. Operating until December 1976, the Federated Shipwrights‚Äô & Ship Constructors‚Äô Association amalgamated with the Amalgamated Metal Workers‚Äô Union to form the Amalgamated Metal Workers‚Äô & Shipwrights‚Äô Union. At the time of the merger 247 of the approximately 1,500 members of the Shipwrights Association were employed as sea-going shipwrights (also known as ship's carpenters). As the various maritime unions objected to the AMWU expanding its coverage to ships' crews, these members were instead transferred to the Merchant Service Guild (later renamed the Australian Maritime Officers Union), with the transfer completed by 1978.

Patanjali terms manana as dharana, the unshakeable mental conviction. In Advaita Vedanta, manana, the deep reflection on what is heard from the teacher, is a part of the three-fold process of shravana-manana-nididhyasana, the three stages of religious life which combined acting as the path of knowledge, lead to the attainment of moksha. According to the Pasupatas belonging to the cult of Shiva, manana is a satmaka or mastery over the power of seeing and acting; manana is the supernormal knowing of objects of thoughts. Manana means ‚Äì 'thinking', 'reflection', 'meditation', 'cogitation'; Panchadasi (Sloka I.53) reads as follows:- :‡§á‡§§‡•ç‡§•‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§®‡•Å‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡§£‡§Ç ‡§≠‡§µ‡•á‡§§‡•ç :‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡•Å‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•Å ‡§§‡§§‡•ç |:\\"The finding out or discovery of the true significance of the identity of the individual self and the supreme Universal Self with the great sayings is what is known as shravana; and to arrive at the possibility of its validity through logical reasoning is what is called manana.\\" In this context, Vidyaranya had previously stated that the Self is untouched by doubts about the presence or absence of associates etc; that are superimposed on it phenomenally. In the afore-cited sloka, Swami Swahananda in his commentary explains that whatever be the relation between two vikalpas ('alternatives'), relation itself has to be understood which even though not an attribute is to be related, for the domain of bheda ('difference') is riddled with contradictions. Vedanta considers vikalpa as kalpana or 'contrary imagination' that invariably leads to anavastha ('infinite regress'). The identity alluded to by the great sayings (mahavakyas) conveyed by a Guru to his disciples i.e. sown in the mind of his sisya, have logical support for their validity which support is revealed through manana which process reveals true knowledge. It is through deep meditation that the knowledge of Brahman is gained, and Katha Upanishad (I.iii.15) declares that one becomes free from the jaws of death by knowing that which is ever constant; Badarayana states that what is mentioned in that Upanishad is meant for deep meditation on Purusha - ‡§Ü‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ú‡§®‡§æ‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç (Brahma Sutras III.iii.14), during which process the differing attributes are not to be combined but only non-different attributes which exist collectively in all the contexts.

Function  The Town Planning Board designates and prepares new draft zoning plans, considers proposed layout plans under Comprehensive Development Area zoning, exhibits draft plans for public comment, considers applications for planning permission, and submits draft plans for approval by the Chief Executive in Council. The Planning Department is the executive arm of the Town Planning Board. It creates plans on behalf of the TPB, provides technical services and enforces zoning restrictions.  Composition  * Chairman * Vice-chairman * 5 other official members * 28 non-official members Members are appointed by the Chief Executive for a tenure of 1-2 years. They serve on either the Metro Planning Committee (MPC) concerning Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and Tsuen Wan, or the Rural and New Town Planning Committee (RNTPC), covering the New Territories excluding Tsuen Wan.  Plans and zones   Outline Zoning Plan (OZP)  Outline Zoning Plans are the standard zoning maps adopted for different areas of the city. Land within these maps is divided into different zones denoting different land uses, like Residential, Commercial, or Industrial. A zoning like \\"Residential\\" can be broken down into different subtypes, to accommodate different types or intensity of residential development. The function of each zone is to specify which land uses may be permitted on the site. Some zones prohibit development in order to provide open space, or to conserve environmental features and heritage assets. Each zone is accompanied by a set of \\"notes\\". The main feature of the notes is a table is drawn up with two columns. \\"Column 1\\" will specify land uses which are always permitted in that particular type of zone, while \\"Column 2\\" lists uses which might be permitted in that zone upon application and approval from the Town Planning Board. The notes can also include a set of \\"remarks\\" elucidating any additional restrictions, i.e. the maximum plot ratio or building height permitted.  Development Permission Area (DPA)  A Development Permission Area (DPA) plan is a provisional type of plan drawn up, mainly in rural areas, as a temporary measure before a formal OZP is adopted there. They normally expire after three years, and the TPB must prepare an OZP in advance of that date.  Comprehensive Development Area (CDA)  Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) is a special type of zone introduced to simplify the process of developing large-scale projects. Under this zoning, no uses are permitted as-of-right. In other words, there are no \\"Column 1\\" permitted uses as other typical land use zones. Instead, the applicant prepares a master layout plan and submits it for consideration by the Town Planning Board, who can approve or reject it. CDA zoning is used for large sites, like obsolete government properties, sites on railway property, or when numerous older properties are slated for urban renewal. Often such projects are proposed by large real estate conglomerates (like Cheung Kong or Sun Hung Kai) who have the capital to bid on such huge sites, the MTR Corporation, or the Urban Renewal Authority. CDA zoning is based upon the premise that comprehensive development is necessarily better than piecemeal redevelopment. This precept has been called into question as the scale of CDA development has resulted in some examples of poor urban design, for example: poor relationship to urban context, closure of established streets and the transference of the public realm into insular, privately owned shopping centres.

It was designed by Richard Gailey and built in 1888 by Smith and Ball. It was renovated in 1925 to a design by Richard Gailey, Junior. It was further renovated in 1937 to incorporate apartments designed by Hall and Phillips. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This three- storeyed, rendered brick hotel was erected in 1888 for Nathaniel Corrigan. It replaced an earlier Empire (Family) Hotel (1865) which had been bought by Corrigan on 19 June 1871 for . The new hotel was designed by prominent architect Richard Gailey who also designed the nearby Prince Consort Hotel, Wickham Hotel and Jubilee Hotel. The construction of these hotels in the late 1880s reflected the confidence of the period and development that occurred in Fortitude Valley. The Empire was constructed by Smith and Ball Contractors and the first publican was Walter McFarlane. The hotel extended along Ann Street and along Brunswick Street, and contained over sixty rooms. In February 1923, following the death of Nathaniel Corrigan, the hotel and adjoining buildings were sold to Messrs Perkins & Co (brewers) for about . Empire Hotel, circa 1934 The hotel was renovated in 1925 to plans by Richard Gailey Jnr and again in 1937 to plans by architects Hall and Phillips. This latter work involved converting part of the Ann Street section to the \\"Empire Apartments\\". These apartments were later demolished in the 1960s, reducing the Ann Street frontage from seven bays to three. The original convex iron and post awning has been replaced by one with a cantilevered design.  Description  A rendered building constructed of brick and stone, the Empire Hotel is located at a prominent intersection in Fortitude Valley. It consists of a main three storeyed L-shaped structure with basement, a two storeyed section on the south-western end facing Brunswick Street, a one storeyed skillion roofed section adjoining the rear of the main building, and a detached one-storeyed rendered masonry toilet block, also at the rear. The Brunswick Street elevation comprises six bays and the Ann Street elevation contains three bays. A cantilevered awning extends along the two street frontages which are tiled at ground level. Above the awning are two levels of projecting verandahs. These highly ornate verandahs are supported by twin cast-iron columns and feature timber handrails, cast-iron balustrades and brackets and a timber and cast-iron frieze at the junction between the first and second levels. French doors open onto the verandah which is roofed with rolled corrugated iron. Painted corrugated iron hip roofs are concealed on the street elevations by an ornate masonry parapet wall. Supported on shallow twin brackets, the parapet consists of masonry balusters and pillars at the junction of each bay topped by urns. A projecting pediment in the Brunswick Street facade which breaks the line of the parapet is flanked by interlocking circles, instead of balusters. The ground floor contains a bottle shop entered from the street corner, a public bar with entry from Brunswick Street, an entry foyer also opening off Brunswick Street, a lounge bar and bistro and a loading bay. There are remnants of art deco plaster work throughout. The entry foyer, now in the art deco manner, features decorative plaster ceilings, patterned floors, tiled walls, timber doors with etched glass panels, and a 1930s lift. The original 1889 staircase has been refurbished with metal balustrade and tiled walls to the first floor level but retains its original timber joinery and balustrade between the first and second floor. Two arched windows, the lower one being leadlight, illuminate the stairwell. A lounge, dining room, kitchen, private bar and staff rooms are located on the first floor. These rooms have ornate plaster cornices and ceilings. The lounge and dining rooms have timber parquetry floors and coloured leadlight windows in distinctive art deco patterns. On the second floor bedrooms and bathrooms are linked by a central corridor. Much of the fabric dates from 1889 including doors, architraves and skirtings, plasters arches over the hallway and main stairwell. A second staircase, with original timber panelling and balustrades, links the first and second floors at the south-western end of the Anne Street elevation. Despite the demolition of part of the Ann street wing, the Empire Hotel is a large and impressive building. The street facades are intact above awning level and internally much of the original fabric remains along with evidence of major refurbishments.

Description The creek's steep catchment area of 3.3 km2, with headwaters at the 1720 m elevation, 300 m southeast of the summit of Brunswick Mountain. Diorite cliffs flank the course of the creek, between the 900m and 1200 m elevation, with the rocks of the basin part of the Gambier Group. Much of the creek's course is a bedrock canyon, with talus and rockslide debris notable in its upper course, especially on the south side. Prior to the washout of 1981, there had been no debris fan on the waterfront, afterwards the resulting debris fan was 14,100 sq m. The creek's basin was logged in the period 1957 to 1968, via a logging road via Magnesia Creek, with 38% of the creek's basin having been logged.Debris supply to torrent-prone channels on the east side of Howe Sound, Bruce Ronald Dagg, UBC Master's thesis, 1981, p. 71 M Creek disaster In the early hours of 28 October 1981,Debris supply to torrent-prone channels on the east side of Howe Sound, Bruce Ronald Dagg, UBC Master's thesis, 1981, p. 74 following heavy rains, a debris torrent swept away the small timber bridge on British Columbia Highway 99.

The incident led to the highway's sobriquet, conferred by the Vancouver Province, the \\"Highway of Death\\" (aka \\"Killer Highway\\"). Of the nine victims, one whose body had been recovered from Howe Sound had not gone off the M Creek bridge, but that of Strachan Creek, which was among the many others destroyed by debris torrents that night.A Look Back In Time: Fifteen years ago this week, Mary Billy, Squamish Chief newspaper, Squamish Library archives, 17 December 1996 The debris torrent was estimated at 20,000 cubic metres, composed of logs and rock, which emerged from the creek's canyon just above the highway bridge, knocking out the creek's central trestle-span.Debris supply to torrent-prone channels on the east side of Howe Sound, Bruce Ronald Dagg, UBC Master's thesis, 1981, p. 74 The term M Creek disaster became used to refer to all the washouts and flooding from that same evening. Thousands of tourists were stranded at Whistler until the highway was reopened. and led to community discussions and agitation to open a \\"back door\\" for Whistler, as many tourists had been stranded by the washouts, with deliberations over the various alternate routes east and south from there ending with the selection of the Duffey Lake Road as the formal extension of Highway 99, which had hitherto ended at Pemberton. Aftermath The same period of rains incurred multiple washouts on the highway between Lions Bay and Pemberton, including several within the Resort Municipality of Whistler, plus the erosion of sand footings for the Culliton Creek bridge in the Cheakamus Canyon/Brohm Ridge stretch of the highway between Brackendale and the abandoned Garibaldi townsite at Rubble Creek. The disaster led to the commissioning of a study on the extent of torrent hazards on the highway, published in 1983 by Thurber Consultants, examining 23 creeks between Horseshoe Bay and Britannia Beach, and on their debris fans on the shoreline, some of which were developed and at risk.Debris supply to torrent-prone channels on the east side of Howe Sound, Bruce Ronald Dagg, UBC Master's thesis, 1981, p. 13 A coroner's jury recommended a series of measures to deal with highway safety, including warning lights at bridges where washouts may occur (this was never acted on), and 11 bridges along the route were replaced with structures with no support spans that might wash out in further debris torrents. Three concrete \\"debris torrent basins\\" were constructed on the upper reaches of Charles, Harvey and Magnesia Creeks to avert similar disasters emerging from those basins.Renewed calls for bridge warning system, Alison Taylor, Pique Newsmagazine, Oct 24, 2003 The location today was extensively rebuilt since the disaster, with the creek now bridged by freeway and a concrete structure, as with other hazards along the highway over the years since.

Southern Pacific 2353 is on static display in Campo, California's Pacific Southwest Railway Museum. Southern Pacific 2355 still sits where it was left in Pioneer Park. It was not relocated. The locomotive and tender have undergone a complete cosmetic restoration. Asbestos material and lead-based paint have been removed. Its paint was stripped completely using an environmentally-friendly blasting material. Polyurethane paint was applied and the train's electronics have been updated.

Two to four players take the roles of different adventurers, moving around a mysterious island, looking for hidden treasures as the island sinks around them. All players win if they find all the hidden treasures and they all make it back to the helicopter and fly away, and they all lose if they cannot. Rules and mechanics  Players take on the role of adventurers trying to retrieve treasures from a rapidly sinking island. They must retrieve four treasures: (The Earth Stone, the Crystal of Fire, the Statue of the Wind, and the Ocean Chalice) and return to the helicopter landing pad (\\"Fools Landing\\") before the waters rise covering the entire island. Each player takes on one of six available roles‚Äîeach with a unique skill: # Pilot: (Blue) - The pilot begins the game on Fools Landing. From there, the pilot has the ability to fly to any other available location on the island for one action. # Engineer: (Red) - The engineer begins the game on Bronze Gate. From there, the engineer has the ability to \\"shore up\\" (flip a tile from its blue side to its colored side) two adjacent tiles (including the tile the engineer is currently on) for one action. # Explorer: (Green) - The explorer begins the game on Copper Gate. From there, the explorer has the ability to move or \\"shore up\\" tiles diagonally for one action (in addition to moving or \\"shoring up\\" adjacent and current tiles). # Navigator: (Yellow) - The navigator begins the game on Gold Gate. From there, the navigator has the ability to move another player up to two adjacent tiles for one action. # Messenger: (Light Gray) - The messenger begins the game on Silver Gate. From there, the messenger has the ability to give treasure cards to other players (without having to be on the same space) for one action. # Diver: (Black) - The diver begins the game on Iron Gate. From there, the diver has the ability to swim through single or multiple flooded and/or sunken tiles for one action.  Set-up  At the beginning of the game, players randomly distribute the Island tiles to create a newly configured Island in the shape of a \\"4 x 4\\" square with an additional two tiles beyond each side of the square. The players select their roles (randomly or otherwise), and place their pieces on the board. Players then shuffle the blue \\"flood deck\\" and flip over the top six cards from the deck and place each in a discard pile. As each card from the flood deck is drawn, the player also flips or \\"floods\\" the card's corresponding tile. Next, players shuffle the orange \\"treasure deck\\" and deal two treasure cards to each player. If players are dealt a \\"Waters rise\\" card, place the card back in the treasure deck, reshuffle, and deal a new card to that player. Finally, players select a difficulty level by sliding the red arrow on the flood meter to the corresponding difficulty level: Novice, Normal, Elite, or Legendary. Players are now ready to begin.  Game play  Whoever most recently visited an island will take the first turn; play will then move clockwise. On each turn, a player may take up to three actions. Available actions (excluding each role's unique skill) include: # Moving to an adjacent tile - a player can move forward, backward, left, or right. (The Pilot, Explorer, Navigator, and Diver have additional movement skills). # Shoring up an adjacent tile (or the tile upon which the player currently resides) - a player can flip a tile from its blue side to its colored side. (The Engineer has additional shoring up skills). # Giving a treasure card to another player who is on the same tile - (all treasure cards are transferable; the Messenger has additional skills); or # Collecting a treasure - A player may collect one of the four treasures by being on one of its two respective tiles, and having the requisite four, matching treasure cards corresponding to the particular treasure. For example, in order to collect the Ocean Chalice, the player must be located on either the \\"Coral Palace\\" or \\"Tidal Palace\\" tile. Players may choose to skip their actions or take fewer than three actions. Once a player has taken their actions, the player draws two treasure cards from the treasure deck. Players may hold up to, but not more than, five treasure cards in their hands at a time. If the player has greater than five cards after drawing, the player must discard enough cards to ensure they have no more than five cards in their hand. After drawing the two treasure cards, the player must then flip over as many cards from the flood deck as the flood meter indicates. For example, if the red arrow on the flood meter is currently at \\"4,\\" the player must flip four flood cards. After each card is flipped, the player also flips the corresponding tile on the island from the colored side to the blue side. If the tile is already on the blue side when its corresponding flood card is flipped, the tile and the card are both removed for the remainder of the game, shrinking the island. If the players run out of cards in either deck, shuffle the corresponding discard pile and start the draw pile over.  \\"Waters Rise\\" and Other Cards  When drawing treasure cards, aside from the cards corresponding to each treasure, players may also draw three other distinct types of cards: Waters rise cards, Helicopter cards, and Sand Bag cards. # Waters Rise: If a player draws a waters rise card, place the waters rise card in the treasure deck discard pile. Next, move the flood meter arrow one level higher. Finally, take the discard pile from the flood deck, shuffle it, and place it on top of the flood deck. Once these three things are completed, draw the number of flood cards corresponding to the arrow's level on the flood meter, and continue play. # Helicopter Cards: Helicopter cards can be played at any time in the game. Helicopter cards do not count as an action. These cards allow the player to move one or more pawns to any other tile, if moving more than one pawn they must start on the same tile. You do not have to be on the same tile as the person you are moving. Players should know that in order to win the game, a helicopter card must be played to leave the island. To play a helicopter card, the player must place the helicopter card in the treasure deck's discard pile and immediately use the helicopter's effect. # Sand Bag Cards: Like helicopter cards, sand bag cards can be played at any time in the game. Sand bag cards immediately shore up one tile that is currently on its blue side. The player who plays a sand bag card need not be on or adjacent to the tile the sand bag shores up. To play a sand bag card, the player must place the sand bag card in the treasure deck's discard pile and immediately use the sand bag's effect.  Winning and losing the game  There are a number of ways to lose the game: # If the flood meter advances to the skull and crossbones logo, players lose the game. # If Fools Landing disappears before the end of the game, players lose the game. # If both tiles corresponding to a particular treasure disappear prior to players collecting that treasure, players lose the game. # If the entire island disappears, players lose the game. Players do not lose the game if they are standing on a tile that disappears. If this occurs, players must move to the nearest adjacent tile. However, if a tile a player is standing on disappears and there are no adjacent tiles, the game is lost. To win the game players must collect all four treasures, get all players to Fools Landing, and use a helicopter card to depart before any of the losing conditions occur. Board game sequel A sequel to Forbidden Island was released in 2013, titled Forbidden Desert. As the name implies, the game is situated in a desert and still employs many of the same mechanics as Forbidden Island. However, there is added difficulty as well as new and improved player roles and mechanics. An additional sequel was made in 2018, titled Forbidden Sky. This game, while again largely similar in mechanics as the two previous games, focused on manipulating circuitry to activate a rocket and escape a floating platform during a thunderstorm.

He was a member of the 1968 U.S. Olympic Track and Field Team, competing in the 10,000 meters. He was ranked multiple times by Track & Field News as the No. 1 U.S. 5,000- and 10,000-meter runner in the mid- to late ‚Äò60s, and was a six-time AAU National Champion from 1966 to 1973, winning outdoors in the 3-mile, 6-mile and 10,000 meters, and three times in the indoor 3-mile. He was a three-time world record holder in the indoor 3-mile.  High School and College  Smith was a champion miler in high school, winning the California State Meet at Edwards Stadium, Berkeley, June 1, 1963, in 4:14.4 for Arcadia High. He was also the nation's fastest prep two-miler that year, ahead of Jim Ryun, with a national-prep-record time of 9:11.6, and was the fourth-fastest miler, nationally, in 1963, with a time of 4:12.6. On July 4, 1963, University of Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman hosted an all-star high school mile race at Hayward Field, Eugene, OR, that was intended to pit Tracy Smith, the California state champion miler, against Dave Wilborn, Oregon‚Äôs state champion miler. But the race evolved into a wild duel between Smith and a then relatively unknown 17-year-old miler from Spokane, WA, Gerry Lindgren. Over the final half mile, Smith would repeatedly surge into the lead only to be countered by Lindgren each time. In a sprint to the finish, Smith made a desperate dive, while Lindgren leaned at the tape for a narrow win in 4:12.9. That race marked the beginning of a decade-long duel between two men who would become the best distance runners of their era. Smith graduated from Arcadia High in 1963 and attended Oregon State University, finishing sixth in the 3-mile at the 1965 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. The following season, he finished second to rival Lindgren, now of Washington State University, over a six-mile course in 29:11, at the 1966 NCAA Cross Country Championships, at Lawrence, KS, Nov. 21, 1966. He would withdraw from Oregon St. after the fall cross-country season because he found the coaches‚Äô training regimen stifling. He would later earn his degree in 1973 from Long Beach State University, where he briefly coached the men‚Äôs cross- country team. Smith burst onto the international running scene March 20, 1966, becoming the first American to ever medal in the International Cross Country Championships, finishing third that year on the 7.5-mile course at Rabat, Morocco, with a time of 36:32.2 , behind gold medalist Ben Assou El Ghazi of Morocco and silver medalist Derek Graham of Ireland.  World Records and AAU Championships  Smith was a three-time world record holder in the indoor 3-mile, first breaking the mark at the AAU Indoor Championships March 4, 1967, Oakland, CA, with a time of 13:16.2. He bettered his own indoor 3-mile world record, turning in a time of 13:15, March 1, 1968, at the Maple Leaf Games, Toronto. On Feb. 24, 1973, Smith, having come back from what many thought was a career-ending Achilles injury, and what he has often described as the highlight of his running career, thrilled a crowd of over 15,000 to once again break the world indoor 3-mile record at the AAU Indoor Championships at New York's Madison Square Garden in a time of 13:07.2. Smith was the AAU Indoor Track and Field Champion in the 3-mile in 1966, 1967 and 1973. He was the AAU Outdoor Track and Field Champion in the 6-mile in 1966, the 10,000-meters in 1968, and the 3-mile in 1969. He was the Track & Field News No. 1-ranked U.S. 5,000-meter runner in 1969, and its No.1-ranked U.S. 10,000-meter runner in 1966 and 1968.  Olympics  On June 30, 1968, Smith ran the 10,000 meters at the U.S. Olympic Trials prior to the Mexico City Games. In order to simulate the altitude of Mexico City, the 1968 Trials were held on a temporary, synthetic Tartan track, one of the first ever installed, amid granite boulders and 100-foot-high ponderosa pines (even in the track‚Äôs infield) at Echo Summit, CA, in the Sierra Nevada, south of Lake Tahoe. At an altitude of 7,377 feet -- nearly a mile-and-a-half high and 28-feet higher than the upcoming Mexico City Olympic venue -- the 1968 Trials were the highest-altitude, world- class track meet ever staged in the U.S. The thin oxygen at such an altitude presented significant problems for the Olympic hopefuls, especially distance runners in the 10,000-meter race. Smith ran most of the race in the lead, trying to press the pace. He faded badly, however, with just over a lap remaining before gathering himself for a sprint over the final 200 meters to win, notably, over 1964 Tokyo Olympics 10,000-meter gold medalist Billy Mills in a time of 30:00.4. Smith would go on to finish 11th in the 1968 Olympics with a time of 30:14.6. Smith, in a bid to make his second U.S. Olympic team, competed in the 5,000 meters on July 9, 1972, at the U.S. Olympic Trials, at the University of Oregon's Hayward Field in Eugene. Smith challenged hometown favorite Steve Prefontaine for most of the race until Prefontaine pulled away in dramatic fashion, setting an American record that would stand for 40 years with a time of 13:22.8. Smith finished fifth with a time of 13:44.8, failing by four seconds to qualify for his second Olympics.  International Track Association  From 1974 until its demise in 1976, Smith was a founding member of the upstart International Track Association, an organization that attempted to introduce professionalism to the sport by paying its athletes to compete in a series of track and field meets in a format similar to professional golf and tennis. This flew in the face of the AAU and the International Olympic Committee, which greeted the ITA with outright hostility, clinging to the timeworn Olympic credo that track and field athletes should be unpaid amateurs. The AAU immediately banned all ITA athletes and officials from participating in AAU-sanctioned meets. Likewise, ITA athletes received lifetime bans from Olympic participation. The AAU also pressured television networks from broadcasting ITA events. In addition to Smith, a number of world-class track and field stars had joined the ITA, including Bob Seagren, Lee Evans, Jim Ryun, Brian Oldfield, Kip Keino, Ben Jipcho and Marty Liquori. The ITA managed to stage over 51 meets during its existence, but its demise came shortly after the 1976 Montreal Olympics when most track and field athletes, intimidated by the AAU and the IOC, shied away from the ITA for fear of hurting their amateur status.  High School Coaching  Smith retired from international racing in the mid-'70s and settled in Bishop, CA, where he taught school and was an assistant track coach in charge of the boys and girls distance runners at Bishop Union High School. He helped mold the Bishop track teams into a regional powerhouse that won several team and individual Desert- Inyo League and CIF Southern Section Championships. Smith, a disciple of his 1968 Olympic coach Mih√°ly Igl√≥i, was an advocate of the intense interval-style training method that Igl√≥i had introduced to the track world in the ‚Äò60s, and deployed these methods with great success to train his high school runners. In 1994, he moved his family to Bend, OR, where he served as head coach of the Crook County High School (Prineville, OR) cross country and track teams, as well as a special education teacher. In 2017, he coached the Crook County High School boys cross-country team to the 4A state championship, the school‚Äôs first such title in 41 years. Smith was ecstatic for his runners after the team‚Äôs win, telling The Bulletin (Bend, OR), ‚ÄúOh, my gosh. What a great feeling. I haven‚Äôt had a feeling like this since running in my younger days. I had a pretty good feeling with individual titles every now and then, but whoa. This is amazing.‚Äù Smith has since retired, but has continued his lifelong love of running.

Family and early life Ephraim Kibbey was a descendant of Edward Kibbe (born 1597 or 1611, died November 1694), an early settler of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, who immigrated from England about 1639. Noted activities Ephraim enlisted in 1777 at Essex, New Jersey in the Continental Army. He endured the brutal winter of 1777-1778 at Valley Forge with George Washington under the command of Capt. Jacob Martin in General William Marshall's 4th New Jersey Regiment and was eventually assigned to Capt. Seth Johnson's company of the 3rd New Jersey Regiment under Col. Elias Dayton. Following the American Revolution, Kibbey spent time in the frontier of southwestern Pennsylvania before proceeding, with Benjamin Stites and several other pioneers, to settle the Symmes Purchase with the establishment of Columbia, Ohio, just upriver from the future location of Cincinnati, in 1788. All that remains today of this settlement is the Pioneer Memorial Cemetery, Cincinnati, including a large monument erected in 1879 dedicated \\"To the First Boat-Load.\\" Anthony Wayne and his Legion of the United States relied heavily on the famous forty (72) scouts led by then-Captain Kibbey in their fight against the Western Confederacy. The scouts were selected from among the finest frontiersmen and Indian fighters, and had several notable forays assisting the Legion in leading to victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. Kibbey was among the first settlers of Deerfield, now South Lebanon, Ohio about 1795 and participated in the defense of the new settlements and in surveying and cutting roads, notably the then-called Kibbey's Road, the first road across the state of Indiana to Vincennes, Indiana. He was later elected to the Legislature of the Northwest Territory in 1798 and 1802 and served from 1803 to 1804 in the 1st Ohio General Assembly. Ephraim died at Deerfield, now South Lebanon, Ohio, in 1809. Marriage and family Kibbey and his wife, Phebe Ann (Crane) (1758-1813), had 7 children: John Crane, Elisabeth, Joseph, Julia Ann, Jerusha, Ephraim, and Phebe.

The company manages an online marketplace website in which members buy and sell a variety of luxury goods. It was Hong Kong's first online marketplace to buy and sell luxury goods The site has over 15 categories, including real estate, watches, jewelry, luxury cars, yachts, aircraft, luxury handbags, art, collectibles, furniture, antiques and fine wines & spirits. As of March 2016, the website had over 22,000 listings from luxury dealers from all over the world, making a US$18.6 billion marketplace. Luxify also has offices in Singapore and London and local partners in Shanghai and Jakarta. History The company was founded in 2014 by Hong Kong-based businessmen Florian Martigny and Alexis Zirah to create a global marketplace specifically for luxury products. When the founders were looking to buy luxury products in Hong Kong, they were disappointed when they couldn't locate a reliable online resource, where people could trade items. Realising that most luxury purchases, especially in Asia, were influenced by online touchpoints, they decided to create an online marketplace for new and used luxury products with the aim of creating more liquidity and transparency in the luxury market. They officially launched their website Luxify.com in 2014. Luxify received its angel funding round from private investors located in Asia and Europe to continue its global expansion. Luxify was named one of Asia's most promising internet companies in 2015. The company also partners with luxury goods companies to widen their market and reach. In June 2015, Luxify partnered with Landscope Christie‚Äôs International Real Estate to offer consultative service for clients who wish to purchase the finest overseas vineyard properties. Also, seeing Philippines as being one of the greatest economic growth countries in Asia, Luxify teamed up with Salcedo Auctions, which is the only auction house in the Philippines to specialise in the sale of fine art, jewelry, decorative arts and collective accessories, to promote its upcoming Collector‚Äôs Sale auction. In October the same year, Luxify partnered with Zachy Wine Auction for its final auction of the Fall 2015 Hong Kong season to showcase collections of some of the finest wines and spirits. Notable listings Apart from listing famous brand items like supercars and classic cars from Rolls Royce, Ferrari and Porsche; and classic watches from Hublot and Rolex; Luxify also has notable and special listings: * August 2016: one of the most complete and highest-quality tyrannosaurus rex skulls - \\"Rees Rex\\" was listed on Luxify, for at least $1.8 million US dollars. Separately, a mounted triceratops prorsus skeleton, with a reserve of around $790,000 US dollars; and a mounted tyrannosaurus rex skeleton priced at $2.39 million; were also listed. The fossils were discovered by Theropoda Expeditions, a private American dinosaur fossil exploration firm, in 2015. * December 2015: The former home of famous pop star Michael Jackson, Neverland, was listed on Luxify after it was on the market for sale for six months and failed to attract local buyers. It was listed on Luxify for around US$100 million dollars with the aim of targeting Asia's super wealthy. * December 2015: Michael Jordan‚Äôs estate in Highland Park was also listed on Luxify.

It was founded in 1959 by Harry Barberian (1930-2001) and is now owned by his son, Arron Barberian. The restaurant includes two main dining rooms, two private dining rooms, and a two-storey underground wine cellar housing over 20,000 bottles in 22 foot tall racks, with antique chandeliers, and a dining table for exclusive parties. Harry Barberian was the youngest of four children born to Armenian refugee parents. After working as manager-chef at Le Baron steakhouse, Barberian bought a cottage at 7 Elm Street for $6,000 and founded his own restaurant. Patrons over the years have included Robert Morley, James Beard, Rudolf Nureyev, Veronica Tennant, Mick Jagger, Denzel Washington, Eminem and every Canadian prime minister since John Diefenbaker. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were engaged at the restaurant in 1964. The restaurant houses a collection of rare Canadiana including original paintings by the Group of Seven. Current proprietor Arron Barberian has become a minor YouTube celebrity due to two incidents: the first, in which, during the Toronto Blue Jays 2013 home opener he comically wielded a bat which had flown into the stands after Cleveland Indians' second baseman Jason Kipnis accidentally let go of it during a swing and the second when security cameras filmed him chasing and fighting back against a would-be mugger who had attempted to rob him. He is also well known in Toronto for having been one of the catalysts behind the redevelopment of Dundas Square, which is close to the restaurant, and for his fundraising efforts for local hospitals and other charitable causes. Arron Barberian has managed the restaurant since 1993 when his family bought back a controlling share twenty years after his father, Harry, had sold a majority share of the establishment and gone into retirement. The younger Barberian expanded the restaurant by building the wine cellar at a cost of $1.5 million. In 2014, Barberian's opened a spin-off take-out sandwich shop, TLP Sandwich Co. at 15 Elm Street, a few doors down from the main restaurant.

The theorem was named after Norbert Wiener and Paul L√©vy. Norbert Wiener first proved Wiener's 1/f theorem, see Wiener's theorem. It states that if has absolutely convergent Fourier series and is never zero, then its inverse also has an absolutely convergent Fourier series. Wiener‚ÄìLevy theorem Paul Levy generalized Wiener's result, showing that Let F(\\\\theta ) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k = -\\\\infty}^\\\\infty c_k e^{ik\\\\theta}, \\\\quad\\\\theta \\\\in [0,2\\\\pi ] be an absolutely convergent Fourier series with : \\\\|F\\\\= \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k = -\\\\infty}^\\\\infty |c_k< \\\\infty. The values of F(\\\\theta ) lie on a curve C, and H(t) is an analytic (not necessarily single-valued) function of a complex variable which is regular at every point of C. Then H[F(\\\\theta )] has an absolutely convergent Fourier series. The proof can be found in the Zygmund's classic book Trigonometric Series. Example Let H(\\\\theta )=\\\\ln(\\\\theta ) and F(\\\\theta ) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k = 0}^\\\\infty p_k e^{ik\\\\theta},(\\\\sum\\\\limits_{k = 0}^\\\\infty p_k = 1 ) is characteristic function of discrete probability distribution. So F(\\\\theta ) is an absolutely convergent Fourier series. If F(\\\\theta ) has no zeros, then we have :H[F(\\\\theta )] = \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k = 0}^\\\\infty p_k e^{ik\\\\theta} \\\\right) = \\\\sum_{k = 0}^\\\\infty c_k e^{ik\\\\theta}, where \\\\|H\\\\= \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k = 0}^\\\\infty |c_k< \\\\infty. The statistical application of this example can be found in discrete pseudo compound Poisson distribution and zero-inflated model. If a discrete r.v. X with \\\\Pr(X = i) = P_{i}, i \\\\in \\\\mathbb N, has the probability generating function of the form : P(z) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i = 0}^\\\\infty P_{i} z^{i} = \\\\exp \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i = 1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\alpha_{i} \\\\lambda (z^{i} - 1) \\\\right\\\\\\\\},z=e^{ik\\\\theta} where \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i = 1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\alpha_{i} = 1, \\\\sum \\\\limits_{i = 1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left\\\\alpha_{i} \\\\right< \\\\infty, \\\\alpha_{i} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, and \\\\lambda > 0.

V. Kumar in association with K. E. Gnanavel Raja and Abinesh Elangovan. The film features an ensemble cast with S. J. Surya, Vijay Sethupathi, Bobby Simha, Kamalinee Mukherjee, Anjali, and Pooja Devariya playing leading roles. Featuring songs and background score by Santhosh Narayanan and cinematography handled by Sivakumar Vijayan, the film was released on 3 June 2016 with mixed to positive reviews and did average collections. Plot The film centers around three men and the women in their life: a struggling and alcoholic film director Arul (S. J. Surya) and his wife Yazhini (Kamalinee Mukherjee); Arul's best friend Michael (Vijay Sethupathi) and his wife Ponni (Anjali); and Arul's younger brother Jagan (Bobby Simha). Arul was a renowned film director until he fell out with the producer of his latest directorial film, because of which the film never released. To overcome his sorrow, he became a chronic alcoholic and started harassing Yazhini. Though Yazhini often threatens to divorce Arul for his behavior, she changes her mind each time due to her love for him. Michael, an artifact dealer, is forced to marry Ponni, despite being in love with a widow named Malar (Pooja Devariya). However, Malar has no love for Michael, merely considering their relationship as friends with benefits. Michael openly reveals to Ponni that he is not interested in being her husband and ignores her. Yazhini tries to convince Arul to seek the producer's forgiveness and get his film released so that they both could return to a normal life. When Arul refuses, the producer himself steps in and asks Arul to pay him 4,00,00,000 to get his film released. Michael and Jagan, with the help of their friend Ramesh (Karunakaran), steal a temple idol and sell it for 4,00,00,000 so that Arul's film can be released. Unfortunately, the producer has already decided to remake Arul's film with an entirely new cast and with his own brother as the director. Arul confronts the producer, who tries to kill him. In a fit of rage, Michael bludgeons the producer to death and is soon sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for his crime. An angry Ponni starts ignoring her husband, never visits him in jail, gives birth to their daughter, and eventually returns to her village. Meanwhile, Yazhini returns to her parents' house and files for a divorce against Arul, fed up of his alcoholism. Arul is sent to rehab to overcome his alcoholism and is released two years later. Now sober, Arul tries to convince Yazhini to return to him, to no avail. Meanwhile, Arul and Jagan bail out Michael, who leaves for Ponni's village in an attempt to restart his married life with her. Ponni agrees to come back with him on the condition that he breaks his friendship with Arul. The deceased producer's widow and brother meet with Arul and decide to sell the production rights of his film to him for 20,00,000. In order to get the money, Michael and Jagan again team up with Ramesh to steal an idol from a Kerala temple and sell it. However, Ramesh drugs Michael and runs away with the idol. Michael is arrested the following morning, but he manages to escape from the police and return to Chennai. On confronting Ramesh, he finds out that Jagan was responsible for getting him arrested at Kerala. Jagan was also in love with Ponni and was disgusted at the way Michael treated her. When Michael was in jail, Jagan declared his love for Ponni, who reciprocated but was forced to return to her village the next day as she was unable to decide between Michael and Jagan. Jagan then decided to get Michael arrested so that Ponni could leave Michael for good and start a new life with him. After confronting Ponni over her love for Jagan, both Michael and she decide to forget everything that happened and plan to leave Chennai to start a new life. Arul, who has successfully acquired the production rights for his film, decides to once again convince Yazhini to return to him. Yazhini, who is getting engaged to another person, Vasanth (Vaibhav), forgives him and agrees to return to him as long as Vasanth agrees. Meanwhile, Michael picks up a fight with a drunk Jagan over Ponni. During the fight, he accidentally kills Jagan, forcing him and Ponni to go into hiding, but he does not tell her that he killed Jagan. When the train that Michael and Ponni are travelling in stops at Palur, Arul, who has found out that Michael had killed his brother, notices him and shoots him in revenge. As Arul is taken to prison, he contacts Yazhini and pretends that he has once again returned to his drunken habits as he does not want her to suffer with the stigma of being a criminal's wife, effectively ending their relationship. In the end, with their respective husbands out of the way, Ponni and Yazhini relish their newly found freedom by enjoying the rain. Yazhini only watches the rain, leaving the viewers to introspect on how she is not ready to venture out into the world alone yet, while Ponni allows herself to get drenched, finally letting go.

The company has been manufacturing facilities across UK and Europe and offices in France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Hungary, China and the United States, with plans to expand further into Eastern Europe and Asia. Fernox was established in 1964 by Peter Muetzel, and currently operates as a subsidiary of Alpha-Fry, Ltd., which is in turn a subsidiary of Platform Specialty Products Corporation. History Founded in 1964 by Peter Muetzel, a German Chemist who settled in Britain, Fernox (short for Ferrous ‚Äì non ‚Äì Oxidus, the Latin name for the process of iron corrosion) was the world's first water treatment company, formed in response to the growing number of 'wet' central heating systems installed in UK homes and work places. At this time Fernox supplied goods direct to customers, often in small amounts, relying on word of mouth to grow its fledgling business. During this early period in the 1960s Fernox introduced three products, the GB-2, the world's first Benzoate Nitrate based inhibitor, developed for use by British Gas. The successful C11 and D33 products were launched shortly afterwards. These powder form inhibitors reduced costs for exports, making it safer and easier to store as well as increasing product shelf life, especially when compared with other contemporary inhibitors. ;1970s In the 1970s, the company introduced products such as MB-1, DS-9 and Floc. As well as its increasing reputation and market presence, this led to Fernox being promoted through large merchants, rather than selling directly to the public. In this decade Fernox also made its first forays into other products such as leak sealers, cleaners, anti-freezes and industrial specific products, with its burgeoning R&D; department providing new and improved formulations that fuelled Fernox proliferation in the UK market. This period of growth culminated in the moving of the company's production site to a new, larger facility in Clavering, Essex. ;1980s In the 1980s, the company released the world's first flushing machine for the domestic market named SQUID, the first domestic disinfection agent named and Sterox. Water Testing Services were formalized for the first time, and new, improved, environmentally safer formulations were introduced for MB-1, DS-9 (which later became DS40) and Floc (which became Superfloc). A Harrier GR7A of 800 Naval Air Sqn, Royal Navy In 1982, as a sub-contractor, the company introduced an inhibitor for Airworthy Zok 27, a jet engine cleaner adopted by the Royal Air Force and used extensively on Harrier Jump Jets in the Falklands conflict, helping to maintain operational efficiency in the adverse weather conditions. After its initial success with the RAF it became commonly used by many civilian and military aviation organisations worldwide. 1986 marked the passing of Fernox's founder, Peter Muetzel, after he suffered a stroke in his office. Fernox also released CP-3 & CH-3 inhibitors for copper tube pipes, and Copal for aluminium boilers, both of which were beginning to become widely used in central heating systems at this time. Fernox also purchased Lauritzen industrial water treatment as part of its expansion into the commercial sector. ;1990s In the 1990s Fernox was regarded as the UK market leader. The company refined existing products, such as the nitrate-free formulation for MB-1, and creating yet more world firsts, examples include the introduction of superconcentrate protectors, cleaners, leak sealers and noise silencers, which replaced the now outdated powdered form products. During this period Fernox set up its technical analytical testing and servicing division to support installers and contractors out in the field. It is also during the 1990s that Fernox began to establish itself as a global brand, with product launches in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Fernox also moved its head office from Clavering, to a new, larger site in Woking, where it remains to date. ;2000s In 2002, Fernox was one of the three founding members of the Domestic Water Treatment Association (DWTA), which sets chemical treatment quality approval standards and a code of practice within the water treatment industry, in order to safeguard industry standards and boost consumer confidence. During this decade, Fernox also opened its new R&D; facilities in both the UK and India, and continued to improve its existing product portfolio by releasing environmentally friendly Phosphate free formulations and the new Express aerosol version of the popular ‚ÄòF ‚Äòrange, which is designed to be dosed into systems in 30 seconds for quick and easy use on-site. Fernox also becomes preferred European and Worldwide supplier to Wolseley plc, Vaillant and BDR Thermea. ;2010s In the 2010s, Fernox launched its popular range of in-line system filters, starting with the award-winning TF1 Total Filter, followed by the TF1 Compact filter, both of which are designed to remove system debris through hydrocyclonic and magnetic filtration. Fernox has also recently introduced the Filter Fluid+ Protector, a simple and innovative approach to removing sludge and debris from radiators.  Acquisition by Platform Specialty Products Corporation  On 3 December 2015, Alent PLC was acquired by Platform Specialty Products Corporation, a public specialty chemicals company. The corporation also announced a new division named MacDermid Performance Solutions, combining the original MacDermid operations of the corporation with businesses from Alent (Fernox) and OMG, and merged the experience, resources and sales strategies of each company. MacDermid Performance Solutions a hi-tech specialty chemicals producer. It also provides technical services to original equipment manufacturers. Key innovations Fernox has been first to develop and market with many important products and services in the water chemical treatment industry, some of the most notable being the first benzoate nitrate based inhibitors, powdered form inhibitors, superconcentrate chemicals, water test kits postal service, domestic flushing machines, formation of the DWTA. The company is the only water treatment company to have an in-house Research and Development departments. In 2012, Fernox launched the Heating System Size Calculator app for use on Android, iPhone, iPad and BlackBerry devices. The app calculates the size of a central heating system and recommends the correct chemical water treatment products and the dosage level required to extend the life of the boiler and system. Awards and recognition The company's products have received accreditation from industry OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturers) for their use during the installation of new central heating systems, or to maintain and protect existing systems. Stelrad specify the use of Fernox chemicals, such as the Protector F1, Cleaner F3/F5 and Energy Saver F6 to be used after installation of radiators to protect and extend system efficiency. BDR Thermea that includes brands such as Baxi, Main and Potterton, recommend a large variety of Fernox products, including Powerflushing machines, Total Filter TF1's, Express and 500ml chemicals as well as various test kits to be used in tandem with their boilers. Other OEMs that recommend Fernox include; Honeywell, SIME, NTI, Nefit, ACV, Worcester Bosch, Ideal Boilers, Vaillant and Rotec. The company has been awarded with the following awards: * Corgi Installers' Mate of the Year (2010) * Phoenix Gas Award (2012) * H&V; Award for Domestic product of the year (Energy Saver F6) (2012) * H&V; News Award Training Initiative (2012) References External links * Category:Companies established in 1964 ","title":"Fernox"},{"id":"44826961","title":"1986 Cotton Bowl Classic"},{"id":"44826965","text":"Under a Red Sky Night is the d√©but (and unique) solo studio album by Irish musician Martin Tourish, released in May 2014.

Named 'Young Musician of the Year' in 2008 by TG4, his compositions are played by Altan, The Chieftains, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis amongst others. Following almost a decade after Clan Ranald (2005), his previous unique collaboration effort with traditional Irish musician Luke Ward (from Cavan), Under A Red Sky Night is Martin's very first solo album. Featuring a cast of nineteen musicians and nearly 56 minutes of Martin‚Äôs compositions and arrangements, it was released to highly positive reviews. According to Martin Tourish, much of the music on Under A Red Sky Night began either as improvisations that were later shaped into compositions, or as a re-imagining of material from the traditional idiom. Each of the tunes and sets are snapshots of the spirit of a particular time and place and the people and ideas that floated within it. The tracks on this album were produced to give as much of a sense of this as was possible and Martin Tourish hope that the listener enjoy exploring each of these microcosms as much as he did.

It was developed by iteration::two, which was acquired by Macromedia in 2005. It is part of the Adobe Engagement Platform. Adobe Labs features Cairngorm as the architectural framework for Rich Internet Application programmers. Cairngorm is based on the MVC model. It is specifically designed to facilitate complex state and data synchronization between the client and the server, while keeping the programming of the View layer detached from the data implementation. The role of the View layer in a Cairngorm application is to throw events and bind to data stored in the Model. Components on the View can bind to Value Objects or other properties in the Model (data) layer. In a Cairngorm Model, related data are stored in Value Objects (VOs), while simple variables can be stored as direct properties of the ModelLocator class. A static reference to the ModelLocator singleton instance is used by the View layers to locate the required data. The Controller is the most sophisticated part of the Cairngorm architecture. The Controller layer is implemented as a singleton FrontController. The FrontController instance, which receives every View-generated event, dispatches the events to the assigned Command class based on the event's declared type. The Command class then processes the event by running the Command class' execute() method, which is an ICommand interface method. The event object may include additional data if required by the developer. The execute() method can update the central Model, as well as invoke a Service class which typically involves communication with a remote server. The IResponder interface, which is also implemented by the Command class, includes onResult and onFault methods to handle responses returned from the invoked remote service. A Cairngorm application can be programmed to manage any server architecture/schemas.

He was often credited as Leo Cattozzo. He is best known as the designer and manufacturer of the self-perforating adhesive tape film splicer known as CIR-Catozzo.  Life and career  Born in Adria, Province of Rovigo, the son of the musician Nino, Catozzo graduated in law, then in cello at the Benedetto Marcello Conservatory in Venice, and finally in set design and directing at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome. He entered the film industry in the early 1940s as a screenwriter and later assistant director for several Mario Mattoli's comedy films. He debuted as a film editor in 1951 for Mattoli's My Heart Sings, and later worked with Alberto Lattuada, Mario Soldati and especially Federico Fellini whose films he edited during the fifties and sixties, most notably La Dolce Vita and 8¬Ω. In 1956 Catozzo received the American Cinema Editors Award for King Vidor's War and Peace. Being allergic to acetone, Catozzo projected and developed an innovative film splicer, later known as \\"CIR-Catozzo\\", \\"Pressa Catozzo\\" or just \\"Catozzo\\", using it for the first time in Fellini's Nights of Cabiria. The insistent demands of his colleagues forced him first to fabricate a hundred copies and later, to patent the machine which launched, in the early sixties, the mass production of the film splicer, something that gradually drew him away from his activity as an editor. In 1989 he received the Academy Scientific and Technical Award for his creation.

In 2009 multi-vendor interoperability was demonstrated and the PRIME Alliance launched.

Currently, the tests have been passed by over 40 products.PRIME Certified Products Most popular usage of PRIME is in AMI. According to PRIME Alliance more than 5 million meters in 9 countries are deployed.Prime Alliance News Letter. December 2014. Specification Overview The PRIME specificationNarrowband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing power line communication transceivers for PRIME networks. International Telecommunication Union. 2012. is structured into Physical Layer, MAC Layer and Convergence Layer. For operations and control, a \\"Management Plane is specified\\".  Physical Layer  Distribution networks are usually made of a variety of conductor types, and terminating into loads of different impedances, which also vary over time. Such infrastructure results in a communication channel which has a time dependent amplitude and phase response that varies with frequency. Interference and impulsive noise produced by motors, switching power supplies and halogen lamps reduces the reliability of communication signals. Due to line attenuation, the noise is location dependent. The PRIME physical layer is based on OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) and Differential Phase Shift Keying (BPSK, DQPSK and D8PSK) as carrier modulation. To address averse power line channel properties, robustness mechanism convolutional encoding (optional), scrambling and interleaving are used. PRIME Specification v1.4 also introduces repetition codingDraft Specification for PoweRline Intelligent Metering Evolution. PRIME Alliance TWG. Revision 1.4. 2014. as additional robustness mechanism. Originally, PRIME uses carrier frequencies (42 ‚Äì 89 kHz) within the CENELEC A band and offers raw data rates between 5.4 kbit/s (Robust mode: DBPSK with convolutional encoding and repetition code) and 128.6 kbit/s (D8PSK). Since specification version 1.4, more frequency bands were introduced to utilize the higher frequencies (up to 471 kHz) in ARIB and FCC bands. Using the full FCC band, raw data rates are eight times as high as in CENELEC A band.  MAC Layer  The MAC Layer specifies the data link layer of the OSI model. In a PRIME subnetwork two device types exist: Base nodes and Service nodes. Base nodes manage subnetwork resources and connections. All devices, which are not Base nodes are Service nodes. Service nodes register with Base nodes to become part of a subnetwork. The topology generated by a PRIME subnetwork is a tree with the Base node as trunk. To extend the subnetwork range, a Base node can promote a Service node from terminal state to switch state. Switches relay data in the subnetwork and build the branch points of the tree. Powerline is a shared communication media. Base nodes and switches announce their presence with beacon messages in well specified intervals. These beacons provide a common time notion to a subnetwork. Time is split into shared contention period (SCP) and contention free period (CFP). During SCP, nodes can access the channel using CSMA/CA. For the CFP period, the base node arbitrates channel access. To reduce transmission overhead, PRIME uses dynamic addresses to address nodes in a subnetwork. The addressing scheme resembles the tree structure of the subnetwork and consists of local switch id, local node id and local connection id. Routes are established during service node registration. PRIME makes use of address structure for packet routing, which reduces state information needed by service nodes. Base node and service nodes monitor network attachment based on periodic exchanged control messages, so called \\"keep alive messages\\". PRIME allows connection oriented communication. The PRIME MAC layer includes control mechanism/messages to open and close unicast, multicast and broadcast connections. To provide reliable connections, Selective Repeat ARQ is used between the two connection end points. PRIME specifies a security profile for encryption of MAC layer packets. Encryption is based on AES-CCM with 128bit keys and key derivation mechanism recommended by NIST.  Convergence Layer  The PRIME convergence layer is split into a Common Part Convergence Sublayer (CPCS) and Service Specific Convergence Sublayer (SSCS). The CPCS provides a segmentation and reassembly mechanism to all SSCS. PRIME currently specifies four SSCS: * IPv4 SSCS * IPv6 SSCS * NULL SSCS, a transparent SSCS for node management and custom use * IEC 61334-4-32 SSCS for use with DLMS/COSEM  Management Plane  The PRIME Management Plane specifies interfaces for local and remote management of nodes and for firmware upgrade.

Zaguroviƒá and Viƒáenco Vukoviƒá were the last printers of srbulje books.  Family  Zaguroviƒá was Serbian Catholic and member of the noble Zaguroviƒá family from Kotor, Republic of Venice (today Montenegro). His paternal uncle was distinguished poet Ilija Zaguroviƒá. The Zaguroviƒá family was related to the Serbian Crnojeviƒá family through the marriage of Jerolim Zaguroviƒá and Antonija Crnojeviƒá, the daughter of Lord ƒêuraƒë Crnojeviƒá of Zeta (r. 1489‚Äì96). They had a son, Anƒëelo, who lived in Venice.  Printing  The Crnojeviƒá printing house was disestablished when ƒêuraƒë Crnojeviƒá fled Zeta in 1496. The types used in his printing house remained in the monastery until Jerolim Zaguroviƒá found them somewhere before 1569. He wrote that he took some types to Venice. Because Jerolim insisted he brought types from Crnojeviƒá printing house to Venice, it was speculated that he had actually used Crnojeviƒá's types in his printing house. This was disputed by some later works which explained that the Crnojeviƒá printing house was so well reputed that other printing houses imitated its types. In 1569 he founded a printing house in Venice and began printing Cyrillic books. One of the motives of Jerolim Zaguroviƒá to establish the printing house was to earn some profit from it to compensate losses of the Zaguroviƒá family business caused by frequent Ottoman sieges of Kotor. Zaguroviƒá did not have a formal theological education so he had to engage Jakov of Kamena Reka to edit and proofread the texts before printing. (Jakov belonged to the Serbian Orthodox Church). In 1569 he printed a psalter and in 1570 a prayer book. This was the last Serbian Cyrillic book printed until the second half of the 18th century. There was only one book printed in 1638 in Venice by Bartholomew Ginami, but it was simply a reprint of the psalter with the book of hours published by Zaguroviƒá in 1569. Zaguroviƒá's printing press was firstly taken over by Jakov of Kamena Reka, and then in 1597 by Bartolomeo Ginammi who used it until 1638.

Although it has two pairs of wings, it jumps more than it flies. Its host plants include grapes, stone fruits, and Malus species, although its preferred host is Ailanthus altissima (Chinese sumac or tree of heaven). In its native habitat it is kept in check by natural predators or pathogens. It was accidentally introduced in South Korea in 2006 and has since been considered a pest. In September 2014, it was first recorded in the United States, and as of 2020 it is an invasive species in the Delaware Valley, eastern Pennsylvania, southwestern New Jersey, northern Delaware, eastern Maryland, and northern Virginia. Description The spotted lanternfly is originally native to parts of China, India, Vietnam, and Taiwan. It is a planthopper, belonging to the subfamily Aphaeninae and is approximately 25 mm long and 12 mm wide. It was originally described by Adam White in 1845 as Aphaena delicatula with habitat outside of Nankin, China. Adult lanternflies have a black head and gray-brown forewings adorned with the eponymous black spots. When resting, the crimson hindwings are partially visible through the semi-translucent forewings, giving the lanternfly a red cast. Neatly spaced black rectangular markings color the tips of the forewings in a pattern sometimes likened to brick and mortar. In flight, the spotted lanternfly displays red hind wings with black spots on the proximal third, a white wedge in the middle of the wing, and a solid black wing tip. The abdomen is yellowish with black and white bands on the top and bottom. Females have a set of red valvifers at the distal end of the abdomen, and when gravid (mated), the female abdomen swells to the point where they find it difficult to fly.Spotted Lanternfly Biology: Life Cycle, Identification, and Dispersion. Cornell College of Agricultue and Life Sciences, New York State Integrated Pest Management The lanternfly is a strong jumper and uses its wings to assist these jumps rather than making sustained flights. In traditional Chinese medicine, the spotted lanternfly is believed to be poisonous, and is used topically for relief from swelling. Subspecies Fulgoromorpha Lists On the WebBourgoin T: Fulgoromorpha Lists On the Web (FLOW): Lycorma delicatula (White, 1845) (retrieved 26 April 2020) lists three subspecies: * Lycorma delicatula delicatula (White, 1845) * Lycorma delicatula jole St√•l, 1863 * Lycorma delicatula operosa (Walker, 1858) Host associations A. altissima is a tree which is native to China and invasive to many other areas worldwide; it is considered to be the key host for L. delicatula and plays an important role in the lanternfly life cycle. This tree is the preferred host at all documented locations the lanternfly and A. altissima co-occur. However, the spotted lanternfly has a wide host range of over 70 plant species, including grape vines, fruit trees, ornamental trees, and woody trees, including apples and several Rosaceae with stone fruits. This range can include many agricultural crops and common forest plants, as the nymphs have been known to associate with other plants beyond Ailanthus altissima. The lanternfly has been recorded causing serious damage on at least 12 ornamental plants such as Parthenocissus quinquefolia, Phellodendron amurense, and Toona sinensis. In the United States high populations are seen infesting common forest trees, such as maple, birch, or walnut; in Pennsylvania alone, L. delicatula has been found on more than 20 newly-recorded host species of woody plants. Life cycle Young spotted lanternflies on Vitis labrusca in Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States in early July, 2018. Young spotted lanternflies on Vitis labrusca in Berks County, Pennsylvania, in late July, 2018. Adult spotted lanternflies on an Acer rubrum in Berks County, Pennsylvania, in mid- October 2019. L. delicatula feeds on woody and non-woody plants, piercing the phloem tissue of foliage and young stems with specialized mouthparts, and sucking the sap; it does not eat the fruit or the leaves per se. The sugary waste fluid they produce coats leaves and stems, and this can encourage mold growth. Beginning in late April to early May, nymphs hatch from their egg cases. A nymph passes through several immature stages, called instars, all of which are wingless. In the first instar it is black with white spots. Later instars have red patches in addition to the white spots. The final nymphal instar has red wing pads and a red upper body, before molting to the adult form, with a black head and grayish wings with black spots. Nymphs hop or crawl to search for plants to feed on. Young nymphs (first through third instars) appear to have a wider host range early on, which narrows as they grow older. Even though lanternflies have been recorded feeding on several herbaceous plants, this is most likely due to early instar nymphs climbing or falling onto these plants because late instar nymphs and adult lanternflies have no reliable association with herbaceous plants. As early as July, adults can be seen, and they mate and lay eggs from late September through the onset of winter. In their native Indomalayan habitat they will lay their eggs preferably on tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), which has toxic metabolites, and is an introduced invasive tree in North America. This host choice is thought to have evolved as a mechanism of protection from natural enemies. It is unclear whether the lanternfly can complete its life cycle on any host other than A. altissima, and there are further experiments planned in the US. There are many hypotheses as to why L. delicatula may have preferences for feeding on certain plants. Two examples of possible factors being investigated are the contribution of the overall sugar composition in the plant and the presence of toxic chemicals. The lanternfly will lay eggs upon any smooth-trunked tree, stone, or vertical smooth surface, including man-made items like vehicles, yard furniture, farm equipment or other items stored outside. The egg masses contain 30‚Äì50 eggs covered in a yellowish brown waxy deposit, often referred to as an egg case. The lanternfly's life expectancy is one year. Some researchers believe that a severe cold interval is required for the eggs to develop past a certain point, however this has not yet been confirmed. Testing has been done to determine how overwintering affects the eggs of the species. The minimum temperature that will kill eggs was estimated by South Korean researchers to be between on the basis of mean daily temperatures during their winter of 2009/2010. This estimate contrasts with eggs having survived the much colder winter 2013/14 temperatures in Pennsylvania, United States. Another study done in South Korea suggested that is about the temperature in which no eggs are hatched, while still had limited hatching, depending upon how long they were chilled and where they were kept. Host plant signs of infestation L. delicatula damages plants directly due to feeding on the sap from the trunk or branches; substantial damage can occur when many insects concurrently feed on the same plant and can present as the senescence of the branches or whole plant. An example of indirect damage is the formation of honeydew, the lanternfly's waste secretions, as sap collects on their trunks as it weeps from the wounds; the accumulation of this sweet sap can attract ants, bees, hornets, and paper wasps. This fosters the growth of molds on the sap as it collects at the base of the plant, which results in a reduction of photosynthetic potential of the plant, even resulting in the death of the plant.  Pathway for entry  L. delicatula will normally use A. altissima for feeding and laying their eggs, but if A. altissima is not present, they can lay their eggs on any stationary object, both manmade and natural, and will feed on a wide variety of plants. While eggs, they can easily be moved from place to place without being noticed, giving them an easy way to spread to new areas. Its initial introduction to the United States is believed to be through this pathway, hitchhiking off of an object imported from Asia into Pennsylvania. When adults, L. delicatula fly around the area to find new host plants, but generally will not thrive unless A. altissima is present. As nymphs, they feed on whatever host plant the egg was laid on before moving to another in the area. It is still uncertain if L. delicatula requires A. altissima to complete their life cycle or if they could finish development on a less desirable host; laboratory studies suggest that adults have trouble surviving off plants other than A. altissima. Accidental introduction In South Korea In 2006, the spotted lanternfly was accidentally introduced in Korea, and has been considered a pest since about 2007. It has since expanded its host range, attacking at least 65 plant species, uninhibited by a natural enemy. The distribution of L. delicatula has since been predicted using a modeling approach, which showed that this pest had the potential to occur in the majority of South Korea. Furthermore, there seems to be a possible correlation between the widespread distribution of A. altissima and the overall damage on grapevines as the tree is commonly found growing on the peripheries of Korean vineyards. L. delicatula has been documented to be a pest to grapevines, leading to a decline in the total number and overall quality of the harvested grapes. There are no quantitative data published supporting this correlation but has been widely hypothesized. In the United States The spotted lanternfly was first detected in the United States in Berks County, northwest of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On September 29, 2014, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture and the Pennsylvania Game Commission confirmed its presence. Based on its host affinities, it presented a threat to the state's grape, fruit tree, and logging industries. The greatest risk of spread was seen in people transporting materials containing egg masses laid on smooth bark, stone, and other vertical surfaces, so the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture banned transport of items that could harbor the hopper, including firewood, lawn mowers, outdoor chairs, trucks, and RVs, from seven municipalities on November 1, 2014. Given the presence of old egg masses, the insect was estimated to have been in the area since at least 2012, having survived the 2013/14 winter's unusual cold. A national working group led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, consisting of university and USDA scientists, was organized \\"to determine what is known about the lanternfly and what research is needed, including DNA analysis to pinpoint where the infestation originated.\\" Other states with known introductions of spotted lanternfly include Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. In July 2018, spotted lanternfly was confirmed in three New Jersey counties, and a quarantine order was issued for eight counties in August 2020. In September 2018 it was found in two New York locations, as well as in Virginia. On February 28, 2019, the Delaware Department of Agriculture signed Emergency Regulations for spotted lanternfly enacting a quarantine for this pest. On August 14, 2020 the New York Department of Agriculture announced that spotted lanternfly has been found on Staten Island. There have also been interceptions of dead SLF specimens arriving in Oregon and California, though no live sightings have been reported. This increases concerns for possibly mistakenly introduction the insect to other states. There is a large potential range for the spotted lanternfly to move into if it is not somehow stopped. This would cover almost all of the eastern part of the country. Canada The risk of spread from the United States is huge. Canadian governments are very concerned about maintaining quarantine and hope that quarantine efforts to the south are successful. Although most of Canada is unsuitable habitat, southwest Ontario and southerly parts of other provinces could be affected. Possible pest control The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture has been recommending based on information from PennState Extension: #Kill eggs October through May by scraping them off of surfaces, \\"double bag them and throw them in the garbage,\\" or scrape the eggs directly into a Ziploc bag of alcohol or hand sanitizer to kill them. #Remove spotted lanternfly hosts, the tree Ailanthus altissima (Chinese sumac or tree of heaven), saving only male trees to use as \\"trap\\" trees, since the spotted lanternfly requires a meal from this tree before laying eggs. Remaining male \\"trap\\" trees should be wrapped with sticky bands starting in early spring to catch any nymphs. Wildlife experts have warned to cover the sticky bands on trees with chicken wire or another similar wire after many reports of other animals (e.g. birds) becoming trapped on them and getting injured and/or dying. #Infested trees can be treated with systemic pesticides June‚ÄìAugust. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture recommends tree injection and bark sprays, applied by professional applicators, and soil drench and foliar sprays, which can be applied by homeowners. As of 2020 the PDA recommended several different pesticides to treat infestations, including insecticidal soaps, neem oil, pyrethrins and essential oils as well as bifenthrin, carbaryl, dinotefuran as bark sprays, imidacloprid, spinosad, tebuconazole, and zeta-cypermethrin. Spotted Lanternfly caught and eaten by a spider in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. 15 September 2020. Sticky traps at the base of tree trunks have also been used. In Pennsylvania, brown sticky traps have been effective at capturing nymphs, though adults may be strong enough to escape the adhesive. Studies have shown that the brown sticky traps are more effective than blue and yellow sticky traps. Also, L. delicatula has been found to be attracted to certain kairomones released by their host plants, and adults and second-to-fourth- instar nymphs also appear to be attracted to spearmint oil. It is hypothesized that such chemicals (like methyl salicylate) can be used to lure them into sticky traps to augment this pest control method. In 2019, researchers from the Hajek Lab at Cornell University have found that two native fungi, Beauveria bassiana and Batkoa major, kill spotted lanternflies, and Beauveria bassiana has also shown an ability to kill spotted lanternflies in biopesticide trials. A few natural predators have been identified in the lanternfly‚Äôs native habitat in China, but are not yet used in biocontrol. The most notable one being tested is the eupelmid wasp Anastatus orientalis, due to its high rates of parasitism of eggs; it is being investigated in the Republic of Korea and in the United States where they are being evaluated under quarantine until researchers are certain they themselves will not become an invasive species and attack other insects.

It represented moulders - skilled tradesmen who fabricated the moulds used to cast metal products in foundries. Despite its exclusive attitude towards membership, which kept the total number of FMMUA members low throughout its existence, the vital position of moulders in major industries such as mining, manufacturing and the railways ensured that the union remained industrially powerful, and the union had a reputation for being highly militant. The union's political inclinations varied between states, with the Queensland branch closely associated with the Communist Party of Australia, while the Western Australian branch was regarded as relatively conservative. History 1910s: Foundation Members of the Bendigo branch of Federated Ironmoulders' Union of Australasia Trade unionism among moulders in Australia began in 1858 with the establishment of the Ironfounders' Trade Union of Victoria. This was shortly followed by the Friendly Trade Society of Ironmoulders of NSW, the Queensland Moulders' Society, and a similar union in South Australia by 1882. An early instance of industrial unrest in the trade occurred in 1861 when ironmoulders at the Sydney foundry of P. N. Russell & Company went on strike after being refused overtime rates when working in excess of eight hours per day. The strike lasted for seven months but was ultimately unsuccessful. These state-based unions became largely inactive during the 1890s Depression, due to the decline in employment among moulders, but began to recover towards the end of the decade. The Federated Ironmoulders' Union of Australasia was formed in 1899 through the amalgamation of state-based unions in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. At the union's 1904 conference the name was changed slightly to the Federated Iron, Brass and Steel Moulders' Union of Australasia; at the same conference a South Australian District of the union was formed. The union's NSW branch (the strongest of the state branches) registered under the Industrial Arbitration Act, 1901 (NSW) almost immediately, although it did not manage to achieve a state industrial award until 1911. The union soon found the state arbitration system to be restrictive and unwieldy, and its use of direct industrial action and strikes led to its deregistration under the state system in 1916; however, by this time it had begun proceedings to register under the federal arbitration system, which it achieved in the same year. 1920s: Demarcation Although machine moulding was first introduced into Australia in the late 19th century the union initially refused to admit machine and plate moulders, regarding the work as relatively unskilled compared to that done by fully qualified 'jobbing' moulders. These workers were therefore organised by industrial unions, such as the Federated Stove and Piano Frame Makers Association of Australia and the Federated Agricultural Implement Machinery and Ironworkers Association of Australia. Over time, and as technology within foundries developed, an ever-increasing proportion of work was performed by semi-skilled machine operators, leading to the tradesmen moulders becoming increasingly isolated within the industry. In 1920 the Federated Moulders did expand its coverage to allow machine moulders to join, although the union's staunch opposition to the piece-work system of payment under which most machine moulders worked meant that few could become members (the union would fine or expel any member who accepted piecework or bonus payments). During the early 1920s conflict between the moulders' union and the new industrial unions led to frequent strikes, as the moulders' union sought to protect their traditional privileged status as craftsmen and restrict the entry of semi-skilled labour into the trade. The union obtained a federal award in 1924, prescribing a 48-hour working week. This was later reduced to 44 hours in May 1927, following an hours claim before the federal arbitration court, organised on behalf of the metal trades unions by the Commonwealth Council of Unions. Barrier Branch of the Federated Iron Brass and Steel Moulders' Union, ca. 1919 1930s: Depression The union's membership reached a peak of 3,845 in 1928, before falling during the Great Depression to less than 3,300. The union estimated that two thirds of its members were totally unemployed in 1931, with the remainder generally under-employed. The decline in employment crippled the union, and workplace activism in the moulding trade was almost non-existent during the first half on the 1930s. Conditions in the industry were also seriously undermined during this period by the 1930 metal trades award, handed down by Justice Beeby, which reduced wages and shift allowances, expanded the role of semi-skilled process workers in the industry and allowed for the use of 'payment by results', or piecework, by employers. The union's name was changed in 1930 to the Federated Moulders' (Metals) Union of Australia, which would remain its title for the rest of its existence. The union's membership began to recover during the late 1930s, and by 1938 had recovered to its pre-Depression levels. In June 1935 the NSW executives of the FMMUA and the Federated Ironworkers Association (FIA) formed a foundry workers' joint management committee in Sydney which worked to increase union density in the industry. The new structure was highly successful, spreading to Newcastle in 1936 and South Australia by 1940. In September 1936 the joint shop committees in Sydney launched a ban on overtime, calling for a 40-hour working week and an increase in wages. The overtime ban spread to Newcastle in January 1937. When employers refused the wage increase workers went on strike and the employers capitulated after five weeks. In March 1937 the Metal Trades Employers' Association (MTEA) launched a lockout of foundry workers aimed at ending the overtime embargo. The lockout ended in failure after six weeks, with workers winning a further increase in wages and an end to the systematic use of overtime in the industry. During the late 1930s the FMMUA also initiated a campaign to obtain compensation for foundry workers diagnosed with silicosis, caused by inhaling the fine sand used to make moulds for casting. Despite the campaign, safety and industrial hygiene standards in Australian foundries remained extremely primitive up until the Second World War. J. Hooke, federal secretary and arbitration agent of the FMMUA, 1931. 1940s: Dilution During WWII the union vociferously opposed dilution (where complex tasks performed by tradesmen were divided up into simple tasks to be performed by unskilled labour) and the introduction of female labour in the moulding trade. These measures were actively pursued by the government in an attempt to overcome manpower shortages caused by the enlistment of men into the armed forces and the rapidly increasing demand for industrial production. In 1944 20 moulders at the Perry Engineering Company in Adelaide stopped work over the employment of two women as coremakers. The dispute spread to 10 other workshops and lasted for several months before the Arbitration Court ordered the moulders to return to work (although the judge found that the company had unfairly exploited wartime regulations allowing female labour in order to undermine the workplace conditions of the tradesmen moulders). In the same year the union voted overwhelmingly to refuse membership to female coremakers employed at Metters Limited, on the basis that it could lead to reductions in the basic pay rate for male moulders. The women workers, whose original employment had been disputed by the metal trades unions, instead became members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU). Shortly after the war the FMMUA played a prominent role in the 1946‚Äì47 Victorian Metal Trades Strike, led by the AEU, which culminated in November 1946 in a lockout of 20,000 Victorian foundry workers by employers. Following protracted proceedings in the arbitration courts, the dispute was finally settled when workers agreed to return to work in exchange for an increase of 16 shillings in the base tradesmen's rate under the Federal Metal Trades Award (with equivalent increases for other classifications) and amendment of federal wage-pegging regulations. This increase later flowed on to workers employed under the various state metal trades awards. 1950s - 1970s: Decline Ralph Spooner, NSW state secretary of the FMMUA, ca. 1964‚Äì5. By the 1950s the FMMUA had approximately 7000 members, but was faced with a declining membership base as technological advances in foundries further reduced the need for tradesmen moulders. The union, therefore, argued against government initiatives to allow semi-skilled adult workers to train beyond the level of machine moulding. After a major dispute in 1970, in which all moulders in Victoria were on strike for a period of five weeks, the Victorian branch of the union established a special committee with the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Country Founders Group to try and improve industrial relations in the industry. The industrial relations committee was highly successful, and time lost due to stoppages fell from approximately two to three weeks per member per annum to less than 24 hours per member after its creation. This model of industrial relations committees in the moulding trade of later spread to other states including South Australia and New South Wales. Nevertheless, the union's membership continued to decline into the 1970s as automation and the decline of heavy industry due to tariff reduction shrank the workforce in foundries. The union was heavily involved in advocating for government support for the industry, including submissions to the Tariff Board, albeit with little success, and by 1973 membership had fallen to 4,000. The FMMUA was heavily involved in the campaign to secure a 35-hour working week in the Australian metal industry during the 1970s and 80s. The union was also active in opposing the penal clauses of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and refused to pay fines imposed on it for undertaking strikes. Amalgamation As early as 1922 the moulders' union had participated in discussions with a view to forming one single union in the metal trade, without success. In September 1944 the federal council of the FMMUA announced its preparedness to \\"federated or amalgamate with any union or unions in the metal trades industry\\" and endorsed a proposal for amalgamation with the FIA; however, the proposal was rejected by a ballot of the moulders' union membership by 2,173 to 1,533. In the late 1960s the FMMUA participated in discussions with the AEU, the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society of Australia and the Sheet Metal Working Industrial Union regarding amalgamation. While the other three unions eventually merged in 1972 to form the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, the moulders elected to remain independent. During the late 1970s the FMMUA again considered amalgamation with the FIA, but the proposal was rejected by a plebiscite of the membership. During the 1970s the Western Australian branch of the FMMUA split off in order to merge with the local branch of the Australian Society of Engineers, forming the Australasian Society of Engineers, Moulders and Foundry Workers, while in December 1980 the South Australian branch also seceded to form the Metal Moulders Union of South Australia before amalgamating with the Adelaide Branch of the FIA to form its Moulders and Foundry Workers Sub-Branch in 1982. Following protracted negotiations during 1980‚Äì83, including opposition from some of the moulders' state branches, the FMMUA finally merged with the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union (AMWSU) to form the Amalgamated Metals, Foundry and Shipwrights' Union in February 1983.

It was engaged in defending the West Midlands of England during the war. It comprised a varying number of searchlight (S/L) battalions and later included light anti-aircraft units. It was disbanded at the end of 1943. When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the former 54th AA Bde was reformed as 80 Anti- Aircraft Brigade but was disbanded on 9 September 1948. Mobilisation As tensions rose at the time of the Munich Crisis, Britain's AA defences were strengthened and 4th AA Division was formed in 1938 within Western Command. In 1939 all TA AA formations, comprising units of the Royal Artillery (RA) and Royal Engineers (RE), were brought under a new Anti-Aircraft Command covering the whole country. On the outbreak of war a new 54th AA Brigade was being formed in 4 AA Division to provide searchlight cover straddling the South Midlands Area of Southern Command and the West Lancashire Area of Western Command. The brigade was formally raised on 1 September 1939 at Sutton Coldfield near Birmingham.Frederick, pp. 1050‚Äì2.Routledge, Table LVIII, p. 376.

In the reorganisation of AA Command in November 1940, 54 AA Bde assumed responsibility for searchlight provision for the Gun Defence Areas of the West Midlands under a new 11th AA Division. At this time it only had two regiments under command: 45th (Royal Warwicks) and 80th, a new regiment raised in October 1940.Farndale, Annex M. Coventry Blitz Coventry city centre following the 14 November air raid. The new division was still being formed when the Luftwaffe launched a series of devastating raids, beginning with the notorious Coventry Blitz on 14/15 November.Collier, Chapter 17. The Coventry raid was preceded by a dozen pathfinder aircraft of Kampfgeschwader 100 riding an X-Ger√§t beam to drop flares and incendiary bombs on the target. The huge fires that broke out in the congested city centre then attracted successive 40-strong waves of bombers flying at heights between 12,000 and 20,000 feet to saturate the defences. The AA Defence Commander had prepared a series of concentrations to be fired using sound-locators and GL Mk. I gun-laying radar, but the bombing severed all lines of communication and the noise drowned out sound-location. Some gun positions were able to fire at searchlight beam intersections, glimpsed through the smoke and guessing the range. The Coventry raid was followed by three consecutive nights (19‚Äì22 November) of attacks on Birmingham and other Black Country industrial towns including West Bromwich, Dudley and Tipton. The change in enemy tactics led to additional AA units being moved to the West Midlands.Pile's despatch.Routledge, p. 391. Birmingham Blitz Birmingham was bombed again during December (3, 4, 11) and on 11 March 1941, but the full Birmingham Blitz came in April 1941, with heavy raids on the nights of 9/10 and 10/11 of the month, causing extensive damage and casualties.Collier, Appendix XXX. The Blitz is generally held to have ended on 16 May 1941 with another attack on Birmingham. By now the HAA sites had the advantage of GL Mk I* radar with an elevation finding (E/F or 'Effie') attachment to supplement searchlights, and several attackers were turned away by accurate fire and their bombs scattered widely, some on nearby Nuneaton.Routledge, pp. 98‚Äì9, 393. The city was attacked again in July, but the Luftwaffe bombing offensive was effectively over.Collier, Chapter 19. The West Midlands had been the hardest hit area of the UK after London and Merseyside.Collier, Appendix XXXI.

These were redeployed into 'Indicator Belts' of radar-controlled S/L clusters covering approaches to the RAF's night-fighter sectors, repeated by similar belts covering AA Command's Gun Defence Areas (GDAs). Inside each belt was a 20-mile deep 'Killer Belt' of single S/Ls spaced at intervals in a 'Killer Belt' cooperating with night-fighters patrolling defined 'boxes'. The pattern was designed to ensure that raids penetrating deeply towards the Midlands GDAs would cross more than one belt, and the GDAs had more S/Ls at close spacing. The number of LAA units to protect VPs was growing, albeit slowly.Routledge, p. 99.Routledge, pp. 398‚Äì404. By now, additional Bofors LAA guns began to arrive in quantity to defend vulnerable points (VPs) and as a light AA Bde, 54th now began to receive LAA gun units in addition to its S/Ls.Routledge, Table LXVI, p. 397. At this stage of the war, experienced units were being posted away to train for service overseas. This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated with the preparations for the invasion of North Africa (Operation Torch) in late 1942, and the need to transfer LAA units to deal with the Luftwaffe's 'hit-and run' raids on the South Coast. However, newly-formed units continued to join AA Command, the HAA and support units increasingly becoming 'Mixed' units, indicating that women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) were fully integrated into them.Routledge, pp. 398‚Äì404.Collier, Chapter XX.

He is generally counted as the second in the list of 63 Nayanars. Life The life of Tirunilakanta Nayanar is described in the Tamil Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. Tirunilakanta Nayanar belonged to Chidambaram, famous for its Thillai Nataraja Temple dedicated to the god Shiva, patron of Shaivism. He was born in the Kuyavar caste of potters. He made earthenware pots and other containers. He was a devout devotee of Shiva and distributed clay bowls to devotees of Shiva, free of cost. He and his wife specially revered the Nilakanta (Tirunilakanta, \\"Blue Throated one\\") form of Shiva, who drank the Halahala poison and used the universe. Once, Tirunilakanta Nayanar enjoyed pleasure with a prostitute. The news reached the wife before he reached home. The enraged wife fulfilled all her duties but did not allow her husband to touch her. When he tried affectionately touch her to placate her, she refused his advances and said 'Would you touch us (me) .... Tirunilakanta.' While the wife meant that her husband does not touch her, she used a pronoun, which also meant \\"us\\". Tirunilakanta could be interpreted as the name of the husband or god Shiva. Traditionally, a Hindu married woman does not address her husband by his name. It is not clear by what she meant, but her husband took the meaning that she refrained him from touching all women (\\"us\\") by the name of the god Nilakanta. The Nayanar pledged not to touch any woman from that day, even in his thoughts. While the wife carried out all the responsibilities of a wife to Tirunilakanta Nayanar, they never touched each other. They lived in different quarters in the house and fulfilled Tirunilakanta's vow in secret. The couple became old. Once, Shiva disguised himself as a Shaiva yogi (mendicant). He was welcomed and worshipped by Tirunilakanta Nayanar. Upon inquiry by the aged potter about what he can do for the ascetic, the ascetic gave him his \\"precious\\" earthen begging bowl and told the potter to keep it safe till he returns. The yogi left; Tirunilakanta kept the bowl in a safe location. After a long time, the yogi returned and demanded his begging bowl. Tirunilakanta looked for the bowl in the place he kept it and then searched the whole house in vain. Shiva had actually made the begging bowl disappear. The worried Nayanar prostrated before the mendicant and told him that he had lost the bowl and offered to replace it with a new clay bowl. However, the agitated ascetic refused and accused the potter of stealing his precious bowl. Upon much persuasion, the ascetic ordered Tirunilakanta to take a dip in the temple tank and swear by taking his hand on the head of his son. When the potter told the yogi that he was childless, the ascetic suggested that he do so by swearing on his wife's head. But, Tirunilakanta refused to do so, due to his vow, the incensed left and appealed to the Brahmin priests of the temple for justice. The Brahmin court heard both sides and ordered the potter to swear his innocence in the holy tank. Tirunilakanta and his wife entered the temple pond, each holding an end of a bamboo stick. The ascetic objected and suggested the potter hold his wife's hand. Ultimately, the potter revealed the whole story - which was concealed from the world till then - about his private life and his vow to the assembled Brahmins and the ascetic. The old couple immersed themselves in the holy waters and emerged as a young couple as they rose up. The awestruck Brahmins looked in disbelief. The ascetic disappeared. In the sky, Shiva appeared with his consort Parvati and blessed the couple. Pleased by the couple's devotion and sexual restraint, Shiva took them to his abode Kailash, where they are said to have lived ever young. Remembrance The images of the Nayanars are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. One of the most prominent Nayanars, Sundarar (8th century) venerates Tirunilakanta Nayanar in the Tiruthonda Thogai, a hymn to Nayanar saints, calling him \\"the blessed potter\\" and the first Nayanar mentioned in the hymn and the only one whose caste affiliation is stated. While describing the Nayanars, Nambiyandar Nambi (11th century) says that Tirunilakanta Nayanar observed sexual abstinence with his wife and as an aged man, reagined his youth with his wife by \\"God's grace\\". A maxim by Sivadevayya, also known as Visweswara Siva Desika, the guru and minister of the Katiya king Kakati Ganapati Deva (1199-1260), part of his lost Telugu sataka (a poem with more than hundred lines) Siva-devadhimani Satakamu says that one must be like Siriyala in childhood, Sundarar in youth and Gundaya (Tirunilakanta Nayanar) in old age; if one has no faith in Shiva then \\"his birth is burden and life is futile\\". Gopalakrishna Bharati (1810‚Äì1896) wrote a short opera named Tirunilakantha Nayanar Charitram on his life. Tirunilakanta Nayanar is worshipped in the Tamil month of Thai, when the moon enters the Vishakha nakshatra (lunar mansion). He is depicted with folded hands (see Anjali mudra). He receives collective worship as part of the 63 Nayanars. Their icons and brief accounts of his deeds are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. Their images are taken out in procession in festivals. In Chidambaram, west of the main Nataraja Temple lies the temple tank called Ilamai thirtam (tank of youth) or Ilamai Nayanar thirtam (tank of the young Nayanar) or Vyaghrapada thirtam, which is believed to the site of the test of Tirunilakanta Nayanar by Shiva. The Ilamaiyakinar temple dedicated to Shiva stands on the banks of the tank. The temple is said to be built by the devotee Vyaghrapada, long before Tirunilakanta Nayanar's times and was also as Thiruppuleeswarar. After the Tirunilakanta incident, the form of Shiva was renamed as Ilamai-yakinar. The temple has a shrine for the Tirunilakanta Nayanar and his wife Ratnasalai. The Thai Vishakha day is believed to be the day of Tirunilakanta Nayanar's test of devotion. The day is marked by a temple festival when the tale of the Nayanar's test are ritually enacted in the temple tank. Separated couples or couples with disputes in the marriage are prescribed to pray in the temple for a happy married life.

The train service was founded by James Sherwood of Kentucky, USA, in 1982. It is currently owned by Belmond Ltd. Belmond operates 45 luxury hotels, restaurants, tourist trains and river cruises in 24 countries. Belmond British Pullman journeys operate mainly out of London Victoria station with visits to places of interest in southern Britain such as castles, country houses, cities, sporting occasions and events including the Grand National and Goodwood Revival. There are also weekend journeys to Cornwall, with overnight accommodation in hotels, and non-stop round trips with lunch, afternoon tea and dinner served on board. Elaborate dining is included in every journey. While Belmond British Pullman operates mainly around London it has a sister train, Belmond Northern Belle, that operates mainly around northern Britain, offering journeys of a similar style. Belmond British Pullman consists of Pullman coaches dating from the 1920s to 1950s. They were bought and restored between 1977 and 1982 and modern facilities such as electric heating and toughened glass installed. Original fittings such brass luggage racks were restored and furnishings sympathetic to the period, such as Art deco-style table lamps and armchairs, added. The carriage interiors are lined with wooden panels decorated with marquetry, which were restored by A Dunn and Son, a family firm that dates from 1895 and which created some of the originals. The eleven Pullman carriages can accommodate up to 226 passengers across tables for one, two or three. There are also private compartments for four. Many of the carriages were part of the former Brighton Belle and were used to convey royalty. Although the records of the Pullman Car Company were destroyed in a World War II bombing raid, it has been possible to trace the history of the carriages, as detailed on plaques in each one. The service is regularly hauled by DB Cargo UK's British Rail Class 67 locomotives painted in brown and cream to match the carriages.

She was the great-granddaughter of Henry Roan Horse. She is one of the most renowned Native American contemporary artists of the past three decades, having won awards from and held exhibits at many museums and art shows throughout Indian Country. Wounded Knee Occupation While a high school student in 1973, Gray hitchhiked to Wounded Knee to participate in the 71-day occupation with a team of 200 Ogalala Lakota activists and members of the American Indian Movement. The protest, intent on calling attention to failed government treaty agreements, poverty, racial tension, and conditions on the Pine Ridge Reservation, was the longest-running act of civil disobedience in US history. One of Gray's sisters, Mary BigHorse, was married to a high-ranking AIM member, Henry Wahwassauk. Two brothers, Andrew Gray and Louis Gray, met up with Gina in Denver and they made their way to a South Dakota safe house, where BigHorse was waiting, outside the occupation area. Under cover of darkness, they entered the compound, where they remained for the next month. Electricity, water and food supplies were cut off by federal marshals and national guardsmen in an attempt to break the standoff. Under heavy gunfire, Frank Clearwater, a Cherokee, and Buddy LaMonte, an Oglala Lakota, were killed. Gina and her brother Louis decided to leave, were smuggled out, and were reunited with their father in the safe house. Education After escaping from Wounded Knee, Gray and her brother Louis returned to finish high school at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico. After graduating from IAIA, she studied commercial art the California Institute of the Arts. Art career Gray's work was characterized by bold, bright colors of mixed-media, which incorporate traditional images of her Osage upbringing with her contemporary world. Considered a master contemporary fine artist, her prints and monotypes feature stylized figures and abstract landscapes. Her commercial art extends from tee-shirt design, to the logo for the East Central University (Ada, Oklahoma) Hayes Native American Studies Center, to the cover design for the National Congress of American Indians History book. Her work has been featured in exhibits at galleries throughout Indian country: in Arizona, the Heard Museum in Phoenix; in New Mexico, the Institute of American Indian Arts Museum and the Wheelwright Museum both in Santa Fe; in Oklahoma, Tsa-la-Gi Cherokee Center Museum, Tahlequah and Gilcrease Museum and Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa; in South Dakota, the Red Cloud Indian Art Museum in Pine Ridge; and in Washington state, the Daybreak Star Museum in Seattle. She has also had work featured at the Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. Gray owned and operated art galleries in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and most recently in Pawhuska, Oklahoma. As well her work being part of numerous private collections and galleries throughout the world, some of her art is owned by the Sultan of Brunei and two royal princes of Jordan‚Äîhis Royal Highness Prince Tlal bin Mohammed and His Royal Highness Prince Ghazi bin Mohammed. Activism One of the things that Gray fought for at Wounded Knee was the deplorable lack of educational opportunities for native children. Throughout her long career, she remained involved in projects that benefited education, like the Council of Energy Resource Tribes education programs, the Trail of Painted Ponies project, and the creation of the Hayes Native American Studies Center. Gray also has participated in projects exposing FBI surveillance of Native American activists and the impact this has on privacy both individually and collectively. Honors and awards Gray has won numerous awards for her artwork throughout Indian Country and served a four-year appointment by the Secretary of the Interior as a commissioner on the Indian Arts and Crafts Board in Washington D.C. *1988 ‚Äì Outstanding Young Women of America *1989 ‚Äì Featured artist Stables Art Center, Taos, NM * Featured artist Gallup All Indian Inter-Tribal Indian Ceremonial * Featured artist Eight Northern Indian Pueblos Arts & Crafts Show, New Mexico * 1st place, textiles: National American Cultural Arts Festival *1990 ‚Äì 1st place graphics: Red Earth Fine Arts Competition *1990 ‚Äì Featured artist: Heard Indian Art Museum, Phoenix, AZ *1991 ‚Äì Southwest American Indian Art Association (SAIAA) Fellowship winner: 70th Annual Santa Fe Indian Market *1992 ‚Äì 2nd place (\\"Clan Seeker\\"): National Museum of the American Indian/Smithsonian Institutions. *1993 ‚Äì Featured artist for the Seventh Annual Tulsa Indian Arts Festival References External Links *Oral History interview with Gina Gray at Oklahoma State University Native Artists Project Category:United States federal Indian policy Category:Assimilation of indigenous peoples of North America Category:Aboriginal title in the United States Category:Osage Nation Category:Plains tribes Category:Native American painters Category:Native American history Category:Painters from Oklahoma ","title":"Gina Gray"},{"id":"44827723","text":"Fran√ßois Marits (25 November 1884 - 2 April 1945) was a Dutch sports shooter.

History The temple was the first building to be erected on the summit, and was associated with the legend of Our Lady of Help. It is unclear what form the original structure took; historians believe that its original form was different then the actual, owing to various restoration attempts throughout the centuries associated with the seismic history of the region. The building was likely constructed in the 16th century, and the first expansion took place in the 18th century. Sometime in 1751, two azulejo panels were placed in the interior. On 22 December 1828, the parish council ordered the placement of a tombstone in the chapel, as a sign of gratitude for the donations made by Manuel Simas and his wife D. Isabel Maria da Silveira Simas (who had restored the chapel and reconstructed the churchyard and roadway to the hermitage). Bishop of Angra, D. Francisco Maria de Sousa do Prado de Lacerda, visited the site on 2 October 1890; to mark the occasion, commander Manuel Simas and the vicar of Santa Cruz, Teodoro Martins Pamplona, ordered the placement of a new marker for the occasion. In 1915, a lane of rounded stone was constructed leading to the doorway of the main chapel. Architecture An overview of the hermitages position at the top of Monte da Senhora da Ajuda, overlooking the regional centre of Santa Cruz Located on the isolated summit of Monte da Senhora da Ajuda, approximately above sea level, on the summit of a small volcanic cone and almost perfectly-round crater. In fact, the hermitage is part of a group of hermitages and chapels surrounded by short walls, located on the Monte da Ajuda, with a privileged position over the town of Santa Cruz and island. Around the crater rim are chapels dedicated to S√£o Jo√£o (probably from the 16th century) and S√£o Salvador (from the 18th century), while a bullfighting arena is located in the centre of the crater. A roadway and wall continues to exist from the town to the Mount, while a small wall semi- encricles the courtyard (surmounted by occasional basalt crosses). The posterior left corner of the courtyard is occupied, alongside the chapel, a whalewatching lookout, dated to 1959 (inscribed over the door). The hermitage is dedicated to the Marian devotion and is an example of the \\"fortified\\" religious architecture of the 16th century. The lateral annex is occupied by a Casa dos Romeiros, for pilgrims that annually bisected the town roads chanting, during Lent. Over the main gate/doorway of the Hermitage is a plaque dated as 1915, which references the passage at the entranceway, and not any specific work done at the hermitage. The three hermitages are single-nave, with chapel accessible from a triumphal arch. The small sacristies are directly connected to the chapel with baptismal fonts, with the one in the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda being more ornamental. While the three chapels/hermtiages have varying styles, the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda, still maintains many of the original Gothic-Manueline characteristics. The buildings are constructed of plastered masonry and painted white, with the corners, cornices, frames and decorative elements in exposed basalt. The building includes a small belfry, with four rounded openings.

It is generally seen as equivalent to the phrase \\"kingdom of God\\" (Greek: Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒØŒ± œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ∏ŒµŒø·ø¶) in the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Luke. Thought to be the main content of Jesus's preaching in the Gospel of Matthew, the \\"kingdom of heaven\\" described \\"a process, a course of events, whereby God begins to govern or to act as king or Lord, an action, therefore, by which God manifests his being-God in the world of men.\\"  Compared with \\"kingdom of God\\"  Howard Clarke notes that Matthew 3:2 is the first of twenty-nine references to the \\"kingdom of heaven\\" in the Gospel of Matthew.Clarke, Howard W. The Gospel of Matthew and its Readers: A Historical Introduction to the First Gospel. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2003. The gospels of Luke and Mark tend to prefer the term \\"kingdom of God.\\" That Matthew uses the word \\"heaven\\" is often seen as a reflection of the sensibilities of the Jewish audience this gospel was directed to, and thus tried to avoid the word \\"God.\\" Most scholars feel the two phrases are theologically identical. Robert Foster rejects this view. He finds the standard explanation hard to believe as Matthew uses the word \\"God\\" many other times and even uses the phrase \\"kingdom of God\\" four times. Foster argues that, to Matthew, the two concepts were different. For Foster, the word \\"heaven\\" had an important role in Matthew's theology and links the phrase especially to \\"Father in heaven,\\" which Matthew frequently uses to refer to God. Foster argues that the \\"kingdom of God\\" represents the earthly domain that Jesus' opponents such as Pharisees thought they resided in, while the \\"kingdom of heaven\\" represents the truer spiritual domain of Jesus and his disciples.  End times  Some scholars believe that when the phrase was first used, it was intended to be eschatological with the kingdom of heaven referring to the end times. However, when the last judgment failed to occur within the era of the early Church, Christian scholars came to understand the term in reference to a spiritual state within (confer with Luke 17:21), or a much delayed end time (confer with Matthew 24:36). There is a difficulty for those believing in a delayed end time, since the phrase \\"the kingdom of God\\" is linked with other phrases like \\"at hand\\" or \\"is near,\\" implying an imminent event. To this challenge, Albright and Mann suggest a better translation would state that the kingdom is \\"fast approaching.\\"Albright, W.F. and C.S. Mann. \\"Matthew.\\" The Anchor Bible Series. New York: Doubleday & Company, 1971. R. T.

In the United States, tsukemen has become popular in Los Angeles, while it remains relatively uncommon in other American cities. Tsukemen is a Japanese noodle ramen dish in Japanese cuisine consisting of separate servings of noodles and soup or broth, whereby the noodles are dipped in the soup. Soba and udon are some types of noodles used in the dish. The noodles are typically served cold, while the soup is typically served hot, which serves to season and moisten the noodles. The noodles can also be served at room temperature. Additional ingredients used in the dish are typically served atop or on the side within the dish of noodles. Some additional ingredients used include nori, chashu, menma, tamago and boiled eggs. The soup serves as a dipping sauce, and is typically much stronger and intense in flavor compared to standard ramen broth. Dashi, a soup in Japanese cuisine, can be used, which is prepared using a soup base or stock that is also named \\"dashi.\\" Some restaurants add hot water to dilute the soup at the conclusion of the meal, decreasing its strength and making it more palatable as a soup to finish the meal. History Tsukemen in Japan Tsukemen was invented in 1961 by Kazuo Yamagishi (1935‚Äì2015), who owned Taishoken restaurant, a well-known ramen restaurant in Tokyo, Japan. In 1961, Yamagishi added the dish to his restaurant's fare using the name \\"special morisoba\\", which consisted of \\"cold soba noodles with soup for dipping.\\" At the time, it was priced at 40 yen, and the dish soon became very popular at Taishoken restaurants. As of 2015, over 100 Taishoken restaurants exist in Japan. In recent years (circa 2000‚Äìpresent), tsukemen has become a very popular dish in Tokyo and throughout Japan, and several restaurants now exist in the country that purvey it exclusively. Tsukemen is also served in restaurants in the United States and in other countries. In recent years (circa 2013‚Äìpresent), Tsukemen has become a popular dish in some ramen shops in Los Angeles. Conversely, in other areas of the U.S., such as Chicago, the dish is uncommon and rarely served in restaurants.

It was located on The Strand. Winchelsea In the 13th century, old Winchelsea was one of England's most prosperous ports, particularly involved in the wine trade from Gascony but was lost to the sea. The new town of Winchelsea was laid out in 1283 in the form of a continental bastides town as a commercial centre for the importing of wine. The port was moved to the area of flat land, below the cliffs along the Strand. It was a river port, at the mouth of the River Brede which flowed out into a large lagoon, protected by a sandbar from the open waters of the Channel. The port connected with the town by a road that went up Strand Hill, through Strand Gate to the market place. The returning route went through the Landgate or Pipewell Gate, down Ferry Hill and into the port area. History Strand House was built just behind the port area at its eastern end at the foot of Strand Hill. It is thought to be located behind the Fish Market and re-used parts of stone walls from earlier store houses in the Quay area. A substantial farmhouse was built using the remains of these stone walls in 1425, probably by the church to farm the land in front of the house as the port declined and the sea retreated. A small second house, now known as \\"The Crow's Nest\\" stood behind Strand House and was constructed as a timber framed Sussex Hall house. If the house was owned by the church it is likely that it came into use as the town's workhouse after the town's decline in 1530 due to the silting up of the port and river. By 1565 the town was reduced to only 109 households when in the 14th century it had numbered in excess of 500 households. The earliest known written record of Strand House is in a parliamentary report of 1777 which recorded a parish Workhouse in use at Rye with accommodation for 60 inmates; Brede with the capacity for 30; Iden that was able to house 20; and Winchelsea‚ÄîSt Thomas the Apostle with facilities for 24 inmates. There is a collection of written correspondence relating to the workhouse in the Sussex Records Society archives dating from the early 19th century. An example is give below: \\"PAR 511/35/1/21 1 Sep 1823 Letter from William Watson, Rye to the overseers of Winchelsea John West (the bearer hereof) having informed me that he has made application to be appointed master of the poorhouse at Winchelsea and that it is necessary for him to produce testimonials of his good conduct, I beg to say that I believe him to be a sober, honest and civil man and very trustworthy. I have known his wife also many years and believe her to be a steady, honest, industrious woman\\". In 1834, the Poor Law Amendment Act came into force and the Rye Poor Law Union was formed on 27 July 1835. Its operation was overseen by an elected Board of Guardians, 18 in number, representing its 12 constituent parishes. Initially, Rye Union made use of existing parish workhouse accommodation at Rye, Northiam and Brede. Former parish workhouses at Beckley, Brede, Icklesham, Playden, Udimore and Winchelsea were sold off in the late 1830s and construction of a new purpose- built workhouse for 436 inmates began in 1843 with the first admissions taking place in 1845. The Rye Union was located on a hill behind the town of Rye on the site of the current Rye Memorial Hospital. At this point, Strand House was sold as a farm, consisting of Strand House, Crow's Nest Cottage, Appletree Wick and the Old Malthouse; census returns for 1841 through to 1901 show that it remained as a farm throughout the remainder of the century. In 1922, the property was bought by two sisters who disposed of the outlying buildings to leave the property as just Strand House and the Crows Nest. They opened the houses as a guest house and it remains as one to current times. Construction Strand House was built in about 1425. The two-storey timber- framed building's east wall has plaster infilling and exposed timber whereas the ground floor on north front is constructed with red brick and has tile hung above. Stone rubble was used to build the east front of the south wing and the ground floor of the south front, which has tile hung above. It has casement windows, a 17th-century chimney stack, a tiled roof and attic. There is a dormer plus three windows. Set in the grounds of Strand House is the jointly occupied two-storey timber-framed Crows Nest Cottage, built the 17th century or earlier. It adjoins Strand House on the west. It has plaster infilling, a tiled roof and casement windows. Weatherboarding was used to re- face the north front. The house is a \\"House with an Open Hall\\" and consists of two bays and is in contracted form, incorporating a single bayed hall at one end with an overshot cross-passage and a standard servants area at the other. It shows a good example of close-studding, which was decorative framing used on the street-facing side of the building while the less decorative large panel framing was used on rear elevations. It was introduced into this part of Sussex from 1430 and became common from 1450. Depictions in art and literature Winchelsea; the Workhouse and Strand Gate Winchelsea, Sussex, Soldiers on the March c.1828 Strand House is included in the sketchbook of William Turner lodged in the Tate Gallery, under reference D10519 \\"from Richmond Hill; Hastings to Margate Sketchbook\\" [Finberg CXL], \\"Winchelsea; the Workhouse and Strand Gate\\". Artist: Joseph Mallord William Turner 1775-1851. Date: c.1816-19. Classification: on paper, unique Medium: Graphite on paper Dimensions: support: 155 x 95 mm. The painting that resulted from this sketch is called \\"Winchelsea, Sussex, Soldiers on the March c.1828\\" and depicts a column of soldiers marching up Strand Hill with a group of camp followers seated in the foreground. Soldiers had been stationed in Winchelsea during the Napoleonic Wars to help guard the coast and along the Royal Military Canal which runs along the marshes below the town. The area was also a haunt of smugglers and coastguards often called on the soldiers for support in dealing with them. Turner would have seen the soldiers garrisoned in Winchelsea when he passed through the town in 1816 on his sketching tour.

He contributed the view of Sikh Religion on Human Rights in German Book, Menschenrechte im Weltkontext. In February 2015, he was the very first speaker of the dialogue series entitled Religion Matters established by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). On letter call from SGPC, he had written various articles in response to Gurbaksh Singh Kala Afghana, who spoke against Amrit and Dasam Granth. He started Sachkhoj Academy which provides platform for independent researchers of Gurbani to perform unbiased research, and learning to use the Adi Granth dictionary lexical resource for the exegesis. Early life and education He was born at Manupur-Goslan, Khanna, Punjab to Bhagwan Singh and Harnam Kaur. At Khanna, he had his primary education and matriculated from AS High School in 1954. In 1956, he completed his Intermediate with Hindi as his major. Life and works at Buddha Dal He belongs to a Nihang family. His paternal uncles (Taya and Chacha) and first cousin served as Nihang in Budha Dal. His taya was jathedar of Budha Dal, Samrala Circle. Among others, Dharam Singh used to have discussions on Banis in Das Granthi with his coeval nephew. In 1960, Dharam Singh began to participate in religious gatherings called Jorh Melas, with Budha Dal. In 1962, he enrolled as a Nihang in Budha Dal at Hola Mohalla function in Anandpur Sahib, after Akhand Path of Dasam Granth. He served as a secretary in the Dal, which was under command of Akali Chet Singh, and used to manage ledgers and other paper work, being among the most formally educated in the Dal during that time. In 1965, he participated in Path Antar Masla and Pothi Mangal conventions along with Buddha Dal representations and offered various suggestions on both topics Gurbani research and Sachkhoj Academy He continued his research of Gurbani, led by the guidance in it such as, ‡®è‡®®‡®æ ‡®Ö‡®ñ‡®∞‡®æ ‡®Æ‡®π‡®ø ‡®ú‡©ã ‡®ó‡©Å‡®∞‡®Æ‡©Å‡®ñ‡®ø ‡®¨‡©Ç‡®ù‡©à ‡®§‡®ø‡®∏‡©Å ‡®∏‡®ø‡®∞‡®ø ‡®≤‡©á‡®ñ‡©Å ‡®® ‡®π‡©ã‡®à ‡••‡©®‡••(Adi Granth, 432) and ‡®¨‡®ø‡®¶‡®ø‡®Ü ‡®∏‡©ã‡®ß‡©à ‡®§‡®§‡©Å ‡®≤‡®π‡©à ‡®∞‡®æ‡®Æ ‡®®‡®æ‡®Æ ‡®≤‡®ø‡®µ ‡®≤‡®æ‡®á‡••(Adi Granth, 938): he concluded that Gurbani is self-contained and that it provides its own explanations by itself. That the exposition of Gurbani can only be conducted best taking the ‚Äòformless being‚Äô as focal point, and not like the way the subject has been treated in the previous Expositions. From 1970-92, he had discourses with people of various religious affiliations like Yogis, Bairagis, Kabirpanthis, Muslims, Pundits etc., during his stay in Garhmukteshwar, (Uttar Pradesh). In 1992, he returned to Khanna and started Gurmat classes on request of Bhai Iqbal Singh of Missionary College aftertheir mutual discussions. In 1994, Sachkhoj Academy came into being.

It comprises the most senior figures within the opposition, headed by the leader of the opposition as the counterpart to the prime minister of Australia. The shadow cabinet is the highest level of the shadow ministry (or \\"opposition frontbench\\"), along with other less senior shadow ministers (equivalent to the government's \\"outer ministry\\") and shadow assistant ministers. The members of the shadow ministry are assigned one or more portfolios, usually though not necessarily corresponding to an existing ministerial portfolio within the government. They served as the opposition's chief spokesperson on matters within their portfolio, and during parliamentary question time may direct questions at their government equivalent. If the opposition forms government, such as through winning a federal election, it is typical for members of the shadow ministry to retain the same portfolio. The current shadow ministry was formed by Anthony Albanese on 2 June 2019, following his election as leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Role and functions According to , the shadow cabinet exists as a \\"recognised component of the parliamentary system\\" but \\"the functions, roles and practices of the Shadow Cabinet are far less clear than those of the Cabinet\\". The role of the shadow ministry in making opposition policy has varied. Meets of shadow cabinet are less formal than actual cabinet meetings, typically lasting a shorter time. History In May 1965, the Australian Labor Party Caucus voted to establish a formal shadow ministry of 25 members. This replaced an earlier \\"opposition executive\\" consisting of 14 members. Since 1987, the shadow ministry has had at least as many members as the ministry, and sometimes more. Shadow parliamentary secretaries (known as shadow assistant ministers since 2016) were first appointed in 1990. Salary and benefits Ordinary shadow ministers are entitled to either a 20 or 25 percent loading on top of the base parliamentary salary of $211,250 (as of 1 July 2019). The loading depends on the number of shadow ministers. Officeholders within the opposition receive higher loadings, up to 87 percent for the leader of the opposition. Historically, ordinary shadow ministers received no additional salary compared to backbenchers but were granted an additional staffing allowance. Current composition The current shadow cabinet was formed by Anthony Albanese on 2 June 2019, following his election as leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) after the party's defeat at the 2019 federal election.

He is generally counted as the twenty-eighth in the list of 63 Nayanars. He is described as a contemporary of Sambandar (first half of the 7th century CE), one of the most prominent Nayanars. Life The life of Tiruneelanakka Nayanar is described in the Tamil Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. Tiruneelanakka Nayanar was born in Sattamangai (Thirusathamangai/Satthamangkai), an important town in the Chola kingdom. The town is currently called Seeyathamangai, Nagapattinam district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The Ayavantheeswarar temple dedicated to the god Shiva, patron of Shaivism, stands in this town. Tiruneelanakka was born in a family of Brahmins (priest caste), whose duty was to recite the Vedic scriptures. An expert in the Vedas, he was a staunch devotee of Shiva and served his devotees, by washing their feet and welcoming them to his home. He used to worship in the temple as the Agamic texts. Once on the day of Poornima (the full moon day), Tiruneelanakka and his wife went to the Shiva shrine. While Tiruneelanakka was performing his daily ritual worship of the lingam (the aniconic form of Shiva worshipped as the central icon in temples), a spider fell from his web on the lingam. The wife blew away the spider, wherein some saliva could have fallen on the lingam. In some versions, she goes a step further and spits on the spot where the spider falls. This action was in accordance with the tradition of spitting on a part of a child where the spider fell so as the poison of the spider does not spread in the body. Tiruneelanakka considered her action blasphemous and asked the wife what she had done. She replied she just blew away the spider as per tradition. The infuriated Brahmin said that she had contaminated the lingam by her saliva, as per Agamic scriptures and she should have removed the spider by some other means. The Brahmin offered rituals to purify the lingam and apologized to the god. Further, he abandoned his wife in fury. While the wife spent her night in the temple, Tiruneelanakka went home and slept. Shiva appeared in Tiruneelanakka's dream. While a part of the body was normal, rest of it was swollen by the spider's poison. Shiva remarked that his normal area was where Tiruneelanakka's wife had blown/spat. Tiruneelanakka realized that devotion (love) was superior to rituals. In the dawn, he went dancing to the temple and worshipped Ayavantheeswarar. He returned with his wife. Tiruneelanakka continued to serve Shiva and his devotees with love. Sambandar (pictured) visited the house of Tiruneelanakka Nayanar. Having heard of the child saint Sambandar's glories, Tiruneelanakka visited to meet him in person. Tiruneelanakka heard that the Nayanar Sambandar accompanied by another Nayanar Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar and an entourage of devotees were coming to Sattamangai. Tiruneelanakka decorated Sattamangai for welcoming Sambandar and hosted him at his home. He honoured Sambandar with due respect. Tiruneelanakka made numerous arrangements for Sambandar to spend the night at his house. Sambandar also suggested that Yazhpanar and his wife - who were travelling minstrels and composed music to Sambandar's hymns - be given accommodation. The caste-conscious host was uneasy inviting the Shudra (low-caste) couple of Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar and his wife home. After insistence by Sambanar, the host gave them a place to sleep near the homa kunda, the fire altar used for sacrifices. The fire of homa kunda shone brightly in the night, giving testimony to the couple's devotion. Tiruneelanakka discerned that devotion is superior to caste barriers too. Sambandar accompanied Tiruneelanakka to the Ayavantheeswarar temple and composed a hymn in honour of the god and his host Tiruneelanakka Nayanar. Tiruneelanakka wanted to accompany Sambanar on his travels, but the child saint instructed Tiruneelanakka to stay in Sattamangai and serve Ayavantheeswarar and his devotees. Sambanar left and Tiruneelanakka complied. After a while, Sambandar invited Tiruneelanakka Nayanar to his wedding in Thirumana Nallur (presently known as Achalpuram). Tiruneelanakka officiated as the presiding priest of the wedding ceremony. After the wedding, Sambandar, his bride and the wedding party went the Shivaloka Thyagar temple of Shiva, in Thirumana Nallur. Sambandar prayed to Shiva, seeking salvation. Shiva appeared as a blazing flame and granted his wish. Then Sambandar, his bride and all the wedding guests, including Tiruneelanakka Nayanar merged in the Light of Shiva. Remembrance The images of the Nayanars are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. One of the most prominent Nayanars, Sundarar (8th century) venerates Tiruneelanakka Nayanar in the Tiruthonda Thogai, a hymn to Nayanar saints, calling him Nilanakkan of Sattamangai. As mentioned in the earlier section, a hymn by Sambanar also honours him. An image of Tiruneelanakka Nayanar is worshipped in Ayavantheeswarar temple, the Shiva temple in his native village. Tiruneelanakka Nayanar is worshipped in the Tamil month of Vaikasi, when the moon enters the Mula nakshatra (lunar mansion). He is depicted with a crown and folded hands (see Anjali mudra). He receives collective worship as part of the 63 Nayanars. Their icons and brief accounts of his deeds are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. Their images are taken out in procession in festivals.

India visit  The objective of Dharmasvamin's tour of India was to visit Bodh Gaya and to study the Buddhist texts with the Indian scholars. However, by the time he reached India, the Buddhist sites in eastern India had declined. According to Dharmasvamin's biography, when he visited Uddandapura, it was the residence of a Turushka (Turkic) military commander. The Vikramashila had been completely destroyed by the Turushka army. At Nalanda, there were 80 small viharas, which had been abandoned after being damaged by the Turushkas, and only two of the viharas were functional. Less than hundred monks resided there, and a local king named Buddhasena financially supported the Nalanda's 90-year abbot Rahula Shribhadra.

It is the earliest surviving example of polyphonic music written in English.Deeming, Helen, Deo Gracias Anglia!: The Trinity Carol Roll, Obsidion (Classical Communications Ltd) 2012, CD709. Derived from Helen Deeming's longer The sources and origin of the 'Agincourt Carol', Early Music, Vol 35, No 1, February 2007, pp. 23‚Äì36 Compiled after 1415, it contains the earliest of two manuscript sources for the Agincourt Carol which tells of Henry V's victory at the Battle of Agincourt, as well as several early Christmas carols. The majority of texts are in Middle English (in a Norfolk dialect) with some of the carols alternating between Latin and Middle English, a common form for carols of the period known as macaronic.Jeffrey, David L., Early English Carols and the Macaronic Hymn, Floreligium Vol 4 (1982) 210‚Äì227  Description  Parchment scrolls were a common method of documentation in the Middle Ages, being both cheaper and easier to transport and store than bound books. However, their lack of protective covers meant they were comparatively prone to damage and loss. The Trinity Roll's provenance is unknown; the manuscript was given to Trinity College by Henricus Octavus Roe of Baldock in 1838, but is not recorded before this time.Parishes: Stotfold, A History of the County of Bedford: Volume 2 Victoria County History, London, 1908. pp 300‚Äì304James, Montague Rhodes The Western Manuscripts in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge: A Descriptive Catalogue Volume III (Cambridge, 1900‚Äì4), 247‚Äì8 The scroll is made from vellum long and wide.Hayward, Paul, The Agincourt Carol, Medieval Primary Sources‚ÄîGenre, Rhetoric and Transmission, Department of History, Lancaster University When rolled, it forms a cylinder approximately in diameter. The carols are noted in mensural notation on five-line staves. The beginning of each song is marked by decorative initials in blue ink with red adornments and each stanza is marked by a smaller blue or red initial. The text is handwritten in the Cursiva Anglicana script of the period, a form of writing initially used for letters and legal documents which soon became the most commonly used script for copying English literary texts of the period, for example the manuscripts of Geoffrey Chaucer and William Langland.Manuscripts and Special Collections ‚Äì Handwriting Styles, University of Nottingham 2011 A faded inscription is at the head of the roll, and the outer side of the roll (dorse) has prayers for four masses inscribed by another, later hand. Analysis of the dialect in the carols on the roll imply that the scribe was from South Norfolk: the inclusion of Deo Gracias Anglia referencing Henry V's victory at Agincourt in 1415 gives an indication of the time frame of the composition of the carols. Some sources, for example J.A. Fuller Maitland suggest that carols were all composed by the same hand, but whether this was the scribe is unknown.Fuller Maitland, J. A., ed., English carols of the fifteenth century: from a MS. roll in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge (London, 1891), vii‚Äìviii  Contents  The thirteen carols included in the roll are as follows:The James Catalogue Of Western Manuscripts O.3.58, Trinity College Library, Cambridge 2014 #Hail mary ful of grace (Hail Mary full of grace) #Nowel nowel (Nowell nowell) #Alma redemptoris mater (Loving Mother of our Saviour) #Now may we syngyn (Now may we sing) #Be mery be mery (Be merry be merry) #Nowel syng we now (Nowell sing we now) #Deo gracias Anglia (England give thanks to God) (a. k. Agincourt Carol) #Now make we merthe (Now make we mirth) #Abyde I hope (Abide I hope) #Qwat tydyngis bryngyst yu massager (What tidings bring you messenger?) #Eya martir stephane (Eia [exclamation] martyr Stephen) #Prey for us ye prynce of pees (Pray for us ye prince of peace) #Ther is no rose of swych vertu (There is no rose of such virtue)  Texts  Christmas forms the subject of the majority of the carol's texts; six are on the subject of the Nativity of Jesus, two are about Saint Stephen and Saint John the Evangelist respectively, whose feast-days are on 26 and 27 December and three are Marian texts praising the Virgin Mary. The two remaining carols are a Christian moral text and the Agincourt Carol. It is speculated that the latter may have formed part of a pageant staged in London in November 1415. The texts are all composed in Middle English, but several are macaronic, incorporating Latin phrases from the liturgy of the Catholic Church, often as their burdens (choruses found at the beginning of the texts and repeated after each verse). For example, in the Agincourt Carol every stanza ends with the phrase Deo gracias ('Thanks be to God') ‚Äì as all church services were conducted in Latin, even non-speakers would have been familiar with their meaning.  Music  Although a large body of medieval carol texts survive, the Trinity Roll is almost unique in also containing the music for the carols. In his 1891 study of the carols, J Fuller Maitland opines: > Few of the songs have absolute melodic beauty such as would make them > popular nowadays...[but] they have a special value, since they are almost > the only existing specimens of English music of the period, or at all events > the only specimens which have not been tampered with before reaching us in > their modern dress. They are especially valuable, moreover, as being almost > without a doubt the work of one composer...The similarity of certain > passages is so remarkable (compare the opening bars of VIII and XIII) that > there can be little doubt that the roll is a genuine transcript of original > works by one composer, not a mere collection of stray pieces. Modern scholars of early music are more complimentary, particularly of their writing for multiple independent voices. Dr Helen Deeming notes that the carols are: > complex and intricate, and could only have been composed, sung and notated > by highly trained musicians. Their part-writing, for two or three > independent voices, is of a musical sophistication that goes well beyond the > plainsong that formed the musical bread-and-butter of most medieval choirs.  Performance and recordings  Of the carols, \\"There is No Rose of Such Virtue\\" has re-entered the repertoire, appearing in its original polyphonic form in services such as A Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols from King's College Cambridge. Alternative settings by John Joubert and Benjamin Britten using the text of the carol have also been composed. The Agincourt Carol, which also survives in a contemporaneous version in the Bodleian Library is also well-known, for example appearing in an arrangement by William Walton for Laurence Olivier's 1944 film Henry V. The composer Ernest Farrar used the Agincourt Carol as the basis for his 1918 Heroic Elegy: For Soldiers.Andrew Achenbach Farrar Orchestral Works, review Gramophone Magazine July 1998 The Alamire consort recorded the complete carol roll in the Wren Library at Trinity College in September 2011, available on CD on the Obsidion label (CD709).Trinity Carol Roll, Alamire website  References   External links  *Interactive Virtual Manuscript at the James Catalogue of Western Manuscripts website *Trinity College Library blog *Medieval carol MS at Hymns and Carols of Christmas website Category:15th-century manuscripts Category:Medieval music manuscript sources Category:Christmas carol collections ","title":"Trinity Carol Roll"},{"id":"44828434","text":"Lozon may refer to: * Lozon, a municipality in Manche (Normandy), Western France * as a French family name, derived from Lauzon, several persons, including: * photographer Lindsay Lozon * Canadian CEO Jeffrey Lozon See also *Luzon ","title":"Lozon (disambiguation)"},{"id":"44828444","text":"Orthodes linda, the linda wainscot moth, is a moth of the family Noctuidae.

The ferry was chartered by ANEK Lines from December 2014. On 28 December 2014, she caught fire in the Strait of Otranto, in the Adriatic Sea. Thirty people are believed to be dead as a result of the fire. The bodies of ten victims were found, while eighteen others remained missing. Additionally, two crewmembers of the Albanian tug Iliria were killed during the salvage operations on 30 December. According to ANEK Lines, the total number of passengers and crew, based on the ship's manifest, was 475. The Italian judge investigating the case determined that 499 people were officially on board the ferry due to overbooking, not including stowaways. Description The ship was long, with a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by two MAN B&W; 9L48/60B diesel engines, which could propel the ship at . History The ship was built in 2009 by Cantiere Navale Visentini, Porto Viro, Italy as Akeman Street for Ermine Street Shipping Co Ltd, London, United Kingdom. Her sister ships are , and . She has accommodation for 850 passengers and 2,286 lane metres of accommodation for vehicles. Between February and April 2010, she was chartered to T-Link. Following a refit in May 2011 at Valletta, Malta, she was chartered to Saremar and renamed Scintu in June 2011. In January 2013, she was chartered to Grande Navi Veloci, followed by a charter to Moby Lines in April 2013. In October 2013, Scintu was chartered to LD Lines. She was renamed Norman Atlantic in January 2014. On 29 August 2014, she made her final voyage with LD Lines, from Rosslare, County Wexford, Ireland to Saint-Nazaire, Loire-Atlantique, France and Gij√≥n, Asturias, Spain. In September 2014, she was chartered to Caronte & Tourist, followed by a charter to ANEK Lines in December 2014. After the 2014 fire, the ship was docked at Bari, Italy during the investigations and legal actions. In July 2019 the ship was towed to Aliaga, Turkey and scrapped. 2014 fire and evacuation Incident On 28 December 2014, Norman Atlantic caught fire in the Strait of Otranto, on a ferry run from Patras to Ancona. A fire broke out on the car deck just before 6:00 am local time, half an hour after leaving the port of Igoumenitsa, Greece, an intermediate stop, when she was northwest of the island of Corfu, northwest of the island of Othonoi. At the time she was carrying 222 vehicles, 487 passengers, and 55 crew.KeeptalkingGreece The heat from the fire permeated the entire ship, even starting to melt people's shoes on the reception deck. The incident happened in Greek territorial waters but with night closing in, the ship started drifting towards Albania. There were gale-force winds and lashing rain. Passengers assert that the order to abandon ship was not given until four hours after the fire had started. Despite their cabins filling with smoke, no alarm had sounded. They also state that the crew of Norman Atlantic gave them little assistance. One group of 49 managed to escape in a lifeboat, but others were prevented from doing so as two of the four lifeboats were destroyed by the fire. The lifeboats had a capacity of 160 people each. Survivors described \\"scenes from hell\\" on board the burning ship, with the ship's crew overwhelmed by the crisis and jungle law prevailing rather than an orderly evacuation. Those in the lifeboat were rescued by the Singapore-registered container ship and landed at Bari, Italy. Several liferafts were also launched, but some of them capsized, causing the deaths by drowning or hypothermia of several occupants.Norman Atlantic: Neapolitan truck drivers drownedNorman Atlantic disaster: \\"I prayed and God helped me\\" The merchant ship Aby Jeannette rescued 39 people from Norman Atlantic's liferafts and brought them to Taranto, and the tanker Genmar Argus rescued a Norman Atlantic crewmember from the sea.Survivors of Norman Atlantic: \\"We held the children in our arms and prayed\\" Other people in the sea or in the rafts were rescued by helicopters.

Spirit of Piraeus, which rescued the 49 people from the lifeboat, was previously named AS Andalucia, as seen in this 2011 photograph. Rescue An international rescue effort, led and coordinated by the Italian Coast Guard, was started to evacuate the 466 passengers and crew on board. Greek Defence Minister Nikos Dendias stated that Italian authorities had responded to a Greek request for assistance and that the Italian Coast Guard had assumed control of the rescue operation. The Italian ferry Cruise Europa rescued 69 passengers and brought them to Igoumenitsa. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said that first passengers were rescued by a helicopter and that his government was working with the Greek government. As darkness fell on 28 December, the Italian Navy said that a tugboat, Marietta Barretta, had finally been able to attach a line to the ferry. Greek Marine Minister Miltiadis Varvitsiotis confirmed the towing operation but said he did not know the destination of the tugboat; although Albania was \\"much closer\\", he said the final decision rested with the Italian rescuers who \\"know the situation better\\". Prime Minister Renzi informed reporters that the ferry was evacuated and that Captain Giacomazzi was the last one to leave the ship at 2.50pm. At least twelve people were killed as a direct result of the fire, and an additional two Albanian tugboat crewmembers were killed during salvage operations on 30 December when a connecting cable snapped. Eight people were injured in the original incident. Officials stated that one person died after jumping from the burning ship. A 62-year-old Greek man was the first of the fatalities to be recovered. On 30 December the number of people on board the ferry was revised to 499; 487 passengers and 12 crew. The number of people unaccounted for was revised to 179 by Italian authorities. On 1 January 2015 the number of people not accounted for was 98 according to the Italian prosecutor Giuseppe Volpe, but according to the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry 18 people were still missing. On 3 January 2015 Mr. Volpe said that the number of unaccounted persons from the fire was 10 to 15, while Greek authorities said the number was up to 19, including nine Greek men. Three of the rescued people who were on board the Norman Atlantic were Afghan illegal immigrants who stowed aboard in lorries in the hold. Judge Volpe said that he expected that more bodies were to be found on the ferry. Among those killed was Ilia Kartozia, a Georgian Orthodox priest, who, according to an eyewitness, helped other to evacuate, but the rescuers failed to save him. His body was recovered off Lecce on 30 December 2014. Norman Atlantic was towed to the port of Brindisi, Italy, arriving there on 2 January 2015. The ship has been sequestered for the investigation. On 6 January, a lifeboat from the Norman Atlantic was found on a beach near Valona, Albania. The Norman Atlantic continued to burn in port for almost two weeks until 10 January 2015, when firefighters were finally able to enter the hull for inspection. On 15 January 2015 the Italian authorities announced that 9 people from the Norman Atlantic (in addition to the two from the tug Iliria) were confirmed dead and 18 were missing. On 23 January it was announced that one more person was missing. On 2 February 2015, just before the boat was due to be towed to Bari, a second body was discovered in the truck parking area. In the same days, the bodies of three people, presumably belonging to some of the missing, were found on the coast of Corfu and Apulia.Body found on Corfu coast believed to be of Norman Atlantic passengerCorpo sulla spiaggia: si verificher√† se appartiene a disperso di Norman AtlanticCadavere trovato in mare a largo di Lecce, forse un disperso del naufragio Norman Atlantic On 4 February, it was announced that the death toll was now twelve dead, with eighteen still missing. As of 14 February 2017, the boat was docked in the port of Bari. In 2019 the ship left the port of Bari with destination Aliaga Turkey and in there scrapped after 3 years which was anchored at the port of Bari Investigations Italian authorities opened a criminal investigation into the fire. The investigation would determine whether or not criminal negligence played a part in the fire. Judge Giuseppe Volpe is in charge of the investigation, which could bring charges of culpable shipwreck. The ship had been inspected at Patras, Greece on 19 December; six serious deficiencies had been found, relating to emergency lighting, fire doors and lifesaving capacity on board the vessel. The owners had been served with a notice giving them fifteen days to remedy the deficiencies. On 2 January 2015 the prosecutor‚Äôs office in Bari widened the investigation, and put two other crew members and two representatives of the Greek ferry line ANEK Lines, which chartered the Norman Atlantic, under investigation. Greek authorities have also started a preliminary investigation. Possible charges include \\"disruption of shipping which could lead to endangerment of persons\\", and arson. Rear Admiral John Lang, formerly Chief Inspector at Britain's Marine Accident Investigation Branch, said the emergency, under freezing stormy conditions at night ‚Äúchallenges many of the established conventions and wisdom on how a mass rescue should be conducted.‚Äù He said that, in the course of the investigation, the right rather than the convenient conclusions should be drawn, adding \\"Rarely has the outcome of a comprehensive and thorough investigation been more important for improving safety at sea.\\" A Turkish passenger reported, as a possible cause, that illegal Afghan immigrants, who had boarded the ship concealed in a lorry, had lit a fire in the ship's garage to keep themselves warm. Another possible cause is sparks caused by trucks scraping the sides of the vessel. Preliminary underwater inspections of the Norman Atlantic revealed that the water intake pipes of the fire sprinkler system were clogged with mussels; additional inspections are necessary to determine if this blockage contributed to the fire's spreading. Although the voyage data recorder (black box) has been recovered, still by mid-March no data have been extracted, apparently because the heat of the fire caused the plastic to melt onto the hard disk. Recordings of the Voyage data recorder published on 7 October 2015, say that the fire sprinkler system wasn't working correctly and instead of spraying water there was smoke coming from the system. The investigations also state that there was a truck that had the engine working. Smoke was coming from the truck prior to the fire.

Mizerany was known in St. Louis, Missouri for the outsized personality he displayed as the star of his own advertisements. Mizerany grew up in the LaSalle Park neighborhood of St. Louis and was graduated from McKinley High School. He was the youngest of seven children; his parents were Lebanese Maronite immigrants. His father taught English to other Lebanese immigrants at St. Raymond‚Äôs Maronite Church. In 1946 Steve‚Äôs two oldest brothers opened the Mizerany Brothers appliance store on Broadway. Steve Mizerany went to work for his brothers and handled the store's television advertisements. All television was live at that time, and Mizerany ad-libbed the commercials as the cameras were rolling. Here he developed his zany persona which attracted attention and some complaints. In 1972, Mizerany opened the Mizerany-Farhatt New Deal Appliance Company next to Bevo Mill on Gravois Road in St. Louis with his childhood friend Joe Farhatt. Here he perfected his advertising style, an admixture of his distinct voice, enthusiastic persona, outlandish attire, slapstick humor, and stunts such as roller-skating in the store's aisles (he also sometimes skated during regular business, rolling up to customers and introducing himself). Taglines included the assertion that the store was home of the \\"decent boys\\". Mizerany also guest-starred in other ads for other businesses. After his death, Mizerany was honored by the St. Louis Board of Aldermen for his charitable activities which included organizing the annual St. Louis police relief celebrity ballgame. Mizerany married Sue Grant in 1947; they were divorced in 1973. They had five children: Catherine Mizerany, Stephanie Dorris, Veronica Miller, Steve Mizerany, Jr. and Vincent Mizerany. In the late 1970's, Mizerany became the center of a litigation scandal for allegedly selling used appliances in new packaging. Amidst the scandal, several women whom worked stepped up and accused Mizerany of sexual harassment and child abandonment; citing children out of wedlock whom he owed back child support on. The issues were settled out of court with a suspected settlement.

It coined the name for the Khrushchev Thaw, the period of liberalization following the 1953 death of Stalin. The novel marked a break both from Ehrenburg's earlier purely pro-Soviet work, and from previous ideas about socialist realism. Summary The novel follows three main characters: Ivan Vasilievich Zhuravlev, a despotic factory manager, Vladimir Andreevich Pukhov, a painter working for the government, and Saburov, an unsuccessful colleague of Pukhov. Other characters include Vera Sherer, a Jewish doctor who is accused in the Doctors' plot. Reception The novel was very successful, selling all 45,000 copies of the first edition in a single day. It drew criticism from the authorities for mentioning the Great Purge and other negative aspects of Stalinism; in late 1954 the Second Congress of Soviet Writers harshly criticized it, along with Vera Panova's novel The Seasons and Leonid Zorin's play Guests. Konstantin Simonov, then secretary of the Union of Writers of the USSR, accused Ehrenburg \\"of caricaturing ... artistic life.\\" However, Ehrenburg was given a chance to defend himself in the Literaturnaya Gazeta.

One learns by hearing, it is the first stage of learning, the initiation when the traditional Vedic doctrines are passed on by the teachers. Shravana is the mental activity by which the texts are understood in order to know the Truth about Brahman. The Sruti is the seed of Vedantic knowledge sown by the Guru (teacher) in the mind of sisya ('disciple') who then tends that seed by his shravana, manana and nididhyasana. Yajnavalkya recommended to his wife, Maitreyi, the form of sadhana which consisted of darshana , shravana, manana and nididhyasana; darshana refers to seeing and realizing God or Brahman. He told her that the first stage in spiritual quest is Shravana, and one has to become a shravaka for whom hearing or shabda creates interests, then sorts out those interests, sifts the essential from the non-essential, removes confusion and doubts, and naturally leads to the next stage, Manana. Shravana is a psychological exercise. Vidyaranya in his Panchadasi (Sloka I.53) explains that:- :‡§á‡§§‡•ç‡§•‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§®‡•Å‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡§£‡§Ç ‡§≠‡§µ‡•á‡§§‡•ç :‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡•Å‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•Å ‡§§‡§§‡•ç |the finding out or discovery of the true significance of the identity of the individual self and the supreme Universal Self with the great sayings is what is known as shravana; and to arrive at the possibility of its validity through logical reasoning is what is called manana. Hearing and discrimination are beneficial to knowledge, both are inter-connected and the internal means for the acquisition of Self-knowledge, the former involves analysis and argument, and the latter is the unceasing reflection on the non-duality of the individual self.

Description and history The Sunday River Bridge is a Paddleford truss bridge spanning the Sunday River in western Newry, Maine, a small town in western Oxford County. It is long and wide, with a total height of , and rests on cut granite abutments. Its internal clearance is in height and in width. The trusses consist of a series of crossed braces between King posts. It has an extended gable roof clad in wood shingles. The sides are finished in vertical boarding for about half their height, and the ends are boarded from the gable down to the tops of the portals. The first bridge on the site, funded by the town (as were all subsequent bridges), was built in 1811. That bridge was washed away in spring flooding in 1869, and a replacement built in 1871 collapsed that same fall. This bridge was built in 1872, with careful attention to its structural stability. A major spring flooding event in 1927 washed out many bridges in the region, but this bridge was spared because the floodwaters bypassed its foundations. The bridge was bypassed by a realignment of Sunday River Road in 1955, and is now open to pedestrian traffic.

Sneeze Guard on a Teachers DeskSneeze guard installed on a teachers desk A sneeze guard, sneezeguard, or cough shield is an acrylic or glass screen designed to protect food or people from the exposure to respiratory droplets, which are dispensed when coughing, sneezing or even talking. Sneeze guards have been in use in restaurants for decades. With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, sneeze guards have been installed in public places like offices, schools and supermarkets to reduce the risk of infection through respiratory droplets. In February 2020, the World Health Organization advised the use of \\"physical barriers to reduce exposure to the COVID-19 virus, such as glass or plastic windows\\", which is in line with the advice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends to \\"Place a barrier (e.g. sneeze guard) between employees and customers\\".  Styles of Sneeze Guards  Freestanding Sneeze Guards: These types of sneeze guards are made up of a clear plastic panel with a system designed to hold it up. The uses of a freestanding sneeze guard are endless. They may be used on reception desks, conference tables, serving tables etc... A freestanding sneeze guard can be used anywhere on a flat surface. Most freestanding sneeze guards are used on desks or raised surfaces. Some freestanding sneeze guards go from the floor to above the head and act as a clear wall. Others are designed to partition space form a seated level, like separating tables at a restaurant. Cubicle Sneeze Guards: These types of sneeze guards are made of a clear plastic panel with a system designed to mount the panel onto a cubicle partition. This type of sneeze guard has risen in popularity as many businesses look to reopen safely post COVID-19 outbreak. Many companies have come out with differing versions of cubicle sneeze guards Hanging Sneeze Guards: These types of sneeze guards are made up of a clear plastic panel hung from the ceiling at a desired height. This sort of sneeze guard can be customized to fit almost any purpose. These sneeze guards allow the end customer to decide where to protect. It also allows for a larger area of protection. These also tend to be the cheapest sneeze guards on the market Portable Sneeze Guards: These are the newest type of sneeze guards made available to the market in direct response to combat the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. A Portable Sneeze Guard improves upon the traditional sneeze guard by its collapsible design enabling its transformation into an easy-to-carry form. This sort of sneeze guard conveniently transports inside a backpack, briefcase, or similar everyday carry bag. Extending the benefits of regular sneeze guards, Portable Sneeze Guards used in schools, and university campuses, in restaurants and cafes, workplaces, or practically anywhere, provide a highly mobile barrier from respiratory droplets. A Portable Sneeze Guard fills a PPE-gap, further protecting children and adults from airborne infectious disease spread from sneezing, coughing, talking, laughing, or eating.  Types of Plastic  Sneeze guards are advertised under many different materials. Most companies will sell sneeze guards made of clear acrylic plastic. Acrylic is more well known under its commercial name Plexiglas is made of Poly(methyl methacrylate). This material is sold under a variety of names. Other commonly used materials are Polycarbonate, a more flexible less flammable plastic, and PETG. With growing concerns over sneeze guard use, the New York State Education Department released a memo claiming certain barriers must be polycarbonate due to fire code. A line in the memo reads \\"Note for installations where the sneeze guard is not fastened to a building element, the product would be considered a furnishing required to comply with MPS S205-13 b. Fire test criteria is required to be approved, ‚ÄúItems of obvious and questionable hazard avoided\\". For any sneeze guard in New York that does not require installation, i.e portable sneeze guards, may be made from Plexiglas.

After 1945 he became a party functionary in the German Democratic Republic and then an increasingly senior Police officer. He concluded his career as the first director of the Sachsenhausen National Memorial. Life Christian Mahler was born into a working family. His father was a Hamburg port worker, and Mahler's own working life started with an apprenticeship in shipbuilding. In 1924 he joined the Communist party and the RFB which was effectively the quasi-military wing of the Communist party. Mahler became an official of both organisations in Hamburg, and also employed with the Water-front quasi-military element (\\"M-Apparat\\") of the Communist Party's District leadership. Mahler was arrested in August 1933 for \\"resistance\\". In January of that year the NSDAP (Nazi party) had seized power, and the arrest should be seen in the context of their subsequent rapid imposition of one-party government on Germany. He was convicted and sentenced to a five-year prison term for \\"Preparation of High Treason together with severe Breach of the Peace and offences against Fire Arms Legislation\\".‚Äûwegen Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat in Tateinheit mit schwerem Landfriedensbruch und Vergehen gegen das Schusswaffengesetz‚Äú After serving his prison sentence he was not released, but was interned in October 1938 in the concentration camp at Sachsenhausen. In 1943 he was transferred from Sachsenhausen to a satellite concentration camp at Falkensee, still in the Berlin area. In the end it was the Soviets who, in April 1945, released him from internment. In May 1945 he joined the quasi-military police service which the Soviets were setting up within their zone in what remained of Germany. By 1952 the entire area had been changed into a separate state, the German Democratic Republic, and Mahler had occupied a succession of senior positions within the police service in the Mecklenburg district. Additionally, in 1946 he joined the new country's newly formed ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). In 1949 he underwent a period of training at the Berlin Police Academy, and from 1950 till 1953 he served as the Police Chief both in Mecklenburg and for the adjacent Schwerin district, while holding the rank of Police Inspector/Colonel. In June 1953 serious public unrest triggered a heightened level of nervousness on the part of the national leadership, and in November 1953 Christian Mahler was relieved of his police functions, after it had been determined that he had had contacts with the west (\\"Westkontakten\\"). The contacts in question seem to have involved his long-term partner, a Jewish survivor of the regime in the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, whose parents lived in Hamburg. By this time the frontier down the middle of Germany, which in 1945 had simply divided the land controlled by the Soviets from that under US or British administration, had assumed a degree of permanence which had not been universally anticipated back in 1945: Hamburg was on the \\"wrong\\" side of it from the perspective of the German Democratic Republic. In December 1953 Christian Mahler obtained a position as Second Secretary of the Party's BPO (business management organisation) at the \\"Elbewerft Boizenburg\\", a ship building business located along the lower reaches of the River Elbe which had somehow avoided being either destroyed during the war or physically crated up and shipped to the Soviet Union in 1945/46, and which later gained a reputation for building river cruisers: during the early 1950s the ship yard was completing \\"Reparations Contracts\\" for the Soviets and specialising increasingly in fishing boats, notably for the coastal herring fishing business in the Baltic Sea (in German \\"East Sea\\"). Mahler remained with the \\"Elbewerft\\" ship yard till February 1955. In March 1955 he moved to a position as BPO Secretary (\\"first secretary of the factory party organisation of the SED\\") with the VEB \\"KGW Schweriner Maschinen- und Anlagenbau\\" heavy engineering company at Schwerin. In 1959/60 he was briefly a member of the regional council in Schwerin, heading up the Home Affairs department. In 1960 he became the first Director of the Sachsenhausen National Memorial, which was a reconfiguration of the former Nazi-Soviet concentration camp in line with the political imperatives of the time. Mahler retained this position till his death in 1966. At the same time he was a member of the national Committee of Anti-Fascist Resistance Fighters.

Eight little cities were created by those autochthonous inhabitants that maintained political links with the Byzantine Empire (that defended these cities allowing their commerce). Thomas Jackson: Recovery of Roman municipalities. p. 14-16 The original name of the cities was Jadera, Spalatum, Crespa, Arba, Tragurium, Vecla, Ragusium and Cattarum. The language and the laws were initially Latin, but after a few centuries they developed their own neo-Latin language (the \\"Dalmatico\\"), that lasted until the 19th century. The cities were maritime centres with a huge commerce mainly with the Italian peninsula and with the growing Republic of Venice. History Dalmatia after the fall of the Roman Empire consisted of a group of autochthonous coastal cities functioning much like city-states, with extensive autonomy, but without control of the rural hinterland controlled by the Slavic tribes who arrived after 640 AD.Giovanni Cattalinich. \\"Storia della Dalmazia\\" V chapter Ethnically, Dalmatia started out as a Roman region, with a romance culture that began to develop independently, forming the now-extinct Dalmatian language called \\"Dalmatico\\". So, these cities were characterized by common Latin laws, Catholic religion, the same romance language, common commerce and the same political/administrative structures and entities. The eight City-states were: * Jadera, later called \\"Zara\\" in Italian and \\"Zadar\\" in Croatian. Originally a small island in the central Dalmatia coast * Spalatum, it: \\"Spalato\\" and cr: \\"Split\\". Initially created inside the Diocletian Palace * Crespa, it: \\"Cherso\\" and cr: \\"Cres\\". In an island in northern Dalmatia * Arba, it: \\"Arbe\\" and cr: \\"Rab\\".

Originally a small island in southern Dalmatia * Cattarum, it: \\"Cattaro' and cr: \\"Kotor\\". Inside the fiord of Montenegro. Later were added other cities in north-central Dalmatia, like Sebenicum (now ≈†ibenik), Flumen (now Rijeka) and Pagus (now Pag). Indeed, in the Early Medieval period, Byzantine Dalmatia was ravaged by an Avar invasion that destroyed its capital, Salona, in 639 AD, an event that allowed for the settlement of the nearby Diocletian's Palace in Spalatum by Salonitans, greatly increasing the importance of the city. The Avars were followed by the great South Slavic migrations.Curta Florin. \\"Southwestern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250\\". Introduction The Slavs, loosely allied with the Avars, permanently settled the region in the first half of the 7th century AD and remained its predominant ethnic group ever since. The Croats soon formed their own realm: the Principality of Dalmatian Croatia ruled by native Princes of Guduscan origin. The meaning of the geographical term \\"Dalmatia\\", now shrunk to the cities and their immediate hinterland. These cities and towns remained influential as they were well fortified and maintained their connection with the Byzantine Empire. The two communities were somewhat hostile at first, but as the Croats became Christianized this tension increasingly subsided. A degree of cultural mingling soon took place, in some enclaves stronger, in others weaker, as Slavic influence and culture was more accentuated in Ragusium and Cattarum while the influence from the Italian peninsula was stronger in the northern Dalmatia islands and in Jadera and Spalatum. Around 950 AD as the Dalmatian city states gradually lost all protection by Byzantium, being unable to unite in a defensive league hindered by their internal dissensions, they had to turn to Venice for support. Each of the Dalmatian city states needed protection (even from Narentane piracy), based mostly on economic reasons. In the year 1000 AD an expedition of Venetian ships in coastal Istria and Dalmatia secured the Venetian suzerainty in the area, and the Narentines, Slav pirates, were suppressed permanently. In the occasion Doge Orseolo named himself \\"Duke of Dalmatia\\", starting the colonial Empire of Venice. The Venetians, to whom the Dalmatians were already bound by language and culture, could afford to concede liberal terms as its main goal was to prevent the development of any dangerous political or commercial competitor on the eastern Adriatic. The seafaring community in Dalmatia looked to Venice as the new \\"queen\\" of the Adriatic sea. In return for protection, these 8 \\"neolatin\\" cities often furnished a contingent to the army or navy of their suzerain, and sometimes paid tribute either in money or in kind. Arbe (now Rab), for example, annually paid ten pounds of silk or five pounds of gold to Venice. The Dalmatian cities might elect their own chief magistrate, bishop and judges; their Roman law remained valid and they were even permitted to conclude separate alliances. In these centuries started to disappear the Dalmatian language, that was assimilated by the venetian dialect.Dalmatian was spoken on the Dalmatian coast from Fiume (now Rijeka) as far south as Cottorum (Kotor) in Montenegro.

Almost every city developed its own dialect, but the most important dialects we know of were Vegliot, a northern dialect spoken on the island of Curicta, and Ragusan, a southern dialect spoken in and around Ragusa (Dubrovnik). The cities of Jadera, Spalatum, Tragurium and Ragusium and the surrounding territories each changed hands several times between Venice, Hungary and the Byzantium during the 12th century. In 1202, the armies of the Fourth Crusade rendered assistance to Venice by occupying Jadera, that started to be officially called Zara. In 1204 the same army conquered Byzantium and finally eliminated the Eastern Empire from the list of contenders on Dalmatian territory. The late 13th century was marked by a decline in external hostilities. The Dalmatian cities started accepting complete foreign sovereignty, mainly the one of the Republic of Venice. The only exception was Ragusium, that remained independent creating the Republic of Ragusa that lasted until the 1807 Napoleon conquest. From 1420 started the venetian domination of the other seven of the original Dalmatian City-States, that were fully integrated in the venetian (and Italian) society of the Italian Renaissance. Zara become the capital of Venetian Dalmatia - as part of the Stato da Mar- until the 1797 end of the Republic of Venice and in the next centuries the city was the main center of the Dalmatian Italians. The last speaker of any Dalmatian dialect of the Dalmatian City-States was Tuone Udaina (), who was accidentally killed in an explosion on June 10, 1898 in the island of Veglia (now Krk) With him disappeared the last vestige of the Dalmatian neolatin cities. His language Romance languages in Istria and Dalmatia (in ancient Italian) was studied by the scholar Matteo Bartoli, himself a native of nearby Istria, who visited him in 1897 and wrote down approximately 2,800 words, stories, and accounts of his life, which were published in a book that has provided much information on the vocabulary, phonology, and grammar of the language. Bartoli wrote in Italian and published a translation in German (') in 1906: this book is considered the first on ethnic minority disappearance in world literature. Dalmatian Pale The boundaries of the eight original Dalmatian City-States were defined by the so-called Dalmatian Pale, similar to the one existing in Ireland under British control and called The Pale. The word pale derives ultimately from the Latin word palus, meaning stake, specifically a stake used to support a fence.\\"Palus\\". Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary. MICRA, Inc.Palisade is derived from the same root. From this came the figurative meaning of boundary and eventually the phrase beyond the pale, as something outside the boundary. The term was used not only for the \\"Pale\\" in Ireland and in Dalmatia but also for various other English colonial settlements, notably Pale of Calais, and later for the Jewish Pale in Russia. Historian Johannes Lucius added to the \\"Dalmatia Pale\\" (somewhat similar to the \\"English Pale\\" in Ireland, as boundary of Roman local laws) of these Dalmatian City-States even Fiume (now Rijeka) and Sebenico (now Sibenik), after the year 1000 when Venice started to take control of the region. Indeed, Fiume was the former Roman Tarsatica: the city of that medieval period was a small fortified town under the Italian Aquileia (and Pola) bishops, enclosed within the town walls which had several defense towers. The town, called Flumen, was granted autonomy in the 11th century by the bishop and was divided into two parts: in the upper part, there was a medieval castle/formerly Roman fort and the church of St. Vitus (thus the name 'Flumen Sancti Viti'), while in the lower part - the popular- there was a commercial and trading center where around the year 1000 many Italian merchants settled. 16th-century map of Sebenicum Sebenicum was the ancient Roman city of Burnum Sibenik: Rediscovery of Burnum (in Italian) destroyed by the Avars and rebuilt in the 9th century by the Croats. Pope Boniface VIII signed in 1298 a \\"bolla\\" that declared a bishop for the town, that so was to be a \\"Free City\\" from the local Ban Paul I ≈†ubiƒá of Bribir.History of Sibenik Furthermore, about Sebenico Thomas Jackson Thomas Jackson, Dalmatia, the Quarnero and Istria. 1887 wrote that: Lucius wrote even that Pagus (the Venetian Pago, now called Pag) had municipal autonomy virtually independent for centuries around the year 1000. In 1244 the Hungarian King B√©la IV named it a \\"Free royal city\\" and in 1376 Louis I of Hungary granted it autonomy. In 1409, Pago, together with the whole island, passed permanently to the Republic of Venice and had reconfirmed their communal autonomy guaranteed by a board of 50 civic local aristocratic families (this board was created in 1451).

The oldest portion of this wood frame house dates to about 1816, and was built by Ichabod Young, who erected the first fulling mill in Piscataquis County. The house is most remarkable for its high-quality interior woodwork, and for the artwork on the walls of several of its rooms, which includes paintings by Rufus Porter and stencilwork by Moses Eaton, Jr., two noted itinerant artists of the early-to-mid 19th century. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The Burgess Houses is a typical New England wood- frame connected homestead, consisting of a main block and two ells, which in this instance connect the main house to a modern one-car garage rather than the more typical barn or carriage house. The main block is a 1-1/2 story Cape style structure, five bays in width, with a large central chimney. Its centered entry is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a louvered transom. The flanking bays contain sash windows with louvered shutters. The first ell, also 1-1/2 stories, is three bays long, also with a central chimney and a centered entrance, and is narrower than the main block is wide. The second ell is also three bays wide, but the bays are narrower, and all have windows. All three sections have their primary facade facing north. The interior of the house includes woodwork that exhibits attention to detail, most notably in the paneling on the first floor. The highlight of the interior is the well-preserved artwork found throughout the main block, which includes paintings by the itinerant artist Rufus Porter, and stencilwork by Moses Eaton, Jr. Both of these artists are among the few documented to do such work in the early-to-mid 19th century, and probably executed this work c. 1820. Ichabod Young came to the area in 1816, and built a fulling mill on the north side of the Sebec River that same year. He probably built the main block of this house that same year, on the south side of the river. The ells were added c. 1830 and c. 1850. The house was owned in the late 19th century by Thomas Burgess.

Muhammad died after fleeing in 1220 or a year after on a deserted island in the Caspian sea. She fled with the harem and the children of Khwarazmshah, took the royal treasury, and drowned 26 hostages, sons of different conquered rulers. She passed through the Karakum and took refuge in the Ilal fortress, but the Mongols captured the fortress soon afterwards. She and all the people were captured. The sons of the Shah were killed, his women and daughters were distributed to the sons and associates of Genghis Khan.An- Nasawi, \\"Description of life of Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu\\". Chapter 18.

Biography  Dobrev studied geophysics in Sofia and then worked as an engineer at the Laboratory for underground nuclear geophysics and geochemistry (Bulgarian: –õ–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ø–æ –ø–æ–¥–∑–µ–º–Ω–∞ –∏ —è–¥—Ä–µ–Ω–∞ –≥–µ–æ—Ñ–∏–∑–∏–∫–∞ –∏ –≥–µ–æ—Ö–∏–º–∏—è). In 1991, Dobrev was elected as a member of the National Parliament and became part of the supreme council (Bulgarian: –í–∏—Å—à–∏—è —Å—ä–≤–µ—Ç) of BSP. After Lyubomir Nachev's resignation, Dobrev succeeded him as Minister of the Interior in the Zhan Videnov cabinet in 1996. Dobrev played an important role during the December 1996-February 1997 political deadlock in Bulgaria. After discontent against the economic policies of the Zhan Videnov government and the resulting inflation triggered massive protests, strikes as well as acts of civil disobedience, Dobrev (who was envisioned by the BSP as the next Prime Minister following Videnov's resignation) and Georgi Parvanov reached an agreement on 4 February 1997 with then Bulgarian president Petar Stoyanov not to attempt to form a new government under the Socialists' mandate (even though they were legally entitled to do so). This paved the way for the early Parliamentary elections and ended the political crisis. He died of cancer on 17 April 1999 in Sofia. In 2007, Dobrev was posthumously awarded with the \\"Justice, Freedom and Security\\" medal (Bulgarian: –º–µ–¥–∞–ª ‚Äû–ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å—ä–¥–∏–µ, —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∞, —Å–∏–≥—É—Ä–Ω–æ—Å—Ç‚Äú) by the Ministry of the Interior.

It is an location of excellence in Corvo\\", confirmed alderman Manuel Rita. In 2012, the council invested 38,000 Euros in the recuperation of the first of the three windmills, by a tradesman from the island of S√£o Miguel through the ProRural financing program within the European Union. The recuperation of the windmills was only possible after the original property-owners had ceded the structures to the municipality for five years.Associated with this remodelling project, the village of Corvo had also purchased a small whaling launch from Graciosa, which was recuperated and transported to the parish, to preserve the island's whaling tradition. Architecture The windmills are located at the isolated southern tip of Corvo, opposite the airfield on the small inclined parcel known as Ponta Negra, near the small light of Ponta Negra. The group consists of three, conical windmills, built from masonry stone: two plastered and painted white, while the other remains in a natural state.Lu√≠s Bettencourt (2008), p.34 It is covered in conical rooftop that rotates, made of wood, from which springs the main shaft and sail axis. The base of the windmills consists of circular basalt stone, broken by small symmetrical staircase.

The building still exists on the corner, and is a Raleigh Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Dr. Glascock and Dr. A.R. Tucker originally opened the hospital in 1914 on the corner of Peace and Halifax before moving to the Wake Forest & Glascock location, built and opened in 1920. The hospital continued to operate until 1978. According to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, \\"The building faces west set back off of Wake Forest Road with a landscaped front lawn and mature trees. The two-story, brick, hospital is a modified-\\"H\\"-type plan, a plan that was made popular by government funded hospitals and often adapted for community hospitals in the early part of the twentieth century. The Mary Elizabeth Hospital was built in the Colonial Revival style, but it has some Craftsman features, such as the exposed rafter tails, wide eaves, and hipped roof, which are echoed by the many Craftsman bungalows in the surrounding residential neighborhood. A large parking lot shared with the adjacent Medical Arts Building, accessible off Glascock Street and Lafayette Road, sits at the rear of the hospital building.\\" The hospital functioned as a successful medical center in Raleigh for many years until its closure in 1978. It has been credited by former Mary Elizabeth Hospital doctors as the site for the number of \\"firsts\\" that happened there. The first blood transfusion in North Carolina was given at Mary Elizabeth Hospital, the first pathological frozen section was handled there, the first doses of penicillin in Wake County were given there, the area's first modern obstetrical unit was started at the hospital, and Mary Elizabeth Hospital had the first radium treatments in Raleigh. In the mid to late 1960s, the doctors were realizing that Mary Elizabeth Hospital was no longer the modern facility that it had once been. New and sophisticated technologies and medical advances demanded a larger building with better equipment and much more space. The doctors of Mary Elizabeth Hospital decided that it as necessary to build a new hospital on a new site that would accommodate future expansion. The hospital was sold in 1970 to Charter Medical of Macon, Georgia, and a year later, the wheels were set in motion to build a hospital that would accommodate 150 patient beds. Legal battles with Rex and WakeMed Hospitals, which tried to block Mary Elizabeth Hospital's expansion plans, delayed the construction of the new hospital for six years. Charter Medical was unable to afford the delays, and after five years, Mary Elizabeth Hospital was sold to Hospital Corporation of America. Finally, the new hospital was built farther up on Wake Forest Road in 1978. On June 10, 1978 the doors to the new hospital officially opened, and Mary Elizabeth Hospital was officially closed. The new hospital was named Raleigh Community Hospital to reflect the past and future community role of the hospital. Many of the doctors and staff members made the transition to Raleigh Community Hospital, which became Duke Raleigh Hospital in 1998. When the hospital closed its doors in 1978, the United Way of Raleigh took up residence, using the old building as its local headquarters. The hospital building transitioned from medical facility to office space, but as one of the remaining small community hospitals in Raleigh and the surrounding area which served the medical needs of area citizens, Mary Elizabeth Hospital continues to be a community and historical landmark.

The owner of Sailshade Studios in Fall River, Massachusetts, she has designed, trademarked and fabricated an energy-efficient window shade.  Biography  Susan Mohl Powers, daughter of Judson Jasper Mohl and Florence (n√©e Kling) Mohl, was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, of Swedish ancestry. Her family lived in Kansas and also in New England, where she completed high school. Her interests in science and mathematics shaped her approaches to art. As a child she was fascinated by fossils; as an undergraduate, she conducted public open houses at Mount Holyoke College observatory. Powers was also a science teacher at a private school in Minnesota. Her early artistic influences included Buckminster Fuller and D‚ÄôArcy Wentworth Thompson's On Growth and Form. She married Alan W. Powers in 1966. They live in Westport, Massachusetts.  Education  Redwood Seed by Susan Mohl Powers Powers earned a baccalaureate in 1966 from Mount Holyoke College, having studied studio art, physics, and astronomy. She began her Master of Fine Arts in sculpture at the University of Minnesota, and completed a Master of Fine Arts in visual design in Massachusetts. She studied with Henry Rox, JƒÅnis Kalmƒ´te, Hui Ming Wang, Leonard DeLonga, and Harold Pattek. Early in her career, she created welded steel sculptures under Katherine Nash, who founded Katherine E. Nash Gallery at the University of Minnesota. Powers has written that her art is an effort to record imagery from scientific studies and observations: \\"I now see cellular and fossil-like forms everywhere. The expression might be a fabric sculpture. It might be an oil painting in which ribbed structures are sewn into the canvas before stretching. It might be works on paper; when I draw pastel nudes, the thighs, the breasts, and the torsos all break apart into geometric, refracted patterns of the expanding universe.\\"  Reception  left Powers' fine art abstracts and commercial fabrications have been well received. A 1979 New York Times reviewer wrote that some modern artists are \\"able to create successful mixtures of science and art. The mixtures by Susan Mohl Powers, now on view at the Squibb Gallery, are fascinating, relying heavily on both disciplines for their expression.\\" Acknowledging that a few pieces \\"might not be eminent successes\\", the review described most of her pieces as \\"striking for their adventurousness and for their emphatic presence... What makes these pieces interesting from an esthetic point of view is their apparent contradictory nature. One look might tell us that they are an Expressionist canvas using geometric shapes as imagery. Another look might tell us that they are soft sculpture. In fact, they work well as both.\\" Fabric Glass Blue Rose by Susan Mohl Powers A review in the Boston Globe described her solo installation of soft sculptures at the Nemasket Gallery in Fairhaven as \\"a series of gauzy, boxy fabric shapes suspended from the ceiling and moving gracefully in the air currents\\". It also highlighted her commercial ventures with Sailshades, and commented she \\"capitalized on the big open space by creating a series of sewn rectangles that, when hanging, stay open without folding or flopping, even though there is no armature other than the seams\\".

Built in 1846, it is a fine example of a Greek Revival house altered with Classical Revival features in the 20th century. It was home for 20 years to Samuel Cony, Governor of Maine from 1864 to 1867, and also his son-in-law, Joseph Homan Manley. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Cony House stands on Augusta's east side, on the east side of Stone Street (Maine State Route 9) opposite its junction with Caldwell Street. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a side gable roof. It is oriented with its main facade to the south, presenting a gable end to the street. That gable end is three bays wide, articulated by pilasters. The front is five bays wide, with the main entrance in the leftmost bay. It is set in a single-story projecting section, with a fully pedimented gable and entablature supported by paired columns, one a square paneled Doric column, the other a fluted round Ionic column. The interior retains most of its original woodwork. The house was built in 1846, and was from 1850 until his death in 1870 the home of Samuel Cony. Cony was long active in state politics, notably serving as Governor of Maine during the later years of the American Civil War. Following his death, it was home to Joseph Homan Manley, who had married his daughter. Manley was a prominent Republican political operative, who served in the state legislature. The house was designed by Alexander Jackson Davis, a leading American architect of the period, with alterations made about 1930 by John P. Thomas.

Free to participate in, RedditGifts was first created by Reddit user \\"kickme444\\" (the alias of Dan McComas), while working on freelance projects. The service involves signing up, filling out a profile based on the user's preferences, and agreeing to send a gift to a randomly assigned user. Overview The service is a gift exchange designed for Reddit users. It matches a Reddit user with another Reddit user, and each user must then send a gift to the other user according to that user's tastes and preferences listed on their profile. Participation is free, although extra perks can be purchased with the optional \\"RedditGifts Elves\\" membership, and goods are usually priced between $10 and $25 USD. The service also requests that users leave \\"thank-you notes\\" for their gift-giver on the website. Since starting as a Secret Santa exchange, RedditGifts has added a variety of different themed exchanges that run throughout the year, such as Nintendo and Halloween. The service also runs Arbitrary Day, \\"a celebration of nothing in particular\\". Up to 2011, approximately $1.5 million had been spent by Reddit users on the project. Microsoft chairman and philanthropist Bill Gates has participated in the service for five years under the username \\"thisisbillgates\\", most notably in 2013 and in 2014; The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation confirmed this. Gates was noted to send objects to Reddit users like \\"Calid7\\" (a 25-year-old Californian woman), such as a travel book and a stuffed cow. He has also been known to donate to charities in the name of the user he has been matched with. History RedditGifts was originally created by Reddit user Dan McComas, or \\"kickme444\\" as known on the site, and \\"5days\\". McComas first conceived the idea while working on freelance projects in 2009. The site was launched in 2009 with 4,500 participants; the website reports that 212,894 people worldwide participated in the event during 2014. The site is a three-time Guinness World Record holder for the World's Largest Gift Exchange. Reddit acquisition In August 2011, Reddit bought the RedditGifts site. The two site-runners reportedly could not afford to continue maintaining the site while simultaneously working their day jobs. Both site-runners continued to run the website, although they are not involved with the daily operations of Reddit. The company takes a 15 to 20 percent cut of every purchase. Reddit operates the website as part of its ongoing plans to monetise their website. As of December 2013, approximately 14 percent of Reddit's revenue came from running the service, although McComas said that those sales alone could \\"put Reddit firmly in the black\\", and that the company may choose to reinvest funds in e-commerce customer service and infrastructure. In December 2013, while expressing his desire for the Reddit business to become self-sustaining, then- Chief Executive Yishan Wong stated that the RedditGifts service \\"provides real value\\", and called it \\"promising\\" for the business. Wong increased the staff count dedicated to the project to eight after realising the service's potential.

Her son by that marriage, Anoushiravan, apparently remained with her after she married Tughril Beg in around 1043. Political influence Tughril Beg is reported to have consulted his chief wife Altun Jan Khatun in affairs, Sibt ibn al-Jawzi states that she was a religious woman, much given to charitable works, of good judgement and firm determination. When Tughril Beg went to Hamadan in 1058 to deal with the revolt of Ibrahim Inal, he sent Altun Jan, Anoushiravan and al-Kunduri to Baghdad. Despite the Caliph's objection, Altun Jan took the treasury and Seljuk soldiery in Baghdad with her, leaving al-Kanduri. When Ibrahim Inal learnt of Altun Jan's approach he seems to have sent a force to have her intercepted. Other Turkmen ruler also joined, and defeated Ibrahim Inal. After this Tughril retired to Rey, where Altun Jan joined him. In Tughril's last days, before al-Basasiri's seizure of the city, a convulated plot had been hatched by Altun Jan Khatun and his vizier al-Kunduri to install Altun Jan's son, Anushirvan. However, Anushirvan attracted no support, and Altun Jan soon dissociated herself from the plot, all of whose conspirators appear to have been eventually restored to favor without further punishment. Death and aftermath She died of edema in December 1060 in Zanjan. Tughril grieved for her greatly, and her bier was carried to Rey, where she was buried. She held estates in Iran. Just before her death she bequeathed her states, assignments and pensions to the Caliph's daughter Seyyedeh Fatima. Tughril assigned these to the latter when the marriage contract between him and the caliph's daughter was finally concluded in 1062. According to some sources it was her who requested Tughril to marry the caliph's daughter at her deathbed. After Tughril's death in 1063, Anoushiravan rebelled but was captured. He was imprisoned in Rey and was killed.

Inspection work began in the early 1990s and was a collaboration between the Organization Department and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's anti-graft body. The decision to formally establish the leading group was announced in November 2009 by the Central Committee of the Communist Party. The group gained special prominence since 2013 under the leadership of Wang Qishan as a result of the wide-reaching anti-corruption campaign following the 18th Party Congress. The Leading Group and its General Office is tasked with dispatching \\"inspection teams\\" (xunshizu, Â∑°ËßÜÁªÑ) to the provinces, central government organs such as ministries, and state-owned enterprises. Under Wang Qishan, inspection teams have been sent out in several 'rounds', with each round numbering about a dozen inspection teams who 'embed' themselves as part of a regional or central organization for weeks to conduct inspection work on party disciplinary enforcement. Several prominent cases, such as that of Hubei Vice- Governor Guo Youming, Inner Mongolia politician Wang Suyi, Guangzhou Party Secretary Wan Qingliang, and a whole host of officials from Shanxi province, were initiated by the central inspection teams.

He spent his childhood in southwest London.  Education  After being educated at Kings College School, he studied law from 1974 to 1977 at Hull University, a period he has written about in highly negative terms. He has described having left \\"on the first train out, the day after my last exam\\". He has never returned to the university. He graduated with a 2.2 degree. Waller then studied journalism at the Thomson Regional Newspapers course in Cardiff in the autumn of 1977.  Career  He worked for several years at Thomson Magazines on Construction News and got his first job in the City at the Exchange Telegraph (Extel) wire service. Waller then joined The Times as a junior business reporter in April 1988 and has worked in a number or roles in the business department, including about a decade writing the city diary. He took over the Tempus investment column in June 2010. In 2008, Waller was interviewed by iBall of Interactive Investor International, in which he was described as having \\"ruffled a few feathers in his time\\" and being \\"renowned for delivering the most entertaining and informed city diary in Britain\\". In February 2009, he wrote an article named \\"Guarantee for Guernsey's Rock depositors tax belief\\", believing that people were depositing money into the island to dodge taxes. He was criticised for not understanding the subject matter. He has called Corporate Social Responsibility \\"box ticking driven by external pressures rather than a genuine desire to do business in an ethical way.\\" Clare Rodway has described Waller as being \\"famous for his acerbic wit\\".http://clarerodwaysconversation.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/which- journalist-would-you-most-like.html Waller has criticised PowerPoint presentations, saying they are counter-productive and people cannot read while hearing a speech simultaneously easy. In 2009 Waller publicly criticised Mehdi Hasan of the New Statesman over an article questioning Vince Cable, then shadow chancellor for the Liberal Democrats, over actions taken when Cable was chief economist at Shell. Hasan replied in the Statesman rebuking Waller, saying he \\"who specialises in fawning profiles of City slickers, now seems to have fallen in love with politicians and their PRs too.\\" In March 2014 Waller was named as Financial Journalist of the Year at the City of London Wealth Management Awards. He left The Times on May 31 2018.  Personal life  Waller tweetedhttps://twitter.com/martinwaller10 and wrote a blog entitled 'Tom Paine's Bones'.http://tomspainesbones.wordpress.com/ The blog was described as \\"observations by a fifty-something financial journalist on business, morality, the morality of business and things that make me really angry\\".http://tomspainesbones.wordpress.com/ The blog has also reflected his interest in history, music, mainly jazz and rock, religion and science fiction. Waller has described his politics as \\"fairly left wing but with a libertarian tinge\\". The blog is now reactivated following his retirement. He is still active on Twitter. He is married with two children and moved from London to Woodbridge, Suffolk in October 2019. He can be contacted on 07768 701199.

Life Yesayan was born on November 24, 1946 in Yerevan, then in the Soviet Union. He graduated from Sasovo Flight Academy and Civil Aviation Academy. In 1987 he has completed training as a test pilot in the Fedotov Test Pilot School. In 2013, Yesayan, together with other Russian test pilots, signed an open letter to Vladimir Putin, criticizing the United Aircraft Corporation for not producing civilian airliners and outlining other shortcomings in the Russian aviation industry. In 2014, Yesayan's crew landed Tu-154 aircraft on the short runway of a Samara training airfield, where Tu-154 have never landed before. Comments about Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 Following the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 incident, Yesayan, alongside another test pilot Magomed Tolboyev, criticized the Russian version about the airliner's shootdown by a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-25 aircraft: \\"Someone, unfamiliar with Su-25's capabilities and the Boeing-777 aircraft, is trying a PR stunt. This is a natural bluff. [...] Su-25 has a maximum airspeed of Mach 0.82. The Boeing-777 aircraft, which I tested in 1998 in Seattle, flies at Mach 0.83 in a cruise flight. Thus, a Su-25 would not be able to catch up with it at all\\". Yesayan also noted that the Su-25 air-to-air missiles are heat-seeking and would strike the engine, while the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 Boeing was damaged on the cockpit side.

Life He was the second child and only son of Charles Boner, of Bath, Somerset, who died at Twickenham, 14 Aug. 1833, and was born at Weston, near Bath, 29 April 1815. He was educated at Bath from 1825 to 1827, and then at Tiverton grammar school from 1827 to 1829. From 1831 to 1837 he was tutor to the two elder sons of John Constable the painter. After his mother's death in 1839, Boner accepted an invitation from August, Freiherr von D√∂rnberg to reside with him in Germany. Some time later, having learned German, he accompanied the baron to Regensburg, where he had the offer of a post in the family of Maximilian Karl, 6th Prince of Thurn and Taxis. Boner became a lifelong friend of the prince, mixed in society, and spent twenty years in the family household at Regensburg. He visited William Wordsworth at Grasmere in 1844; and in 1845 he made the acquaintance of Mary Russell Mitford, with whom he carried on a literary correspondence for ten years. In 1860 Boner left Regensburg and made Munich his home. His daughter Marie was married, 27 February 1865, to Theodor Horschelt the painter. As special correspondent of The Daily News, he went to Vienna in August 1865, his time with the paper lasting from the time when the treaty of commerce between England and Austria was arranged until the conclusion of the Seven Weeks' War. In 1867 Boner went to Salzburg to be present at the meeting of Napoleon III and Franz Joseph I of Austria, and wrote a description of the scene. He also visited Trieste, where he attended the funeral of Maximilian I of Mexico. He died in the house of his son-in-law Horschelt, 5 Louisenstrasse, Munich, 9 April 1870.

His translations from the German included Hans Christian Andersen's A Danish Story Book (1846), illustrated by Count Franz Pocci, and The Dream of Little Tuck (1848). The Andersen translations included The Princess and the Pea, and followed the German version of 1839 by Georg Friedrich von Jenssen (as did Caroline Peachey at the same period), multiplying the single pea to three. After a London visit in 1844, Boner contributed to the Literary Gazette a series of articles on German poets. He also wrote for the New York Tribune and other papers, and compiled a memoir of Maximilian I of Mexico.

In addition Dumbarton played in the Dumbartonshire Cup, the League Charity Cup and the Greenock and District Charity Cup.  Story of the Season  August The season began with an invitation to play in the Rangers FC Sports eleven-a-side tournament. On 2 August Dumbarton defeated St Mirren 2‚Äì0 in the semi final, but lost out a week later to the hosts, Rangers, 4‚Äì1 in the final. On 16 August the opening games in the inaugural Scottish League championship were played, and Dumbarton began their campaign with a home fixture against Cowlairs. The team lined up as McLeod (goal); Hannah and Watson (backs); Keir, Boyle and McMillan (half backs); and Bell, Hutcheson; Mair; Henderson and Taylor (forwards). Taylor scored Dumbarton's first ever league goal after 15 minutes, but shortly thereafter Cowlairs equalised. In the second half Cowlairs were kept hemmed in as the Sons hit every part of the woodwork but the ball would not go in. Taylor scored late on but it was ruled out for offside and the game ended at 1-1. Football was included as part of the International Exhibition of Science, Art & Industry held in Edinburgh in 1890, and the third game held in this connection was between Dumbarton and Leith Athletic. Wilson from the second XI taking Hutcheson's place was the only change to the team. The game was held in good conditions apart from a strong wind blowing down the pitch meaning most of the play was confined to one end. In the first half the Sons played against the wind and with good defensive play reached the interval only one down. In the second half Dumbarton used the conditions to their advantage and two goals from Wilson and another from Mair gave Dumbarton a 3‚Äì1 win. Three days later, Dumbarton travelled to Cathkin Park, to play Scottish Cup holders Third Lanark in a league fixture. Hutcheson returned to the side. Bell opened his account after 30 minutes but Thirds replied soon after, this being the score at half time. Taylor and Mair restored the Sons advantage and the game finished 3‚Äì1. On 30 August Hearts came to Boghead to fulfil a league fixture. McNaught came in to replace Henderson in the front line and reserve player McDonald played for McMillan. Hearts were first to score but Bell with his third goal in three league games equalised matters just before half time. The Sons came out in the second half intent on pushing forward and goals from Bell and Mair secured a 3‚Äì1 win. At the end of the month, Dumbarton sat in second place in the league with 5 points from three games, a point behind Rangers. September Dumbarton were drawn away against Smithston Hibs in the first round of the Scottish Cup on 6 September, but as the opponents did not have a suitable standard of ground the match was switched to Boghead. Alex Miller took McDonlad's place in the half back line, The Sons were firm favorites for this tie and were a goal ahead from McNaught within five minutes. In the end Dumbarton eased through with an 8‚Äì2 win. The early pace setters in the league, Dumbarton and Rangers met on 13 September at Boghead, An unchanged side took the field, The Sons were quick off the mark and goals from Bell(2) and Mair had the home side well ahead by half time. Dumbarton continued to play strongly in the second half and crushed their rivals 5‚Äì1, Bell completing his hat-trick. After a free week, it was back to Scottish Cup business on 27 September, with Hibernian being the opponents at Easter Road. McDonald came in for Hannah and McMillan returned and replaced Keir. The Sons were ahead within minutes and held a 3‚Äì1 lead at half time. In the second half it was all Dumbarton with a further six goals and a final 9-1 scoreline ‚Äì Taylor completing his hat trick October On 4 October Dumbarton entertained near neighbours Vale of Leven for their home league fixture. The team was unchanged. An own goal provided the Sons with the lead but despite having most of the play it was Vale that equalised before half time. The second half began in a similar fashion with the Vale keeper being tested repeatedly. Eventually the Vale's defence was broken and Dumbarton won the tie by 3‚Äì1. A week later it was Abercorn who were the visitors to Boghead on league business, with the only change to the team being the return of Hannah to the defence. Taylor had the Sons two ahead by half time then in the second half Taylor completed his hat trick and a brace from Galbraith finished off a 5-1 thrashing. Clydebank were drawn at Boghead to play Dumbarton in the third round of the Scottish Cup on 18 October. Dumbarton fielded an unchanged full strength eleven. Taylor(2) and McMillan had the Sons comfortably ahead by half time. A further two from Taylor and one from Bell completed the scoring for a 6‚Äì0 victory. The return league fixture at Cowlairs was played on 25 October. Unfortunately Cowlairs ground was unavailable and the Northern club made their ground available for the tie. The Sons were again able to field their strongest team. The Dumbarton men spend most of the first half swarmed around the Cowlairs goal with scores resulting from three scrimmage and a Bell strike giving the Sons a 4‚Äì0 lead. The game was more even in the second half and Cowlairs got one back, only for Bell to get his second and Taylor (his 17th goal of the season) to make the final score 5‚Äì1. So at the end of the month Dumbarton led the league with 13 points from 7 matches, 4 points ahead of Rangers with a game more played. November Following a free week it was back to Scottish Cup business on 8 November, with a fourth round tie against Mossend Swifts at Boghead. The same eleven took to the field. The game was barely seconds old when Mossend scored, but within ten minutes the Sons had scored twice through McNaught to take the lead. Mossend then responded with two goals of their own before McMillan, Mair and Taylor gave Dumbarton a 5-3 half time lead. The second half saw the home side score two more for a final result of 7‚Äì3. On 15 November, eight of the Dumbarton first XI - McLeod; Watson; McMillan; Boyle; Taylor; Galbraith; Mair and McNaught ‚Äì were selected to play in the county side against Renfrewshire. A 3‚Äì1 win was recorded with Taylor scoring two goals and Mair the other. After a walk over against Dumbarton Albion, Dumbarton played away in the second round of the Dumbartonshire Cup against Duntocher Harp on 22 November. One change was made to the team with Keir returning and Hannah dropping out. Bell Galbraith and Taylor had the Sons well ahead early in the first half, and at the interval the score stood in Dumbarton's favour by 4‚Äì2. With the wind and rain at their backs Dumbarton completely dominated in the second half and ran out winners by 10‚Äì2. On 29 November it was to have been the fifth round home tie in the Scottish Cup against 5th KRV, but the referee ruled the pitch unplayable. Nevertheless, the teams went ahead and played a friendly, where late goals from Taylor and McMillan gave Dumbarton a 2‚Äì0 victory. December The re-run of the postponed Scottish Cup tie against 5th KRV was played on 6 December. An unchanged side took to the field The Sons had little difficulty in breaching the KRV defence and were 6-0 up by half time - Taylor notching a hat-trick (his fourth of the season so far). A further two goals in the second half completed the scoring for an 8‚Äì0 victory. The Dumbartonshire Cup semi-finals were played on 13 December with Dumbarton drawn at home to play Clydebank. Robertson came up from the seconds to give Bell a rest. The Bankies surprised the Sons by scoring first but by half time had turned things around by leading 2‚Äì1. A further two goals in the second half made the final score 4‚Äì1. On 20 December, the biggest match of the season so far saw 10,000 spectators crammed into Boghead to witness Dumbarton play Celtic in the Scottish Cup quarter final. The team was back to full strength with the return of Bell. Snow covered the ground and despite the referee being happy for the game to be played Celtic lodged a protest. Mair had the Sons in front at half time and then Mair again and Bell in the second half completed a 3‚Äì0 victory.. The protest was subsequently dismissed. The final match of the year involved the away league fixture against Abercorn on 27 December. Once again the full squad was available to play. The Abbies started off the stronger and were ahead but Taylor got the equaliser before half time. Taylor scored again (his 25th of the season) to make the final score a 2‚Äì1. So at the end of 1890, Dumbarton remained unbeaten ‚Äì leading the league with 15 points from 8 games, six ahead of Rangers - and still going strong in both the national and county cups. January On New Year's Day Dumbarton played in front of a 15,000 crowd at Celtic Park. The Sons played without Keir who was replaced by second XI man Stewart. The Celts were first to score but Dumbarton equalised before half time. No further scoring took place the result being a 1‚Äì1 draw which was all the more impressive as Stewart was lost to injury for most of the second half. Two further friendlies were played on 2 and 3 January with easy wins being recorded against Arbroath (6-0 away) and Kings Park (8-3 home) respectively. After a blank week on 17 January Dumbarton played Abercorn in the Scottish Cup semi final at Boghead. The full first XI played with Keir returning to the squad. The Sons were soon ahead from a Galbraith goal and McNaught made it two by the interval. Bell got a third and while the Abbies scored late on, the game was won by 3-1 and Dumbarton were in the final. On 24 January Dumbarton played their home league fixture against Cambuslang. Watson and Taylor were missing and replaced by Lang (Methlan Park) and Thompson (second XI). McNaught was first to score before Bell scored twice to give the Sons a 3-0 interval lead. Keir and then late on Thompson scored in the second half for an easy 5‚Äì0 win. With no match on 31 January, Dumbarton still headed the league with 17 points from 9 matches.. February The Scottish Cup final was played on 7 February at Hampden Park pitting the odds on favorites unbeaten Dumbarton against the surprise package Hearts. Full strength Sons took to the field in front of an 11,000 crowd. Hearts were first to show and were ahead after 13 minutes and held that lead with ease till the interval. After a disappointing first half Dumbarton picked up a little in the second but in the end Hearts were worthy winners. The following week saw Dumbarton playing in another cup final ‚Äì this time for the county championship. The venue was Boghead against Vale of Leven and the Sons team was minus Galbraith his place taken by Thompson. Vale were in front after 3 minutes and as was the case in the Scottish final the Sons were finding it difficult to get into the game. In the second half however Dumbarton played to their best and after Mair equalised, Taylor, Bell and Mair again scored for a 4‚Äì1 win ‚Äì lifting the cup for the third season in a row. On 21 February Celtic visited Boghead on league duty. Lang and Hutcheson replaced McMillan and Mair in the Sons team. The game was fast and exciting throughout and Galbraith had Dumbarton ahead by half time. Celtic came back in the second half and equalised, and although Boyle had the home team ahead once more, the Celts had the final say the game ending a 2‚Äì2 draw. Vale of Leven returned to Boghead on 28 February for a league match. Wilson took the place of McNaught in the attack It only took two minutes for Keir to put Dumbarton ahead, and Taylor and an own goal made it three by half time. Boyle scored the only goal of the second half and the result was a comfortable 4‚Äì0 victory. So at the end of the month Dumbarton would still lead the league with 20 points from 11 matches ‚Äì leading Rangers by 4 points. March The beginning of March saw the selection of the teams to play for Scotland in the upcoming British Home Championships. Disputes between the SFA and the Scottish League as to priority of players‚Äô commitments ensured that few league players would be capped. Indeed, only McMillan was selected from Dumbarton to play against Ireland. In the end he decided instead to play for Dumbarton in a league match. On 7 March Dumbarton played the first of their league fixtures against St Mirren at Boghead. McNaught returned to the team but McMillan, Taylor and Mair were missing. Surprisingly it was Saints that took the lead after 20 minutes but Bell then McNaught had the Sons ahead by the interval. The second half was all Dumbarton with Bell scoring a further three goals for a 4‚Äì1 win. Bell's four goal haul was all the more remarkable as he had a poisoned hand and spent the whole match with his arm strapped to his chest. A free week was followed on 21 March by a trip to Cambuslang for the return league match. McMillan and Taylor were back in their respective positions. The Sons were to find the visitors‚Äô keeper in fine form and it was Cambuslang that would start the second half a goal ahead. The Dumbarton nerves were restored by goals from Taylor and Bell within five minutes of the restart. The Cambuslang goal continued to survive a barrage of shots but in a break away the Sons conceded to come away with a disappointing 2‚Äì2 draw. On 28 March Third Lanark arrived at Boghead for the return league fixture, where an unchanged side took the field. Bell and then McLeod, who had come out of goals and changed places with Hutcheson, had the Sons two ahead by the interval. Then Hutcheson (who had switched again with McLeod) scored a third before Thirds found the net for the first time. However two further goals for Dumbarton made the final score 5‚Äì1. Two days later Dumbarton travelled to Belfast to play the Distillery on Easter Monday. In a one sided game the Sons returned after an 8‚Äì1 win. So at the end of the month the league race had tightened up ‚Äì both Dumbarton and Rangers were on 25 points, but Dumbarton had played a game fewer. April On 4 April Dumbarton played Partick Thistle at Cappielow in the semi final of the Greenock Charity Cup. McKenzie took over in goals while McLeod replaced Boyle in the half back line. Smith replaced Hutcheson at centre forward. Bell scored after ten minutes and another before half time and 2-0 was the score at full time. The following week, the most important match of the league to date took place at Parkhead as Celtic entertained Dumbarton. Boyle returned to the team and McLeod resumed his place in goals. The Celts were a goal ahead at half time but the game might have turned midway through the second half. Bell scored what he, and most in Parkhead, thought was the equaliser. However a number of the Celtic defence cried offside and this was agreed by the referee. Some of the Dumbarton players were ready to leave the field in protest but were persuaded to stay. The rest of the game saw the Sons encamped around the Celtic goal but no further scoring took place. On 18 April, Dumbarton made the trip to Edinburgh to play Hearts in the league. Lang took McMillan's place at right back. The Dumbarton men were anxious to make up in some way for the defeat in the Scottish Cup final and were one ahead from Bell at half time. Further goals from Bell, Taylor and Galbraith were testament to the dominance of the Sons forwards and the game ended 4‚Äì0. The destiny of the league championship was at stake with the meeting against Rangers on 25 April at Ibrox. McMillan was back in the team but it was Rangers that started much the stronger and were ahead within minutes, and by half time were three up. The Gers scored again in the second half before two quick fire goals from Bell brought the Sons back into the game. Dumbarton continued to pile on the pressure but in the end time ran out and the game was lost 4‚Äì2. With one match to play, Dumbarton had 27 points in the league ‚Äì the same as Rangers with one fewer match played. May Dumbarton played their final league game on 2 May against St Mirren at Paisley. A couple of changes were made with Lang replacing Boyle and James Miller taking Taylor's place. Goals by Galbraith(2) and Bell had the Sons three ahead by half time. The Saints recovered to score midway through the second half, though J Miller restored the three goal lead shortly thereafter. St Mirren scored again at the end to make the score 4‚Äì2. At the same time Celtic had beaten Rangers, meaning that Rangers would require to win their game in hand to equal Dumbarton's points total. The following Monday evening Dumbarton Rangers (Dumbarton's second XI) beat Clydebank's 2nd XI 4‚Äì0 to win the Dumbartonshire Second XI Cup ‚Äì the third scoop of both county cups in succession. On 9 May while Dumbarton had a rest week, Rangers won their outstanding fixture to tie with Dumbarton at the top of the league, and in the absence of rules to decide on a winner, the League committee decided on a play off. The semi final of the new League Charity Cup was played at Celtic Park between Dumbarton and Rangers on 16 May. Boyle returned to the team. Both teams played a fast game and play raged from end to end. Taylor opened the scoring for Dumbarton after 30 minutes and that was the score at the interval. The Sons kept up the pressure in the second half but there was no further scoring. Near the end McMillan and a Rangers player had a ‚Äòdisagreement‚Äô and both were sent from the field. The league decider was played at Cathkin Park on 21 May in front of 10,000 spectators. The team was unchanged from that which had played five days earlier. Rangers were determined to make good their previous disappointing performance and after a spirited first half they led 2‚Äì0. After the interval the Sons got down to the task in hand but it wasn't till 20 minutes from time that Taylor got one back. J Miller then scored the equaliser and despite hemming the Gers in for the final minutes a winning goal could not be found. It was subsequently decided that rather than have a further playoff that the Championship be shared. Over the next two days Dumbarton played two friendlies in a north of Scotland tour (2-2 against Arbroath on 22 May and 6‚Äì2 against Aberdeen on 23 May). On 30 May a friendly was played against Kings Park at Stirling and was won 4‚Äì2. June As the football season came to its end, Dumbarton still had two finals to play. On 3 June the final of the Greenock Charity Cup was decided at Cappielow as Dumbarton played hosts Morton for the second year in succession. Hutcheson returned at centre forward in place of J Miller. The Sons were quickly into their stride and were four up by half time. Play settled down in the second half and a goal for each team made the final score 5‚Äì1. Then on 10 June, Celtic were the opponents in the final of the League Charity Cup at Cathkin Park. Miller was back in the attack As it was Dumbarton saved their best final performance for the crowd of 12,000. Bell opened the scoring and despite constant pressure this was the score at the interval. It was more of the same in the second half and two goals from Taylor ended the season on a high with a 3‚Äì0 win and yet another piece of silverware for the Dumbarton trophy cabinet.

Sudol's piercing and airbrushing techniques opened a new world of self-expression for Pho. He combined the techniques with lessons learned from other woodturners; the use of color as employed by Giles Gilson and Michael Hosaluk, a sense of continuity learned from Michael Mode, and the use of metal leaf in the work of furniture maker David Marks. He was also influenced by 20th century Surrealist painters and sculptors, notably Salvador Dali and Mihail Chemiakin.New Masters of Woodturning: Expanding the Boundaries of Wood Art, by Terry Martin and Kevin Wallace, Fox Chapel Publishing, 2008 Career Binh Pho began selling his work in 1995, quickly gaining the attention of art collectors and devoted increasing time to his work.Attractive Opposites by Stephen Henkin, The World & I, a Publication of The Washington Times, June 2003 For much of his career, the work was autobiographical in nature, sharing the story of his life in Vietnam and pursuit of freedom in the United States.River of Destiny: The Life & Work of Binh Pho, Fine Arts Press, 2006 In 2006, the book River of Destiny: The Life and Work of Binh Pho was published in conjunction with an exhibition of the artist's work at the Long Beach Museum of Art in California. In the book, curator and author Kevin Wallace shared Binh Pho's life story, Vietnamese history and philosophy.Binh Pho: Shadow of The Turning, American Art Collector, December 2014 Technique For Pho, part of the attraction of working with wood was the poetic similarity he saw between trees and human beings and he approached the material with reverence.Attractive Opposites by Stephen Henkin, The World & I, a Publication of The Washington Times, June 2003 A love of color, Eastern imagery and modern art are obvious in his pieces.New Masters of Woodturning: Expanding the Boundaries of Wood Art, by Terry Martin and Kevin Wallace, Fox Chapel Publishing, 2008 After turning a vessel and carefully preparing its surface, Pho sketched the layout of the decoration, utilizing a principle of Chinese landscape painting, in which the eye is drawn into a vast landscape by the inclusion of a temple or cottage. He used an airbrush to apply paint to the surface. He then employed ultraspeed drills to etch and pierce sections of the vessel. The piercing creates negative space that contrasts with the wood that remains and patterns that mimic natural phenomena.Attractive Opposites by Stephen Henkin, The World & I, a Publication of The Washington Times, June 2003 Binh Pho is particularly known for his use of form, instinctively designing works that utilize ratios that are very close to the theoretical ‚Äúgolden section‚Äù that can be seen in works dating back through antiquity.Geometry of the Golden Section, Robert Vincent, translated by A.

He was also the older brother of Texas starting quarterback John \\"Bunny\\" Andrews. Early life William Rooster, Jr. was born in Dallas, TX, where his father worked in the pursing office of Texas Pacific Railways. As a 17-year-old at Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas, Andrews participated in the 1936 Texas state championship track meet as the school's manager. There he met legendary Texas track coach Clyde Littlefield who put Andrews to work setting up for the Texas Relays. Andrews ended up staying three extra days to work even after the track team left on the bus for Dallas. For this he was paid $9. Malcolm Kutner, a classmate of Andrews, asked Texas football coach Dana X. Bible to bring Andrews on as a team manager, but said that Andrews would need a job. Texas A&M; coach Homer Norton also wanted Andrews as a manager and even sent him a dorm room key. But the night before Andrews was to leave for Texas A&M;, Andrews' classmate called to tell him that Bible had found him a job through the National Youth Administration so Andrews headed to Austin instead. Texas Athletics At Texas, Andrews was the team manager from 1941-1945 and roommate with future Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Bobby Layne. In 1943, during World War II when many schools suspended their football programs due to lack of men, Texas had trouble finding a kicker. Andrews showed off his drop kick style in practice, an unusual style at the time, and earned a chance to play by winning a kicking contest in practice. His first chance came against TCU when he kicked two extra points and had a third attempt blocked, enraging TCU coach Dutch Meyer who saw the use of the team's water boy as an insult. Meyer dared coach Dana X. Bible to use Andrews the following week against Texas A&M; and Bible did, with Andrews kicking two more extra points and having a field goal blocked. Andrews continued to play in the 1944 and 1945 seasons. On a few occasions he faked the kick and instead threw passes to Layne, a play that succeeded once against Oklahoma in 1945 and once in his final game, the 1946 Cotton Bowl. Twice he connected with Layne for touchdowns. But during those later years, Andrews primary job was to keep his roommate, hard-partying, hard-drinking quarterback Bobby Layne, out of trouble. In addition to managing the football team, Andrews played seven different positions for the UT baseball team as a part-time player in 1944‚Äì45, and was a manager in 1946. Once sent in to draw a base on balls, he hit a game-winning home run instead.1966 Longhorn Hall of Honor induction program The nickname \\"All- America Waterboy\\" came not from his play on the field, but from serving as manager in college postseason games (the 1941 East-West Shrine game and College All-Star games in Chicago every year from 1942 to 1946). The nickname \\"Rooster\\" came from a college incident in which Andrews broke an arm trying to retrieve a chicken from a tree. Longhorn Logo and Burnt Orange The \\"Steerhead\\" Logo, developed by Rooster Andrews, was named the best logo in College Sports by Athlon Sports in 2013 In 1961, coach Darrell Royal talked to Andrews about ways to improve the Longhorns uniform. Back then, the Longhorns' helmets were white with orange numerals on the side and a thin orange stripe down the center. Andrews told Royal he had an idea and would work on it that night. He found a Longhorn head in a book, traced it and colored it in with crayon, and then found a distributor to make decals of the logo. They were added onto the helmets of the 1961 Longhorn football team and have remained there ever since. In 2013, Athlon Sports named the steerhead logo that Andrews developed as the nation's best college football logo. One year later, Royal and Andrews worked together to change the uniform color from the bright orange that was then used to the burnt orange in use today. Royal wanted the color to be darker, closer to the color of the football, the way the practice uniforms looked when they were stained with sweat after a hot, hard practice. Andrews soaked a uniform in water and showed it to a manufacturer who was then able to make uniforms with the burnt orange color. Later life In 1946, Andrews turned down an offer to be a manager with the Miami Seahawks of the All- America Football Conference to become a salesman for a C&S; Sporting Goods. The self-described jockstrap peddler later became president of the company from 1961‚Äì69. In 1969 he, along with his brother Bunny, moved to the Texas Sporting Goods Company becoming a Vice-President and manager of the Austin store. In 1971 he opened the first of his own sporting goods stores in Austin. At its peak, Rooster Andrews Sporting Goods had four retail locations across Austin, an annual sales volume of $5 million, and employed more than 70 people. Andrews married his sweetheart Betty Jane Burk and had four children. He was an active member of the community serving on boards and as presidents of many Austin civic organizations including the Optimist Club and the Travis County Grand Jury. Andrews became a Texas Longhorn legend who dined regularly with Longhorns football coaches Darrell Royal and Mack Brown and became friends with everyone involved in Texas included Presidents Johnson, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. Among other honors Andrews received over the years, he was inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor in 1966 and to the Austin Athletic Hall of Fame. He was given the Doak Walker NFL Alumni Award in 1987 for contributions to football. He was named to National Sporting Goods Hall of Fame in 1990. In 1992 he became the only person in the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame who never played high school football. He was inducted for his contributions as a booster of the game.http://tshof.org/highschool/inductees/inductee_detail/index.html?staff_id=559 He was Inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame, Class of 2016.http://ttfca2.wixsite.com/txtfhalloffame/inductees Andrews was also true to the roots that brought him to the University of Texas as an Official and Head Judge of the Finish Line for the Texas Relays for 60 years.

They were built from February 1943 February to circa April 1944 by the Allied Works Council. They were also known as Hastings Deering (Australia) Ltd premises and Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd premises. They were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 August 1999.  History  The Archerfield Second World War Igloos Complex comprises three former igloo hangars and one associated igloo store. These structures are located on a site which had been part of the Archerfield Aerodrome during the Second World War, and each is a timber truss igloo structure with corrugated iron or ribbed metal sheet cladding. The igloos were constructed in 1943-44 by the Allied Works Council for the Department of Aircraft Production. The complex was used for military aircraft maintenance and repair under the control of the US 81st Air Depot Group, and under the U.S. 5th Air Force under the command of General Douglas MacArthur's Supreme Headquarters of the South West Pacific Area. It has been noted in a study of prefabricated Second World War structures that the Archerfield Second World War Igloos are among \\"the longest clear span buildings existing in Australia.\\"  History of the Site, and aviation in Brisbane, to the Second World War  The area immediately surrounding the Archerfield Second World War Igloos Complex has been known as Archerfield only since 1929. As early as 1826 the wider area was known as Cowper's (later Cooper's) Plains, named after the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement's first medical officer, Dr Henry Cowper, who, during his regular visits to Limestone Hill (Ipswich), camped overnight on the government cattle run established on the grassy plains east of Oxley Creek, about south of the main Brisbane River settlement. The first freehold land in the district was made available in the 1850s, and most of the remaining land was taken up in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1855 Thomas Grenier purchased from the New South Wales Government , much of which is now part of Archerfield Aerodrome. The land on which the igloo structures are located was granted by Deed of Grant in July 1856 to John and Isaac Markwell. The land was transferred in December 1878 to George and Samuel Grimes, and later to Annie and Martin Finucane in March 1901 who subdivided the property. The land surrounding the igloos was transferred to the members of Spring and Sims families in the 1910s and 1920s, and this land was acquired by the Crown in February 1945 pursuant to the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act 1906 and The Real Property (Commonwealth Titles) Act of 1924. The first aerodrome in Brisbane was established on a site at Eagle Farm which had been inspected in February 1922 by Captain EC Johnston, Superintendent of Aerodromes, Civil Aviation Department, as a site for a civil aerodrome. A grass airstrip was formed in 1923, and a layout for hangar blocks with a caretaker's cottage was prepared in February 1924. The Brisbane Civil Aviation hangar was constructed at the site c.1925, and the first commercial operations were commenced by QANTAS in 1926, which formed the Brisbane Flying Training School in 1927. By August 1928 a second hangar housing QANTAS was located adjacent to the north of the Brisbane Civil Aviation hangar, with a caretakers cottage to the south. However, the aerodrome suffered from poor drainage and flooding. Significant aviation events during this period included the landing of the Southern Cross in June 1928. Squadron Leader Charles Kingsford-Smith and Charles Ulm completed the first trans-Pacific flight from California to Brisbane, landing at Eagle Farm. Kingsford-Smith and Ulm formed Australian National Airlines in 1929 and initiated scheduled services between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Also of note in 1928, Squadron Leader Bert Hinkler AFC completed the first solo flight from England to Australia in 16 days in a light aeroplane. On 10 April 1933, Queensland aviator Mrs Lores Bonney left Archerfield on the start of her solo flight to England. In September 1928 the Brisbane City Council approved of about of farm land at Cooper's Plains (renamed Archerfield July 1929), near Oxley - part of the first alienated by Thomas Grenier in 1855 - as the site for a new Brisbane aerodrome. This site was intended to replace the Eagle Farm Aerodrome, which had suffered substantial flooding. In 1929 the Commonwealth Government resumed the bulk of the present airfield, with frontages to Beatty, Mortimer and Boundary Roads, and additional land was acquired in 1930, 1936 and 1942. In August 1929 it was stated that as soon as the aerodrome at Archerfield was acquired and prepared, flying activities would be transferred from Eagle Farm which would then be available for disposal, and that the two existing hangars would be moved to Archerfield, but that the caretakers cottage on the site would remain. Eagle Farm continued to operate until 1931 when it was closed after heavy rains. The first hangars were erected or moved to Archerfield in 1930-31. The Queensland Aero Club, which had been established in 1919, was based at Eagle Farm during the 1920s and moved to Archerfield 1931. In 1929 the Eagle Farm site was placed with the Department of the Interior for sale, and several options for disposal of the property were considered, including industrial sites or to the general public in broad acre lots or by subdivision. In 1931 it was assessed as having a poor prospect of sale, and it was recommended to lease the land until the real estate market improved. Until 1939, Archerfield Aerodrome comprised one large, grassy field of nearly , several hangars located along the Beatty Road side of the airfield just north of the God's Acre Cemetery, and the Queensland Aero Club's facilities at the northern end of the field along Boundary Road. There was no tarmac, and the roads in and out of the airfield and to the buildings were unsealed. The first control tower was a small timber structure on steel posts, which was replaced by a new Archerfield Administration, Passenger Terminal and Control Tower Building erected in 1941. Preliminary plans for a control and administrative building were prepared in 1936 as part of the Commonwealth Department of Civil Aviation's commitment to improve facilities at a number of strategic airfields around the country. From 1935-36, it was reported that the number of passengers travelling through Archerfield had doubled, and that Brisbane's position as a strategic centre in the Empire Air Mail scheme had been enhanced by QANTAS Empire Airways duplication of the English mail service. In June 1939 the Eagle Farm Aerodrome site was still being considered for sale, however by early 1940 the Minister for Civil Aviation, the Honourable James Fairbairn, stated that the Eagle Farm Aerodrome site was very suitable for training purposes, and directed that it be retained. This was supported by Captain Johnston, who originally selected the site. This decision is likely related to Fairbairn's attendance at a meeting in Ottawa in December 1939 in which the details of the Empire Air Training Scheme were concluded. Australia had declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, and the importance placed on the retention of Eagle Farm in concert with Archerfield is reflected in Fairbairn's report to Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies that \\"the only activity that we have undertaken which could lead to the winning or losing of the war by our failure or success in carrying out our undertaking is the Empire Air Training Scheme\\". After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Archerfield Aerodrome assumed a new strategic importance as it provided a base for Australian, American, British, and Dutch air squadrons, was used for the maintenance and repair of military aircraft, and for training purposes. Archerfield Aerodrome played an important role in the Allied war effort, particularly following the entry of Japan into the war with the attack on Pearl Harbor on 9 December 1941. Immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbour, Archerfield Aerodrome was placed on \\"war alert\\". The aircraft were dispersed around the boundary of the airfield to minimise damage in case of attack and duty crews were on immediate standby at all times. Other precautions at Archerfield in case of air attack included slit trenches, introduction of camouflage, and the use of decoy aircraft.  Military aviation in Australia, and events leading to the Second World War  The Australian Flying Corps were involved in the First World War as part of the Australian Army. Following the establishment of the Royal Air Force in 1918, Australia's Minister for Defence, Senator George Pearce, appointed the Swinburne Committee to report on the needs of military aviation. Australia's involvement in the Imperial defence strategy inevitably placed its senior military commanders in a position subordinate to their British counterparts, and as its starting point the Committee accepted the strategy's basis that Australia's security would continue to be based on sea power. The committee found that while they supported the establishment of an air service, they rejected any suggestion that it should have an independent role. Any Australian air force would exist solely to support the sea and land forces. The Committee recommended the formation of a single, separate air corps, which would be administered by an Air Board composed of members of the Naval and Military Boards, while the wings of the corps allotted to the Navy and Army were to be controlled by the Naval and Military Boards respectively. Cabinet approved the proposal on 18 February 1919, and the Air Board was formed with the Air Corps key role determined as surveillance. The Navy and Army had their own tasks for the air service, and in April 1920 put forward a proposal for the formation of an air force to meet certain fundamental needs of the Navy and Army, which included torpedo bombers, patrol planes, flying boats and seaplanes, fighting planes, reconnaissance planes and bombers. The Air Corps became the Royal Australian Air Force on 31 March 1921 with a total complement of 21 officers, and the bulk of its aircraft came as a gift from the Imperial government and consisted of essentially obsolete machines left over from the First World War. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) came into being as the world's second separate air force, and its establishment coincided with the decision to place defence spending on a peacetime basis for the first time since the First World War. In 1924, the Air Board described the RAAF's condition as most unsatisfactory and that it survived on a hand-to-mouth existence, with 65 officers and 300 men and only two machines fit for war. Defence funding became even tighter in the Great Depression years, and the situation did not improve until the mid-1930s with the growing threat of war and easing of the Depression. A particularly strong anti-RAAF move emerged in 1929 when there was a possibility that the Air Force would be dismembered and split between the other two forces, a threat which was apparent until after the mid-1930s. This coincided with Salmond Report of 1928 which recommended that Australia substitute air power (due to its speed, mobility, flexibility and offensive striking power) for sea and land power. As the Air Force entered the 1930s, it was still equipped with 1916-17 types of machines, although the growing threat of the Japanese air force had been recognised as early as 1925 in the Memorandum Regarding the Air Defence of Australia by Air Commodore Richard Williams. The 1920s had seen a vast improvement across the spectrum of aircraft performance, particularly in range and reliability. This was highlighted in 1928 when Squadron Leader Charles Kingsford-Smith and Charles Ulm completed the first trans-Pacific flight from California to Brisbane landing at Eagle Farm, and Squadron Leader Bert Hinkler AFC completed the first solo flight from England to Australia in 16 days in a light aeroplane. The capability now existed for long range strike operations against enemy shipping. Australia's defence independence was constrained by the commitment to the Imperial strategy and the British connection. The Imperial Conference of 1923 declared that the basis of the Empire's security was the sheltering screen provided by the Royal Navy, a judgement which was confirmed at subsequent conferences until 1937. Twice during the interwar period, a review of the RAAF was thought necessary, but in each occasion the government turned to an RAF officer, resulting in the Salmond Report of 1928 and the Ellington Report of 1938. Germany had invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, and on 3 September 1939 Australia declared war on Germany. The RAF realised that if massive expansion were necessary, Britain had the industrial capacity to increase aircraft production but it would not be able to train enough aircrew from British sources. Through Australia's commitment to the defence of Britain, agreement was reached that Australia and other Dominions would participate in a massive training program, subsequently known as the Empire Air Training Scheme, the details of which were concluded at a meeting in Ottawa in December 1939. Australia contributed over 27,000 men to the scheme throughout the Second World War. The RAAF's involvement in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) was more complex than in Europe. At this time, there were 12 RAAF squadrons, of which two existed in nucleus only and four were citizen force. The aircraft inventory consisted entirely of obsolescent machines. In Brisbane, aviation activities centred on Archerfield (including civil aviation) and Amberley which was under construction. The former Eagle Farm Aerodrome site was taken over by the RAAF for Flying Training purposes on 8 March 1940. On 7 December 1941 the US Navy Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbour was attacked by the Japanese. The US Pensacola convoy bound for the Philippines was redirected to Brisbane, arriving on 22 December 1941. Most of the Convoys seventy crated A-24s and P-40s were trucked to Amberley for erection and then for flying to their Clark Field destination in the Philippines, but Archerfield also shared in the erection of both fully crated and deck cargo delivered aircraft. A decision was made in January 1942 to develop Eagle Farm as a major aircraft erection depot and aerodrome from which the planes could proceed. Initial works were delayed by heavy rain for three weeks converting the ground to a quagmire, and as a result thousands of feet of ashes and coke breeze were carted from the gasworks and deposited in order to keep trucks moving with borrow material from Nudgee. Shiploads of aircraft components were arriving at the port and had to be transported to Amberley, and some to Archerfield, for assembly until Eagle Farm was ready. The Americans advised that the runways were urgently needed for the fighter plane protection of Brisbane, and on 29 March 1942 a squadron of P-39 aircraft landed. Archerfield Aerodrome would assume a new strategic importance as it would provide a base for Australian, American, British, and Dutch air squadrons, would be used for the maintenance and repair of military aircraft, and for training purposes, while maintaining its civil aviation functions and well established repair and maintenance facilities. Shortly after the entry of Japan into the War, Australian foreign policy appeared to make its most dramatic shift since Federation. On 27 December 1941 Prime Minister Curtin stated that Australia now looked to America \\"free from any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom...we shall exert all our energies toward the shaping of a plan, with the United States as its cornerstone\\". At this time, the RAAF did not have a fighter remotely capable of combating the Japanese Zero, which served the Japanese Naval units. By February 1942 Japanese forces had gained footholds in territories adjoining northern Australia which made it seem probable that the advance southwards would continue, culminating in the invasion of Australia. This threat of invasion in 1942 is summarised in a statement made by Prime Minister John Curtin in 1944, in which he said \\"now that Singapore was lost and we were unable to concentrate a superior fleet, the strength of our defences was inadequate to defend Australia...against an enemy with command of the sea and air. We lacked air support, possessing no fighters whatsoever, and our bomber and reconnaissance planes had been reduced to about 50 machines. No country faced a greater danger with less resources than Australia.\\" The RAAF had not performed well up until this time, with their involvement in the Far East campaign consisting of a series of devastatingly quick defeats, and a humiliating flight down the Malay Peninsula to Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies before final defeat or capture. On the 19 February 1942 the Japanese bombed Darwin, and the Darwin Air Station was not well prepared. Several Australian and American aircraft were destroyed on the ground or shot down, and large numbers of the RAAF deserted their posts with 278 personnel still missing four days after the attack. It was against this background that the decision to place the RAAF under General Douglas MacArthur was made on 18 April 1942. The directive appointing General MacArthur as Supreme Commander of the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) placed under his control all armed forces which the governments concerned had assigned, or may assign, to this area. The Supreme Headquarters was in Brisbane in the AMP Building (MacArthur Central). Tenants were compulsorily evacuated under military orders from 21 July 1942 until 14 June 1945. Recognising the need for a coordinating agency for all Australian construction of a military nature, an Allied Works Council (AWC) was formed in February 1942, and the works were mainly carried out by the Civil Construction Corps, into which labour and manpower could be drafted. The Civil Construction Corps, a labour force of more than 50,000 people, was set up in April of the same year. While some of these people were volunteers, the majority were drafted. The AWC was disbanded in September 1945. Second World War Construction Work at Archerfield In November 1939 defence works tenders were announced by the Department of the Interior, including for the erection of an Elementary Flying Training School at Archerfield. This was initially named the 3 Flying Training School (FTS), but was soon renamed 2 EFTS, and was based at Archerfield from November 1939 until it was disbanded late April 1942. In June 1941, it was reported that contracts for 49 buildings at Archerfield for the RAAF had been accepted by Senator Harry Foll, Minister for the Interior. These buildings were constructed by contractor H Trelour and were located at the southeast of the aerodrome at the corner of Mortimer and Beatty Roads. The RAAF 23rd Squadron was based at Archerfield from 30 August 1939 to 6 May 1942, while the RAAF airfield at Amberley was under construction. On 1 July 1942 the RAAF closed down its Station and Archerfield was then given over entirely to the U.S. operations in July 1942, in concert with the ongoing civil aviation operations and the well established repair and maintenance facilities. Under U.S. Lt. General George Kenney, a Central Command Base for the 5th Airforce was established. Planes flown in and out of Archerfield by the U.S. Air Force included B-17 Flying Fortresses, Liberators, Kittyhawks, Dakotas, and B-26 Marauders. The embryo U.S. camp, named \\"Camp Muckley\\", was developed to the southeast of the Archerfield Aerodrome. The construction of anti-aircraft gun emplacements at Archerfield was proposed in July 1941, however following the bombing of Pearl Harbour in December 1941, the excavation of slit trenches and air-raid shelter construction proceeded swiftly. While Amberley had paved runways, Archerfield still had grass runways. Initially Archerfield was too small, and the runway too short. Extensions to the landing area to the northeastern corner were approved in March 1942 which involved severing Boundary Road, and the existing Queensland Aero Club buildings fronting Boundary Road were moved. March 1942 saw the strengthening of anti-aircraft defences in Brisbane at Archerfield and Eagle Farm, and other locations. Camouflage work at Archerfield was underway from April 1942. In 1943, a site on nearby Kerry Road was chosen for the erection of 5 large span nailed timber arch igloos. The five Kerry Road igloos were constructed on this site by the Allied Works Council for the Department of Aircraft Production in 1943-44. The igloos were situated near the Archerfield Aerodrome but separated by Beatty Road. A taxiway between the aerodrome and the igloos allowed the structures to be used for the servicing and repair of military aircraft. Four of these igloos were used as hangars and the fifth as a store. A December 1942 camouflage report for the Department of Aircraft Production indicated that while looking at sites for additional hangars it was noted that the Department of Civil Aviation contemplated extensions of runways east of Beatty Road, and that action was being taken to acquire a strip of land deep parallel with Kerry Road which was intended to become the main access road to the aerodrome. It was noted that at some future date it was intended to remove some of the existing hangars at Archerfield and place them along Kerry Road, and this may account for the location of the existing igloos well back from the road. Eventually five large igloos with ancillary buildings were constructed. Work on the first of the five igloos (either no.3 or no.4) and ancillary buildings was commenced around February 1943 by contractor William Hughes and Co Pty Ltd. It has been noted that \\"The igloos are a testament to the then Commonwealth Government's philosophy of dual purpose planning, of high cost projects for wartime and post-war\\". This \\"dual purpose planning\\" would provide for continuing industrial and infrastructure development in the post-war period. A camouflage report of March 1943 noted the siting of a Civil Construction Corps camp for the \\"new hangar work\\" on Kerry Road, and suggests anti-aircraft guns were located there. By March 1943 the initial pair (nos. 3 and 4) of Kerry Road igloo hangars were under construction, and these were noted as being long and span and of hardwood construction. The valuable maintenance and airframe repair resources of civilian organisations such as QANTAS and AOA/ANA continued to operate and were much in demand at Archerfield, and QANTAS was at work in the second igloo hangar to be constructed (no.3 or no.4) before construction works were complete in August 1943. The second pair of igloo hangars to be erected (nos. 2 and 5) featured their abutment pins raised a few metres above the ground on sturdy timber frames, resulting in much greater clearance, and drawings of these two igloos are dated October 1943. These igloos were noted as being long and span and of hardwood construction. By January 1944 the middle two igloo hangars were complete, with the eastern igloo hangar half built and the western igloo hangar not yet erected. By April 1944, all five igloos were almost complete, with the western igloo hangar underway. The fifth igloo functioned as the store, and was noted as being long and span and of Oregon construction, and the four igloo hangars were surrounded by hardstand. Taxiways lead to the south of the igloos and then to the west of the site crossing Beatty Road. A photograph dated c.1945 shows the western igloo with a large concrete storm water drain running under the site. A total of 35 buildings including ancillary structures such as administration buildings, lavatories and guard houses were also erected. The Kerry Road igloos were shared initially by ANA and QANTAS, in the repair and maintenance of military aircraft for the Department of Aircraft Production. One of the middle two igloo hangars was reportedly used to remove planes' engines which were then sent to nearby Salisbury for testing. The larger igloo hangars (nos. 2 and 5) had walkways near the ridge which enabled overhead access of the planes. When U.S. forces reached the Philippines, their activities at the Kerry Road igloos ceased. From February 1945 the middle two igloo hangars were given over to the U.K.'s Royal Naval Air Service. Their transportable Aircraft Maintenance Yard No. 1, referred to as TAMY 1, assembled, repaired and flight tested aircraft for the Fleet Carrier force sent to the Pacific after Victory in Europe. Accounts of large scale dumping at sea of much of the \\"Lease-Lend\\" equipment from the decks of carriers, over off the east coast of Australia, were reported. The RAF and the Netherlands East Indies Air Force were also stationed at Archerfield from mid-1945. Development of the Igloo Faced with wartime manpower shortages as well as a lack of building materials, particularly steel and timber, it was necessary for the authorities to find a method for constructing large, easily assembled structures suitable for such functions as hangars, stores and shelters. Prefabrication provided part of the solution, particularly in Queensland where there was less building infrastructure and equipment, (partially due to fears of bombing raids). Although prefabricated buildings had been in use in Australia from the beginnings of European settlement and World War I saw the development of the Nissen hut, the prefabricated structures used during the Second World War differed in terms of their production line technique, span and sheer size. American designs and technologies for building large span timber structures were introduced to Australia for this purpose, although it has been suggested that a French engineer employed at Hornibrooks, Breakfast Creek, may have been responsible for the innovative design of the type of timber arched hangar built at Archerfield. These large igloos used small pieces of timber (sometimes green, unseasoned timber) nailed together to form a trussed framework roofed with corrugated iron. The igloo is a light nailed hardwood timber arch construction, where each arm is made up of two half arches more or less freely pinned at two abutments close to the ground level, and at a central or crown pin. Each half arch consists of two adjacent trusses laced together at top and bottom chord level and each truss consists of a top and bottom chord laced together in arch form. As a result, each truss is made up of four main timber chords sprung into arch form, and light timber bracing nailed into position to form a curved open-latticed box truss. These igloos were designed to have the half arches raised by ropes and pulleys before being pinned together at the centre. The igloos at Archerfield were one of several designs for lightweight long span structures which used timber in small sectional sizes of chords to enable the lattice trusses to be hand nailed in jigs on site and speedily erected at low cost. As previously stated, it has been noted in a study of prefabricated Second World War structures that the Archerfield Second World War Igloos are among \\"the longest clear span buildings existing in Australia\\". Post World War II Igloo No. 3, 2015 The land surrounding the igloos was acquired by the Crown in February 1945 pursuant to the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act 1906 and The Real Property (Commonwealth Titles) Act of 1924. The RAAF and the RAF had a presence at Archerfield Aerodrome until 1946. The RAAF 23rd Squadron returned to Archerfield in 1948, and remained there until 1955. After the conclusion of the Second World War, Eagle Farm was re- established as Brisbane's principal airport by the Department of Civil Aviation with operations commencing in 1949, and Archerfield became Brisbane's secondary airport, catering for general aviation and flying schools. Archerfield Aerodrome is still government owned, and managed by the Federal Airports Corporation. All five igloos are now in private ownership and one (No. 5) is no longer within the heritage register boundary. Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd occupied the site in 1962, which was purchased from the Commonwealth for and transferred in June 1965. Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd still own the site on which No. 4 igloo is located, and only minor changes to its structure has occurred. Other changes to the Thiess Contractors site include the demolition of a house at the front of the site in 1991. This house was originally used as an office, and has been replaced by an administration building. The other three igloos are now owned by Hastings Deering (Australia) Ltd. Other remnants from the Second World War period on the Hastings Deering property include a drainage channel running through the carpark at the front of the site and a bridge across the drain. Originally a supplier of milking machinery and tractors, Hastings Diesels Ltd moved from their Melbourne Street premises at South Brisbane to Kerry Road, Archerfield in 1957. The property was transferred in April 1968. Currently named Hastings Deering, the company operates large scale sale and servicing of earthmoving equipment. There have been a few major changes to the Hastings Deering site, including the addition of a single-storeyed administration building to the end of igloo no.2, the construction of additions for such purposes as painting and engine testing, and the re-roofing of the igloos.  Description  Roof of Igloo No. 4, 2015 The site comprises four timber framed igloos with corrugated iron and ribbed metal sheet cladding. Numbered from the eastern end of the site, the igloos are identified by a number from 1 to 4. The site fronts Kerry Road to the north, with a recreation reserve to the south fronting Mortimer Road. All four igloos are of similar construction, and use nailed timber arch construction, where each arm is made up of two half arches pinned at two abutments close to the ground level, and at a central or crown pin. Each half arch consists of two adjacent trusses laced together at top and bottom chord level and each truss consists of a top and bottom chord laced together in arch form. Each truss is therefore made up of four main timber chords sprung into arch form, and light timber bracing nailed into position to form a curved open-latticed box truss. The structures were originally sheeted in corrugated iron, however igloos nos. 1-3 have been re-sheeted with ribbed metal sheeting. The structures also have translucent sheeting at regular intervals, approximately located between each box truss, which provide adequate lighting levels. The igloos have ridge ventilators, concrete floors, and the abutments are fixed by timber plates into concrete footings. Original external stormwater drains along the side of each igloo are still in use, some with grates known as 'Bailey's matting'. Internally, the igloos are used for a range purposes including storage and manufacturing, and consequently have various free- standing structures. Igloo no. 1 is the former store, and is the smallest of the four igloos. It is located closer to Kerry Road than the remaining three igloos which are in alignment facing north-south. When constructed, it was described as being long and span and of Oregon construction, and currently has skillion roofed side annexes. Igloo nos. 2 is of similar size and is the largest of the four igloos, and when constructed was described as being long and span and of hardwood construction. It has an overhead walkway near the ridge, and its abutment pins are raised a few metres above the ground on timber frames which result in much greater clearance. Igloo no. 2 has a large single-storeyed administration building added to the northern end, and large additions have also been made to the southern end including a paint booth and engine testing room. This igloo has skillion roofed side annexes, and large louvres have been installed in the northern wall above the administration building. Igloos nos. 3 and 4 are of similar size, and when constructed were described as being long and span and constructed of hardwood timber. Igloo no. 3 has skillion roofed side annexes and the name HASTINGS DEERING on the northern wall above the entrance which has evidence of early sliding door mechanisms. Internally this igloo shows some signs of structural movement, with the cracking of some narrow timber members and cracking of concrete surrounds to abutments. Igloo no. 4 has original gable roofed side entrances, and has been enclosed at the southern end with several demountable structures, and a fence separates it from the surrounding Thiess Contractors site. Large carparks are located to the north of igloos along the Kerry Road frontage, and several demountable and ancillary structures are located around the igloos and the site in general. An original concrete drainage channel is located along the northern part of the site parallel to Kerry Road, with an original bridge north of igloo no. 3. This drainage channel turns southwards between igloos nos. 1 and 2 and runs to the rear of the property.  Heritage listing  Archerfield Second World War Igloos Complex was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 August 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Archerfield Second World War Igloos Complex is important in illustrating the pattern of Queensland's history, and comprises three former igloo hangars and one associated igloo store. These structures are located on a site which had been part of the Archerfield Aerodrome during the Second World War, and were constructed in 1943-44 by the Allied Works Council for the Department of Aircraft Production. The igloo complex was used for military aircraft maintenance and repair under the control of the U.S. 81st Air Depot Group, and under the U.S. 5th Air Force under the command of General Douglas MacArthur's Supreme Headquarters of the South West Pacific Area. The igloos complex is important in demonstrating the strategic role of Archerfield Aerodrome in the maintenance and repair of military aircraft, and the significant contribution to the Allied war effort made by the well established civil aviation repair and maintenance facilities at Archerfield Aerodrome. The development of the igloo complex, and Archerfield Aerodrome as a strategic facility for the repair and maintenance of military aircraft, is a result of a shift in Australian foreign policy in December 1941, when Prime Minister Curtin announced that Australia now looked to America free of the United Kingdom to shape a plan with the United States as its cornerstone. As a result, all Allied forces were placed under the control of General Douglas MacArthur in April 1942, and under U.S. Lt. General George C. Kenney, a Central Command Base for the 5th Airforce was established at Archerfield. This contrasts with Archerfield's previous role as Brisbane's airport, and later as a base for the RAAF 23rd Squadron, and a location for the RAAF Elementary Flying Training School which serviced the Empire Air Training Scheme to provide airmen for the defence of Britain, from late 1939. The igloo complex is representative of the massive wartime infrastructure constructed at and around sites such as Archerfield Aerodrome, and has been noted as being a testament to the then Commonwealth Government's philosophy of \\"dual purpose planning\\". This philosophy applied to high cost projects for both wartime and post-war use, and would provide for continuing industrial and infrastructure development in the post-war period. Since the late 1950s, the igloo complex has been continually associated with the industrial development of the surrounding area. The location of the igloos well back from Kerry Road also demonstrates the intention of the Department of Civil Aviation at the time for this to be the principal entrance to Archerfield Aerodrome, which had been Brisbane's principal airport prior to the Second World War. As a result of the massive infrastructure works during the war, Eagle Farm was re-established as Brisbane's principal airport with operations commencing in 1949, and Archerfield became Brisbane's secondary airport. The igloo complex is a significant example of the work of the Allied Works Council, and as such, is a testament to its ability to meet emergency demands for the construction of Allied defence works during the Second World War. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The igloo complex is one of the few highly intact Second World War sites which clearly demonstrates the site's original function, in this case as a major military aircraft repair and maintenance facility, and the important role this played in the defence of the South West Pacific Area. It also has the potential to reveal further information concerning the function of, and activities which occurred at, the site during the Second World War. The igloo complex is also a highly intact group of timber truss igloo structures, which demonstrate the principal characteristics of this type of structure, and represent a significant advancement in timber technology and construction achieved during the Second World War which enabled long span lightweight structures using hand nailed timber in small sectional chord sizes to be erected quickly and at low cost. It has been noted in a study of prefabricated Second World War structures that the Archerfield Second World War Igloos are among the longest clear span buildings existing in Australia. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The igloos are substantial structures in a relatively flat landscape, and through their bulk and simple form make a considerable aesthetic and architectural contribution to the surrounding area, and are recognised as local landmarks. Internally, the innovative timber structure is clearly expressed, and the expansive interiors and quality of natural light contribute to the aesthetic significance of the structures. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period.

The process is characterised by hand printed wood block relief prints with naturally sourced pigments and dyes. Bagh print fabric motifs are typically geometric, paisley, or floral compositions dyed with vegetable colours of red and black over a white background, and is a popular textile printing product. Its name is derived from the village Bagh located on the banks of the Bagh River.Bagh hand block print artist Mohammed Bilal Khatri History The origins of the Bagh print are uncertain, but it is believed that the practice is over 1,000 years old, with the techniques having been handed down through family practice from generation to generation. It is possible that the craft traveled with settlers from Jawad in the Madhya Pradesh state in India or from printers of Rajasthan state. Another possibility is that the Chhipas, or traditional cloth printers, of the Muslim Khatri community who currently practice the craft of Bagh print, traveled to the area around 400 years ago from Larkana in Sindh province, Pakistan, which is known for the Arjak tradition of block printing. The initial reasons for the migration is unclear, but the area's proximity to the Bagh river, which provided the water necessary for washing of fabric and processing of vegetable dyes, could be the primary reason for settling in Bagh. In addition, the chemical composition of the water from the Bagh river enhances the texture of the vegetable, natural, and black dyes, giving them a luminous quality that distinguishes Bagh prints from other prints in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan regions. In the 1960s, many craftsman abandoned the traditional process of Bagh prints in favour of using synthetic fabrics. However, a number of artisans, including Ismail Sulemanji Khatri, continued to practice and innovate within the traditional framework of the craft and brought Bagh prints to international prominence. In 2011, a Bagh print design was adopted in a tableau theme of the Madhya Pradesh state at the Republic Day parade in New Delhi on 26 January 2011. Featured in the parade was a Shalbhanjika, the celestial apsara of the 11th century, draped in Bagh printed clothing. Process Mohammed Yusuf Khatri at work on the Bhatti process. The process of creating Bagh prints includes pre-printing (the washing and pre- dying of the fabric), printing (application of the design) and post printing (fixing the dyes and applying a fabric finish).  Pre-printing  Pre- printing starts with Khara Karna, the initial washing of the fabric for printing. Cotton is the commonly used fabric; however, other fabrics include the Maheshwari suit material, kosa silk, bamboo chicks, chiffon, crepe, georgette tissue, and mulberry silk. The Khara Karna washing consists of washing in running water for two hours and beating the fabric on river stones to remove any starch in the fabric to assist with the dyeing process. Next, the fabric is soaked in a water solution of rock salt, mengni (goat dung), and castor oil, pressed, rinsed and dried three times, which is known as Mengni Karna. Then, the cloth is pre-dyed with Harara to provide an off-white base color, which also adds a richness to the black and red dyes that will be applied later.  Printing  Bagh prints are made by hand applying natural and vegetable based dyes using carved wood relief blocks. Red and black dyes are most common, but indigo, mustard, and khaki dyes are also used. New blocks for printing are hand carved from teak or sheesham wood, but some blocks have been in use for 200 ‚Äì 300 years. Motifs for the prints are geometric or floral, sometimes inspired by the 1,500 year old paintings at Bagh Caves.  Dyes  Dyes for printing are derived from plant sources (plants, fruits, and flowers), and minerals. To make the dyes, pigments like ferrous sulfate and alum are boiled in water and mixed with tamarind seed powder to make a paste, which acts as black and red dyes respectively. Other colors like indigo, mustard, and khaki can be made using indigo leaves, dhavdi leaves, or pomegranate rinds.  Printing blocks  The blocks, known as bilals, are made of intricate and deeply carved teak or sheesham wood and are frequently sourced from Pethapur, Gandhinagar, and Jaipur. The relief blocks can be reused and collected over generations, with some family libraries holding thousands of individual designs. Some blocks are aged up to 300 years old and have been in use for so long that they are known by particular names. New blocks are made approximately every six months to keep up with market demands, but care is taken to ensure that the new design is a variation of a traditionally accepted design. Common motifs include geometric shapes as well as natural forms like jasmine, mushroom, mango, or small dots on a field.  Printing process  In order to apply the correct amount of dye to the printing block, a wooden reservoir, called a palea, is filled with dye. A bamboo mesh (kartali) wrapped in wool is set up to float in the reservoir, soaking up the dye and transferring the color when the printing block is rested on top. The cloth to be printed is laid over a red sandstone table, called a farsi, which is padded with extra cloth or old clothes to ensure smooth printing. The printing blocks are applied by hand, with an expert craftsman producing five yards of fabric in two to three hours, depending on the complexity of the design. Once the design is fully printed, the cloth rests for 8 to 14 days to allow the dye to fully absorb into the fabric.  Post-printing  Once the fabric has rested, it is brought to the river and rigorously washed for 20 minutes and beaten against river stones to remove excess dye. This process, known as the Bichalna, requires both strength and care, as any smudges or stains that occur from improper washing are permanent. The fabric is then fixed and finished in the Bhatti process, where the fabric is boiled in a mixture of water, Alizarin, and Dhavda flowers. The fabric is constantly shifted and turned with long sticks as the temperature of solution is slowly increased, which aids in the proper development of the colors. The whole process takes from four to six hours. Finally, the fabric is bleached and washed three more times before the fabric is complete.

The artisans themselves follow an internal quality control mechanism through various stages of its production through master artisans. The Textiles Committee of the Ministry of Textiles, Government of India, exercises quality control through the Development Commissioner of Handicrafts in cooperation with the stakeholders. New experiments Initially, Mohammed Yusuf Khatri, Mohammed Bilal Khatri, Mohammed Kazeem Khatri and their family made traditional dresses to meet the needs of various caste groups residing in the tribal region of Bagh. People of different castes and families had different dresses with specific identification tags of the tribal Bhil and Bhilala community. Some of the Kahtris developed designs to meet contemporary urban taste in the later part of 1980s; these designs covered sarees, shalwar kameez, covers for cushion and tables, block printed silk saree, tusser silk, silk stoll, scarf and so forth. Some the family members created innovative wooden blocks and colours which were accepted in the national and international market due to their long life. These included craft such as block printing on bamboo chik or mats, leather, jute, and other materials besides cloth. One such practice he pursued was the old technique of reusing the traditional blocks of 200 to 300 years old, which were patterns or designs of paintings in the 1,500 year old cave paintings in the region. Some of the block designs covered Nariyal Zaal and Ghevar Zaal based on the Taj Mahal paintings, Saj, Dakmandwa, chameli or jasmine, maithir or mushroom, leheriya and jurvaria or small dots on the field. Other innovations introduced by the Khatri family are block designs of the jaali pattern from the Taj Mahal and forts in the region, standardizing the use of primary colours of alum based red, and corroded filings of iron for black, and developing vegetable based yellow and green dyes. His primary innovation was creating the Bagh print on different types of cloth by printing on them. His innovative design of a bed cover, consisted of a bed cover which had 1,200 different blocks and won him the National Award in 1984. Location The Bagh village, where this handicraft is practiced, lies within the geographical coordinates of at an elevation of . The Bagh river, which flows near the village, is a major factor in the adoption of the art form. The Narmada river, about from Bagh, being a perennial source, is an important source for this art work, particularly during the season when the Bagh river goes dry.

The full title of the peace treaty is \\"Final Peace Agreement Between the Government of Australia and the Government of Siam\\". It was one of the first expressions of Australian sovereignty and independence in foreign affairs after the Statute of Westminster came into effect in 1942. Background Australian and Dutch prisoners of war at Tarsau in Thailand, 1943 In November 1941, as concerns about war with the Japanese in the Pacific grew, the Thai minister of justice, Thamrong Navasawat, met the Australian prime minister, Robert Gordon Menzies, in Canberra during a goodwill tour of the British Empire in Asia. This meeting was designed to assure the government of Australia of Thailand's neutrality. The British had been pressing the Australians to establish a legation in Bangkok, but the latter still preferred that their interests be represented by the Westminster. On 8 December, the Japanese invaded Thailand and the Thais quickly accepted Japanese terms for the transit of their armies. On 21 December, Thailand signed a broad military alliance with Japan. The Allied bombing of Thailand had already begun when, on 25 January 1942, the Thai government declared war on Britain and the United States. While the latter refused to accept the action as a free one and did not regard Thailand as other than an occupied country, Britain responded in kind. Since Australia then had no representation in Bangkok, Canberra asked the Swiss to inform the Thai government on 2 March that it had declared war on Thailand. There was no response, and the Thais claimed after the war that they had no intention of going to war with Australia and were unaware of the convention that Australia was at war whenever Britain was. There were only eleven Thai persons in Australia at the time, and all were watched by the Security Service of the Commonwealth Investigations Branch. Some Australians, mostly employees of the tin mines, were interned along with the British in Thailand. Negotiations In October 1945, the Chifley Government sent Lieutenant-Colonel Allan J. Eastman of the Australian Army as their representative in Allied-occupied Bangkok. J. C. R. Proud, the Australian political representative in Singapore, summed up the government's position with regards to peace with Thailand when he advised Eastman that \\"the death in Siam of so many Australian prisoners of war is a fact which cannot be disregarded by us.\\" The British suggested that Australia should negotiate its own peace treaty with Thailand, and it was briefly considered elevating Eastman to the post of minister to Thailand, but it was decided not to establish full diplomatic relations with a state with which Australia was still at war. Eastman was appointed consul and participated in Anglo-Thai negotiations taking place at Singapore even before royal assent to his consulship was obtained. Since Thailand had never formally recognised a state of war with Australia, it regarded a separate treaty with the latter as a technicality. Australia's terms were simply that Thailand end its state of war with Britain and accept Britain's peace terms. It insisted on the trial of collaborators with the Japanese‚Äîwhich the Thais resented‚Äîand on reparations in relation to the tin mines. The Thais did try and imprison former Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram in order to forestall any Allied tribunal before signing the Anglo-Thai Peace Treaty on 1 January 1946. After the British peace treaty, Eastman exchanged notes with the Thai negotiator, Prince Vivadhanajaya Jayanta, confirming that a separate treaty with Australia would be signed no later than 3 April. The government in Canberra considered withdrawing him from Bangkok at that point, but he urged his retention so long as the process for determining compensation claims lasted. He was not withdrawn until ratifications of the peace treaty were exchanged in May. In 1950 Thailand agreed to pay ¬£6 million in compensation to the governments of Britain and Australia for wartime damage to their tin mining operations. The Australian share amounted to just over ¬£1 million.

Ethiopia has a number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including Axum (granted World Heritage status in 1980), the rock‚Äìhewn churches of Lalibela (1978), the Semien Mountains National Park (1978), the Fasiledes Castle in Gondar (1979); the prehistoric sites of Tiya (1980), the lower Valley of the Awash River (1980), the lower Valley of the Omo (1980), the Muslim Holy city of Harar (2006); and the Konso Landscape (2011). Unfortunately, the archaeology of Ethiopia is understudied in many ways. Little research has been done at Tiya, and there are several difficulties in understanding these types of sites from an archaeological standpoint. First, it is difficult to determine the identity of the megalith builders given just the megaliths themselves. Second, archaeologists have been preoccupied with reconstructing ethnic histories through oral historical accounts, yet these are unavailable or uninformative in many cases. Surface finds at Tiya contained a selection of Middle Stone Age tools (MSA) that are technologically similar to tools found at Gademotta and Kulkuletti. Because of a unique production process that uses what are called ‚Äútranchet blows‚Äù, Tiya tools might also belong to the same time span as these other two sites. Other points of interest near Tiya include Melka Awash, the Hera Shetan crater lake, and Agesoke, a place where very tall, naturally ordered stone blocks can be seen. Broader significance Man honourary stele, with swords Anthropomorphic woman honourary stele, with breast A sword symbol on a stele at Tiya. According to Joussaume (1995), who led archaeological work at Tiya, the site is relatively recent. It was dated to a time period between the 11th and 13th centuries CE. Later dating places the stelae's construction some time between the 10th and 15th centuries CE. However, the building of megaliths in Ethiopia is a very ancient tradition, with many such monuments predating the Common Era. Tiya is one of nine megalithic pillar sites in the Gurage Zone. As of 1997, 118 stelae were reported in the area. Along with the stelae in the Hadiya Zone, the structures are identified by local residents as Yegragn Dingay or \\"Gran's stone\\", in reference to Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (Ahmad \\"Gurey\\" or \\"Gran\\"), ruler of the Adal Sultanate. The Gurage stelae are of three types: anthropomorphic stelae with human figures, phallic stelae, and stelae of neither anthropomorphic nor phallic type. The anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic/non-phallic stelae types are flat in shape, being the only stelae of this form in the southern region. Most of these stelae, including the 46 ones at Tiya, which are the largest of the bunch, also have distinctive, elaborate decorations. Among these designs are swords, plant-like symbols, and a standing human figure with arms akimbo. The plant and sword emblems can be found on the same stelae. The sword design is reportedly of local \\"Galla\\" type, as made by the Oromo. The shape of its blade is likewise the same as that of a traditional Somali dagger. In addition, the Tiya rock slabs also often feature a T-shaped symbol. The stelae at Tiya and other areas in central Ethiopia are similar to those on the route between Djibouti City and Loyada in Djibouti. In the latter area, there are a number of anthropomorphic and phallic stelae, which are associated with graves of rectangular shape flanked by vertical slabs. The Djibouti-Loyada stelae are of uncertain age, and some of them are adorned with an analogous T-shaped emblem. Additionally, archaeological excavations at Tiya have yielded tombs.

History The first incinerator at Marchwood was a small plant which took refuse from Southampton and the New Forest, and was commissioned in 1975.Surveyor, (1975), Volume 145, page 35 This plant was closed in 1996. Demolition of the plant, which took place in 2010, was temporarily suspended when a pair of kestrels nested at the site. The new plant, commissioned in 2007, was built close to the site of the old incinerator. The plant is surrounded by a metal dome superstructure which was designed by the architect Jean-Robert Mazaud. The dome was built by the Texas company Geometrica. It was built using galvanized steel tubing joined with high-strength aluminium hubs, which was then clad in aluminium.

The girl, with a head full of crickets for the celebrity world, attracts the attention of Dicky Crawford, a patron of the womanizing arts who gets her a part in a show. Nora falls in love and Patricia tries to distract Crawford's interest from her sister by flirting with him. During the dress rehearsal, Patricia is chosen to replace the first sick actress. But, while in the dressing room, he sees a note that Nora is preparing to go to Crawford's apartment. Half dressed, he rushes to stop her, leaving the theater as he is, throwing on only a coat over the petticoat. At Crawford's house, the man tells her he is only interested in her. The two, however, are surprised by Danny who, working as an investigator for Crawford's wife, is looking for evidence to nail the man so that his wife can get a divorce. Having found his girlfriend wearing only underwear under her coat, Danny doesn't want to hear Patricia's protests of innocence. Only later, when Pat is about to be evicted, do the two manage to talk and clarify. Reconciled, they marry, moving to the countryside with Nora and her new boyfriend, a young stage assistant in love with her.

Valance had been a successful model prior to her casting and Paige marked her first acting role. Her half-sister Holly Valance previously appeared in the show as Felicity Scully from 1999 until 2002. Valance was initially contracted for three years. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 2 June 2014. Valance filmed her final scenes in November 2017 and Paige's departure aired on 30 March 2018. Valance returned on 24 February 2020, as part of the serial's 35th anniversary celebrations. Paige is portrayed as being \\"feisty\\", \\"tough\\", \\"unpredictable\\" and resourceful. Valance said Paige was not a mean character and often hid her softer side behind a \\"hard exterior\\". The character was introduced as the biological daughter of Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin) and Lauren Carpenter (Kate Kendall) and her early storylines focused on building relationships with her parents and half-siblings. Paige initially chose to keep her identity a secret, as she was scared that she would not be accepted. Paige also developed a relationship with her housemate Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) and was blackmailed into selling illegal car parts alongside Tyler Brennan (Travis Burns). The character has received mostly positive attention from critics, with one saying she had caused \\"quite a stir\\" since her debut and another who noted that she had a distinctive on-screen presence. Valance earned a nomination for Most Popular New Talent at the 2015 Logie Awards for her portrayal of Paige. Casting On 9 March 2014, Colin Vickery from news.com.au reported that Olympia Valance had joined the cast of Neighbours as Paige Novak. Valance had been a successful model prior to her casting in February and Paige marked her first acting role. She won the part after a lengthy audition process, which included four call-backs that got \\"harder and harder\\" each time. Of her casting, Valance commented \\"When I got the call to say the part was mine, I was so excited. In Australia, if you're on Neighbours, you're considered to have one of the best jobs in the world. It's iconic.\\" One of the first people Valance called was her half-sister Holly Valance, who previously appeared in Neighbours as Felicity Scully. She later said that working with people who knew her sister made her feel \\"very comfortable\\" on-set. Series producer Jason Herbison confirmed that Valance had won the role based on her own talents, saying she was \\"the perfect fit for Paige\\". Valance was initially contracted for three years. She made her screen debut as Paige on 2 June 2014. In December, Valance commented that she would leave Neighbours at the end of her contract, as she had a desire to move to London. However, in October 2016, Fiona Byrne of the Herald Sun reported that Valance had decided to extend her contract with the show for another six to eight months. Valance commented, \\"I love my job and I don't feel ready to leave just yet and they were happy to have me for a bit longer.\\" Development Backstory and characterisation In her fictional backstory, Paige had \\"a miserable upbringing\\" with her adoptive parents, and always felt second best to brother Ethan (Matthew Little). After leaving her boarding school, Paige became self-sufficient and worked various jobs. Her adoptive parents would send her \\"guilt-induced cash gifts\\" which she spent quickly on holidays and parties. Ahead of her introduction, Valance said \\"Paige isn't a mean character ‚Äì she's cool and sexy and a bit edgy ‚Äî and I think everyone is going to love her.\\" She also thought Paige's personality had many layers and hoped viewers would like her and find her interesting. Valance later described Paige as being \\"feisty\\", \\"unpredictable\\", \\"funny\\" and \\"very compassionate\\". She called Paige resourceful and said her \\"hard exterior\\" often hid her softer side. The Neighbours official website branded Paige \\"tough\\" and \\"volatile\\", adding that she works hard and enjoyed partying and skateboarding in her spare time. Valance liked her character and said she could identify with her family situation, as she is one of eight half- siblings. She also felt lucky to be playing someone with \\"such a complex history\\". Family Kip Gamblin plays Paige's biological father Brad Willis. Paige first became aware that her biological parents, Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin) and Lauren Carpenter (Kate Kendall), were looking for her when Brad met with Ethan in Adelaide. Valance told All About Soap's Carena Crawford that Paige felt relieved that she had finally found her parents, but there were so many unanswered questions surrounding them and her adoption. Paige became curious about her parents and followed them back to Erinsborough to find out more about them. She decided to keep her identity a secret, in order to find out what Brad and Lauren were really like. Paige checked into the local hotel with the fake surname Novak and made up a back story about being from Tasmania. Paige immediately ran into Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) and flirted with him, unaware that he was her half-brother. Valance explained that Paige was naturally flirty and thought Josh was \\"pretty hot\\" until she learned they were related. Paige's actions also put her half-sister, Amber (Jenna Rosenow), offside as she was dating Josh at the time. Paige met her mother at her caf√© and managed to get herself a job as a waitress. Lauren and Paige made a good impression on each other and Valance said there was a connection between them. Paige also engineered a meeting with Brad by joining the gym he managed, and Valance commented that Paige really liked her father. However, Brad's wife, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), was quite suspicious of who Paige was, especially as Paige had no ID and had checked into the hotel with \\"disposable cash\\". Paige also struggled to get along with her other half-sister, Imogen (Ariel Kaplan), as she was also suspicious of her, but Paige bonded well with her younger half-brother Bailey (Calen Mackenzie). Valance thought that deep down Paige was scared that her parents would not accept her as their daughter. She later said, \\"She builds relationships with people on the street who think she's someone she's not. Afterwards, people will find it hard to accept her because of it. There are a lot of people involved.\\" Paige's grandmother, Kathy Carpenter (Tina Bursill), was the first to discover her true identity. Paige learned that Kathy had hired a private detective to find her granddaughter and realised that she would soon have to tell everyone the truth. When Kathy asked Paige to mind her own business, Paige became angry and \\"in the heat of the moment\\", she took Kathy's heart medication. Valance insisted that Paige regretted her actions and intended to return the pills. While they were out for a drive together, Kathy found Paige's sketchbook with a drawing of Lauren inside that had the world \\"mum\\" underneath it. Kathy was so startled that she drove away without concentrating and crashed into Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney). Kathy then struggled to breathe as her scarf was choking her, and Paige had to step in and save her. Valance commented, \\"This isn't the way she wanted things to work out, of course, and she knows that she has to do everything she can to save Kathy's life.\\" After Kathy was rushed to hospital, Paige decided to leave town, believing that everyone would be disappointed in her. Valance said it would be hard for Paige to convince her parents that she did not mean to cause trouble, as she had been lying to them for so long. Paige left two teddy bears Lauren gave her at birth on her doorstep and caught a bus. Lauren managed to catch up to her and they had a \\"very emotional\\" reunion. Lauren then took Paige to Brad who was shocked at the revelation. When he asked Paige for a DNA test, Valance understood why. Her siblings had mixed reactions; Amber was not happy about Paige being her sister, while Imogen and Josh were accepting and started \\"to warm to her\\". However, Amber later showed them Paige's sketchbook and the unkind things she had written about them, which undermined the progress Paige had made with them. Valance did not think things would be easy for Paige going forward, but hoped that her new family would realise her heart was in the right place, even though she went about things the wrong way. Neither Terese or Matt were pleased when Paige revealed her identity. When Lauren asked Matt to welcome Paige into the family, he agreed. But Terese then asked him to join her in excluding Paige from both their families. When Matt learned Paige was responsible for trashing Harold's Store, he was forced to arrest her. Paige trashed the store after becoming frustrated over hiding her identity from Lauren. Paige admitted to the crime, while Lauren pleaded with Matt to go easy on her, but he could not give Paige any \\"special treatment\\" and they had to leave it to the law. Things between Paige and Terese eventually got easier, and Elmaloglou explained that there was a point where Terese finally accepts that Paige is not going anywhere. She hoped that Terese would take Paige under her wing in the future. Relationship with Mark Brennan Paige became Mark Brennan's (Scott McGregor) new housemate when she moved onto Ramsay Street. Valance did not rule out a relationship between Mark and Paige, saying \\"Hmmm, she is single, he is single ‚Äì I can't say anymore!\\" In August 2014, it was confirmed that producers had planned a romance storyline for Paige and Mark. They grew closer and realised that they had a deeper connection than friendship. During a gym work out, Paige proposed a little competition that meant whoever lost had to buy the other dinner. Paige pushed Mark over, causing him to lose and agree to take her out, but neither of them call it a date. Valance commented that Paige had been \\"really attracted\\" to Mark from the start, so she gets dressed up for the dinner. However, Mark struggled with the idea of moving on from his deceased fianc√©e Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer), and even though he knew it was a date, he had not admitted it out loud. Mark made the situation worse by ignoring Paige afterwards, causing her to confront him as a storm hit Erinsborough. Valance explained \\"They're both saturated from bringing in everything from outside and she's super fired up. She just loses it and screams in his face.\\" Mark and Paige then consummated their relationship. Paige and Mark's first official date ended abruptly when Paige turned up wearing Kate's dress, which she had purchased from a charity shop. Mark reacted angrily and accused Paige of being up to something, before shouting at her to get out of the bar. Mark later realised that he had been too harsh on Paige, but just as he decided to give their relationship another go, he saw her kissing another man. McGregor commented \\"He thinks he's blown his chances with her ‚Äì but he's also wondering if this is what he really wants.\\" McGregor was cautious about his character getting involved with Paige, as he believed that they were \\"at different stages of their lives\\". There was an age gap between them and a difference in maturity, which McGregor thought would impact on their future as a couple. Paige later witnessed Mark kissing Dakota Davies (Sheree Murphy), leaving her \\"hurt and frustrated\\". After sitting down to discuss their relationship, Mark told Paige that he had been undercover with the police and was investigating Dakota, who kissed him. Paige made it clear that Mark had not been treating her right, especially as he did not confide in her about his job. They then decided that their relationship was not working. A few weeks after their break-up, Mark invited Paige to an afternoon tea for Sonya (Eve Morey). But when she arrived she witnessed Mark engaging in \\"a heart-to-heart\\" with Rain Taylor (Airlee Dodds) and she left. Following Brad's advice, Paige told Mark that she loved him, but he explained that he did not feel the same way and probably never would. Valance told Alana Wulff of TV Week Soap Extra that being with Mark was the first time Paige had \\"ever fallen deeply in love\\". Even when he moved on with Naomi Canning (Morgana O'Reilly), Paige did not give up hope that he might reciprocate her feelings eventually. The following year, Mark realised that he still had feelings for Paige, but did not act on them as he believed she was dating his brother Tyler (Travis Burns). When he learned Paige and Tyler were about to break up, he offered Paige his support. Paige then tried to kiss him, but he rejected her advances. Valance commented, \\"Paige still has deep feelings for Brennan, and it's very hard for her to keep them under wraps.\\" The actress thought that Mark pulled away because he was scared to get involved while she was still with Tyler. Valance backed a reunion for Mark and Paige, telling Digital Spy's Sophie Dainty, \\"Paige just absolutely adores him. She completely loves him and even now that she is doing whatever with Tyler, deep down she is just completely besotted with Brennan.\\" Valance stated that the relationship had become popular with viewers and wanted to work more with McGregor, who she felt she shared a good chemistry with. The couple did reunite after Paige \\"pours her heart out\\" to Mark following a stalking incident. Paige was \\"touched\\" when Mark came to check on her, but when he told her he was just doing his duty, she confronted him and they ended up kissing. Mark and Paige later become engaged, after Paige proposed. Valance described the moment as \\"a bit of an accident\\" and thought it happened rather suddenly. The actress also pointed out that Paige was not sure about whether she wanted to get married, but she did want to be with Mark. When Paige started planning the wedding, she began to realise that she did want to get married and she became excited about it. Valance had fun picking out her character's wedding dress and she enjoyed having her hair and make-up done differently. Ahead of the wedding, Paige had been framed for several robberies, so she was unable to enjoy her hen party. She also told Lauren about her fears that Mark will soon find out what kind of woman he is marrying. On the day of the wedding, Paige assumed that she had gotten away with handling the stolen items. But when Mark turned up at the house, he arrested her in front of their friends and family. Mark then ended their relationship due to a lack of trust between them. Tyler Brennan and working for Michelle Kim Mark's younger brother Tyler began flirting with Paige after realising that Imogen did not have feelings for him. Paige initially told him that she would not be his second choice, but she later changed her mind. Tyler was wary that Paige was using him to get back at Mark, but Paige managed to assure him that she was genuinely interested in him. After spending the day flirting, Tyler and Paige kissed, but during the moment Paige called out Mark's name. Valance commented that it was just \\"a slip of the tongue\\" as she was constantly thinking about Mark. Paige and Tyler decided to just be friends. However, their attraction to one another grew stronger and they kissed again. Valance thought \\"Tyler and Paige were \\"too much alike\\", but they brought out the best in each other.\\" When Bailey took a stolen car from outside the garage, Paige reported it to the police and told Tyler. However, she was overheard by Michelle Kim (Ra Chapman), who ordered Paige and Tyler to give her $8000 or steal another car. Paige then learned Tyler was working for businessman Dennis Dimato (David Serafin) stripping stolen cars for parts. Michelle blackmailed Paige with video footage of Bailey stealing the car and then forced Paige into taking a job at the garage selling the stolen car parts. Paige and Tyler faked a relationship to cover up their illegal activities and tried to raise some money to pay off their debt by taking part in a bikini car wash. After realising that they made a good team, Tyler made a romantic advance towards Paige, but she rejected him. However, Paige later changed her mind and returned to the garage with the intention of having sex with Tyler, but she discovered he had already moved on with a customer. Valance told an Inside Soap columnist that Paige was better off with Tyler's brother, as she needed someone with more maturity. Paige and Tyler tried to turn the garage into a legitimate business, but they soon realised that they were not rid of Dimato when his nephew Joey (Steven Sammut) left them a bag of money and Michelle ordered them to make a drop-off. When they discovered that a community fundraiser was taking place near the drop-off point, they decided to put the money in an old well and retrieve it later. However, they became stuck in the well when a crowd of people gathered nearby. During their rime in the well, Paige and Tyler gave into their feelings for each other. Paige later admitted that still had feelings for Mark and Tyler told her that he just wanted to be friends. Paige and Tyler later learned that there was $6000 missing from the bag and Tyler was beaten. When Nate Kinski (Meyne Wyatt) learned of their debt, he offered to lend them the money. Paige was unhappy that someone else had become involved, and Valance said \\"She's also annoyed that Tyler didn't discuss it with her first. They're heaping lie upon lie, and she feels that their situation is escalating.\\" At the end of the year, Michelle seeks Mark's help, while he believes she may be able to lead the police to Dimato. Paige was wary and Valance explained that when Michelle tells Paige she was trying to get away from Dimato, Paige does not believe her as she has been \\"badly burned\\" by her before. However, Paige began to feel sorry for Michelle when she says she does not feel safe at the caravan park, where the police have hidden her. Michelle also opens up to Paige about her past and how she has found religion. Mark warns Paige that Michelle is manipulating her, but she does not listen to him and goes off to meet Michelle. Paige was then kidnapped and locked in a car boot. Of the scenes, Valance said \\"Paige is terrified ‚Äì and as soon as that boot closed on me, I got a real sense of what that would feel life. The whole thing shocks Paige, but she works out it has something to do with the Dimato situation.\\" Paige managed to escape her captor by striking him over the head and running out of the door. But as she ran down the road, Paige was unaware of the speeding car behind her until it clipped her, leaving her unconscious. Weeks later, Michelle came to Paige asking for her help as Dimato had been physically abusing her. Valance commented that Michelle was \\"a convincing victim\\" and Paige accepted that she needed help. Although Mark warned Paige that Michelle was playing her, Paige agreed to organise a SIM card in her name and a flat lease for Michelle. Valance told an Inside Soap columnist that Paige's sympathy for Michelle \\"clouds her judgement\\" and if she learnt Michelle was playing her, she would be very hurt. After a word from Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), Paige found the flat she leased for Michelle was full of stolen goods. During a \\"tussle\\" between the two women, Michelle managed to pin Paige to the ground and admitted that she was getting her revenge for Paige sending her to jail. Paul warns Paige that she needs to get rid of the stolen items as soon as possible, and Paige takes them to a charity bin, where she is almost caught by Mark. Paul later points out that Paige's plan is flawed and when she tries to get the items back, she finds them gone. Mark and Detective Ellen Crabb (Louise Crawford) find Paige's fingerprints on the items and learn that she has a second phone fill of incriminating message. Ellen tells Mark to bring Paige in for questioning. Departure and return In early 2017, Valance admitted to Holly Byrnes of the Herald Sun that while she wanted to pursue acting opportunities in London or Los Angeles, she would find it hard to make the decision to leave Neighbours, explaining \\"A lot of people don't get this opportunity, so I feel very lucky and very blessed to have been given this chance. To go and throw it away for the unknown ... it's going to be really hard because I've loved the cast, I love the crew.\\" Valance also revealed that she had asked the producers not to kill her character off if she did leave, as she wanted to return for guest appearances. On 1 December 2017, a reporter for The Daily Telegraph confirmed Valance had filmed her final scenes that week, and would be leaving the show to pursue new acting roles. Valance's step-father Ross Wilson, who filmed a cameo in the same week, later confirmed that Valance felt it was time to move on and she would be moving to Los Angeles in January 2018. He added \\"It's an emotional week for her. I know there will be a few speeches and a lot of tears.\\" Paige's exit scenes aired in March 2018. On 24 November 2019, Neighbours confirmed that Valance would reprise the role for the serial's 35th anniversary celebrations. Paige returns on 24 February 2020, followed shortly after by Jack. It soon emerges that the couple's relationship is on the rocks, and Paige suspects Jack may have had an affair. Storylines After learning her biological parents, Lauren Turner and Brad Willis, came looking for her, Paige follows them to Erinsborough.

Kathy's scarf restricts her breathing and Paige saves her. Paige decides to leave town, but Lauren catches up with her, finally knowing the truth.

Bailey takes a car from the garage, leading Paige to discover that it was already stolen and was part of an illegal car ring. She is blackmailed by Michelle Kim into helping Tyler raise $8,000 and is made manager of the garage.

They later discover some of the money has been stolen. Paige suspects Jayden Warley (Khan Oxenham), but it turns out to be Glen Darby (Luke Jacka).

When Nate Kinski is almost attacked by the man who beat Tyler, they tell him everything and he pays their debt.

Paige and Jack eventually reunite, but their relationship proves too difficult for Mark and Jack's girlfriend Steph Scully (Carla Bonner) to deal with. They decide to make a fresh start in Queensland, near Paige's family. Two years later, Paige returns to Erinsborough alone and she tells Terese that she thinks Jack is having an affair. Jack later joins her and reveals that he wants to go back into the priesthood, leading to their amicable break up. Paige spends time with Mark, who has returned for work, and Aaron and Chloe Brennan (April Rose Pengilly) conspire to set them up together. After a few dates, Paige proposes to Mark at the Lassiters Wedding Expo and he accepts. After another couple drop out of their wedding, Mark and Paige take their place. Jack brings Gabe to Erinsborough and Mark and Paige marry. Paige returns to Queensland to pack up her house and move to Adelaide, while Mark stays behind for work. Paige rings Mark while he is still in Erinsborough and tells him she is pregnant. Reception For her portrayal of Paige, Valance received a nomination for the Logie Award for Most Popular New Talent in 2015. She was also nominated for Best Daytime Star at the Inside Soap Awards. Paige and her storylines have received mostly positive attention from critics. A reporter for the Daily Record observed that Paige's arrival \\"ruffles some feathers\\". Kirsty Nutkins from the Daily Express quipped \\"Paige Smith has been causing quite a stir since her arrival in Ramsay Street\\". Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly praised Valance's addition to the cast, calling her a \\"standout\\" despite her lack of acting experience. He also thought Paige had \\"an instant and distinctive presence on screen\\". A reporter for The Age branded Paige \\"mysterious and cranky\\". Glen Williams from TV Week disliked Paige's lies, saying her \\"conniving deceit is simply chilling\\". While his colleague Stephen Downie thought Paige was \\"probably the last person you'd go to for advice.\\" A Soap World columnist noted that Neighbours had \\"mastered the art of big event storytelling\\" with plots such as the Paige reveal. All About Soap's Claire Crick was a fan of Paige and Brennan's romance, commenting \\"It's sad Kate died, but we can't help but love the new Prennan romance, it's about time someone put a smile on Mark's oh-so handsome face and there's no denying they make possibly one of the best-looking couples ever to grace Ramsay Street!\\" During a review of 2014, Kilkelly commented \\"We've been gripped by the huge repercussions from Paige's arrival in Erinsborough\\". In 2015, Kerry Barrett from All About Soap placed Paige at number 28 on the magazine's list of 30 favourite Neighbours characters. Barrett quipped that Paige \\"caused quite a stir in Erinsborough!\\" and thought her best moment was \\"revealing her true identity to mum Lauren.\\" Melinda Houston of The Sydney Morning Herald was not a fan of the character, saying \\"she's certainly proved herself psychopathically untrustworthy and the latest carry-on looks highly suss.\\" Of Mark and Paige's doomed wedding, Crick (All About Soap) quipped, \\"Wow! We thought we'd seen it all when it comes to soap weddings here at All About Soap ‚Äì but never before have we seen a groom arrest the bride just moments before the ceremony is about to start!\\" Crick went on to say that the wedding would \\"go down in Erinsborough history\\" for the wrong reasons, and that she thought Mark and Paige seemed like they were \\"made to be\\".

It was designed by Lange Leopold Powell and built from 1915 to 1916. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 June 2014.  History  Kurrowah, a rendered masonry, timber and tile residence on Gladstone Road, Dutton Park, in Brisbane, was designed by Lange Leopold Powell and constructed in 1915-1916. It is a rare and intact example of the residential work of this noted Queensland architect. This attractive house with a beautifully designed and crafted interior is set on high ground, giving it views to the west and south. The area now known as Dutton Park developed slowly. Initially it was thickly timbered, deeply gullied land. From the 1840s farms were established near the river. Early land owners included Edward Deighton (Under-Secretary, Department of Public Works and Mines 1877-8) whose house \\"Wahcumba\\" was situated on a large estate off Gladstone Road. By 1883 there were about ten residences along Gladstone Road, most on the ridge overlooking the river and on large allotments. Dutton Park railway station opened in 1884. Subdivision of land from large land holdings, such as the Deighton Estate (between Boggo Road, now Annerley Road, and James Street, now Lochaber Street), followed during Brisbane's 1880s land boom. The first horse- drawn bus service linking Dutton Park with the city commenced in 1890 and was replaced by electric tram along Gladstone Road by 1908. This stimulated rapid development of the area and almost doubled land values. In 1914 the suburb was named in honour of Charles Dutton, Secretary of Public Lands between 1883 and 1887, and by the 1920s the area was considered fashionable. The land on which Kurrowah stands was sold to Edward Deighton . The eastern portion of his estate adjoining Annerley Road was subdivided during the 1880s, as the Deighton Estate. Three larger blocks (totalling were also created. A new certificate for this land, which included the site of the future Kurrowah, was issued to Abraham Fleetwood Luya (timber merchant, South Brisbane Alderman and later South Brisbane Mayor and Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for South Brisbane) in 1888 and a house was built on the site, in which Luya was resident by 1889. He sold the property in 1894 to Anna Magdalena Heinecke, wife of Frederick W Heinecke (manager of the nearby Virginia Tobacco factory), who was listed by the Queensland Post Office Directory as living at \\"Linden\\" on Gladstone Road, between Gloucester and James Streets, by 1896. During the 1880s Brisbane had grown spectacularly. The population more than doubled to over 90,000 in 1891, primarily due to immigration. This stimulated building activity, municipal organisation, provision of amenities and services, and cultural and leisure outlets. The number of inhabited dwellings almost doubled between 1881 and 1891, from 5,814 to 10,321. Aided by the requirement of the Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885, which enforced a minimum allotment size, this population increase caused Brisbane to overshoot its boundaries, growing along the lines of transport (railway, road, tram and omnibus routes which were dictated by the hilly topography of the area) until the town coalesced with its fringe settlements transforming them into suburbs. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Brisbane was the largest administrative, commercial and industrial centre in Queensland. Two-thirds of the colony's imports were unloaded onto Brisbane wharves. Administration had become centralised and risen in importance with the expansion of government services. The number of civil servants (excluding teachers) had increased, many of whom were located in Brisbane. Increasingly private organisations were established in, or relocated to, Brisbane, centralising control there. With its population of 119,428 in 1901 the city had a sophistication and diversity not found elsewhere in Queensland. In February 1909 the Queensland Figaro reported that \\"Mr Frank Brodribb has purchased 'Linden', Gladstone Road, a handsome residence with charming grounds, occupied for some time by Mr and Mrs Pickworth. Mr Brodribb with his family will shortly take up residence there\\". Titles show that the property was purchased in his wife's name, Jessie Scott Brodribb, in November 1908. The Brodribb family was part of Brisbane's upper stratum of society, which at this time still comprised graziers, leading businessmen and professional men. Frank Kenric Brodribb was the son of Darling Downs property-owner Francis Claudius Brodribb, whose sheep station, \\"Kurrowah\\", was located between Millmerran and Cecil Plains. The elder Brodribb died in 1904 leaving a considerable estate, including his station, in trust for his four daughters and only son. Frank K Brodribb appears to have owned other properties in Brisbane, including a house in Bower Street off Gladstone Road in 1916 and, until its sale in 1917, a commercial building in Queen Street, Brisbane, occupied by the Union Bank of Australia. Jessie Brodribb was a daughter of early Queensland settler and builder John Campbell. The couple married in September 1904 at St Andrews Anglican Church, South Brisbane. They resided in the vicinity of Dutton Park from about 1908 after moving from Toowoomba. By 18 February 1909 the Brodribbs were in residence at 'Linden'. They quickly renamed the residence 'Kurrowah' and their second son was born there in July of that year. Social occasions and fund-raising events held at Kurrowah were often centred on the garden; with guest lists including the state's social elite. In January 1915, architectural firm Chambers and Powell called tenders \\"for the erection and completion of [a] Brick Residence, Gladstone-road\\". Drawings for its construction and that of a garage with pit, man's room, workshop, washing down shed and WC date the design to January 1914. In February 1916, the Brodribb's land was re-configured from three blocks to two with the former \\"Linden\\" (labelled \`Old House') on the block to the east (Resub 2, 1ac 19.7p (4545m2)) and a \\"New House\\" on the block to the west (Resub 1, ). Construction of the new Kurrowah was completed by 1916 when it was included in the Queensland Post Office Directory 1916-17 edition. The siting of the new house conforms to the preference of Brisbane's wealthier residents to site their homes on its hill tops and ridges, seeking \\"space, air, view, breeze, drainage, display... combined with a rustic home, they ... also settled ... on acreages outside the town boundaries\\". Initially Brisbane's social divisions, as in Australia's other capitals, were topographical (between ridge or hill and gully) but later in the nineteenth century, especially after the introduction of mass transport such as trams and trains, increasingly whole suburbs acquired class labels. No description of the house appeared in the media at the time of its completion. However, newspaper articles reporting later social events reveal that the \\"wide tile piazza was utilised for dancing.... Supper was served in the lounge\\". On another occasion, \\"[t]he reception rooms were beautified with [flowers].... The supper table...was set in the large panelled dining room.... Dancing was enjoyed on the wide, tiled piazza\\". There was a concrete tennis court in the grounds from at least 1923 which was utilised for tennis and jazz parties. Domestic architecture in Australia in the first two decades of the twentieth century was notable for its use of popular architectural treatments characterised by a conservative eclecticism. Before the modern movement shunned the predilection for styles, English Queen Anne and Arts and Crafts influences were slowly supplanted by the Californian Bungalow and Spanish Mission styles from The United States of America in the quest for architecture appropriate for Australian conditions. Another development, in the yards of affluent home owners, was the introduction of the garage in the back yard adjacent to the fence, usually in materials matching the house, to house the newly acquired car. The design of Kurrowah demonstrates this evolution and these preferences of the affluent classes at this period. Architectural influences evident in the design of Kurrowah are mostly derived from England and the work of architects such as Charles Voysey, combined with some features in common with the Bungalow. Essentially romantic in style, it has steep gabled roofs with decorative terracotta tiling, tall slender chimneys and deep recessed verandahs supported on substantial masonry piers. The drama of the exterior with its contrasting exterior finishes (light-coloured roughcast walls against dark brick work, shingles, mouldings and timber detailing) was repeated in the interior with dark timber panelling, ceiling beams and battens contrasted against smooth light-coloured friezes, ceilings and heavily decorated plaster embellishments. Kurrowah demonstrates a progression in the evolution of domestic architectural planning and decoration. Whilst maintaining picturesque influences such as nooks and bays, a move toward functionalism in line with overseas fashion is evident. The developing rationale provided rooms arranged for greater convenience, more attuned to the occupants' needs and the environmental benefits of aspect. The central hall is wider in the vicinity of the more public areas of the house to accommodate this active area; the piazzas and morning room provide outdoor living, appropriate for the climate; the kitchen is integrated as an ordinary room and features such as built-in cupboards and wardrobes are provided for greater convenience. The move towards a simpler, healthier, coherently arranged, easy to maintain interior is evident in the choice of finishes such as timber wall panelling and parquetry floors. Kurrowah's architect, Lange Leopold Powell, was born on 2 July 1886 in Rockhampton. Educated in Brisbane, he was articled to Brisbane architectural firm Addison and Corrie. After he completed his training and gained some experience he travelled to England in 1908, where he joined the London architectural firm of Belcher & Co. Returning to Australia in 1910 he married in April 1911. In the following year he formed a partnership with Claude William Chambers (Chambers and Powell) based in Brisbane. During 1915 Chambers moved to Sydney to practise, leaving Powell working in Brisbane. In 1920 Powell began practising on his own. Between 1922 and 1924 he was in partnership with George Hutton (Queensland Government Architect). He practised on his own again between 1925 and 1927 before going into partnership as Atkinson, Powell and Conrad from 1927 to 1930. This was followed by a partnership with his senior draftsman, George Rae from 1931 to 1933; followed again by sole practice until his death on 29 October 1938. During this career Powell played a significant role in the development of the architecture profession. He served as honorary secretary (1910‚Äì15), councillor, vice-president (1923-7) and president (1927-31) of the Queensland Institute of Architects; became a member of Queensland's first Board of Architects and for many years was the Queensland representative on the Australian Institute of Architects' federal council and its president from 1928 to 1929. With Sir Charles Rosenthal he drafted the constitution of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (1930) and became its second president (1932-3). He also represented the Queensland Board of Architects on the R.A.I.A.'s board of architectural education. He became a fellow of the Queensland Institute of Architects (1918), the Royal Institute of British Architects (1929) and the R.A.I.A. (1930). Powell is noted for his commercial buildings and churches employing a diversity of styles. His obituary in 1938 described him as one of Brisbane's leading architects. Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, John William Charles Wand praised him saying, \\"he had done much to beautify St John's Cathedral\\", and that Powell \\"was a genuine artist whose love of beauty was his master passion.... He delighted to use his gift for religious purposes. The great Masonic Temple in Brisbane will long remain to keep his memory green in the minds of those who admired his art\\". A number of Powell-designed buildings are entered in the Queensland Heritage Register namely: * Austral Motors Building, Fortitude Valley * BAFS Building, Brisbane CBD * Ballow Chambers, Spring Hill * Holy Trinity Church, Mackay * Masonic Temple, Brisbane CBD * National Bank of Australasia, Mossman * St Andrews Uniting Church, Bundaberg * St Martin's House, Brisbane CBD * St Mark's Anglican Church, Warwick His design contributions to other churches illustrate his interest in interior decoration; such as the carved-stone reredos in Holy Trinity Church, Fortitude Valley) and the altar and triptych (painted by William Bustard) for the Lady Chapel of St John's Cathedral, Brisbane CBD). Powell also designed about 30 houses and remodelled or made additions to another five. Of the other 29 Powell-designed houses only five are known to survive. These are: * his own residence at 50 Eldernell Terrace, Hamilton, dating from 1923 * 26 Thornbury Street, Spring Hill (1912) * 3 Moreton Street, New Farm, built for Mr A S Huybers in 1918 * Mrs O Sandel's Residence in Windemere Road, Hamilton dating from 1920 * a house for builder, George Stronach in Eldernell Terrace, Hamilton, built in 1931. Powell's houses, mostly for wealthy clients, were of generous proportions and located in the select suburbs of Brisbane like Hamilton and Clayfield. Kurrowah's features are characteristic of his residential work and adhered to the stylistic preference of his clients and the period. In her undergraduate thesis on Powell, Margaret Kerr noted the characteristics of his residential work: solid brickwork with a stucco finish; steeply pitched tiled roofs; gable ends; tall chimneys; roof overhangs with exposed rafters; double-hung or casement windows; a broad flight of concrete entrance stairs with a solid balustrade of sweeping curves; a timber entrance porch and often an adjoining piazza; brick porch piers with stucco finish and red brick capping detail. Features specific to his brick houses included: arches in the base wall to assist with subfloor ventilation; gable ends finished with shingles or flat sheet with wide battens for a half-timbered effect; fireplaces finished with face brickwork. His interiors included dark oak panelling in the entrance hall and living room to door head height, with papered friezes; and fibrous plaster ceilings with elaborate decoration in the more expensive homes. Built-in cupboards were common. All of these features constituted the home of a well-off Brisbane family. The lifestyle of the Brodribb family, which included regular entertaining, holidays and travel, was that of members of Queensland's upper social stratum. Substantial funds generated by a trust established at Francis Claudius Brodribb's death were successfully managed by his son-in-law, Canon Thomas Pughe. In 1924 part of that estate, \\"Kurrowah\\", a pastoral property comprising, plains, river flats and open forest country with about of Condamine River frontage, which had produced good quality wool, was sold; realising a significant sum of money for the beneficiaries. All of Kurrowah's extensions were built during the Brodribb's ownership. By 1923 a suspended timber verandah, accessed through the panelled drawing room had been added to the front elevation. In 1923 a timber extension was added to the master bedroom at the rear. At this time a garage with attached accommodation was located where the current cottage stands. Floor plans dating from after 1930, show plans for the conversion of this garage with accommodation into a cottage and use of one of the public rooms as a bedroom. By 1946, but probably prior to 1938, a further extension at the rear, creating a fifth bedroom, was added. In 1938 Mrs Brodribb attempted to sell Kurrowah but was not successful. The house at the time was described by Isles, Loves & Co Pty Ltd, auctioneers, as follows: \\"Kurrowah\\" occupies one of the finest sites with beautiful views of river, city and mountains, and is situated on the corner of Gladstone and Deighton Roads, containing an area of . \\"Kurrowah\\" was designed by one of Brisbane's leading architects and is built of brick, concrete and stucco, with tiled roof in the Jacobean period of architecture and the interior is finished in a manner befitting such a fine home. The foundations were designed to carry another stor(e)y if so desired. There are 5 bedrooms, dressing room, den, music room and balcony, beautiful piazza with tiled floor to (the) Eastern side, 2 bathrooms, well-appointed laundry and all modern conveniences throughout, kitchen, pantry and maid's room, 3 separate garages, man's room, tennis court, lawns etc. In December 1940 Frank Kenric Brodribb died at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital at South Brisbane, aged 71. The following June, Kurrowah was subdivided into five lots with the house occupying the large central lot while four small lots of between about were excised from the garden. These were auctioned on 28 June 1941. Described as: > 4 Magnificent Blocks being part of Mrs F K Brodribb's beautiful property, > situated on the corner of Gladstone and Deighton Roads, occupying one of the > finest positions. High with excellent views and on the tramline. Every > convenience - gas, water, electric light and sewerage available, bitumen > roads. Three lots were sold immediately and the fourth in 1944. By 1946, two of these sites had been built upon. This subdivision conforms to the trend, which The Courier-Mail reported in 1938, of renewed interest in subdivision of land in Brisbane after a long-term lull during and after the Depression. Mrs Brodribb died in May 1951 and the property passed to her son, Kenric Colin Campbell Brodribb and Queensland Trustees Ltd. Kurrowah was sold in February 1953 to Francis Arthur Rushbrook, who in turn sold it to Robert and Mary Murray in 1955. No additions were made to the house during the Murray's ownership and its interior remains highly intact. This level of intactness is uncommon in houses that are almost a century old, and although there have been minor alterations, the quality of its interior design and decorative character is apparent. Extension to the cottage and the addition of a small structure beside the double garage, used as accommodation by the Murray's gardener, date from after 1946. Although nearby houses including the former \\"Linden\\" (later called \\"Mangerton\\" by its owner, Dr Morgan Lane) were demolished for higher density housing, Kurrowah remained a family home set in a large garden, although surrounded by suburban development. The Murray family retained the property until its sale in 2013.  Description  Kurrowah is a substantial, rendered brick residence standing on a high ridge in Dutton Park. The allotment is over and a \\"battle axe block\\", with the house accessed via a long driveway from Gladstone Road. Behind the house (to the north) are ancillary buildings along the rear boundary. The one-storey house faces south- west, down the sloping yard to Gladstone Road, and has striking vistas to the southern mountain ranges. The house is designed in an eclectic, revival style with a solid character relieved by decorative patterns with Scottish references in architectural and decorative details. The building form is dynamic with multiple projecting rooms sheltered by steep, intersecting gables. The gable ends are decorated with timber panelling or terracotta shingles and the barge boards are moulded terracotta tiles. The exterior walls are roughcast stucco painted white with bands of red facebrick outlining features of the building. The same brick is used for three carefully modelled chimneys, which rise from sturdy bases to tall, slender stacks. It is high-set on brick piers at the front and low-set at the rear, and the understorey is accessible through arched openings in the perimeter wall. The windows are primarily two banks of small, timber-framed casements with multiple panes. A wide verandah \\"piazza\\" runs along the south-eastern side. The north-eastern side is the rear of the house and the gable ends here are clad with weatherboards and are vented with timber louvres. Projecting from the southern end of this side is a timber-framed, weatherboard-clad room with a hipped roof clad with terracotta tiles. It has a hexagonal end wall and windows that include later, timber-framed casements with green lights. At the northern end of the north-eastern side is a piazza, enclosed with more recent timber-framed awning windows. The north-western side is less articulated and shelters a small back-of-house court, reflecting its service rooms inside. A timber- framed room projects from the northern end. It has walls clad with weatherboards and a pyramidal roof clad with terracotta tiles with a terracotta finial. The windows in this room are also later, timber-framed casements with green lights. This room is set on masonry piers with roughcast stucco. In the understorey under the kitchen at the southern end of this side is a laundry. From the front, the house looms over the drive, which passes the house on the western side to reach the garages behind. A concrete path, with impressed and coloured diamond shapes, winds up from near the road to the front concrete stair with heavy, sweeping rendered masonry balustrades. The chimney breast is conspicuous with a central, decorative diamond pattern of polychromatic bricks. A small, gabled porch with a colourful, tessellated tile floor shelters the front entrance. At the western end of the front elevation is a later timber-framed porch, clad with sheets and battens and enclosed with more recent timber-framed awning windows. The front door is timber with a high waist and a large glazed top panel. A small brass knocker has a portrait of William Wallace with sword and features \\"SCOTLAND\\", \\"WALLACE\\" and \\"ANNO DOM MCCCVI\\" (1305, the year of Wallace's death), above which are two kangaroos holding a thistle. The fanlight of the front door and the adjacent hall window are divided into small panes by lead cames. The layout of the house comprises principal reception rooms at the front (south-west) with discreet service rooms on the western side and a separate bedroom wing at the rear (north- east). Circulation is via a central hall divided into distinct sections, reflecting hierarchy of use: wide and decorative in the front hall; narrower and less-decorative in the bedroom wing; and less-decorative still in the service rooms. The reception rooms include a drawing, dining, and morning rooms; den; and another room, designated as a bedroom by the 1930s. The adjacent service area includes a scullery, kitchen, and maid's room. The bedroom wing includes a master bedroom with adjoining dressing room, three other bedrooms, bathroom, and toilet. The house interior has a distinctly heavy character brought about through an extensive use of dark-stained timber wall panelling, small windows, deep-relief plasterwork on principal ceilings, and other weighty decorative treatments. A distinctive feature of the house is the use of splayed window and door reveals in the front hall and the drawing room, which serve to reduce glare and also to suggest a thicker wall, inferring a weightier construction. The internal partitions are rendered masonry with high-quality, moulded timber joinery throughout and the house retains original timber built-in wardrobes. The house retains early electrical lighting including early fittings and shades, an electrical servant bell system, and original door and window hardware. The dressing room retains an early pedestal basin. The bathroom and kitchen fit-outs are not original. The timber-framed extensions have walls and ceilings lined with sheet material with timber batten cover strips. The south-eastern piazza is reached through timber-framed, glazed French doors from the south-eastern rooms. The piazza floor is colourful, tessellated tiles on a suspended concrete slab. Two murals depicting bucolic scenes are painted on the piazza walls. At the northern end of the bedroom wing is the enclosed piazza. Its floor is recent ceramic tiles that are not of cultural heritage significance. Doors into this room are original French doors, re-fashioned to be bi-folding. Three ancillary buildings stand against the rear (northern) boundary. From east to west these are; the cottage, the garages, and a small timber structure of one room. The cottage is a low-set, one-storey building with a roughcast rendered masonry core, a steep, timber-framed hipped roof clad with terracotta tiles, and two banks of small, casement windows that match those of the main house, including hardware. (Later, lightweight extensions to the core are not of cultural heritage significance.) The garages comprise two attached, timber-framed structures and the construction shows the western garage was built first. The earlier garage has a timber board floor while the later garage has a concrete floor. Both are rectangular, timber-framed structures clad externally with cement sheets. Both have a gable roof with timber battened gable ends; the earlier roof is clad with terracotta tiles and the later roof with corrugated metal sheets. The small timber structure of one room is an early timber building, set on low concrete block stumps with metal ant caps. It is a one- storey, timber-framed building with a hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. The sides and rear are clad with v-jointed timber boards the front is clad with later timber chamferboards. The side and rear walls have a timber, lattice ventilation panel with a coarse metal insect screen and it retains an early timber-framed, sliding sash of fixed timber louvres. The garden consists of exotic specimen trees and lawn with early concrete garden beds. The front fence includes early low, masonry walls of Brisbane tuff with prominent mortar.  Heritage listing  Kurrowah was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 June 2014 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Kurrowah (1915-1916) is important in illustrating the contribution of notable architect, Lange Leopold Powell, to the evolution of Queensland's domestic architecture. It is important evidence of the lifestyle of Queensland's prosperous elite in Brisbane's suburbs in the early twentieth century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Kurrowah is a rare and intact example of an architect- designed domestic interior from the early twentieth century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Kurrowah is a fine, intact representative example of the early twentieth century housing type preferred by prosperous residents. Romantic in its architectural expression and generous in its proportions, it is sited on a spacious allotment on a hill top near the river, advantageously orientated to capture views and breezes. Characteristically, these houses: were architect-designed; used quality materials; had a generous, slightly modified traditional floor plan with a distinct hierarchy of rooms; and included facilities for servants and accommodation for a motor vehicle. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Located within a garden setting in an elevated position removed from the road with views to the west and south, Kurrowah is of aesthetic significance for its attractive Romantic form and composition. Designed by notable Queensland interwar architect Lange L Powell, it features a skilful use of stylistic treatments, a striking use of decoration and generously proportioned planning. Its fine interior craftsmanship is significant for its high degree of creative achievement. The highly intact interior displays considerable artistic value.

History The United Kingdom Census 1851 shows that the village consisted of 16 dwellings and supported a population of 81. By 1858 there were none. Clearances had been well underway in the area during the first half of the 19th century; many of them brutal and uncaring. The residents of Stiomrabhaigh were better placed than most having leases directly with the land owner but when these expired they accepted an offer of crofts in Leumrabhagh. Lewis was relatively prosperous right up until World War I, which put an end to the herring trade with Russia and Eastern Europe, and in spite of the clearances the increasing population put pressure on land. There were numerous requests to resettle Stiomrabhaigh all of which were resisted by the landowners and it was not until 1921 when Lord Leverhulme abandoned his ambitious plan for Lewis that crofters returned to the township. Even the resettlement was marked with tragedy as two young men were drowned while transporting household goods from Calbost. These settlers were never officially recognized as crofters by the government; they received no help and no road was built to the township. Given the difficulties of living without facilities over the next twenty years a number of the families drifted back to Leumrabhagh. At the start of World War II only two families remained and by the end of the 1940s Stiomrabhaigh was once again deserted. Today Ruined blackhouse at Stiomrabhaig Today there is much of the township to be seen; its ruined buildings, lazy beds and field walls standing in splendid isolation between the moor and the sea.

When Falstaff and the others agree, Poins says to Hal that the pair of them should play trick on Falstaff by letting them rob the travellers, but then in disguise robbing the robbers of their haul. The point of the jest will be to hear the \\"incomprensible [i.e. enormous] lies\\" Falstaff will later tell to excuse himself. When Poins and Hal attack Falstaff after the robbing the travellers, he and his followers instantly run away. Poins is with Hal when Hal plays a joke on Francis, a drawer (waiter) at the Boar's Head. He also listens to Falstaff's increasingly ridiculous lies. In Part 2 Poins discusses the illness of Hal's father the king, expecting Hal to be pleased at the prospect of his father's death. Hal gets a letter from Falstaff, in which Falstaff tells him not to trust Poins because he has been telling people that Hal will be marrying Poins' sister Nell. Poins denies it. Bardolph and a boy arrive with news that Falstaff is meeting Doll Tearsheet at the tavern. Poins suggests that they disguise themselves again, this time as waiters, to overhear the conversation. At the tavern, Doll asks why Hal likes Poins, Falstaff says that they are both similar in size and shape, and equally empty headed: \\"His wit‚Äôs as thick as Tewkesbury mustard. There's no more conceit in him than is in a mallet [i.e. he's got no more brains than a hammer].\\"Henry IV Part 2, Act 2, Scene 4, l.201. Character role Hal and Poins listen to Falstaff's story of the robbery. Poins' principal role is to act as Hal's confidant. In Part 2 especially he is little more than a sounding board for Hal's views.Cahn, Victor, Shakespeare the Playwright, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, p.476. In Part 1 he is presented as the more assertive of the two, being the \\"mastermind\\" of both the Gads Hill robbery and its comeuppance. In this respect Poins is an ambiguous figure, who is both part of the criminal underworld and also of the superior social world that looks down on it and undermines it. He is \\"of uncertain social standing\\", but his comment that his only problem is that he is a \\"second brother\\" implies that he is \\"a gentleman with no inheritance, his gentility making him an appropriate companion for Hal\\".Bulman, James, \\"Bawdy in Henry IV Part 2\\", Martin, Scheil, Shakespeare/adaptation/modern Drama: Essays in Honour of Jill L. Levenson, p.158-9. He represents wayward tendencies within the upper class, closely linked to Hal's own behaviour. The fact that Poins disappears from the narrative after the end of Henry IV, Part 2 suggests that his identity cannot be incorporated into the continuing story; he is neither a \\"low life\\" character, nor a participant in the high politics of the new regime. He is effectively a \\"shadow\\" side of Hal himself.Mason, Pamela, \\"Orson Welles and Filmed Shakespeare\\", The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Film, pp,183‚Äì99. In Part 2 in particular, Hal appears to become visibly embittered by his association with the world of Falstaff and Poins, using increasingly open derogatory language about both of them, but Poins is never explicitly rejected, unlike Falstaff. Throughout both plays the tension between Poins and Falstaff beneath the apparent bonhomie represents their competition for Hal's favour and each one's willingness to undermine the other.Wills, Garry, Making Make-Believe Real: Politics as Theater in Shakespeare's Time, Yale University Press, 2014, p.93. However, while Poins' accusations against Falstaff are proven correct, it is never clear whether Falstaff's accusation about Poins' sister is true or a lie.Tricomi, Albert H. (ed), Contextualizing the Renaissance, Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance Studies, 1998, p.27. Poins' ambiguous role is further implied by the reference to him in The Merry Wives of Windsor, in which Anne Page's suitor Fenton is said to have been a companion of \\"the wild Prince and Poins\\". According to Giorgio Melchiori, \\"the mention of Poins is meant to place Fenton in a separate category from Falstaff and the other companions of the Prince\\", since Poins is the Prince's confidant, and implicitly a member of the gentility, albeit a wayward one. This implies that Fenton has had a bit of a wild youth, but is not directly tainted with criminality. Sources Sir Nicholas Poins, depicted by Hans Holbein the Younger Poins is a development of the character \\"Ned\\" in Shakespeare's principal source, The Famous Victories of Henry V. Some passages appear to be derived directly from the earlier play, such as the conversation in which Poins says Hal would be thought a hypocrite if he mourned for his estranged father, which derives from a scene in Famous Victories in which Ned says that mourning would \\"make folks believe the death of your father grieves you, and tis nothing so\\".Hutson, Lorna, The Invention of Suspicion: Law and Mimesis in Shakespeare and Renaissance Drama, Oxford University Press, 2007. The name Poins may come from the Poins family, based in Gloucestershire, descended from the Baron Poyntz, who was active in the reign of Edward I. In 1869 G.R. French argued that \\"it is probable that Shakespeare intended him for a cadet of the family of Poyntz, one of high antiquity in Gloucestershire\\".Francis Griffin Stokes, Who's Who in Shakespeare: A Dictionary of Characters and Proper Names, Courier Corporation, 2011 reprint, p.261. Members of the Poins family had been courtiers in the reign of Henry VIII. Sir Nicholas Poins was depicted by Holbein. Thomas Wyatt dedicated his poem \\"Of the Courtier's Life\\", which satirises court cronyism, to John Poins.David Scott Kastan (ed), Shakespeare, William, King Henry IV Part 1: Third Series, Cengage, 2002, p.138. Poins' reference to being a younger brother (and therefore not the inheritor of the family estate) implies that he comes from an established family. In the earliest version of Henry IV, Part 1 all of Falstaff's cronies had names derived from established families of the era, but most were later changed. Melchiori considers it significant that Poins was the only one whose name was not changed.Melchiori, Giorgio (ed), Shakespeare, William, The Merry Wives of Windsor: 3rd Series, A&C; Black, 2000, p.122. The character appears to have been popular with audiences at the time. According to Leonard Digges, writing shortly after Shakespeare's death, many plays could not get good audiences, \\"but let Falstaff come, Hal, Poins and the rest, you scarce shall have a room\\".Birch, Dinah (ed), The Oxford Companion to English Literature, Oxford University Press, 2009, p.473. In other literature The mystery of Poins' fate is explained in William Kenrick's play Falstaff's Wedding (1760) in which it is revealed that Hal really did have a relationship with Poins' beautiful sister Eleanor. His love for Nell Poins led him to spare Poins the fate of the other former companions, but he was removed from the king's company by being given an administrative position in the north of England.Kenrick, W., Fastaff's Wedding: A Comedy, London, 1760. Robert Brough's 1858 novel The Life of Sir John Falstaff also says that Poins escaped the fate of the other companions. Poins is depicted as a slavish follower of Hal: When Hal becomes king, Poins is rewarded for his loyalty with a knighthood. The now \\"Sir Edward Poins\\" writes a dismissive letter to Falstaff informing him that he will only be allowed in the royal palace when it is open to the public for viewing tapestries.Brough, Robert, The Life of Sir John Falstaff, London: Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans, and Roberts, 1858, p.192 In Robert Nye's 1976 novel Falstaff, written as the autobiography of the knight, Falstaff refers to Poins as Hal's squire. He says \\"I never liked Ned Poins. He didn't like me either\\", calling him \\"a greasy little prick\\". After saying that Poins was homosexual, he adds that he once spent the night with Mistress Quickly to win a bet, but was terrified by her body. He was first disturbed by the sight of her pubic hair, but ended up \\"shitting in the bed\\" when she tried to arouse him sexually. Mirroring Shakespeare's unexplained dropping of Poins, Falstaff says he will show his contempt for him by simply omitting him from the rest of the narrative: \\"it will give me great pleasure to write him right out of my book\\", as \\"one of the pleasures of authorship\\" is simply \\"forgetting a character\\".Nye, Robert, Falstaff, Arcade, 2001, p,254-5.

He won the 1946 Lasker Award. Early life and education The son of David and Mary Ann Mahoney, John Friend Mahoney was born on August 1, 1889 in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. In 1914 Mahoney graduated from Marquette University with attached clinical training at the Milwaukee County Hospital and at the Chicago Lying-in Hospital. Career From 1917 he worked as an assistant surgeon in the US forces in Europe during World War I. After returning in 1919, he served in the United States Public Health Service on various quarantine stations and marine hospitals, including Ellis Island. In this context, it was from 1925 to 1929 that he was sent to Europe. While in England, Ireland, and Germany, Mahoney studied syphilis treatment. Since 1929 Mahoney was Director of the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory of the Food and Drug Administration. The laboratory improved serological tests for syphilis and demonstrated, with the advent of sulfonamide treatment in the United States in the 1930s, its efficacy in gonorrhea. He was also Medical Director of the Marine Hospital in Staten Island. Mahoney was made aware of the possibilities of penicillin treatment by a paper of Wallace Herrell and colleagues from the Mayo Clinic. Particular attention was on the treatment of gonorrhea patients where the pathogen was resistant to sulfonamides. Mahoney could confirm this and also began to test penicillin for syphilis, first in vitro without success, then in rabbits. Dr. John F Mahoney lead the Terre Haute Prison experiments and supervised Dr. Cutler in the Guatemala Syphilis Experiment. By 1929, Dr. Mahoney worked as the director of the Venereal Disease Research Lab in Staten island, where the Terre Haute experiments began in 1943, this is also where Cutler first assisted him. After stopping the Terre Haute experiments for lack of accurate infection of subjects with gonorrhea, Dr. Mahoney moved on to study the effects of penicillin on syphilis. His research found huge success for penicillin treatments and the US army embraced it in STD prescription. Although this seemed prosperous, Mahoney and his collaborators questioned the long term effectiveness of eliminating the disease all together in individuals. Mahoney, Cutler, and other researchers, felt that a smaller, more controlled group of individuals to study would be more helpful in finding this cure. This led to the use of citizens in Guatemala as subjects. Once this had been successful he began clinical trials. He presented at a meeting of the American Public Health Association in New York in October 1943 the first results in four patients in the early stages of the disease. Time reported the findings. With Mahoney's involvement, the Committee on Medical Research began an extensive clinical trial with over 1400 patients in different hospitals. Mahoney led the study at the Staten Island Marine Hospital. In June 1944 penicillin was introduced as a standard treatment for syphilis in the United States Army. In 1946 Mahoney was one of the first winners of the Lasker Award. In 1948 he was Chairman of the World Health Organization Expert Committee on Venereal Diseases at its first meeting in Geneva. In December 1949 he retired from the Public Health Service. In 1950 he was appointed Commissioner of the New York City Department of Health, serving until 1953. Dr. John F Mahoney lead the Terre Haute Prison experiments and supervised Dr. Cutler in the Guatemala Syphilis Experiment. Mahoney graduated from medical school in 1914 and by 1918 was titled Assistant Surgeon at the United States Public Health Service. By 1929, Dr. Mahoney worked as the director of the Venereal Disease Research Lab is Staten island, where the Terre Haute experiments began in 1943, this is also where Cutler first assisted him.

Development and syndication Development of The MGM Theater of the Air was a departure from the parent company's previous practices. An article in a 1949 issue of Billboard noted that MGM \\"thruout [sic] the years has extended scant co-operation on the program level\\" to WMGM (which had been WHN). \\"Theater of the Air\\" and five other programs were set to be produced by MGM for broadcast on WMGM and KMGM (an FM station in Hollywood) and syndicated to other stations. The programs totaled about six hours of air time per week. Beginning September 1, 1949, eight programs (including The Story of Dr. Kildare, The Adventures of Maisie, Crime Does Not Pay and The Hardy Family) were available to \\"big stations and little stations,\\" as promoted in an ad for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Radio Attractions. The programs attracted interest from stations even before the official date when they would be available. Between 150 and 200 stations sought information about the shows \\"within a few days of the initial public announcement.\\" An initial estimate was \\"The eight programs will cost MGM close to $1,500,000 per year for production and talent charges.\\" A reviewer of an early episode of The MGM Theater of the Air commented, \\"In slickness of production this hour-long program compares very favorably with many of its network brothers.\\" Move to Mutual Broadcasting System The MGM Theater of the Air and other MGM-produced programs moved from syndication to network distribution the week of December 31, 1951. Mutual began carrying the MGM productions Woman of the Year (based on the movie of the same name, Crime Does Not Pay, The Black Museum, The Story of Dr. Kildare, MGM Musical Comedy Theater of the Air, The Modern Adventures of Casanova, The Gracie Fields Show, The Adventures of Maisie, The Hardy Family and The MGM Theater of the Air. Broadcasting magazine reported on Mutual's \\"extensive promotion campaign\\" for the MGM package: \\"The campaign was launched via distribution -- to advertisers, agencies and radio editors -- of boxes of gingerbread men in the shape of Mutual's 'Mr. Plus' trademarks and MGM's 'Leo the Lion,' along with details of the Mutual-MGM program tie-up.\\" Despite the network's promotional efforts, however, the program lasted only one year on Mutual. Personnel By its nature, The MGM Theater of the Air had no regular cast. Different MGM movie stars of the era were featured each week. They included Marlene Dietrich, Ronald Reagan, Joan Bennett, George Murphy and Nina Foch. Howard Dietz, vice-president of MGM, was the program's host, with Carey Wilson as substitute host. Ed Stokes was the announcer, with Bob Williams as his substitute. Marx Loeb was the director. Raymond Katz was the producer. Joel Herron was the music conductor.

In Scottish Gaelic they are known as the Sliochd E√≤ghain mhic E√≤ghain (the children of Ewen, son of Ewen). History Origins The first representative of the Cameron of Erracht family was Ewen Cameron who was born in the late 15th century, son of Ewen Cameron, XIII of Lochiel, chief of Clan Cameron by his second wife Marjory Mackintosh, grand-daughter of Malcolm Beg Mackintosh, 10 chief of Clan Mackintosh. Ewen's son was John Dow M'Ewen V'Ewen Cameron, 2nd of Erracht who was executed in around 1585 for the murder of Donald Dubh Cameron, XV Chief of Clan Cameron, in 1569. John Bodach M'Iain V'Ewen Cameron, 3rd of Erracht was executed on the orders of Cameron of Lochiel in 1613. Jacobite risings Donald Cameron, 7th of Erracht was born shortly before the Jacobite rising of 1715. Thirty years later during the Jacobite rising of 1745 he joined Cameron of Lochiel and was second in command at the historic Glenfinnan gathering. After the Jacobite defeat at the Battle of Culloden, Cameron of Erracht was a homeless warrior in the mountains for three years. He had three children, the eldest of whom was Sir Alan Cameron of Erracht K.C.B. Sir Alan Cameron of Erracht Alan Cameron of Erracht, founder of the regiment Sir Alan Cameron of Erracht raised the 79th or Cameron Highlanders in 1793. He was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant and led the regiment through the severe campaigns in Flanders from 1794 to 1795. In 1797 the regiment was broken up and two hundred and ten men joined the Black Watch regiment. In 1798 Cameron of Erracht raised a second 79th regiment that was seven hundred and eighty strong and after taking part in many engagements he died in 1828 in Fulham.

Frodesen was an avid critic of the Modern Breakthrough, many of his works represent conservative stances, although he considered himself an \\"apolitical defeatist\\".Lars Frodesen (1922), Forel√¶sninger og breve, Kobnhavn, Royal Forlag, p.54 Frodesen gained minuscule attention for his writings in the late 1910s, though after his death of pneumonia in 1921, much of his work was forgotten. During the nazi occupation of Denmark his books and papers were considered \\"Entartete\\" and subsequently much of his literary legacy was destroyed.

It was designed by George Thornhill Campbell-Wilson and built from 1892 to 1893. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Hughesville, a substantial, single-storeyed timber residence, was erected in 1892-93 for Richard Alfred Hughes, a local horse-dealer, to a design by architect George Thornhill Campbell-Wilson. Reputedly, the house was a wedding gift from Alfred (Fred) Hughes to his son Richard, who married Elizabeth Magee in 1891. Fred Hughes was a horse-dealer and livery stables keeper, resident in Brisbane from at least 1871, when he purchased land in Charlotte Street. He had established a livery stables on this site by 1874. In the mid-1880s, Hughes and his family moved to Upper Mt Gravatt, where they owned a property at the corner of Kessels and Logan Roads. He sold the Charlotte Street property in 1889, but maintained a livery stables in Adelaide Street during the first half of the 1890s. At his Upper Mount Gravatt stables, Fred Hughes bred blood stock, including Arabs. In January 1892, his son Richard, aged 19 years, acquired title to over of land at Eight Mile Plains, just south of Upper Mt Gravatt along Logan Road. On this property Hughesville was erected, at the junction of Logan and Padstow Roads. The architect was George Thornhill Campbell-Wilson, who practised in Brisbane from 1889 to . George Campbell-Wilson was born in Brisbane, the eldest son of architect George William Campbell Wilson and Ada Weedon. He trained under his father and practised as an architect in Queen Street, Brisbane, from 1889 until his retirement in . Hughesville was arguably the finest house in the district, a farming community approximately eight miles south of the One-mile Swamp (Woolloongabba). The Eight Mile Plains had been combed by timbergetters prior to its opening as an agricultural reserve in the early 1860s. Over in the nearby Coopers Plains area had been proclaimed the Brisbane Agricultural Reserve in June 1861. In October 1864, this was extended by a further , and the whole - encompassing what are now the suburbs of Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hills, Runcorn, Kuraby, Eight Mile Plains, and parts of Coopers Plains, Algester and Stretton - were proclaimed the Eight Mile Plains Agricultural Reserve. Fruit and some vegetable growing were the principal activities. By 1869, the area was sufficiently populated to necessitate the opening of a school at Eight Mile Plains, but the real impetus for the expansion of small farming in the district came with the opening of the extension railway from Yeerongpilly to Loganlea, in April 1885. By the time Hughesville was erected in the 1890s, Eight Mile Plains had emerged as a solid farming community. Richard Hughes followed his father's occupation, and ran horses on the Logan Road property until 1912-13. The house remained in the Hughes family until 1994. The house was unoccupied for some years and became increasingly derelict. Subsequently it was restored and is now used as offices. It featured in a XXXX beer television commercial.  Description  Hughesville, 1908 Hughesville stands on a grassy slope at the intersection of Logan and Padstow Roads, both of which are major arterial roads. It is a substantial timber-framed house, clad with broad chamferboards and lined with double beaded tongue and groove boards. It sits on short wooden stumps. The core is encircled by wide beech verandahs, with step-out sash windows opening from every room, and roofs of corrugated iron. The front and side verandahs have slender cast-iron corinthian columns, tripled at the corners, and delicate cast iron balustrading. This decoration contrasts with the square timber posts and timber balustrading (now removed) of the rear verandah. The pyramid-shaped corrugated iron roof of the core is separated from the verandah roofs by a small cornice with paired console brackets. At the apex is a widow's walk, with cast iron cresting and corner finials. In comparison with the exterior, the interior is functionally austere. The core comprises a wide central hallway, with front parlour and dining room to the right and three bedrooms to the left. From the parlour a faceted bay window projects onto the front verandah. At either end of the hallway are mirror-imaged front and back doorways, each with a cedar fanlight and sidelights. Joinery throughout is of red cedar, as are the interior floorboards, with japanned edges in the main rooms. There is a cedar mantelpiece in the dining room and a grey marble mantelpiece with gilt mirror in the parlour, surrounding back-to-back fireplaces. The internal walls bear early paintwork, including a plain dado strip along the hallway. A servant's entrance leads from the dining room to a gable-roofed timber kitchen house, with servant's room, attached to the rear verandah. It is unlined, and retains the original brick fireplace. All that remains visible of an early garden layout are two camphor laurel trees, one on either side of the front path, and a large mango tree. Several outbuildings, including two stables, a buggy shed and harness room, are no longer extant, and less than one hectare of the original property remains.

The apple doesn't ripen on the tree, but is carefully placed in the sun after it is picked until it turns red.

The 37th edition of the Liberty Bowl, it featured the Stanford Cardinal and the East Carolina Pirates. Although East Carolina did not reach the end zone on offense‚Äîthey scored on four field goals and an interception return for a touchdown‚Äîthat effort, combined with strong defense, was enough to defeat Stanford, 19‚Äì13. The Cardinal scored the game's only offensive touchdown, while cornerback Kwame Ellis returned a blocked punt for touchdown and was named the game's MVP in a losing effort. Teams Stanford Led by first-year coach Tyrone Willingham who replaced Bill Walsh, the Cardinal had been expected to finish last in the Pac-10; instead, the team finished with a 7‚Äì3‚Äì1 record, good enough for fourth in the conference. Stanford was led offensively by quarterback Mark Butterfield, who had thrown for over 2,500 yards and 19 touchdowns during the season and running back Anthony Bookman, who had run for 900 yards. East Carolina East Carolina was led by fourth-year head coach Steve Logan. The Pirates were returning to the Liberty Bowl for the second-straight year after having been blown out 30‚Äì0 in the 1994 Liberty Bowl. East Carolina was led by quarterback Marcus Crandell, who had thrown for over 2,700 yards and 18 touchdowns and as a junior, was already East Carolina's all-time passing and offensive yardage leader. Game summary Despite the offensive credentials of both teams, the game turned out to showcase the defenses of both teams. Stanford took the opening kickoff into East Carolina territory before the drive failed. On its next possession, Stanford appeared to be driving again, but Butterfield's pass was intercepted by Daren Hart, who raced 39 yards for a touchdown. Early in the second quarter, Pirate kicker Chad Holcomb kicked a 46-yard field goal. Stanford finally scored on an Adam Salina one-yard plunge to cut the lead to 10‚Äì7, but two Holcomb field goals in the last 2:01 of the half made the halftime score 16‚Äì7. Early in the second half, Stanford cornerback Kwame Ellis blocked a punt and returned it for a touchdown to make the score 16‚Äì13 after the missed PAT, but could get no closer as the Pirate defense kept Stanford off-balance all day, holding Butterfield to just 139 passing yards and Bookman to only 46 rushing yards. A fourth Holcomb field goal sealed the victory for East Carolina. Ellis, who had blocked the punt and contributed to a defensive effort that did not allow any East Carolina offensive touchdowns, was named the game's MVP in a losing effort.

Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin Portrait of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini is a small portrait by Jan van Eyck believed to be the same person as in the famous 1434 Arnolfini Portrait due to the similarities of facial features. Thus, the work is van Eyck's second portrait of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini, a wealthy merchant from Lucca, a city in Tuscany in central Italy, who spent most of his life in Flanders. The painting was long thought a self-portrait; in colourisation, costume and tone, it is very similar to the signed and dated Portrait of a Man in a Red Chaperon in London, which is generally accepted as a self-portrait. It was only later that the current work was associated with Arnolfini and the double marriage painting. It is today in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin. Arnolfini wears a dark green gown, with dark brown fur lining. He wears a red chaperon with cornette tied on top of the head, with the patte hanging behind. The bourrelet is twisted. He is depicted with exacting realism; no attempt is made to gloss over his facial imperfections. He has small, slightly oriental eyes, a large nose and an inscrutable stare.Ferrari, 120 Jan van Eyck, Arnolfini Portrait, 1432. National Gallery, London The meaning and significance of the scroll held in his left hand is unknown. It may relate to finance and trade, it might be a type of international credit note that was then just being introduced to European banking. Arnolfini's folded arms would have rested on the original, but now lost, frame. As with van Eyck's other single head portraits, the frame would have contained inscriptions giving the date of completion. Opinion as to the date of the painting has varied, with the likely dates ranging from 1434 to 1438. Today the later date is generally accepted. That van Eyck painted two portraits of Arnolfini has led to speculation he was a friend of the artist. For many years the two works were not associated, and the identity of the sitters was unknown. Often the London double portrait was taken as a portrait of the artist and his wife, Margaret.Ridderbos et al, 63 In 1857, Crowe and Cavalcaselle linked the London double portrait with the early 16th century inventories of Margaret of Austria, and established the sitters as Giovanni [di Arrigo] Arnolfini and his (possibly already deceased) wife, Giovanna Cenami.Hall 1994, 4; Crowe and Cavalcaselle 1857. 65‚Äì66 Notes Sources * Ferrari, Simone.

Named after the eponymous martial arts films by director Quentin Tarantino, the electro-pop song was written by the group's long time lyricist Kim Eana and Miryo, while member JeA composed and arranged the song under the moniker Candy Sound. Accompanied with a seven-minute long music video that paid homage to the plot of the inspired film, it was released as the second and final single from Black Box on July 29, 2013 by Nega Network and LOEN Entertainment, to coincide with its parental album release. Upon its release, \\"Kill Bill\\" received positive reviews from critics for its \\"easy-breezy, Western-themed\\" pop tune and the competence of all members, further praising member Miryo for her rap performance. The song also attained commercial success for the group, becoming their sixth top ten entry on the Gaon Digital Chart, while earning the group their second, and to date, highest entry on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, peaking at number twelve. To further promote the song, Brown Eyed Girls appeared on several South Korea television music programs to perform the track, along with their previous single \\"Recipe\\".  Background and release  Following the release of \\"Recipe\\" on July 9, 2013 to both critical and commercial success, the group released their first image teaser for their upcoming fifth studio album, titled Black Box, on July 23, 2013. A music video teaser was released three days later, confirming the group's next single to be \\"Kill Bill\\". Along with the digital release of its parental album, the seven- minute length music video for the single was released on July 29, 2013, while a performance video was later released on August 2, 2013.  Composition  \\"Kill Bill\\" was written by the group's long time lyricist Kim Eana and member Miryo, while production and arrangement was handled by member JeA under her moniker Candy Sound. A dominant electro-pop and dance-pop track, the song begins with an \\"addictive whistle hook\\", thus portraying the old Western movie reflection. It also draws comparisons to the work of Dr. Luke by Jeff Benjamin of Billboard, citing its \\"crunchy synths and lively guitar strumming\\" with knocking beat as the prime elements. Running a total length of three minutes and twenty-six seconds, it follows the common verse-chorus form, and is composed in the key of D‚ô≠ major with a tempo of 128 beat-per-minute. Lyrically, the song is largely themed around the titular 2003 classic film by Tarantino, telling the story of a woman \\"mocking\\" the man who did her wrong, further \\"laughing\\" at his despair that their relationship is over with the hook \\"So don't you want to kill me?\\", performed by member Miryo. Charts and performance The song was released to various digital outlets in 2013, after which it quickly topped various online charts. Kim, Jae-hwan.

This piece of armour, generally dated to the 3rd century BC, is of Italiote origin and comes from Southern Italy. Its discovery in Tunisia led researchers to link it to the expeditions of the Second Punic War led in Italy by the Carthaginian general Hannibal between 211 and 203 BC This hypothesis, although tempting, is now widely questioned following in-depth examination, at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, of the various objects found in the tomb. The cuirass is nowadays kept in the Bardo National Museum in Tunis, as is the archaeological material found in the same tomb. It is still, a century after its discovery, one of the emblematic pieces of its ancient department.  History  Old photograph of both sides of the cuirass, in the Catalogue du Mus√©e Alaoui published by Ernest Leroux  Location and dating of the cuirass  The cuirass was discovered by Tunisian workers in a Punic tomb in the south of the village of Ksour Essef, precisely in the locality of Hammada-El-Mekata, twelve kilometres south-west of Mahdia in the Tunisian Sahel. The armour was found in a niche on one side of the burial chamber. Its dating remains relatively uncertain: archaeologists date it from the end of the 2nd century BC, others from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC or around 300 BC.  History of the excavations  In the context of the French protectorate of Tunisia, particularly from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Punic necropolises were extensively excavated. At the archaeological site of Carthage, excavations were mainly carried out by White Fathers, such as Alfred Louis Delattre. The opening of the tombs was often the object of mundane ceremonies, attracting the French colonial population. The cuirass, made in Campania or Apulia, was found on 20 February 1909, during excavations of a Punic tomb with a well during earthworks. The archaeologist and director of the antiquities service in Tunisia, Alfred Merlin, who was informed at the beginning of the following month, studied the tomb in the company of Louis Poinssot, inspector of antiquities. The material in the tomb was, however, damaged during the archaeological excavations: two Amphorae were broken, before being carefully restored using the fragments collected immediately on the spot. The boards of the sarcophagus, which were damaged during the excavation due to lack of care, are also being restored in the laboratory of the Bardo Museum.  Archaeological context  Example of Punic tombs with wells in the archaeological park of the Baths of Antoninus The type of shaft tomb in which the furniture is found is widespread in the Tunisian Sahel. The tomb has an access shaft and two burial chambers; the shaft, measuring 2.30 √ó 1.30 m, is filled at the time of discovery with stones from the nearby Rejiche quarries. One of the two burial chambers, of about 4 m2, was empty during the excavations. The other, larger, measures 2 m by 2.40 m and 1.60 m high. The same tomb contains a cypress wood coffer-sarcophagus covered in red, 0.84 m high, 1.80 m long and 0.68 m wide. This sarcophagus found in the tomb belongs to a widespread model over a geographical area extending from the Byzacium to Gigthi. Excavations at the beginning of the 20th century mention only one body lying on its back, the bones having been discovered \\"rather badly preserved and reduced to crumbs for the most part\\", coated with a reddish-brown pigment, identified with cinnabar. According to Merlin, the deceased may have undergone ritual emaciation prior to burial. Two skeletons were identified in new analyses carried out in Tunisia at the end of the 20th century, one of which belonged to a male individual, 1.70 m tall and in his forties. The skull bears traces of red ochre. In addition to the sarcophagus and armour, four amphorae, a bowl, a wooden dish (still containing ochre) and a black glazed lamp were uncovered during the same excavation. Elements of a bronze belt are also found, as are copper metal plates in the sarcophagus that were not reported by Merlin. Habib Ben Youn√®s identifies these fragments as elements of a casket. The cuirass is found at the time of the discovery next to the lamp. The archaeological material was then deposited in the Bardo Museum, where the cuirass \\"is the most beautiful ornament in a room\\". Some forgotten elements were found in the museum's storerooms in the 1990s. Ben Youn√®s points out that many testimonies present in the Punic necropolises excavated at the beginning of the 20th century have disappeared, even though they could have provided much information on this civilisation.  Description  Detail of the floral motifs Detail of the divine representation The cuirass (inv. 01-02-03-01) is identified as belonging to the \\"kardiophylax\\" or heart guard type. \\"The most important piece of the find\\", it is made of gilded bronze and measures 30 centimetres in height or 28 centimetres by 30 centimetres for the pectoral. The front side measures 42.5 centimetres by 44 centimetres and the reverse side measures 42 centimetres by 66 centimetres. It has a breastplate and a backrest or bib: the faces of this part have three raised circles including a representation of Minerva helmeted. Strands of the goddess's hair are visible. Her eyes are large and her lips thick. She is wearing a necklace of acorns, which is reminiscent of the top of the breastplate, which is decorated with a similar necklace of Acorns and bucranium. Her helmet is decorated with Rinceaux and three crests. A palmette motif is also present on each side of the deity's head. A floral motif, identified as a lily, is located between the circles. The breastplate had a central motif that has now disappeared and was probably made of silver according to Merlin. The pattern on the back is an eight-pointed rosette. Bands for attaching the breastplate with rivets are decorated with globes and palmettes. The breastplate also has geometric and floral decorations that complement its ornamentation.  Interpretation   Chronology problem  There is a problem of chronological order in the tomb excavated at the beginning of the 20th century. Indeed, the archaeological material found predates the First Punic War and therefore predates the hypothesis formulated by the excavator, dating the armour to the Second Punic War. The study of the archaeological environment of the armour thus makes its chronology hypothetical according to Yann Le Bohec. According to a classification of the mid-1990s, one of the amphorae dates from the first half of the 4th century BC or even the end of the 5th century BC. A second amphora, which is a local copy of Italian pottery, can be dated to the same period. A third is of a type produced up to a period estimated to be the second half of the 4th century BC. The attic lamp can also be dated to the fourth century BC. Finally, the cup belongs to a type that was widespread until the 2nd century BC. According to Ben Youn√®s, the preferred date for the funerary deposit would probably be the 4th century BC.  Unknown owner but general context assured  The cuirass, of \\"exotic provenance\\" if we take into account the place of discovery, is not a Carthaginian work but an Italian work, from Southern Italy or Campania, dated to the 2nd century BC according to Merlin. Some of the vases from this Italian region that have survived represent figures wearing such armour: a statuette with the same piece of armour and bronze discs (elements placed on leather garments of a shape similar to that of the armour) are also known. These protective elements for soldiers were particularly expensive and rare for the time. In 1909, Merlin mentions the presence of similar armour from Apulia in the museums of Karlsruhe, the British Museum and the National Archaeological Museum in Naples. The latter, discovered at Ruvo di Puglia, is \\"almost identical\\" to that of Ksour Essef, \\"the differences [...] are insignificant\\", even if the latter is in a poorer state of conservation because it is strongly oxidised. The representation of Minerva can be compared to the representations of the same deity known for Campania between 317 and 211 according to the searcher. The belt also belongs to a type present in Southern Italy. The presence of such a breastplate in Tunisia very quickly prompted historians to link it to the Second Punic War. In this hypothesis, a warrior in Hannibal's army would have brought it back from Italy at the end of the war. Merlin remains cautious, however, and mentions an imported product \\"like so many other less valuable Campanian products\\" or ventures to identify the occupant of the tomb as a mercenary buried with products from his country. The fact that he is \\"a contemporary of the Second Punic War\\" is linked to the initial dating of the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. The caution that is called for in the various hypotheses formulated by the excavator is not always appropriate in later works. The work may have belonged to a Libyphenician of the army of Carthage according to Ben Youn√®s, or could simply be a trophy. It may also be a testimony to \\"the participation of the people, the Libyphenicians, in the war effort of the metropolis of Carthage well before the outbreak of the first Punic war\\". The armour seems to be in any case a \\"probable and indirect witness\\" of the armies or mercenaries of the Carthaginian wars, \\"probably acquired in Campania\\" during the Italian stay of the Punic army, between 211 and 203 BC, which makes it an exceptional object.

It was built from 1876 to 1930s. Its architects included Francis Drummond Greville Stanley. It is also known as Bulimba Creek School and Doughboy Creek Mixed School. On its grounds is the historic house Dumbarton, also known as Ashcroft House and Gibson House. The original Hemmant State School closed at the end of 2010, and in 2012 was replaced by the Hemmant Flexible Learning Centre, a new school targeted at students disengaged from mainstream education. The school buildings and structures were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 September 2003.  History  Hemmant State School was established in 1864 as the Bulimba Creek School (non-vested). It contains several generations of public works buildings that were built as the community at Hemmant expanded and developed. The oldest remaining building was erected in 1876, to a design by Queensland Colonial Architect, Francis Drummond Greville Stanley. The Playshed was added in 1884. The house known as Dumbarton, which was relocated from another Hemmant location to the school site in 2001, was built probably in the 1870s or early 1880s and local opinion attributes its construction and occupation to the Uhlmann and Gibson families. The Uhlman family was significant in the area as local butchers, milkmen and storekeepers, while the Gilson family were significant in the development of the sugar industry in Queensland. Hemmant was originally known as Doughboy Creek and the first land sales took place in 1858. Non-indigenous settlement in the area commenced the following year when the Franklin and Popham families migrated in the same ship and took up adjacent pieces of land at Hemmant. English, Scottish, Dutch and German migrants followed and established farms. The soil was easy to clear and fertile, and the first crops were vegetables and fruit, which were transported up the river to Brisbane until the construction of the bridge over Bulimba Creek in 1870 made road transport possible. In 1863 William Gibson and his son Angus arrived in Moreton Bay and settled at Hemmant. The remainder of the family followed in 1864. In 1866 William Gibson obtained cane cuttings from Louis Hope at Ormiston, which he planted at Hemmant, on a farm he called Clydesdale. Other farmers in the district also switched to sugar production. In 1868 William Gibson and Sons established the Clydesdale Sugar Mill, and by 1871 there were seven mills in the area. In the second half of the 1870s, however, drought and disease destroyed the crops repeatedly and sugar farming was moved further north. In 1883, the Clydesdale Mill was sold and the Gibson family began the move to Bingera at Bundaberg. The mill closed down the following year, and Hemmant returned to vegetable and dairy production. Hemmant State School was opened on 9 May 1864 as Bulimba Creek School on a two-acre site. It was a non-vested school; the Department of Public Instruction supplied the teacher, Frederick Ffoulkes Swanwick, and the parents paid for the construction of the school, a shingled, weatherboard building, . Eighteen children enrolled during the first week and 74 by the following year, although the average attendance was only 32. By 1866 three classes were required. In 1866 the name was changed to Doughboy Creek Mixed School, to avoid confusion with the newly established Bulimba State School. It then became the Doughboy Creek Primary School (1869), Doughboy Primary School (1870) and Hemmant Primary School (1876). In 1873 a new teacher's residence was built. Complaints by the teacher and parents about the condition of the school, which had been built entirely of pine and was now a dangerous, white ant-eaten shell, resulted in a detailed inspection by David Ewart in 1876. He recommended that a new school be built, with the residents again contributing to its construction. The building was a standard Public Works school design (Burmester, Pullar & Kennedy 1996 classification: B/T2), with verandahs on both front and back, designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley, the Colonial Architect. In 1884, a large open playshed was built to another standard Public Works design (Burmester, Pullar & Kennedy 1996 classification: B/T5). In 1897 the shingles on the school building were replaced with iron and in 1899 two new rooms and other improvements were made to the teacher's residence. In 1889, were transferred to the Railway Department to enable the construction of the Cleveland railway line, and in 1912 the Headteacher's residence was moved to the north of the railway line and more land was resumed to make an island platform closer to Hemmant Village. During the flood of 1893, much of Hemmant was submerged, including a popular tourist attraction known as The Aquarium. During the flood the men took refuge in the school while women and children were lodged in nearby buildings. An open-air annexe (Burmester, Pullar & Kennedy 1996 classification: C/T9), by with verandahs on two sides, was built by AG Temperley for in 1915. It was equipped with canvas blinds to offer some protection from the weather. This was built with its front verandah adjoining and connected to the rear verandah of the existing building. In 1922 sash windows were installed to replace the blinds and the building was enclosed. In 1931 Mr AC Weedon was contracted to improve the residence, construct a teachers' room and install new earth closets for . The Teachers' Room was built on the front of the verandah of the previously open- air annexe. In 1939 the school residence was sold and a tennis court built on the site. An additional which adjoined the original school site was added to the school in 1951 to make a total of . In 1955 the schoolrooms were remodelled and a new classroom was built at the rear of the previous annexe. In 1961 major remodelling and additions took place at a cost of . Major changes which took place in these 1955 and 1961 remodellings included enclosing the verandahs, removing the front verandah of the original school, and dividing its large classroom into two. In 1980 the preschool was opened and in 1988 the tennis courts were cleared. In 2001 a nearby house now known as Dumbarton was moved from 41 Hemmant-Tingalpa Rd, corner of Brand Street, onto the school site. Dumbarton was associated with the development of Hemmant as a farming community in the last quarter of the 19th century. Its original site was part of a 29-acre property alienated from the Crown by Friedrich Uhlmann and F Harz in 1859. In 1869 the land was subdivided and the Dumbarton site was transferred to Friedrich Uhlmann. In 1873 this land was further subdivided and one acre (including the Dumbarton site) was transferred to the Doughboy Sugar Company. In 1880 a mortgage was taken out against the property, possibly for improvements, which may have included construction of the house. In 1885 title to this property was transferred to Angus Gibson, then to Christof Uhlmann in 1888, thus returning to the Uhlmann family. The Gibson and Uhlmann families were connected by marriage, William Gibson's daughter Margaret having married Frederick Uhlmann's son Christopher Frederick in 1876. Local sources, and descendants of the Gibson family claim that the house was built by Friedrich Uhlmann for the Gibson family, possibly as early as 1864. The first definite evidence of the house is in 1887, when it is marked on a Railways survey of the proposed route of the Cleveland railway line. In 1911 the house and land were bought by Henry Skiller who lived there until his death in 1955 when it was transferred to Alan Skinner, subdivided and sold to William and Elizabeth Ashcroft. The house fell into disrepair but was renovated in the 1990s. In 2000 the Main Roads Department acquired the land to build a new road to the Port of Brisbane. Following representation from local residents, members of the Gibson and Uhlmann families and local historical organisations, the house was moved to the Hemmant State School site in April 2001. The name \\"Dumbarton\\" has been applied to the house only recently. Previously it was known as the Gibson House or the Ashcroft House. \\"Dumbarton\\" was named after the original home in Scotland of the Ashcroft family. Hemmant State School closed on 31 December 2010. In 2012, the site reopened as the Hemmant Flexible Learning Centre, a new school targeted at students disengaged from mainstream education.  Description  Hemmant State School is situated on a four-hectare site facing Hemmant-Tingalpa Road. The school uses only the northern third of the block. The remainder is separated by a fence and provides grazing for horses. The occupied portion is roughly equivalent to the original two acre site. The site slopes west/east and is partially levelled with a retaining wall above the playground. All principal area of heritage significance on this site is to the west, i.e. above, this retaining wall. This area includes the 1876 school, the 1915 open-air annexe and its extension, the 1931 teachers' room, the 1884 playshed, and Dumbarton House. These buildings and structures are arranged around a bitumened play area. To the west of the playshed is the toilet block, which is relatively recent and not of significance. To the east of the retaining wall and not included in the heritage register listing are the preschool, playground and shade cover, tennis courts and shelter sheds, a shade house, and three sheds. The 1876 school is the building closest to Hemmant-Tingalpa Road. It is an asymmetrical, low-set, rectangular, timber framed structure, , which has been divided into two classrooms. An enclosed verandah extends along the western side and into a walkway to the other school buildings. The walls are weatherboard except on the eastern wall where it is weatherboard on the southern section with more recent aluminium siding for the remainder. The stumps are concrete and the floor timber, although internally it is covered with carpet and linoleum. The roof is corrugated iron, slightly hipped and broader on the eastern side to cover the enclosed verandah section. The roof is straight on the western side but protrudes beyond the line of the building to shade the windows. There are two whirlybirds on the verandah portion of the roof. Each classroom has four banks of three hopper windows on the western side. On the southern wall there is a row of four casement windows topped by hoppers and protected by an awning in the classroom, and a hopper window on the enclosed verandah section. There is also a ventilation window into the ceiling space in the southern wall. On the eastern wall there are aluminium framed sliding windows above the aluminium cladding sections of the wall. Access to the building is via a parallel staircase, railed and posted, on the eastern wall, which leads to a landing which goes to an ante-room on the enclosed verandah. Internally the walls are primarily tongue and groove, vertically jointed boards, with fibrous cement ceilings, flat in the classroom and sloped in the verandah. The classrooms are divided by a wall with a sloping blackboard and white board on either side of French doors. Cupboards run under the black/white boards. The northern end of the enclosed verandah has a stove and sink fitted on the eastern wall. The northern end of the verandah leads to an enclosed walkway through to the other school buildings. The 1915 open-air annexe and its extension are to the north of the 1876 school building. It has been modified and extended. It is a highset timber building, approximately , with concrete stumps, partially enclosed under. The roof is corrugated iron and has two ventilators on the southern portion. To the north and west it is hipped to accommodate now enclosed verandahs. The external walls are clad with chamferboards except on the walkway from the other buildings, which is weatherboard, and the enclosed northern verandah section, which is clad with aluminium siding. Above the aluminium are aluminium framed sliding windows. Access to the building is via the walkway from the 1876 school building, perpendicular stairs from the west, and stairs on the northern side. Internally the building is divided into nine sections. On the western section there is an enclosed verandah which has been converted into a computer room. This room is lined with fibrous cement sheeting and has a timber, tongue and groove ceiling. There is access to the walkway from the 1876 school building and from the teachers' room. Double timber doors lead onto the front steps and there is a double hopper window adjoining. An arch leads into a small room, which, with its neighbour, has been divided from the original open-air annexe classroom. Each has a false ceiling. The southern one has a pair of double casement windows, each topped by a hopper. A door leads into the original annexe schoolroom. This is a large (7200 by 7700) room with tongue and groove timber walls and a pressed metal ceiling, flat in the middle and sloped towards the sides and ends. The western end of the ceiling is obscured by the false ceilings in the adjoining subdivided rooms. There are metal stringers between the walls. Three sets of the windows consisting of a double casement topped by a hopper are on the southern wall. A large archway leads onto the enclosed northern verandah. East of this is another large classroom, 6210 by 7700, with board lining. Five triple hopper windows cover the whole of the upper part of the southern wall and the northern wall is occupied by a door and louvres onto the enclosed verandah. The verandah runs most of the length of the building with tongue and groove vertically-jointed walls onto the classrooms and a tongue and groove sloping ceiling. It is wide along the original annexe room and then splits to while the remainder is occupied by a stairway. At the eastern end of the building are three small offices. Two continue the line of the original walls and are fitted with casement windows topped by hoppers. The third continues the verandah and has aluminium framed sliding windows. The sub-floor is partially enclosed and the remainder is concreted or bitumened and fitted with fixed timber seats between the stumps. The land slopes and the area is divided by a small retaining wall with steps across it. The western end is enclosed with corrugated iron into a storage room and the eastern end is enclosed with chamferboards to form a tuckshop and small additional room. The tuckshop has three sets of double casement windows on the eastern end. There are tin and chamferboard walls along some sections of the southern wall and a drinking trough and bubblers along one. The other teaching building is the 1931 teachers' room, which is to the north of the 1876 school building and to the west of the 1915 open-air annexe. It adjoins the latter and is connected to it by a doorway onto the western verandah. It is a small, lowset weatherboard building with casement windows with awnings on all three exposed sides. Internally walls and ceiling are lined with tongue and groove vertically jointed timber boards. The 1884 playshed is on the eastern side of the bitumened area. It is an open timber framed structure, . The roof is corrugated iron supported by timber posts with angled bracing. It is partially enclosed on the eastern side with corrugated iron which has a blackboard along it. The floor is bitumen and there are fixed timber seats between the posts. Large hooks are screwed into the beams at two places. Dumbarton Dumbarton is situated on the southern side of the school complex. It is a high-set, single-storey dwelling with exposed cross brace stud framing. It has a transverse gabled roof with colorbond sheeting, a roof light over the stairwell, finials on the gables and a weathercock on the chimney of the double fireplace. The verandah roof is curved and separate from the house. The verandah surrounds the basically square core of the house and in the southeastern portions it is enclosed with chamferboards and fibrous cement sheeting. The open portions have timber handrails and dowelled balustrading. The posts are moulded and have decorative brackets. Access to the verandah is by steps or a ramp, both recent, on the western side of the house. Another set of steps leads from the south (rear) of the house. All windows and doors onto the verandah are covered with security mesh. Internally the house has a central hall, with rooms leading off on either side. At the front are two rooms now converted to offices. Each room has vertically jointed walls and tongue and groove ceilings, French doors leading onto the front (northern) side and a double hung window on the other external side. The room on the east has access to a small modern en-suite bathroom. The room on the right has a fireplace with timber surrounds and shelf. The next door on the left is another modern bathroom with pine ceiling and a dividing wall with leadlight through to the en suite bathroom. The hall enters a larger back room on the right with vertically jointed walls and ceiling, the second half of the double fireplace, a double hung window onto the west and French doors onto the verandah at the south. The remaining quarter of the floor is occupied by a kitchen that opens into the enclosed sections of the verandah. All the fittings are modern, including the sloping clear sealed pine tongue and groove ceiling on the verandah portion and the three double hung windows in the new section. Early double hung windows and French doors open onto the verandah, presumably from the original room. Narrow stairs lead to the attic which consists of two rooms. These are carpeted and lined with vertically jointed timber boards except on two walls which have horizontal beaded boards. The ceilings are recent with clear finished tongue and groove boards. The eastern room has two double hung sash windows with timber framed hoods. The western room has the chimney through it and leads onto a balcony with timber railings and cross balustrading. There is a recent door into the roof space at the front of the building.  Heritage listing  Hemmant State School and Dumbarton was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 September 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Hemmant State School was established in 1864 and is one of the oldest still-operating State schools in Queensland. The earliest surviving building on the site dates to 1876. The school is important in illustrating the pattern of Queensland history. Established shortly after the subdivision of the Doughboy Creek area into farms, the school illustrates the expansion of agriculture (initially small cropping and dairying) on the outskirts of Brisbane during the late 1850s and 1860s, during the period when Brisbane was consolidating its position as the principal town and capital of Queensland. In the 1870s the school population expanded with the introduction of sugar cultivation into the Doughboy Creek area, and expanded again in the 1920s and 1930s when meatworks were established in adjoining suburbs, employing Hemmant residents. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Hemmant State School was established in 1864 and is one of the oldest still-operating State schools in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Hemmant State School group comprises school buildings from the 1870s, 1880s, 1910s and 1930s and are significant in representing changing trends in school architecture, which were themselves representative of developments in education policy and practices. The 1876 building is considerably modified but a rare survival. The 1884 playshed is intact, including hooks which may have been used for hanging gym equipment, and relatively rare. The 1915 open-air annexe is considerably modified but many of the modifications are cosmetic and reversible. Major changes, such as the addition of another classroom and the substitution of windows for canvas blinds, are themselves representative of changes in the school population and education policies and practices. Dumbarton, although considerably modified, provides evidence of single-skin and cross-bracing construction and is one of few remaining buildings in the Hemmant area which illustrates domestic architectural style and form of its era. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Hemmant State School has a particular significance for the people of the small rural community of Hemmant. The school developed as the district grew and was a meeting place and community centre for many years. Like Hemmant State School, it has strong community importance. When it was threatened with demolition in 2000, local action resulted in government intercession and the removal of the house to the local school site. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It is also associated with the locally prominent Gibson and Uhlmann families, who were among the first settlers in the Doughboy Creek (Hemmant) area. The Gibson family was also important in the development of the Queensland sugar industry, and Angus Gibson, who held title to Dumbarton from 1885 to 1888, was active in local government in the early 1880s and was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council 1899-1920.

It has an area of 51.04 acres and is located in Briar Creek Township. The lake is situated on East Branch Briar Creek. The lake was constructed in the early 1970s for the purpose of flood control. It is dammed by the Briar Creek Dam. Shale and limestone rocks are found in the lake's vicinity. The lake was electrofished by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission in 2010. The reservoir is designated as Approved Trout Waters and is stocked with trout. More than a dozen species of fish inhabit it and several bird species are found in its vicinity. The lake is part of the 173-acre Briar Creek Lake Park. Fishing and boating are done in the reservoir. Geography The Briar Creek Reservoir in late winter The Briar Creek Reservoir is located in East Branch Briar Creek. It is situated in the southeastern part of the creek's watershed. The lake's elevation is slightly under above sea level. The Briar Creek Reservoir is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Mifflinville. It is located to the west of Berwick, on the Berwick-Evansville Road in southwestern Briar Creek Township. The Briar Creek Reservoir is resembles a Hill-Land type lake. However, classification is difficult due to its small size and lack of features. The points on the lake's shoreline are \\"gradual and rounded\\". The lake has a distinct channel which meanders in a west-northwest to east-southeast direction. The Briar Creek Reservoir is at least deep in parts of its eastern half. Various other sites in the lake are at least deep. The Briar Creek Reservoir is dammed by a dam known as the Briar Creek Dam. As of 1979, the dam is in good condition, with an \\"adequate\\" spillway capacity. The dam is not affected by any significant problems. In 1967, the dam was planned to be made of earth, be high, and have a volume 155,000 cubic yards. The Briar Creek Reservoir is almost entirely surrounded by shale. However, a band of limestone occurs to the south of the lake. Much of the land in the lake's vicinity is non-agricultural grassland. History The area where the Briar Creek Reservoir is located contained forests and was located near the 19th-century Franklin Fester farmhouse. The area where the reservoir would be was drilled in 1966 to determine if the area was suitable for constructing an impoundment for water. The construction of the lake was initially planned to be done in 1967. However, it was constructed in the early 1970s. Its original purpose was as for flood control. The reservoir was designed by the Soil Conservation Service. Historically, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission owned the Briar Creek Reservoir. They leased it to Columbia County. The county was in charge of maintaining the lake. However, in more recent times, the lake is owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and maintained by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The Fowlersville Covered Bridge has been situated near the Briar Creek Reservoir since 1986. The Briar Creek Reservoir was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 30, 1990. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1195238. The lake was historically known as Evansville Lake. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission performed an electrofishing survey in the Briar Creek Reservoir in 2002. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission also surveyed the reservoir in 2010. Biology The Briar Creek Reservoir is stocked with trout by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Fish habitats such as turtle basking platforms and porcupine cribs have been placed in the lake. More than a dozen species of fish inhabit the Briar Creek Reservoir. The most common include yellow perch, brown bullhead, golden shiner, white crappie, hatchery trout, and bluegill. A 2010 survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission identified 645, 322, 319, 216, 153, and 121 individuals of each species, respectively. Less common fish species in the lake include white sucker, black crappie, largemouth bass, yellow bullhead, and pumpkinseed. The 2010 survey identified 86, 67, 45, 24, and 12 individuals of each species, respectively. Rarer species include common carp, smallmouth bass, hybrid sunfish, and channel catfish. The 2010 survey identified 2, 1, 1, and 1 of each species, respectively. The largemouth bass in the Briar Creek Reservoir range from in length, with the largest weighing . The lake's black crappies range from in length, with the largest weighing . The white crappies range from in length. The largest fish in the lake are the common carp, which range from in length. The smallest are the pumpkinseeds, which range from in length. Various waterfowl inhabit the Briar Creek Reservoir and the surrounding areas. Bald eagles, a threatened species, have also been observed at the lake. Sandhill cranes commonly visit it during migration. Recreation The Briar Creek Coldwater Conservation Plan describes the Briar Creek Reservoir as \\"a centerpiece of watershed activities\\". A recreational park known as the Briar Creek Lake Park contains the lake and some of the surrounding areas. The park has an area of 173 acres and is named after the lake. Fishing and boating are done in the Briar Creek Reservoir. However, only boats with electric motors or un-powered boats are permitted in the lake. Un-powered boats may be moored there. The lake has a boat ramp. The Briar Creek Reservoir is designated as Approved Trout Waters and trout fishing is permitted year-round. There are picnicking opportunities in the vicinity of the Briar Creek Reservoir. Weddings have been performed near the lake.

Given that her brother Thilawa was married to Saw Pale, a granddaughter of King Kyawswa of Pagan,Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 401 and that she herself was married to Swa Saw Ke, brother of Saw Pale, she was certainly of royal descent. She had at least one other brother, Maha Pyauk.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 434 Furthermore, she most probably married Swa some time between 1343 and 1351 during his stint as governor of Yamethin in the Pinya Kingdom before his defection to Sagaing 1351.Swa returned from Arakan 1343 and defected to Sagaing after the death of King Kyawswa I of Pinya in December 1350. In 1367, King Thado Minbya of Ava died, leaving no heirs. The court first offered the throne to Thilawa but her brother declined, instead recommending Swa for the job. Swa accepted the offer, and Khame Mi became the chief queen with the title of Queen of the Southern Palace.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 401 According to the standard chronicles Maha Yazawin and Hmannan Yazawin, she finally bore Swa a child, who later became King Tarabya.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 435 However, the Yazawin Thit chronicle, citing a contemporary inscription, says Shin Saw Gyi was the mother of Tarabya but the compilers of Hmannan rejected it nonetheless. (Since Tarabya was born in December 1368, she would have been in her 30s, probably mid-to-late 30s.)

His studio was destroyed by a bomb in 1944, and photographs of artists Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele are some of the few surviving examples of his work. Trƒçka was born in Vienna to Czech parents who came from Moravia hence throughout his life he was connected with both Germanic and Czech cultures, and lived and worked in Prague and Vienna. In 1911 he entered the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. During that time he experimented with new photographic techniques, and some of his pictures were produced both in silver bromide and bromoil prints, as mirror images. He also often modified the background of a negative with a brush to create a more artistic expression. In the early 1910s Trƒçka reproduced some paintings of Egon Schiele. Trƒçka photographed Schiele in early 1914. Between 1916 and 1918 he served with the Austrian Army, and then worked as a military photographer. He resumed his studio work in 1924.

Of Hawaiian ancestry, Brown's impact was felt through his role in the Hawaii State Senate, his influence on health delivery especially to the native Hawaiian population, and his engagement with Hawaiian cultural values. Hawaiian Lineage Brown was the descendant of an influential Hawaiian family, son of George  ªƒ™ ªƒ´ Brown, nephew of Francis Hyde  ªƒ™ ªƒ´ Brown, and great-grandson of John Papa  ªƒ™ ªƒ´, a major political figure in nineteenth-century Hawaii and a key historical resource for the study of Hawaiian history through his autobiographical narrative, Fragments of Hawaiian History (1866-1870). Political career Brown was an unsuccessful candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii in 1966, and served in the Hawaii State Senate from 1968 to 1974. Politically, Brown was influential on environmental and land development issues, and on the role of tourism in relationship to local social and cultural contexts. Brown managed the passage of long-term environmental protection policies, and advocated for opportunities through which the hotel industry might support the preservation of Hawaiian culture and historic sites. Brown‚Äôs position on tourism in Hawaii, made public at the 1984 Governor‚Äôs Tourism Conference, represents a key statement for the role of tourism in the state. The Queen's Health Systems Brown‚Äôs other major role in Hawaii was as chair of the Board of Trustees of the Queen‚Äôs Health Systems. During the period of his tenure in the 1980s and 1990s Brown emphasized preventive medicine as well as cultural and social initiatives, especially those serving the native Hawaiian community. The latter included support for the Polynesian Voyaging Society‚Äôs programs to improve the well-being of native youth through re-connections to traditional ways and values. Brown has been honored by the Polynesian Voyaging Society through the inscription of his name on a plaque across the pale kai of the H≈çk≈´le‚Äôa canoe, and by the naming of a star--Kamu'ookalani--designated as a marker to help guide wayfinders home. Cultural Influence Brown influenced the Hawaiian Renaissance through his connections with major figures and leaders of that movement, including George Kanahele, author of Ku Kanaka, Stand Tall: A Search for Hawaiian Values (1986), the Hawaii Maritime Center, and Project WAIAHA. He has been remembered as a unique thinker, in his merging of native and contemporary values. His remarks on the \\"malama ethic\\" as a State Senator reflect a core statement of these values. Directorships, honors, and awards Brown‚Äôs significant roles and honors include: service on the boards of directors of Amfac, the Hawai‚Äôi Nature Center, Oceanic Cablevision, Emerald Hotels Corporation, Tongg Publishing Company, Pan Pacific Development Company, Hawaiian Airlines, the Historic Hawai‚Äôi Foundation, and the John A. Burns Foundation; chairmanship or presidency of the Mauna Lani Resort, the Hawai‚Äôi Community Development Authority, the Nature Conservancy, the Board of Governors of the East-West Center, the Hawaii Maritime Center, and the Bishop Museum Board of Directors; election to the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun, the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects, the honorary Doctor of Humanities of the University of Hawai‚Äôi, and the Red Cross Humanitarian of the Year; recipient of the honors of Living Treasures of Hawai'i by Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawai‚Äôi, the Charles Reed Bishop Medal of the Bishop Museum, the David Malo Award from the Rotary Club, and the Kama‚Äôaina of the Year by the Historic Hawai‚Äôi Foundation. His service included philanthropic and cultural contributions to Hawaiian and other communities, among them the founding of the Friends of the Future foundation, the co-founding of the Native Hawaiian Hospitality Association, and the establishment of the Kenneth F. Brown Asia Pacific Culture and Architectural Design Award.http://www.fofhawaii.org/about.html?doing_wp_cron=1439757395.8719611167907714843750 Hawaiian Ali'i Memorial Brown died on February 7, 2014. State flags flew at half staff, as a mark of respect by the Senate for Brown's memory, and Brown was recognized in a motion honoring his lifelong devotion to the people of Hawai'i by the Hawai'i State Senate on February 14, 2014. Brown's life was celebrated on March 20, 2014, at a gathering at the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii, the first such event in a century to honor a member of the Hawaiian ali'i--Ku i ka Mana.

It is the fourth of the Ramage novels, following on from Ramage and the Freebooters. Plot Ramage's ship, HMS Triton, is performing guard duty to a merchant convoy travelling from Britain to Jamaica. An otherwise routine assignment is complicated by his being under the orders of Rear Admiral Goddard, his family's sworn enemy. The convoy is menaced by French and Spanish attackers, and hit by a hurricane. Ramage pulls through, only to be court-martialed under Goddard's trumped-up charges. A side-plot occurs when Triton is wrecked on a remote island, Isla Culebra. Ramage discovers that the Spanish garrison is searching for lost pirate treasure, having failed to puzzle out a clue left by the pirate in the form of a short poem. Successfully taking the Spanish forces prisoner, Ramage turns his wits to solving the puzzle and eventually triumphs through a combination of clear thinking and good fortune, recovering a large quantity of gold and precious stones which he delivers to the British authorities on leaving the island. It is his short spell as the senior ranking officer of either side on the island that gives the book its title, though in fact Ramage never attempts to exercise any civil authority over the island.

From 1939 onwards, the club were known as Maryhill Harp. They won the Scottish Junior Cup once, in 1928. History The club were formed in 1923 and admitted to the Scottish Junior League (SJL), using Kelvinvale Park in Maryhill as their home ground. Their greatest season came in 1927‚Äì28 and coincided with the Intermediate dispute in the Junior game. With several more successful clubs such as Baillieston, Duntocher Hibs and Yoker Athletic defecting from the SJL to the Intermediates, plus no Intermediate representation in the Junior Cup, Hibernians won a league and cup double. Their 6‚Äì2 victory over Burnbank Athletic at Firhill remains the highest scoring Junior Cup final in the competition's history. Willie Gray, who scored four of the goals, was already Hibs first Scotland Junior internationalst, being capped against Ireland in March 1928. He and fellow scorer Joe Riley both joined Celtic the following season along with goalkeeper David Nicol. Hibs added a second SJL championship title in 1932‚Äì33 but the dispersed nature of the league, with clubs from towns such as Dunoon and Rothesay, and the ebbing away of local opposition to other leagues, was becoming financially untenable. After a few struggling years, the club submitted their resignation to the league in May 1939 and declared their intention to apply for membership of the Central League. The SJL however, refused to accept the resignation and the incumbent Hibs committee chose to close the club down in early June 1939. Immediately, a new club Maryhill Harp was founded by former Hibernians officials and by the end of June 1939, they had intimated their intention to apply for the Central League using Hibs' former Kelvinvale Park. At the Central League AGM however, the Harp application surprisingly failed at the first ballot and the club were obliged to re-apply to the SJL, who readmitted the club. Within months, the outbreak of World War II affected football activities dramatically. Wartime travel restrictions badly hampered the running of the SJL and by February 1940, the league announced it would close down. A small wartime league was constituted in March 1940 and this ran for a second year in 1940‚Äì41 before the SJL went into complete abeyance for the rest of the war. The club were finally admitted to the Central League in 1941‚Äì42. Their first season was a relatively successful one, winning their league section only to lose to Clydebank in the championship play-off. Latterly, Harp enjoyed moderate success, although they reached the final of the West of Scotland Cup in 1954‚Äì55, losing in a replay to Douglas Water Thistle. The end for the club was signalled in January 1967 when Glasgow Corporation compulsory purchased Kelvinvale Park for new housing. Harp played their final match on 7 June 1967 against Greenock Juniors losing 1‚Äì0. Although the area of the ground has been completely redeveloped, Kelvinvale was located around present day Kilmun Street / Ledgowan Place. Hibs/Harp was generally run on a low cost basis and supplied players for wealthier Junior clubs and Senior teams. The club had a fruitful relationship with Celtic who loaned out many youth prospects and picked up the occasional player themselves. As well as the three aforementioned players from Hibernians' Junior Cup winning side, Celtic also signed Charlie Napier and Peter Scarff the following year with the latter winning one cap for the full Scotland team. In the Harp era, players exchanged between the two clubs included Hugh Long, Willie Miller, Duncan MacKay, Bertie Auld, Frank Haffey and Jimmy Quinn with all but Quinn becoming full Scotland internationalists.

The islets and adjoining intertidal areas are notable as habitat for bird life. The islet pair has enjoyed protected area status since 1909 and since at least 1972, have been part of the Beatrice Islet Conservation Park. During either the 1960s or the 1970s, the islets were extensively damaged by an exercise to remove an infestation of South African boxthorn. Description Beatrice Islets are pair of islets located in Nepean Bay about east of Kingscote on Kangaroo Island in South Australia.DMH, 1985, Charts 11 & 12BIA, 2005, page 185 The Beatrice Islets along with Busby Islet are three high points on the southern edge of a spit that is exposed at low water. The spit which is named ‚ÄòThe Spit‚Äô extends from Cape Rouge about north of Kingscote in a south easterly direction across the opening of the Bay of Shoals for a distance of about . The islets which are separated by a distance of about , have a north-south alignment. The islets historically consisted of sand dunes that were permanently above high water. However, an exercise to remove South African boxthorn, an introduced species considered to an infestation risk, which occurred either during the 1960s or the 1970s and which resulted in the islets becoming ‚Äòsusceptible to erosion, and tides and rough weather‚Äô thereby reducing the ‚Äòonce stable vegetated islets to bare, wave-washed sand spits‚Äô. Subsequent attempts to stabilise the islets and encourage the deposition of sand were unsuccessful.NPWS, 1987, page 25Robinson et al, 1996, page 301 As of 1987, the islets were reported as existing ‚Äòonly as a mudflat/cocklebed which emerges above the sea at low tide.‚Äô Formation, geology and oceanography The conditions for the creation of The Spit and therefore Beatrice Islets and Busby Islet became possible about 7500 years ago when sea levels reached current levels.Robinson & Armstrong, 1999, page 26 The islets are composed of sand and sandgrit. The islets is part of a drying spit at low water which falls to a depth of within about to the west. Flora and fauna Flora As of 1987 and again in 1996, the Beatrice Islets were reported as having no vegetation as a result of an exercise to remove the infestation of South African boxthorn.NPWS, 1987, page 25 Fauna While sources dated 1987 and 1996 do not explicitly list fauna for Beatrice Islets, it is likely that fauna species which are exclusively birds reported as being present on The Spit and Busby Island such as the following will be observed on the Beatrice Islets: white-bellied sea-eagle, eastern curlew, fairy tern little egret, pied cormorant, little pied cormorant, black-faced cormorant, Australian pelican, Australian white ibis, grey plover, greater sand plover, whimbrel, grey-tailed tattler, bar-tailed godwit, red knot, red-necked stint, red-capped plover, sooty oystercatcher, pied oystercatcher, curlew sandpiper, sharp-tailed sandpiper and ruddy turnstone.

Its current members include Bobby Shmurda, Rowdy Rebel and Corey Finesse. Background Rowdy Rebel grew up in a neighbourhood known as \\"the 90s\\" in Brooklyn's East Flatbush area. People in his neighborhood referred to him as \\"rowdy\\" as a child, which is the genesis for his stage name. Many members of GS9 (including Shmurda) originated in the same East Flatbush locale. He is of Jamaican and Bajan descent. Much of Rowdy Rebel's music contains references to the block where he grew up. Rowdy has noted that he and other GS9 members talk about friends from the neighborhood \\"to keep their names alive.\\" Despite the fact that only he and Bobby Shmurda have been signed to Epic Records, one of their primary goals is to help other GS9 members such as Abillyon and Corey Finesse get record contracts too. Bobby Shmurda had run-ins with the law while living in Brooklyn, including fifteen months spent in detention for probation violation and being arrested on gun charges that were later dropped. According to his 2014 indictment, Shmurda was the ringleader of a criminal enterprise called \\"GS9\\" that regularly entered into disputes with criminal gangs, was responsible for murders and non-fatal shootings, and engaged in drug trafficking along Kings Highway to East Flatbush. All members appeared in Shmurda's video for \\"Hot Nigga\\" On June 3, 2014, Shmurda was arrested and charged with felony criminal possession of a weapon. Police claim they saw him flashing the gun in an apartment and when they went to investigate, he tried to hide it in a couch. He was set free on $10,000 bail. On December 17, 2014, police arrested Shmurda and 14 others, including his brother Javese and his fellow GS9 label-mate Rowdy Rebel. Police charged Shmurda with conspiracy to commit murder, reckless endangerment, and drug and gun possession; charges against the others included murder, attempted murder, assault, and drug dealing. Shmurda pleaded not guilty and was held on $2 million bail. Record label GS9 also release music under GS9 Records.

Even during his collegiate years, he was politically active and defected against authority to assist revolutionary students prior to the first Indian National Congress (INC) movement in 1921. He took part in a number of mutinous activities and was imprisoned in all major INC insurrections.\\"Aligarh Kesari Thakur Malkhan Singh.\\" Dainik Janta Yug 24 Jan. 1976: 2. Print. Career Malkhan Singh's devotion to community service and the freedom struggle earned him the reverence of other revolutionaries, establishing his reputation as a very prominent Congressman and mobilizing a significant youth support base. After the Indian Independence in 1947, he was elected President of the Aligarh District Congress Committee (DCC). He had been a member of the Congress Socialist Party and became the most eminent of thirteen state legislators who resigned from their positions in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly in 1948 to contest against the INC. After losing the bye- elections in 1948 and the General Elections of 1952 as a Socialist candidate, he re-entered the legislature in 1955 as a PSP candidate, defeating the Congress opponent from Aligarh. On 16 February 1955, Malkhan Singh declared in Lucknow that he had rejoined the INC after the party agreed to pursue a socialistic pattern of society. He was elected President of the Aligarh DCC unanimously. Later, in 1957 he went on to be a minister sharing titles for sports and industries. Legacy Outside politics Thakur Malkhan Singh‚Äôs activities were related primarily to benefiting education. He taught in, managed and was the founder of various high schools and colleges. The Malkhan Singh District Hospital, a facility in Aligarh and Malkhan Nagar, a government colony were named after him. For all of his contribution to the freedom struggle, he was bestowed the title of Aligarh Kesari, or lion of Aligarh. Personal life Malkhan Singh married Sidhyawati Devi, who hailed from an aristocratic zamindar family. They were survived by three daughters: Sarla Chauhan, Sushila Singh Chauhan, Dr. Urmila Kushwaha (a reputed doctor of medicine in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh) and two sons: Virendra Singh and Nripendra Singh .

It is named for Chinese actor Jackie Chan who, with other Hong Kong actors, helped fund the building of the community and purchase of the hill. Jackie Chan also campaigned with the Hong Kong Red Cross to raise additional relief funds that went to reconstruction of the site. Officially, the government does not allow villages to be named after individuals, hence the official name not bearing \\"Jackie Chan\\". The neighbourhood is built up on a hill, high enough to avoid being inundated by a tsunami, thus being safe from tsunamis. The village is a green field construction, where only treed hills and farmers' fields once stood. It is located 25 minutes, some 17 km, outside of central Banda Aceh. The village is 1.5 km inland and elevated 300m. The village has a clinic and kindergarten and a covered village square for a market. However the market has not worked out. There are 606 mostly single family homes in the village. The village was built by a Chinese contractor. The quality of the build is reasonable, unlike some other similar reconstruction efforts in Aceh. There is no local high school, and the public transport system is insufficient to needs, as most jobs are located far from the village. The village opened in 2007 with 2400 residents from a variety of villages and a variety of ethnic groups. They have lived harmoniously and built a community together. As of 2014, the community's kindergarten is currently unused. Some 1200 people remain, others having moved away to be closer to work or services.

Her research focuses on Japanese-Korean relations. Her 2013 book Comfort Women of the Empire criticized the Korean interpretation of comfort women as exclusively \\"sex slaves\\". A Japanese language version of the book was published in Japan in November 2014. Nine former comfort women in Nanume-Jip (ÎÇòÎàîÏùò Ïßë), seeking to ban sales of the book, filed suit in both civil and criminal court, claiming that the scholar had defamed them. In November 2015, a group of 54 scholars from Japan and the United States issued a statement criticizing South Korean prosecutors for ‚Äúsuppressing the freedom of scholarship and press.‚Äù On January 25, 2017, the 11th criminal division of Seoul Dongbu District Court acquitted professor Park on the charges of defaming the comfort women survivors with her book.  Academic career  Park graduated from Keio University in 1981. She earned an M.A. from Waseda University in 1989 and a Ph.D. in 1993. Comfort Women of the Empire In her most controversial book Comfort Women of the Empire, Park challenges an established description of imperial Japan's military brothel system. Based on historical documents and the testimony of comfort women, including several cases of comfort women who fell in love with Japanese soldiers, a soldier who took care of a sick woman, or soldiers who helped comfort women to return their home country, Park asserts the existence of hidden comfort women who have been excluded from the mainstream narrative of comfort women, mainly consisting of \\"Japanese military coerced Korean women\\" and \\"sex-slaves\\". She describes a more complex relationship between the comfort women and soldiers. She says this kind of \\"comrade-like relationship\\" tragedy, which is basically a co-operative relationship of mobilized weak people by the name of patriotism, was a result of Japan's colonization of Joseon (Korea). Since Japan and Korea were superficially not distinguished as separate countries during the period of Japan's Korean annexation, the act of forcibly arresting Korean women could not have officially taken place, rather the dealers sold women to the \\"comfort station\\" by deception. She also says condemning Japan with requests that it take legal responsibility is not effective, considering the colonial status of Korea and the existence of the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea, and criticizes the way of Jong-Dae-Hyup (Ï†ïÎåÄÌòë, the main comfort women supporting NGO in South Korea)'s movement which has insisted on the \\"legal\\" responsibility of Japan. Since Jong-Dae-Hyup's movement has only been focused on the legal responsibility of Japan, even including some forged facts, it has increased hostility between Japan and Korea, and also caused some people in Japan to turn away. Furthermore, excluding other comfort women's stories which do not fit into the pre-existing image of \\"pure innocent teen girls who were arrested by Japanese soldiers and coerced to be sex-slaves\\" is actually suppressing the real victims and makes the victim groups separated. Therefore, considering the historical situation, the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea in 1965, and the apology and compensation of Japan in the 1990s, Park gives her opinion that requesting responsibility for Japan's colonial domination is required, rather than trying to urge Japan to accept legal liability for the War. While she does state that Korea must face the truth correctly in order to hold Japan properly responsible for its offences, she also criticizes Japan at the same time, for the rightwing extremists in Japan excuse their responsibility by the treaty between Japan and Korea in 1965 and the compensation in 1990. While Park acknowledges the treaty in 1965, she avers that Japan took legal responsibilities only for the individuals as per the necessary process after the War, and also, she censures the compensation of 1990 for failing to be disseminated throughout Korea due to the Japanese government‚Äôs ambiguous attitude. As a result, Park seeks Japan, before other dominant empires of the past, to profoundly apologize for their actions of colonial domination and the case for the Korean comfort women, for this would be significantly meaningful internationally, and also for the Asian integration or co-operation in the near future. Park‚Äôs book Comfort women of the Empire contains a significantly different narrative about comfort women compared to the previously accepted narratives, as it describes in depth of the imperialistic exploits by Japan, patriarchal system in Korea and also capitalistic exploits of the \\"dealers\\". This explanation brought fierce anger from the comfort women supporters, since her explanation were analyzed as \\"virtually an exoneration to Japan\\" from the critics. She was sued by nine comfort women who had filed from Nanume-Jip (ÎÇòÎàîÏùò Ïßë) and paid 10 million won, or $8,262, to each of nine women. She was also accused by Korean prosecutor. This trial is on progress. On 25 November 2015, against the indictment of Park, 54 Japanese scholars and intellectuals including Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe (Â§ßÊ±ü ÂÅ•‰∏âÈÉé, Nobel Laureate) Tomiichi Murayama (ÊùëÂ±± ÂØåÂ∏Ç, former Prime minister of Japan), Y≈çhei K≈çno (Ê≤≥Èáé Ê¥ãÂπ≥, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan) and Chizuko Ueno (‰∏äÈáé ÂçÉÈ∂¥Â≠ê, professor, Tokyo University) addressed statements supporting Park Yu-ha, and asking for the Korean government's withdrawal of the accusation. 190 Korean intellectuals also followed the statements. On January 17 2017, Professor Noam Chomsky at MIT and Professor Bruce Cumings at University of Chicago joined in the previous statements addressed by Japanese scholars previously, with requesting immediate withdrawal of presecusion or sentence 'Not guilty', with supporting Park Yu-ha. On 1 February 2016, Park made the book available online hoping to help solve the comfort women issue. Works  **An English summary by author.

Location  Kirchgemeindehaus Wipkingen Located in the formerly independent municipality Wipkingen, the church hall (German: Kirchgemeindehaus) ‚ÄûHaus f√ºr das Volk‚Äú, meaning home for the people, was inaugurated in 1932, being the parish house of the Reformed church congregation, that is independent since 1865.  History and background  About 60 religious associations have been established by or for immigrants in Z√ºrich in the past 20 years. In order to offer appropriate cult rooms, in 2008 the Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Z√ºrich respectively of the city of Z√ºrich established the centre in Wipkingen. The theologian and pastor Dinah Hess is as of December 2014 its director, she tries also to find rooms for further parishes, and she is responsible for the rental of rooms and the communal life in the center. Pastor Hess also obliges the communication to the migration churches, and to aware that the Reformed Church sometimes may have a different understanding of mission between the registered partnership, and therefore not to deny, but to carefully address debates on such topics. On monthly meetings, all the church communities discuss organizational items, but also may discuss religious issues. Currently there are eight churches from four continents, all of the Protestantism faith, situated in the centre. In addition to the Francophone community from the Republic of the Congo, there are also an Anglophone community of citizens from Nigeria, two Latin American churches for Spanish and Portuguese speaking people, a Tamil community, a Korean church, a Finnish church and a Swiss free church situated in the centre. As at many places in Switzerland, 'loud' worship often is not tolerated, and many communities have difficulty to find locations; therefore the centre promotes these charismatic churches, having in Switzerland usually called 'long', 'loud' and 'exotic' worship.  Parishes in the centre  The Hansomang community comprises about 70 people from South Korea. Accompanied by piano, its white-robed choir sings during Sunday each louder than usual in Switzerland, otherwise the service is traditionally reformed, well-tempered and calmly. Hansomang was founded in 2002, supported by the Presbyterian Church of Korea and the Presbyterian Church in Korea, and maintains a partnership with the Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches. The Korean community in Bern is connected to Hansomang as a sister church. Eglise Evang√©lique missionaries International EEM is a free church from the Republic of the Congo, founded in 1992, and practicing a rollicking, rhythmic, unleashed Sunday service. Jeanette acts in worship as a presenter, accompanied by a six-member all-female band. The Francophone community is Protestant, but influenced by Evangelicals in the USA and by the Pentecostal free churches of South Africa. The church is decidedly missionary-oriented and distributes leaflets on the streets. It practices the \\"reverse mission\\" of migrant churches; the people that were converted to Christianity by European missionaries, bring the Gospel back to Europe. The Oikos Church has its origins in Sri Lanka and was founded in 2004. The Protestant community supports people in Sri Lanka and India, which have suffered losses during the war and need help to survive. On Sunday morning about one hundred believers gather for two and a half hours of service. Children running around, the atmosphere is lively, the air stuffy, a youth worker participates also, and all is accompanied by keyboards and electric piano, praise, and believers witness their experience usually in the Tamil language. During the prayer all speak to himself. Most of the community members refuged to Switzerland in 1989, and about 30% of them gained the Swiss citizenship. Igreja de L√≠ngua Portuguesa de Evang√©lica Zurique IELPZ was also founded in 1992 in Z√ºrich. The members come from Latin America, Africa and Europe. The services are held in Portuguese and translated into German. Suomalainen Seurakunta (Finnish parish) was founded in 2002, and compatriots in Z√ºrich a piece of the Finnish church community.

It was founded in 2002, by 2010 it was called Word base Ministries Association. Iglesia Vida Eterna offers Sunday worship services in Spanish and then the joint meetings with food from Latin America.

It is owned by Grupo Radio Centro, and currently mostly simulcasts the programming of sister station XEN-AM, the primarily Spanish oldies format \\"Radio Centro y El Fon√≥grafo\\". History XEFO-AM signed on January 1, 1931, as the radio station of the National Revolutionary Party (later the PRI). In 1941, the PRN sold the station to Francisco Aguirre Jim√©nez. From 1030 AM he would build a broadcasting empire initially known as \\"Cadena Radio Continental\\", starting with XERC-AM in 1946 and growing into today's Grupo Radio Centro. That same year, the station took on the name \\"Radio Centro\\", branding as \\"the station of the Mexican family\\" and positioned itself as a general station similar to XEW-AM; while airing musical programming for most of its existence, in the 1980s, information and entertainment programs were added, and by 1998 non-talk programming had disappeared. Newscasts and sport programs were also present, but were later moved to Radio Red AM and Radio Red FM. Lately, the station aired programs focused on self-help and motivation, hosted by professionals in the topic, and it also aired the live Sunday noon mass from the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral (this broadcast was moved to XEN-AM and was also relocated to the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe after the cathedral was damaged by the 2017 Puebla earthquake). In 2017, citing \\"changes in AM transmission infrastructure\\", Grupo Radio Centro reorganized all of its AM radio stations, shutting down several and consolidating their programs. Radio Centro's talk programming, of which only two programs (\\"Club Nocturno\\" and \\"Buenos D√≠as\\", the former of which has since been cancelled) survived the transition, now shares XEN-AM 690 with El Fon√≥grafo. XEQR then went silent. Beginning on October 2, 2017, the full slate of talk programming returned as an online and HD Radio-only stream, which only lasted less than two months after a fire affected GRC's headquarters. It wouldn't be until March 2019 when the station's stream returned, although not with all the programming it had prior to 2017. In August, the format absorbed the programming of sister station XERED-AM (which had also become an online-only stream) uniting it under the \\"Radio Centro 1030\\" name. On April 11, 2020 it returned to the air, however, the next day, it switched from the talk format to a simulcast of XERC-FM, and on May 15, concurrent with the announcement that XERC-FM was being sold to MVS Radio, the Internet stream was shut down with all their collaborators dismissed. On May 18, XEQR switched again to a simulcast of XEN-AM. Beginning in July 2020, the station breaks away from XEN to air sports programming at certain times and days, but otherwise remains a simulcast.

Associated features include dwarfism and mild intellectual disability as well as a process known as tibialization of the fibulae, which involves thickening and enlargement of these bones to an extent resembling the tibiae. The combination of the presence of tibialization of the fibulae, which is highly specific for the disorder, and the absence of laboratory abnormalities, ruling out alternative diagnoses including rickets, essentially confirms the diagnosis. Cause This condition is currently felt to be a genetic disorder, caused by inheritance of an abnormal gene via autosomal dominant inheritance. Diagnosis  Radiographic features  The most prominent and extensively documented findings of Weismann-Netter‚ÄìStuhl syndrome are on plain radiographs of the bones. Findings include bilateral and symmetric anterior bowing of both tibiae and fibulae, lateral bowing of the tibiae, femoral bowing, and squaring of iliac and pelvis bones. Management  History  The features of this disorder were first described by French doctors Robert Weismann-Netter (1894‚Äì1980) and L. Stuhl in their report first describing the association in seven patients in 1954. They believed these seven patients had mistakenly been diagnosed as congenital syphilis or rickets, which remain the primary considerations in the differential diagnosis of this syndrome today.

In 1922, Heidenreich moved to Berlin, where he supported himself as a scene painter in the UFA studios in Babelsberg.Carl Heidenreich (American, 1901‚Äì1965), Since the mid-1920s, Heidenreich exhibited actively, including exhibitions at Berlin Secession and Berlin Academy of Arts. His work was strongly rooted in German Expressionism, as evidenced by such paintings as Street Encounter (1932). Politics Heidenreich was a member of the Communist Party-OPPOSITION of Germany (KPD-O). After the Nazi rise to power in 1933, Heidenreich was deemed a degenerate artist and his upcoming solo exhibition in Berlin was abruptly cancelled.Biography for Carl Heidenreich He was imprisoned by the SS at Berlin's Moabit prison, used as the detention center by the Gestapo. After his release in 1934, Heidenreich escaped to Spain, leaving behind nearly 300 works, most of them destroyed and lost. Deported to France in 1935, he returned to Spain at the start of the Spanish Civil War. Heidenreich joined the Rovero Battalion POUM, the Anarcho- Syndicalist unit memorialized by George Orwell in his book, Homage to Catalonia., an anti-Stalinist Spanish Communist Party. In 1938, he was incarcerated by the Stalinist-controlled Catalonian government and tortured in Barcelona's Modelo prison. A number of paintings and works on paper, documenting this period of Heidenreich's life, survived in private collections. Among them are a series of prison sketches. In early 1939, as Franco's Falangist forces swept through Barcelona, ending the Spanish Civil War, Heidenreich fled back to Paris, where he stayed until the outbreak of World War II. Imprisoned in 1940 at the camp Cepoy/Loiret as an enemy alien, he made his way to Marseilles. In 1941, with the support of the American Guild for German Cultural Freedom, he received a visa from the US Consulate; in May of 1941 on the S.S. Capitain Paul Lemerle, reportedly the last ship allowed by the British to pass through the Straits of Gibraltar. After some weeks' internment on the Island of Martinique, he was able to book passage on the Duc d'Aumale, arriving in New York at the end of May. An important group of watercolors records his impressions of the peaceful Caribbean island.CARL HEIDENREICH , Gabriele Saure, Carl Heidenreich, Goethe-Institut, New York. Art Career in the US Heidenreich settled in New York, where he was welcomed by the community of German and German Jewish refugee intellectuals, including Hannah Arendt and her husband Heinrich Blucher. In 1949, Heidenreich became an American citizen and had a first major exhibition at Harry Salpeter Gallery. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Heidenreich exhibited regularly, his work was widely collected, and he made significant contributions to Abstract Expressionism, both as a painter and watercolorist. His works are included in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, and Brooklyn Museum. In 1965, Heidenreich returned to Germany for the first time in 30 years to attend his first postwarexhibitions in Frankfurt and Berlin. Already suffering from a serious illness, he died in Frankfurt on September 6, 1965. A significant number of art works left behind in Heidenreich's New York studio have been cared for by family friends and collectors, primarily Richard M. Buxbaum and Emanuel Wolf, who have maintained the artist's legacy through continued exhibitions and publications. In 2004, Heidenreich‚Äôs work was shown along with his teacher‚Äôs (Hans Hofmann) at a major exhibition at the Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive, which published a catalog with essays by Peter Selz, Alla Efimova, and Gabriele Saure. In 2006, the Goethe Institut in New York presented a retrospective of Heidenreich‚Äôs American work; in 2011 a major exhibit was mounted at the Pankow/Berlin Artists' Collective Gallery.

Founded in Beijing, China, Greenkeepers is devoted to inspiring environmental awareness through local impacts within communities across the globe, including but not limited to its offices in Beijing and Fremont. Greenkeepers aspires to fundamentally change the way people see environmental work, and is renowned within local communities for its approach of leading by example - not only transforming the environment or promoting environmental awareness, but also redesigning societies' consumptions of limited resources. In its lifetime, Greenkeepers has initiated various projects in local, regional, and global scales. Notable accomplishments and on-going projects include the Dragon Path River Cleanup, the Sichuan Book Drive, the Beijing Tree Planting Initiative, and the Food Waste Reduction Initiative. History Founding Greenkeepers was founded in August 2009 in Beijing, China by Kevin Xiao, Vivian Xiao, Olivia Tan, Jeffrey Yu, Philipa Yu, and Laura Du. The idea for Greenkeepers arose during a trash pick-up event organized by the Beijing Student Press Association, of which each founder was a part of. According to the Greenkeepers website, an elderly woman approached then 9th grade Jeffery Yu with an empty bottle, encouraging him to sell it and buy himself a snack on the way home. Though an initially humorous experience, the founding members realized the story was indicative of a larger underlying problem within the Beijing local community; namely that in China, no one recognized the merits of environmental conservation. As co-founder Philipa Yu recounts, ‚ÄúLocals picked up recyclable material for the sole purpose of later selling it and earning a little extra pocket money. Otherwise, trash was left unattended to.‚Äù Based on the need to shift society's views on the environment, Greenkeepers was born. Its goal since then has been to foster a sense of respect for the environment and to encourage the local community to be aware of the effects of their actions. 2009-2015: Development In its early stages, Greenkeepers meetings were largely informal - carried out on couches in libraries and in various people's houses. It remained as a 6-member group and did very little in terms of quantifiable actions; instead, time was spent clearing procedural hurdles involved in establishing an organization within the students' school. The largest problem Greenkeepers faced at this time was on deciding the exact nature of the group - what it would do and focus on. After much deliberation, the founders agreed that Greenkeepers would be heavily action oriented and thus, it became vital that the group remained small. Today, one of Greenkeepers' core values is that a small group of dedicated individuals is more beneficial than a large organization with only a few members who truly believe in the cause. 2014-2018: US Branch Greenkeepers USA branch was build with the idea to spread sustainable practices around the world. It began in 2014 and gained a following around the Bay Area, namely Fremont. Some of the big projects this branch completed were the Los Gatos Creek Cleanup, and e-waste and recycling drive, and workshops such as the #Sprout v2.0 that gave volunteers experience with farming and technology that affects the environment. Additionally, the team also participated in a FIERCE Green Summit, took a Water Treatment Research trip to Alameda County, and held an environmentally friendly online challenge called the Greenkeepers 14 Day Project. 2019-2020: USA Reboot Unfortunately, the Greenkeepers branch at USA was forgotten for a while until new core members decided to reboot the program in 2019. With a successful reboot, the Fremont branch is dedicated to raising awareness and making improvements in the environment of local communities. With members communicating between two high schools, the team worked on several service projects, a food waste reduction initiative, a composting system implementation, an online 21 day green challenge, and more. Beijing Projects Dragon Path River Cleanup Greenkeepers attempted to impact the greater Beijing community by cleaning up a section of the Long Dao River in a nearby community. Students from the International School of Beijing and Kong Gang Elementary school gathered together and cleaned up miscellaneous trash along the river bed. Sichuan Book Drive Over 7000 books were donated to the Huili County Experiment Middle School, Huili County Second Primary School, and Zhaojue County Middle School in the Sichuan province of China. Beijing Tree Planting The Beijing Tree Planting activity provided members of the local community an opportunity to give back to their environment. Greenkeepers launched this project to tackle the growing problems of Beijing's, and China in general's pollution. Its goal was to not only reduce pollution, but also to stop it at its source by encouraging people to adopt greener methods of living. Over 1000 trees have been planted in Beijing since. Tree Labeling During the time of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, students of the Greenkeepers attempted to educate members of the International School of Beijing community of the types of plantation on campus. Greenkeepers members printed labels, for each type of plantation on campus, on recycled paper with only black and white ink, and attached it to plants all over the school. Over 300 trees have been labelled. Awareness Activities Mug Sponsoring To curb the usage of paper cups or disposable plastic bottles, Greenkeepers promoted the use of reusable cups and mugs. Science Safari To promote environmental awareness and protection within children of younger ages, Greenkeepers launched its Science Safari to educate younger children of prominent environmental issues. Paper Towel Campaign Greenkeepers noticed that among the local community, there was little regard for paper usage, namely that of napkins and paper towels. In order to reduce the harm done to forests through the use of so many pieces of paper, signs were established, across the local community in Beijing. In places like coffee shops and restaurants, Paper Towel conservation posters attempt to raise awareness and educate the public about environmental friendliness. More than 100 labels have been set up. Annual Events Earth Day Overnight Campout During the annual Earth Day Overnight Campout event, members of the local community gather to reduce electricity usage by living on the International School of Beijing campus for one electricity-free night. Thus, members of local communities show their respect and acknowledgement of the cause to reduce electricity usage worldwide. Unplugged Concert The yearly Unplugged Concert, as with the Earth Day Overnight Campout, also draws attention to society's prevalent use of electricity in the 21st century. Performances are done without the use of electronic equipment, usually solely based upon a performer's voice or abilities with musical instruments. The concert not only raises money for the cause, but also allows community members to gather and appreciate the idea of energy conservation. Fremont Projects 21 Day Challenge In the Greenkeepers 21-Day Challenge, participants completed a task everyday that helped keep them busy during the coronavirus pandemic and more importantly, help the environment. For each day they took part in the challenge, they uploaded their proof under the hashtag #GK21Days and got an entry into a raffle to win a 20 dollar gift card or gift. Leaf Mulch Party Despite windy conditions, members worked with LEAF, a non- profit with the mission to grow sustainable pesticide-free food, to build a new farm right in the heart of Fremont. Members began the first step by preparing the ground with sheet mulch. This process helps the normally dry soil absorb water and increase its fertility, fostering the growth of healthy plants. Sabercat Creek Restoration Members from Greenkeepers worked with the City of Fremont on the restoration of the Sabercat Creek. They helped remove various invasive plants and poisonous hemlock. Food Waste Reduction Initiative Partnering with StopWaste, a public agency reducing waste in the Alameda county, members are raising awareness on America's overconsumption patterns, specifically in the field of food waste. Students are starting small in their local high schools to implement compost bins and boxes to reduce the amount of food ending up in landfills, and plan to revamp the school's food- share program to reduce food wastage. Recycle Crafts Workshop An afterschool arts and crafts workshop was hosted with Harvey Green Elementary. There, members informed elementary school students about the intricacy of recycling. All the material for the workshop was reused from cardboard, plastic caps, paper, etc; This event serves as a gateway to promote future generations to recycle, reuse, and reduce. Litter Pickup Greenkeepers partnered with the City of Fremont to host a litter pickup event for high school students to get involved in making Lake Elizabeth, Central Park, a more beautiful place. More than 40 students attended to pick up trash from the park and recreational area. Recycling Drive As Greenkeepers USA was starting to get established, members started out with a simple project in order to consolidate a following within the local area, as well as to educated nearby neighborhoods in the benefits of practicing recycling. #SproutGK SproutGK was a workshop/gardening event organized by Greenkeepers and conducted at LEAF Stone Garden. Participants attended workshops where they developed problem-solving skills and learned about sustainable solutions. Participants also grew produce that went to the Tri-City Food Bank. Structure of Organization Management Greenkeepers is an entirely student run service organization. Each local branch consists of a general leadership team, known as the \\"core team,\\" that facilitates group meetings. Each core member is in charge of a small focus group tasked with spearheading its own initiative such as fundraising or public relations. Although only one group is in charge of organizing and leading a specific endeavor, each member of a Greenkeepers branch contributes in the project's success. The executive team of Greenkeepers International is the core team centered in Beijing, while the non-profit organization in the U.S. is headquartered in Fremont. As of 2020-2021, the Fremont branch is managed by six individuals ‚Äì Jessica Lu, Hema Madichetty, Meher Mehta, Aneri Sheth, Anika Wadhera, and Patrick Wang. Members Members of Greenkeeepers enjoy a high degree of freedom. Although Greenkeepers has its set in stone annual events and projects, members have the options to join existing task groups or to start their own. They are fully able to pursue their own creative ideas and desires with the backing of Greenkeepers' local connections and access to resources. As of January 2015, Greenkeepers has had a total of over 300 members in its lifetime. As a student-run organization, members hail from various walks of the community. In its Beijing branch, Greenkeepers is almost entirely consisted of international high school students. Nevertheless, the organization enjoys a relatively small and limited local following. Although high school students primarily make up the organization, Greenkeepers has immense presence within younger age groups as well - in accordance with its goal of spreading environmental awareness. In Fremont there are 6 core members and 11 general members, all of which are high schoolers in the community. Everyone participates in a few projects that are aimed to help the local environment.

It owns 45 radio stations in Mexico and the United States, including 9 radio stations in Mexico City. History Radio Centro's origins date to 1946, when Francisco Aguirre Jim√©nez formed the Cadena Radio Continental to operate XEQR-AM 1030 and new station XERC-AM 790 in Mexico City. Organizaci√≥n Radio Centro was formed in 1952, and the current company was founded in 1971. In 1965, it founded OIR (Organizaci√≥n Impulsora de la Radio), which syndicates Radio Centro's formats to stations across Mexico. Its non-Mexico City business extended further in the 1980s, when Radio Centro began selling its formats outside the United States (in 1983) and created Cadena Radio Centro (in 1986) to manage this portion of its operations. Meanwhile, in Mexico City, it had expanded to five AM stations and three new FM outlets. Radio Centro was the second media company to place its FM towers on Cerro del Chiquihuite, to the north of the city, though they are now located elsewhere. In 1994, it sold Cadena Radio Centro, picked up (and promptly shed) an investment in Heftel Broadcasting (now known as Univision Radio), and bought 33% of Radiodifusi√≥n Red (which it would later own outright). The absorption of Radiodifusi√≥n Red, also known as Radio Programas de M√©xico, brought three additional Mexico City stations into Radio Centro's stable. It also built a new building on the west side of Mexico City, known as the Tr√©bol Radio Centro (or \\"Radio Centro Clover\\") in 1993. It also launched an initial public offering on the BMV (where Grupo Radio Centro stock continues to trade) and the NYSE (where it delisted in 2013). In May 2000, Televisa attempted to buy GRC and announced an agreement in principle for a merger, but the acquisition failed due to marketplace concerns. The Federal Competition Commission recommended that Televisa sell some stations, and ultimately four months after the announcement, talks ended. Other reasons for the acquisition's failure included dissent within the Aguirre family and a dispute over GRC's valuation. Another roadblock was that newscaster Jos√© Guti√©rrez Viv√≥, who hosted the Monitor newscasts on Radio Red, refused to work with Televisa. In 2012, GRC acquired 25% of KXOS FM in Los Angeles, three years after signing a local marketing agreement to take control of the station's programming. On March 11, 2015, Radio Centro won one of two concession packages to build and operate a national television network. However, Radio Centro ended up not paying the 3 billion pesos to secure the concession.BMV \\"Relevant Event\\" release, 10 April 2015 Seeking to limit costs after the television concession fiasco, in June 2015, shareholders approved a merger of Radio Centro with Controladora Radio M√©xico and GRM Radiodifusi√≥n, two components of Grupo Radio M√©xico. The merger added 30 radio stations to Grupo Radio Centro's portfolio and marks its first major expansion outside of Mexico City.Radio Centro description of the deal In November 2016, GRC took control of Univision Radio's El Paso cluster, consisting of KBNA-FM, KQBU and KAMA, by local marketing agreement, and filed with the FCC to buy 25% of the stations, with the remaining shares being held by a US citizen. On November 27, 2017, a fire affected the company's main offices, forcing it to briefly suspend the broadcasts of all its Mexico City stations and relocate to an alternate site.

The film marks the directorial debut of Nitin Dixit. The film stars Adinath Kothare, Mihiresh Joshi and Yash Kulkarni in lead roles and Leena Bhagwat, Rashmi Anpat, Sulabha Deshpande, Sunil Abhyankar in supporting roles. Ashish Vidyarthi appears in a special appearance. The film released on 26 December 2014 received positive reviews and won numerous awards from its inception. Plot Kaustubh (Mihiresh Joshi) is an innocent little boy. He loves to live in his imaginative world that is full of wonders and adventures. The tales that his grandma Aaji (Sulabha Deshpande) tells him are the base on which he has built a few fantasies. The Dashavtar tales from Indian mythology are his favourite. These tales are based on Lord Vishnu's ten avatars. Kaustubh has also learnt through these tales that Lord Vishnu's tenth avatar, the Kalki avatar, is going to be incarnated in Kaliyuga, the modern era. The innocent mind of Kaustubh, who is in his fourth standard, is captured by the idea that he himself is that Kalki avatar. His close friend Mangya (Yash Kulkarni), who is equally thrilled with this idea, confirms his belief. A few incidental coincidences validate Kaustubh's imagination. Once he is convinced, he shares this secret with Amod (Adinath Kothare), the young engineering student who is a tenant in Kaustubh's home. Amod, who is an atheist by nature, does not pay much attention. Convinced by the idea of being the Kalki avatar, Kaustubh becomes so confident that he tries the biggest adventure he has been possessed with since quite a long time. He gets injured and suffers from a fractured leg. This acts as a big blow to Kaustubh's fantasy and his emotionally driven imaginative world is shattered. He finds it difficult to come to terms with reality and withdraws into a shell. He starts avoiding his dear friend Mangya and even everybody at his home. Observing his strange behaviour, the Doctor advises Kaustubh's parents to consult a psychiatrist. However, they do not act upon the advice, in anticipation of the social stigma. Kaustubh's mother (Leena Bhagwat) realizes that Kaustubh, who feels so detached from everyone, is comfortable with Amod. So she requests Amod to help Kaustubh come out of this emotional turmoil. Amod accepts this challenge and in an attempt to get into the crux of the problem, gets friendly with Mangya. He then understands that the real cause is Kaustubh's fantasy- based passion of becoming an avatar. Amod shares with Kaustubh a different perspective about the very concept of the avatar and slowly helps him come out of the mental stress he is facing. Kaustubh with Amod's help overcomes the depression and regains his confidence.

Martin, an 18-year-old black male, was fatally shot by a white Berkeley police officer when Martin pulled a gun on him. The shooting sparked protests in the St. Louis area and other cities in the U.S. The shooting elicited comparison to the earlier shooting death of Michael Brown two miles away in Ferguson, Missouri. Incident Antonio Martin On the night of December 23, 2014, a Berkeley Police Department officer responded to an employee's emergency phone call report at 11:11 pm of shoplifting by two men at a Mobil On the Run convenience store along the 6800 block of North Hanley Road. An unidentified officer arrived at 11:15 p.m. in his police cruiser and saw two men just outside the store who matched the description of the suspects. The shooting happened in a parking lot outside a Mobil gas station. The police officer was not wearing a body camera and there were no shots fired by the teen's gun. As the officer fired, he fell to the ground while running away, which was caught on video by the store's security cameras. One of the shots fired by the officer struck Martin, another struck the tire of the officer's vehicle, and the third is unaccounted for.  Evidence  Police recovered a Hi-Point 9mm handgun from the scene, said to be Martin's, with five rounds in the magazine and one round in the chamber. Footage of the incident was captured by surveillance cameras outside the convenience store. According to police, several witness' accounts back up the officer's story that Martin was first to draw his weapon. The officer said he was not wearing the body camera he had been issued earlier that day. The police car's dash-camera was likely not recording at the time.  Investigation  The officer is identified as a 34-year-old white male, and a six-year veteran of the department. He had previously Served with the Country Club Hills, Missouri Police Department. He is represented by attorney Brian Millikan who also represents St. Louis police officer Jason Flanery in the October killing of VonDeritt Myers. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch assigned a prosecutor to the county's investigation. The City of Berkeley will conduct its own independent investigation.  Aftermath  Cathedral Basilica Despite complaints about the timeliness of medical attention to arrive, paramedics arrived six minutes after the shooting. Martin was declared dead, and his body covered, by 11:28 p.m. A crowd of onlookers and protesters gathered at the scene within 20 minutes of the shooting. The county crimes against persons unit arrived at 12:15 a.m. As the crowd grew angry, protesters clashed with law enforcement working to protect the scene for investigators collecting evidence. The crowd grew to an estimated 300 people as tensions escalated. Some threw rocks and other projectiles at them. Media crews and surveillance video recorded an individual lighting fires with lighter fluid inside and outside the same store when looters broke in. Police say 19-year-old Joshua Williams of St. Louis was the individual. Williams, a frequently quoted advocate for peace in the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting, was charged days later with arson in the first degree, a felony; felony burglary and misdemeanor stealing. On video Williams confessed to police of lighting the fires. Four others were arrested for assault-related offenses. Martin's body was removed from the crime scene at around 1:40 a.m. Several protesters lingered at the site throughout the night. Riot police outside the Cathedral Basilica Police were seeking the unidentified second suspect who fled the scene as a \\"person of interest\\". Two other bystanders at the scene were identified as witnesses. Martin's girlfriend was among those at the scene at the time of the shooting. The night after the incident, dozens of people, including Martin's mother and stepfather, gathered near the scene where Martin was killed to chant and protest. Some in the group broke away to block traffic on the nearby Interstate 170. Law enforcement attempted to subdue the protesters with pepper spray. At least two were arrested. Outside the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis about 75 vigilers held a moment of silence for Martin and others. St. Louis Police officers in riot gear stood ready in front of the cathedral.

In 2011, the band released their first album, titled It Never Goes Out, receiving some attention.

After releasing the album, vocalist Christian Holden stated in a blog post on the bands Tumblr that \\"Our new album deals with some real dark stuff. So to all my brooding and slightly damaged friends, have your a happy album or Rugrats in Paris nearby. It‚Äôs partly about my experience with friends and loved ones in the past three years which were very complicated, toxic, and abusive. But laid within is a lot about the deconstruction of self for personal growth and transformation. I hope it helps you live and stuff. Apparently we are emo now.\\" Home, Like Noplace Is There ranked at number 1 on the AbsolutePunk staff's top 30 albums of 2014, and number 6 on the users' top 50 albums of 2000-2015.

Leor Galil, writer for the Chicago Reader named it his favorite record of 2014.
